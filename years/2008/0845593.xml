<AbstractNarration>The theoretical computer science community has recently witnessed a significant expansion in research interest at the intersection of algorithms and game theory.  As part of this trend, there has also been a resurgence of interest in ordinal matching problems, where one seeks to pair up elements in two or more sets, with the quality of a solution characterized in game theoretic terms by ranked preference lists of the individual elements participating in a matching problem, rather than in terms of a global objective function involving explicit numeric costs.  Ordinal matching problems arise in a diverse number of applications in practice, including matching medical school graduates to residencies at hospitals, maximizing the number of donor matches in kidney exchange networks, and efficient load balancing on the Internet.  Dr. Dean will develop improved algorithms for a broad range of ordinal matching problems, helping to bridge the gap in complexity between methods for ordinal matching and traditional cost-based matching problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Dean is an award-winning teacher and also serves as the associate director for the USA Computing Olympiad (USACO), where his training initiatives increase the enthusiam and algorithmic problem-solving proficiency of students at the high-school level.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Matching problems are an important area of algorithmic computer science, both in theory and in practice.  A few examples include the assignment of students to universities, optimal allocation of goods from supply points to demand points, and matching organs donors with patients in need of transplants. Matching problems are often "ordinal" in nature, where the preferences of objects to be matched are provided in the form of ranked lists (for example, in a student-university matching scheme, each student might rank universities in order of preference). Ordinal matching problems of many types have been widely studied to date in the computer science, applied mathematics, economics, and operations research communities. The most famous such problem is the so-called "stable marriage" or "stable matching" problem, dating back to the early 1960s and whose solution is used today in the National Residency Matching Program (NRMP), which matches thousands of medical school graduates with residencies at hospitals.  The research goal of this CAREER grant was to study algorithmic aspects of a wide range of ordinal matching problems.  Outcomes of this work include 7 published papers in high-quality venues, as well as dissertations of two PhD students on the specific subject of matching (as well as many other publications in other algorithmic areas not directly related to matching).  Notable results include extremely fast algorithms for solving "stable allocation" problems, the currently best known method for approximating the solution of the stable matching problem with ties and incomplete preference lists (one of the most prominent variants of the stable matching problem that is still under intense study due to its computational complexity), fast algorithms for solving stable matching problems where preference lists tend to be similar, and algorithmic results for "unsplittable" stable allocation problems (e.g., matching medical residents with hospitals, where some residents form married pairs that cannot be separated during the matching process).  These results, which reflect the intellectual merit of this grant, provide a substantial contribution to the ordinal matching literature, impacting both theory and practice.  In terms of broader impact, CAREER grants are somewhat unique in their support of both research and educational objectives.  The primary educational objective of this grant was to improve the reach and impact of the USA Computing Olympiad (USACO), one of several major "Olympiads" in the States tasked with identifying and training top high-school students in their respective disciplines.  The USACO provides on-line training material and programming contests at different levels in order to help bright high-school students learn computational problem-solving, it invites the top ~2 dozen students in the USA to a rigorous academic summer training camp, and it selects a team of the top 4 students in the USA to attend the International Olympiad in Informatics, the most prestigious programming competition in the world at the high-school level (one of several international high-school Olympiads in different scientific disciplines).  The principal investigator of this grant assumed the directorship of the USACO in 2011 and moved the summer training program to his home institution, Clemson University, at the same time.  Under his leadership, participation in the program has doubled in the past ~5 years, with more than 2600 students participating in our largest on-line contests, and thousands more utilizing our on-line training materials.  USA team members attending the IOI have done very well, with first place individual wins both in 2012 and 2014.   The USACO fills a key niche in the nation's computing education pipeline, ensuring a stream of very advanced highly-trained students entering university each year.  Alums of our program have many impressive accomplishments to date.          Last Modified: 02/03/2015       Submitted by: Brian...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
