<AbstractNarration>The development of techniques for cooling and trapping of a wide variety of atomic and molecular samples in recent years has created exciting opportunities for probing and manipulating chemical reactions at cold and ultracold temperatures. Theoretical studies of atomic and molecular interactions at cold and ultracold temperatures have become an integral part of this endeavor. To further advance progress in this field, quantitative calculations of rotational and vibrational transitions in cold and ultracold molecule collisions, including heteronuclear molecules, will be carried out by taking the H2-H2 and H2-HD systems as illustrative examples. In addition, quantum mechanical calculations will be carried out on the astrophysically important O+OH reaction at cold and ultracold temperatures. State-of-the-art quantum scattering methods will be used to investigate the molecule-molecule and atom-molecule collisions. General purpose computer codes have not been developed for this type of calculations. The molecule-molecule scattering calculations will be performed using a quantum scattering code jointly developed with Roman Krems (University of British Columbia) during the previous funding cycle. The code will be made available to the broader scientific community once it has been fully implemented and tested for the general case of diatom-diatom collisions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The studies will have broad impact on research at the interface between Atomic, Molecular and Optical (AMO) Physics, Physical Chemistry, and Astrochemistry. The computational algorithms developed will be equally applicable for molecular phenomena in related fields, for example, Atmospheric physics and Astrophysics. Summer support for an undergraduate student and partial support for a postdoctoral scholar will be provided to carry out research in the frontier area of AMO Physics. The postdoctoral scholar will be expected to take up a tenure track or similar position after completion of the work and to continue to mentor students and scholars.</AbstractNarration>
