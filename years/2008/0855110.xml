<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;As the computing industry accelerates into the many core era, it is confronted with the need for reliable and accurate simulation, modeling and performance prediction tools for future systems comprised of tens to hundreds of cores per die. Due to different intellectual histories and goals, the integration of mature existing point tools into accurate models of even small 4-8 core systems has proven to be time consuming, error prone, and brittle, with the models themselves taking hours to days for a single simulation run on state-of-the art workstations. Concurrently, these effects make re-use across groups and institutions difficult and have begun to severely inhibit research and teaching progress in many core architectures.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed program of work will create an open source many core simulation and modeling infrastructure. This infrastructure, Manifold, will adapt techniques for concurrent simulation to enable existing highly parallel architectures to be harnessed to model future designs. Manifold will enable users to incorporate existing simulation tools when they exist, as well as provide models for key many core components and phenomena, for example interconnection networks. The goal is a software infrastructure that is i) easily accessible to all academic and research communities, ii) runs on commodity clusters, iii) runs on many core laptops for classroom use, and iv) reduces barriers to entry in catalyzing new efforts. Central to Manifolds mission is the development of curricular material for computer architecture modeling and simulation including new courses, course modules, training materials, and significant evangelization.     &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project created new ways to model the performance of future computer systems.  Because computers have so many, many design trade offs, simulating them before they are built is the only way to know what is the right thing to build.  Parallel computers execute programs using many tasks.  But before this project, simulating those computers was done on a slow, non-parallel computer.  This project created Manifold, a versatile simulation software package that simulates parallel computers in parallel using a technique called distributed discrete event simulation.  Think of a computer as something that moves information around much like your heart pumps blood around.  Discrete event simulation works using a ticking clock.  Each tick, it makes a list of every event that occurred during that tick.  Then, all of the events are updated before the next tick.  Distributed discrete event simulation allows multiple "worker threads" to process the events on their own cores, making the simulation faster.  Although Manifold itself is the most significant outcome of this project, there were several other important outcomes.  The SST project at Sandia National Laboratories used Manifold techniques to create a government-wide computer simulator.  This project also paid for the education of seven Ph.D. students, all of whom today work to make computers faster using what they created in this project.
