<AbstractNarration>An unresolved question in animal behavior is how complexity and variation in male signals is maintained within populations.  Past attempts to identify evolutionary forces that result in different male reproductive signals have ignored the possibility that particular trait combinations may gain effectiveness by the synergistic interaction of individual signal components.  In fact, these interactions may be a vital component of selection on complex male displays.  This study will focus on pheromones in a species of salamander. These reproductive pheromones are chemical signals, created by a combination of proteins, that a male delivers to a female during courtship.  The combination of individual pheromone components makes each male unique.  Behavioral experiments will measure the strength of female preferences for particular pheromone combinations.  Documenting these female preferences will reveal whether this mechanism of female mate choice can account for the immense variation of male pheromones.  Additionally, mathematical models of the process by which pheromone diversity is maintained will be constructed, and evaluated using the experimental results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will promote outreach programs at Oregon State University and at the University of Louisville.  These programs will link faculty and students (graduate and undergraduate) with local teachers (K-12) and with students traditionally under-represented in scientific research.  The three primary goals of this activity are to train graduate and undergraduate students in experimental approaches and in new techniques, to put into practice new teaching methods shown to promote learning and retention in large science courses, and to let faculty and graduate students work with local school teachers to develop short programs amenable to different grade levels.</AbstractNarration>
