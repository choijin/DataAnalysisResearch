<AbstractNarration>Theodore A Endreny&lt;br/&gt;CBET-0836354&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to examine the following question: What degree of&lt;br/&gt;dewatering will trigger changes in hyporheic and riparian hydraulic gradients, flows, and nitrate concentrations in a dry tropical mountain stream?  This research question will be pursued in a small headwater stream proposed to supply water to the Village of Buena Vista, within in the State of Yoro, in the country of Honduras. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the dry season, this stream flows at approximately 75 liters per minute, equivalent to the flow from four household faucets. It is enough water, however, to meet the United Nations recommendation of 50 liters per person per day for the community of Buena Vista. The water quality in the stream is potable, maintained by nutrient transformations in the near stream environment, which acts like a filter. Filtering of nutrients will likely be affected by withdrawing water from the stream, which lowers the stream water level, and subsequently adjusts flows within the riparian zone and the hyporheic zones. This project uses groundwater and surface water monitoring in the riparian and hyporheic zone during controlled stream dewatering experiments in the dry season of August and September. Nutrient chemistry analysis will record changes in redox transformation with changes in the riparian and hyporheic gradients as a function stream water withdrawal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts from this research will involve college student participation in ecological designs for a community water supply project. Their work will balance needs of society and nature and improve the quality of life in Buena Vista and other mountain villages in Honduras, should these designs be disseminated. The project will also provide training of college students in ecological engineering design and construction in the developing world.</AbstractNarration>
