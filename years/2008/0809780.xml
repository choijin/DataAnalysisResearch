<AbstractNarration>Probably the most important topic to be investigated under this grant is the proposed new extension of the NMR isotopic perturbation method (which originated in the Saunders Laboratory and has been applied to many problems involving carbocation structures and rearrangements) to cases where the rotation of a methyl group is isotopically perturbed.  This innovation will have a number of important applications outside of the field of carbocations.  It is expected that this method will be used to probe subtle differences on the non-equivalent CH bonds to methyl groups in environments of less than three-fold symmetry.  The broader impacts are addressed by the expectation of having student involvement (including women) from Croatia and from Yale.  It is expected that participation in the work supported by this grant would be a substantial aid to their education. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was planned as a collaboration with Prof. Olga Kronja in Zograb, Croatia.  The idea was based the isotopic perturbation which we developed at Yale University under passed NSF grants.  This method involves introducing deuterium into molecules undergoing rapid and reversible reactions. The equilibrium constant is changed from unity to a finite value by this introduction. When experimental observation of this nature can be made, we can compare them with results  predicted by theoretical calculations. Other examples where this method have been used have resulted in excellent agreement between experiment and thoery. This agreement demonstrates that the experiments have been done correctly and that the approximations made in the calculations are appropriate.   The novel feature of this project was the proposal that one could perturb the rotation of a methyl group by using the introduction of isotopes.  In most cases, the rotation of a methyl group is extemely fast and it is not possible to slow it down even by going to extemely low temperature.  This project involved perturbing the rotation, but not slowing or stopping it. Isotopic perturbation has been used by our group and by many others to investigate a number of other  important problems.  Unfortunately, we were never able to prepare the critical compound required for this project.         Last Modified: 10/13/2017       Submitted by: Martin Saunders]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
