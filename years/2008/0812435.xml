<AbstractNarration>Graph-Based Learning for Speech Processing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past decades much research has been invested in automatic speech&lt;br/&gt;processing, and current speech processing systems often achieve remarkably &lt;br/&gt;low error rates. However, systems are still dependent on matched training and &lt;br/&gt;test corpora, and their performance deteriorates rapidly when faced with&lt;br/&gt;test conditions that differ from the training data. In the machine learning &lt;br/&gt;community, many novel algorithms have recently been proposed to better &lt;br/&gt;incorporate information from unlabeled test data into the learning and &lt;br/&gt;classification process. Most of these techniques scale poorly to large tasks &lt;br/&gt;and thus seem unsuitable for speech processing. This project investigates&lt;br/&gt;the applicability of one recently developed paradigm, graph-based&lt;br/&gt;learning (GBL), for automatic speech recognition. In particular, it &lt;br/&gt;uses GBL as an adaptation framework where acoustic classifiers are &lt;br/&gt;constrained to yield outputs that vary smoothly along underlying data&lt;br/&gt;manifolds characterizing the test data. The project addresses the &lt;br/&gt;core problems of poor scalability and computational complexity of GBL &lt;br/&gt;by using data clustering and subselection techniques as well as &lt;br/&gt;sparse matrix computation. Various ways of incorporating domain &lt;br/&gt;information (e.g. temporal or higher-level prosodic information)  &lt;br/&gt;into graph construction are evaluated, including the use of multiple, &lt;br/&gt;combined similarity measures for graph construction. Finally, online,&lt;br/&gt;incremental GBL techniques are being investigated in order to &lt;br/&gt;facilitate real-time processing. The outcome of this project is &lt;br/&gt;expected to significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of &lt;br/&gt;speech processing systems. Furthermore, it will contribute to improving &lt;br/&gt;the scalability of semi-supervised learning algorithms in general and&lt;br/&gt;thus facilitate their application to related pattern recognition fields.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
