<AbstractNarration>Multi-Agent System Based Intelligent Distributed Control System for Power Plants&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is development of an Intelligent Distributed Control System (IDCS) for a large-scale power plant. The complex network of sensor/actuators and distributed systems inherent in modern large-scale power plants immediately suggests a Multi-Agent System (MAS) as a viable solution. To operate a large-scale power plant, the monitoring and control systems are distributed and automated for each subsystem in the power plant. The approach is to use MAS, which allows implementation of significantly more sophisticated measures to compensate for the unsecure and nonrobust properties plaguing traditional control systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research is that MAS is well suited for distributed control of power plants since the resulting cooperative and negotiated solutions provide the ability for distributed autonomy, robust control, and flexible auto configuration. Current power plants use only centralized or loosely decentralized control schemes and require continuous intervention by the operator, while MAS can manage the power plant operation by itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research includes creation of a powerful unified tool for monitoring and control of power plants; an operational environment that is secure, fuel efficient, and provides practical and realistic infrastructure; and application in a broad range of engineering problems including nuclear plants, fuel cell plants, and power grids. With over 32.4% of current generation coming from coal alone, it is important to burn these fuels as efficiently and cleanly as possible. MAS paints a coherent picture for operators and will be useful as a training tool for workforces in energy systems.  The MAS-IDCS facility will be utilized in developing courses in Power Systems Control and Computational Intelligence, and will be attractive in recruiting diversified groups of students. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
