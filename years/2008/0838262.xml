<AbstractNarration>The Allen Telescope Array (ATA) is a centimeter-wavelength radio telescope producing unique science in the areas of radio surveys and transient source detection. The ATA is the first radio telescope designed for commensal observing; it will simultaneously produce sensitive SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) surveys as well as large area continuum and spectroscopic surveys for conventional radio astronomy. The science of the ATA is enabled by a number of innovative technical developments. The ATA may serve as a prototype for the US design of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), a next generation radio telescope currently in the planning phase.   Located in Hat Creek, CA, formerly the site of the Berkeley Illinois Maryland Association (BIMA) millimeter-wavelength array, the ATA currently consists of 42 offset Gregorian antennas with continuous frequency response from 0.5 to 11.2 GHz, with the possibility of future upgrades to more antennas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The Allen Telescope Array (ATA) at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory (Figure 1) is the first radio telescope operating at centimeter wavelengths that was designed and built as a large number of small dishes (LNSD) in order to minimize the cost and maximize its utility in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).  The ATA has served as a proof of concept for the LNSD design that has now been adopted for use in the mid-frequency component of the international Square Kilometre Array.  The ATA features an extremely wideband feed/receiver system that allows it to simultaneously observe all frequencies within the terrestrial microwave window from 1 to 10 GHz (Figure 2).  The use of four independent data paths allows multiple simultaneous scientific projects to be conducted e.g. SETI searches and traditional radio astronomical mapping of atomic hydrogen or molecular lines.  Figure 3 illustrates the observation of 50 target stars for SETI while a map of the M81+M82 region was made in the neutral hydrogen line.  Such commensal observations can work in the other direction; searches for radio transient sources were conducted whenever SETI surveyed the 20 square degrees near the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.  This grant provided partial support for systematic, SETI observations with the ATA covering the terrestrial microwave window while exploring stellar targets judged to be suitable hosts for habitable planets and more recently the candidate exoplanetary systems discovered by the Kepler spacecraft (Figure 4), in addition to the known exoplanets visible from the northern California site. During the course of this grant, the search for narrowband, obviously-engineered signals, was migrated from a partial custom hardware system onto a software-only system known as SETI on the ATA (SonATA) executing on very fast enterprise servers and processors donated by Dell Inc. and Intel.  Currently we observe three targets simultaneously, covering a dual-polarization bandwidth of 20 MHz with a frequency resolution of 1 Hz.  This grant has supported the migration to SonATA; targeted observations covering many hundreds of MHz in the direction of 10,300 stars, 2,500 exoplanets (or candidates), and a survey grid near the galactic center; as well as investigations into new signal detection strategies, ideally suited to the ATA.  During the grant, the partner for operations and maintenance of the ATA changed from UC Berkeley Radio Astronomy Lab to SRI International.  Undergraduate REU students participating in the SETI Institute's Astrobiology summer program live and study for a week at the ATA learning about radio astronomy, interferometry, and SETI.  During that unique week they also spend time exploring nearby Lassen Volcanic National Park and the research sites operated by our astrobiologists, who study micro-organisms that thrive in the extremely acidic and hot environments within the park (Figure 5).  Over three years, 8 of the 50 participating students have worked with mentors supported by this grant using the ATA for individual research projects.  Of those 8, one is now in graduate school, three are in their final year of undergraduate school, three are working in technology deferring grad school, and one is tutoring physics as an entrepreneur. This represents a very exciting and productive synergy between the NSF-funded URO and REU programs.  The detection of a signal from a distant technological civilization would represent a far-reaching outcome of the Copernican Revolution and change everything. SETI has an enormous appeal for the general public and we have endeavored to use that as a hook for education and public outreach, as well as citizen science.  Each year the PI and Co-IÆs of this grant present over 100 lectures, colloquia, and informal talks, as well as participating in many more media interviews and film/TV shoots.  Co-I Seth Shostak hosts an hour-long weekly broadcast/podcast radio show produced in-house called "Big Pictur...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
