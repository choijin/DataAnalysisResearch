<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project advances the understanding of security and privacy in pervasive healthcare by testing technological methods of securing implantable medical devices and by evaluating human factors through patient studies.  The most fundamental question is how to balance the opposing goals of safety and effectiveness with security and privacy of wireless, implantable medical devices.&lt;br/&gt;        Future pervasive healthcare devices --- including prescription-based devices like pacemakers, drug pumps, and neurostimulators --- will not only contain long-range wireless capabilities, but will have sophisticated processors and the ability to interact with other devices on the person or in the person's environment.  These innovations could vastly improve healthcare, but also introduce unique security and privacy risks not well understood from the perspectives of cyber security, medicine, public policy, and society.  A primary challenge is understanding how to overcome the fundamental tension between security and privacy and traditional goals of safety and effectiveness.  A second challenge is learning how to design usable, intuitive security mechanisms that patients and doctors will accept and understand.  Approaches include novel, zero-power security mechanisms that do not drain the healthcare device's battery, and surveys of patients and other users of pervasive healthcare technologies to learn about patient perceptions and expectations.&lt;br/&gt;        Blending computer science with healthcare, the project prepares computer science students for interdisciplinary security research via both research and coursework.  Further demonstrating broader impact, the project reaches out to under-represented minorities and women in computing at community colleges in Western Massachusetts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our research objective has been to enhance understanding of security and privacy in pervasive healthcare by pursuing technological approaches to securing medical devices.  The PI of the grant has given dozens of talks on the topic of medical device security and has written papers calling for the biomedical engineering community to include security and privacy routinely at the product design stage.  One recent publication from our medical partners looked at the extent to which software played a role in medical device recalls as recorded by the FDA.  Our investigations led us to conclude that there was no evidence of protections against malware in Automated External Defibrillators.  In response to the finding, we looked at the feasibility of protecting an implantable medical device from attacks without modifying the device itself.  We presented a solution that protects an implantable medical device by delegating security o a personal base station.  We identified three of the major factors affecting security and privacy solutions for implantable medical devices:  fundamental tensions, software risks and human factors.  We also identified two challenges from the security community with which the biomedical community might be able to help:  access to medical devices and methods for in vitro experimentation.  We have tackled the former issue by developing the Open Medical Device Research Library to serve as a repository for medical devices, affording security researchers greater access to devices that was traditionally available.  Security and privacy related issues are not unique to healthcare but should be included in many of the increasingly critical technologies used in the home and workplace.  Healthcare is changing with wireless connectivity to medical device continuing to increase and devices used for critical care becoming increasingly reliant on software.  While much of our work has been undertaken within the realm of healthcare; we were able to leverage our research in security and privacy as it relates to healthcare and transfer that knowledge to smart metering of homes for public utilities.  The results of our experiment demonstrate that it is possible to extract complex usage patterns from smart meter data using off-the-shelf statistical methods.  Ultimately, it is our intention to benefit the consumer, the ultimate end-user of technology be it as a healthcare consumer receiving an implantable medical device, as a homeowner with a smart meter from their public utility or as the user of a contactless payment card.  Security and privacy are among the key factors in the successful deployment and continued use of these pervasive technologies.
