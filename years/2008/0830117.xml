<AbstractNarration>University of California-Los Angeles&lt;br/&gt;Columbia University &lt;br/&gt;University of Bremen&lt;br/&gt;University of British Columbia&lt;br/&gt;University of California-Davis&lt;br/&gt;University of California-Riverside &lt;br/&gt;University of California-Santa Barbara&lt;br/&gt;University of Texas-El Paso &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award establishes a Center to conduct research and education on the interactions of nanomaterials with living systems and with the abiotic environment.  The goals of this Center are to develop a predictive understanding of biological and ecological toxicology for nanomaterials, and of their transport and transformation in the environment.  This Center engages a highly interdisciplinary, multi-institutional team in an integrated research program to determine how the physical and chemical properties of nanomaterials determine their environmental impacts from the cellular scale to that of entire ecosystems.  The research approach promises to be transformative to the science of ecotoxicology by combining high throughput screening assays with computational and physiological modeling to predict impacts at higher levels of biological organization.  The Center will unite the fields of engineering, chemistry, physics, materials science, cell biology, ecology, toxicology, computer modeling, and risk assessment to establish the foundations of a new scientific discipline: environmental nanotoxicology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on nanomaterials and development of nanotechnology is expanding rapidly and producing discoveries that promise to benefit the nation?s economy, and improve our ability to live sustainably on earth.  There is now a critical need to reduce uncertainty about the possible negative consequences of nanomaterials in the environment, while at the same time providing guidelines for their safe design to prevent environmental and toxicological hazards.  This Center addresses this societal need by developing a scientific framework of risk prediction that is paradigm-shifting in its potential to keep pace with the commercial expansion of nanotechnology.  Another impact of the Center will be development of human resources for the academic community, industry and government by training the next generation of nano-scale scientists, engineers, and regulators to anticipate and mitigate potential future environmental hazards of nanotechnology.  Partnerships with other centers will act as powerful portals for the dissemination and integration of research findings to the scientific, educational, and industrial communities, both nationally and internationally.  This Center will contribute to a network of nanotechnology centers that serve the national needs and expand representation and access to this research and knowledge network through an internship program directed at California community colleges serving underrepresented groups.  Outreach activities, including a journalist?scientist communication program, will serve to inform both experts and the public at large about the safety issues surrounding nanotechnology and how to safely produce, use, and dispose of nanomaterials. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
