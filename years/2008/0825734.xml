<AbstractNarration>Documenting and learning from observations following extreme events are invaluable to advancing the state-of-the-art and the state-of-the-practice in multi-hazards engineering.  Recorded observations serve as benchmarks to our understanding of the effects of these events, their underlying causative mechanisms, and for validation of design procedures.  Capturing these observations is critical to advancing the profession.  Currently, the Geo-Engineering Earthquake Reconnaissance Association performs post-earthquake reconnaissance.  Having succeeded in developing innovative techniques for post-earthquake reconnaissance, the association is broadening its scope to include other natural and human-made disasters.  This broadening of its mission is reflected in its new name: Geo-engineering Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While post-earthquake reconnaissance continues to be a central mission, we recognize that GEER members have already participated effectively in reconnaissance efforts that document geotechnical effects of other extreme events (e.g., World Trade Center Towers collapse and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita).  GEER is well positioned to provide leadership in developing innovative technologies and protocols for performing reconnaissance of the damaging effects from other natural and human-made disasters.  Much of the data and information generated by extreme events is perishable and therefore must be collected within a few days or weeks of the event.  There continues to be a real need for assembling strategic geo-engineering survey teams with NSF support.  Many of the innovative techniques employed in recent reconnaissance efforts, such as use of digital cameras, GPS devices, PDAs, remote sensing, and digital mapping, were developed by GEER members.  GEER's ability to rapidly assemble experienced and new geo-engineers is unmatchable.  However, these efforts are being improved through better coordination prior to the next event, through continued development of technologies, and training of young professionals. By joining with other professions who have also developed effective procedures, and sharing the results of this research with other communities, the future detrimental effects of extreme events will be minimized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funds for continuation of GEER management and reconnaissance activities under the new expanded scope of providing quick response investigations of major geo-engineering-related disasters. It is expected that an average of one or two investigations of moderate sized events would be conducted per year.  In the event of a major disaster, a small quick response team would be dispatched to determine the magnitude of the needed response so that a request for additional funds could be quickly submitted.</AbstractNarration>
