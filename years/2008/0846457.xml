<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: ECCS-0846457&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: New Computational Paradigms for Large-scale ab-initio Simulations of Emerging Electronic Materials and Devices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Name:  Polizzi, Eric&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Institution: University of Massachusetts Amherst&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to enhance significantly the role of computational modeling and high-performance computing for designing new classes of high speed, and high functionality electronic devices. The project aims at providing a sound basis to face the challenges in large-scale atomistic simulations for applications ranging from material sciences and chemistry to nanoelectronics and bio-nanotechnology. Specific advanced mathematical techniques and high-performance parallel algorithms are then proposed for simulating the electronic structure and transport properties of large scale systems only from the knowledge of the constituent atoms. To achieve these goals, first-principle continuum-based modeling and calculations are performed using efficient real-space mesh techniques and within the density functional theory. The transport models range from a standard non-equilibrium Green?s function formalism approach to  more reliable time dependent and dissipation models for exploring transition between micro and grand-canonical representations A state-of-the-art nanoelectronics simulation environment, NESSIE, will be developed for prototyping emerging materials and devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project proposes the fusion of the recent breakthroughs in quantum atomistic simulation of materials and devices with those in high-performance computing. The results are potentially capable of advancing knowledge and understanding of nanoscale physics of emerging electronics and focusing &lt;br/&gt;experimental investigation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project will accelerate the development of quantum technologies and their impacts in the global economy. Packaging the required high-performance numerical simulation tools into portable software will also have significant broader impacts in science and engineering and education.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The technology for electronic devices has been on a rapidly rising trajectory since the 1960s ("MooreÆs Law").  The main factor in this development has been the ability to fabricate ever smaller silicon CMOS devices, with today's device sizes in the nanometer range (20nm).  Basic physical theory and experimental research dealt with nanometer dimensions much earlier, and has continued to flourish, as  experimental advances have encouraged new theoretical investigations and innovative techniques for simulations. The emergence of new nanoscale materials and devices whose operating principles rely entirely on quantum effects,have motivated the need for a more fundamental and comprehensive understanding of the nanoscale physics of systems  only through knowledge of the constituent atoms. Atom by-atom large-scale first-principle calculations are becoming increasingly important to achieve realistic quantum simulations that can reliably supplement the current experimental investigations. More particularly, the capability to model and study various relevant quantum many-body effects has become a fundamental requirement in the anticipated design of future high-end technology,such as plasmonic effects for computing and sensing applications,  or excitonic effects for energy applications using photovoltaics.The needs for ever higher level of accuracy and high-performance in these large-scale electronic structure calculations, pose unique numerical challenges for the traditional first-principle computational models and  algorithms.   The project presents new computational and algorithmic paradigms that can significantly improve the efficiency of existing computational methodologies used in quantum chemistry, physics, and materials science applications. It addresses the very important problems of efficiency, robustness and parallel scalability in first-principle electronic ground state and excited state calculations of complex molecular systems and nanostructures.In order to accomplish such realistic quantum simulations, this project has motivated the design of novel numerical algorithms that are both capable of processing a considerable amount of generated data and achieving significant parallel scalability on modern high end computing architectures. Innovative activities in numerical algorithms for solving the eigenvalue problem, in particular, have led to the development of the groundbreaking FEAST algorithm and FEAST solver (2008-present) with perspectives of major broader impacts in many areas of Science and Engineering. The recent publicly available FEAST solver package  (www.feast-solver.org) is a new state-of-the-artnumerical library which keeps gaining significant international visibility in the scientific and education community, and which has been recently integrated into the world leading INTEL-MKL library (as INTEL's MKL main HPC eigenvalue solver).    Beside  the "black-box" solver, the project includes also the development of a set of both flexible and generic numerical modules thatshould be of benefit to a large portion of existing  quantum chemistry and solid-state physics software packages.In addition to a strong service activity provided to the "electronic structure community", theproject also contains a significant educational component. For instance, half ofcurrent FEAST users are students (among few thousand downloads), and this trend is expected to continue in the future.
