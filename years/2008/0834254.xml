<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to support 30 graduate students, from the United States, to attend the 27th International Congress on Applications of Lasers &amp; Electro-Optics, which is an annual conference organized by Laser Institute of America, to be held in Temecula, California from October 20 to 23, 2008. This support opportunity will be advertised though emails to be sent out by Laser Institute of America. The students can apply the support by replying the emails sent from Laser Institute of America. The student selection process will be based on the following priorities: 1) Students from groups traditionally underrepresented; 2) Students from universities and colleges that traditionally lack funding to support graduate student attendance at conferences; and 3) Students who present high-quality papers, as determined by the conference chairs in consultation with the program committee. The selected students will be expected to present their papers during the conference, compete for student-paper awards, and attend a ?Student Career Forum: Future for Graduate Students in Academy and Industry?. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The efforts to be made in this project will blend research and educational activities for the graduate students who attend. By participating in the conference, these students will be exposed to state-of-the-art research topics and will interact with academic and industrial leaders. They will learn how to best use their time in graduate study and how to be prepared for their future career. The priority of support will be given to the graduate students from underrepresented groups, such as women, African American and Hispanic students, and from universities that lack financial resources. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
