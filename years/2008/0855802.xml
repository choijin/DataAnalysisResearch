<AbstractNarration>Full Center Proposal (Phase I) for an I/UCRC for Water and Environmental Technology (WET) Center &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0855881 Temple University; Rominder Suri &lt;br/&gt;0855786 University of Arizona; Ian Pepper &lt;br/&gt;0855802 Arizona State University; Morteza Abbaszadegan &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this proposal is to start a new I/UCRC "Water and Environmental Technology (WET)" with a focus on water quality and emerging contaminants. The lead of the proposed Center will be Temple University (TU) with site locations at the University of Arizona (UA) and Arizona State University (ASU). The objective of the proposed Center is to advance the knowledge and understand the effects of emerging contaminants on water quality. Emerging contaminants generally refer to pharmaceuticals, personal care products, as well as pathogens detected in the source water environment; thereby posing a potential or real threat to human health or the environment. The proposed research aims at developing technologies to detect, understand, mitigate and/or control emerging contaminants in the environment as well as other traditional contaminants that can adversely impact water quality. Center engineers and environmental scientists using microbial, chemical, hydrologic and mathematical approaches will work collaboratively to conduct this research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center and its research activities will involve faculty, undergraduate and graduate students and industrial representatives; and the industrial-focused research program will enhance the scientific understanding and help address a potentially significant health and environmental problem. Many of the companies of the proposed Center have overseas installations; thus, students will be exposed to regulatory, social and cultural aspects of different countries, enhancing their global experiences. All three institutions plan to engage K-12 students and teachers, and will enhance the ongoing efforts of integrating research in classroom teaching. WET has a strong diversity plan that ensures the participation of underrepresented groups in all levels of the Center. The Center plans to publish results in various publications as well as present at Conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ National Science Foundation Water &amp; Environmental Technology Center at Arizona State University  The National Science Foundation Water &amp; Environmental Technology (WET) Center at Arizona State University (ASU) was funded in February 2009. The overall goal of the center is to enhance partnership in advancing science of water and to promote scientific research that will ensure the quality of water by pooling the resources of the university and industry.  From the beginning, The WET Center at ASU selected and funded research projects in health-related water microbiology and other emerging contaminants. Some of the research accomplishments include the completion of many projects including the analysis of photocatalysis implementation in water treatment systems for the removal of disinfection by-products (DBPs) precursors, the development of biosensor for rapid detection of pathogens in water distribution systems; optimization of rapid small-scale column tests method for arsenic removal technologies for fast compliance with new arsenic rule; a universal sample processing protocol for the detection of pathogens in environmental samples. The new method is fully compatible with most cutting edge technologies and therefore has greatly increased the capability of water utilities for rapid and efficient detection of pathogens.

For example, long term study of pathogens in source water established that utilities using central Arizona source waters do not have to use enhanced coagulation for the removal of DBPs and those utilities in the area do not need to provide additional treatment as required under the new LT2ESWT Rule. Moreover, it was shown that naturally occurring estrogenic chemicals are labile to chlorination and are effectively removed during water treatment processes.  During the previous years many manuscripts have been published in peer-reviewed journals, oral and poster presentations were made by students and post-doctoral fellows at the American Society for Microbiology annual meetings, Water Quality Technology Conference and other national and international conferences and many at local meetings.  The Center is contributing to the area of water quality by strengthening the basic and applied knowledge base in some priority areas and training young professionals. This has being accomplished through funding research projects, organizing workshops and training students in various water quality areas.  The WET Center at ASU provides opportunities to train undergraduate and graduate students from different disciplines and K-12 science teachers. Undergraduate and graduate students are currently being trained in the areas as diverse as molecular detection of microbes, physical and chemical treatment of water, microbial source tracking, disinfection processes, novel microbial quantification techniques and coagulation processes. The Center has also collaborated with a program focused towards Engineering Exposure to minority students at high school level.  The research publications and project reports will strengthen the basic and applied knowledge base in the area of water quality. Moreover, student training will enhance the quality of young professional available to industry. Within our outreach program, we are enhancing community awareness and public health, public preparedness, and professional development.
