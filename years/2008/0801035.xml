<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigators (PIs) will conduct a multi-institution, integrated study encompassing several core science foci of the second Verification of the Origin of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment (VORTEX2) to be held in 2009.  In support of this research, and in support of the overall VORTEX2 program, the PIs will field several core VORTEX2 instrumentation systems. The field-project and analysis effort will permit the coordinated collection of multi-platform measurements and their integrated analysis. The diverse data sets will result from fixed and mobile radars, mobile mesonets, and in situ instrumentation with the goal of developing a more comprehensive scientific understanding of the genesis, maintenance, and structure of tornadoes and supercells and their relationship to the environment. This study will combine integrated analyses with those of less comprehensive data from over 130 tornadoes obtained during the Radar Observations of Thunderstorms And Tornadoes Experiment (ROTATE) program (1996-2007).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific Motivation and Intellectual Merit: Current level of understanding in several areas of tornado science fails to provide answers to fundamental questions including the true range of sizes, intensities, and structures of tornadoes.  The factors governing the occurrence and timing of tornado genesis, growth, intensification, maintenance, and dissipation, as well as the modes of genesis, are hypothesized from previous work, but remain largely unvalidated observationally, as do details concerning vertical wind field profiles, and the evolution and structure of damaging winds near the ground. The specific role of downdrafts in tornadogenesis and the sensitivity of the tornadogenesis process to microphysical and thermodynamic characteristics are not known. Thus, while significant advances have been made in addressing many of these questions using data from the original VORTEX and from ROTATE; these results have been limited.  Specifically, VORTEX2 will provide an integration of multiple-Doppler mobile radar data with comprehensive in situ thermodynamic data that has not been achieved previously. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Improved understanding of tornado genesis, maintenance, structure, and environmental dependencies will have a broad impact on the ability to detect, warn, and forecast these severe events and to reduce subsequent casualties. The fielding of mobile Doppler radars, mobile mesonets, and in situ thermodynamic probes will be led by the PIs. These datasets will be available to the scientific community for both scientific and educational purposes and are likely to be extensively used by a large number of investigators and educators. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Normal 0   false false false         MicrosoftInternetExplorer4              This NSF award supported research activities that have improved our understanding of how tornadoes develop and are maintained within supercell thunderstorms, which are the variety responsible for virtually all strong and violent tornadoes.  The project involved analyzing cutting-edge observations of both tornadic and nontornadic supercells obtained in the Radar Observations of Thunderstorms and Tornadoes Experiment (ROTATE) and the second Verification of the Origins of Rotation Experiment (VORTEX2).  In situ data collection using instrumented cars in VORTEX2 was directly supported by this grant to accomplish one of the main VORTEX2 goals of multi-scale, rapid-update, dual-Doppler radar observations and simultaneous thermodynamic observations that were severely lacking in pre-VORTEX2 supercell datasets.  State-of-the-art numerical simulations also were used to further our understanding of tornado-producing storms, and included "data assimilation" studies, in which observations are combined with a numerical model in order to produce a four-dimensional depiction of the storm that can subsequently be analyzed, as well as simulations that isolate key processes responsible for the development of intense vortices in highly idealized "pseudostorms."  Additional simulations were used to study the challenging forecasting problem of storm mergers, which sometimes precede the development of tornadoes, but just as often precede storm demise.   Nontornadic supercells have been found to generally possess less (in some cases considerably less) angular momentum (the spin that can be contracted to produce a tornado) near the surface than tornadic low-level mesocyclones.  The angular-momentum-bearing air also tends to be cooler in nontornadic storms than in tornadic storms, and nontornadic storms tend to have weaker "suction" from aloft; the cooler air and weaker suction combine to limit the degree to which the angular-momentum-bearing air in nontornadic supercells can be accelerated inward and upward near the surface.  Rotation increases as air having high angular momentum penetrates closer to the axis of rotation, just as a figure skater spins faster as her arms are drawn inward.  It has also been found that the near-surface angular momentum can suddenly increase&mdash;perhaps even triggering tornadogenesis&mdash;when narrow precipitation shafts descend to the ground from aloft on the rear flank of the stormÆs updraft.    Another key outcome is the discovery of a plausible role for low-level environmental wind shear (the variation of the speed and direction of winds with height in the stormÆs environment) in tornado formation.  It has been well-known for decades that environmental wind shear plays a direct role in the development of rotation aloft (about a vertical axis) in supercells&mdash;horizontal spin associated with the shear is tilted into the vertical by the supercellÆs updraft&mdash;but that the development of vertical spin next to the surface requires downdrafts and temperature gradients, both of which are largely independent of the environmental wind shear.  Our work has found that strong low-level environmental wind shear is tied to tornado formation by promoting the suction that is crucial for drawing angular-momentum-bearing air inward and upward near the surface.    The temperature characteristics of the angular-momentum-bearing air and sudden appearance of rear-flank precipitation shafts also have been found to affect tornado maintenance.  For example, sudden surges of cool air can shunt the near-surface vortex away from the source of suction aloft, thereby causing the tornado to weaken.  On the other hand, some surges within the "outflow" of supercells can actually intensify tornadoes.  The outcome appears to be sensitive to the temperature anomalies and precipitation that accompany a surge, perhaps for the same reason that cold angular-momentum-be...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
