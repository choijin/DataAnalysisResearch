<AbstractNarration>John Weeks of the University of Maryland is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Program to extend the Local Molecular Field (LMF) method in new directions and to apply the existing LMF theory to help resolve important conceptual issues involving water and polyelectrolytes.  Weeks is 1) using LMF theory to develop a new and very general theory of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions in water; 2) developing new and efficient ways of solving the self-consistent LMF equations; and 3) connecting the LMF picture to other important new theoretical developments with suggestive common features.   In addition, Weeks and coworkers are extending LMF theory in fundamentally new directions involving dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because LMF is simple, physically motivated, and widely applicable, it has an impact on how scientists working in many different areas think qualitatively about charged (ionic) systems. Longer term, there are significant biological and technological implications of this research that benefit society as a whole. Nonuniform ion distributions around solutes and in membranes and ion channels play a key role in the stability of colloidal suspensions and in many fundamental biological processes. Ions and ion channels are essential for cellular metabolism. Ionic liquids are being used as alternative nonvolatile and nonflammable solvents with tunable properties for use in manufacturing processes.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Our new LMF theory can be viewed as a mapping that relates the structure and thermodynamics of a nonuniform system with long ranged intermolecular interactions to those of a simpler "mimic system", with appropriately chosen short ranged or truncated intermolecular interactions but in an effective single-particle potential or 'local molecular field' (LMF) that accounts for the averaged effects of the long ranged interactions. The short ranged mimic system can be treated much more efficiently by computer simulations and it also helps in developing simple intuitive local pictures of structure and solvation in charged systems.   Charged ions and polar liquids play a key role in a host of biological and engineering problems. Nonuniform ion distributions around solutes determine the stability of colloidal suspensions.  Water has been called "the matrix of life" and its importance in biology and as the most important solvent can hardly be overstated. Hydrophobic interactions are believed to drive protein folding and other fundamental biological processes. Ions and ion channels are essential for cellular metabolism, and failure to regulate the transport of ions in and out of cells can lead to disease and death.  Thus fundamental progress in our understanding of the properties of ions and water can have broad and transformational impact.   Research carried out under this grant made important advances in three basic areas.  1) We showed for dense uniform liquids that properly truncated models for ions and water (ignoring all corrections from the LMF) can give a surprisingly accurate descriptions for correlations functions describing the arrangements of particles in the fluid. This is illustrated in Fig. 1, which compares correlation functions in bulk water between hydrogen and oxygen atoms using a standard (SPC/E) water model with Coulomb interactions to those given by two different truncated models with only short ranged intermolecular interactions.  This agreement shows that properties of the basic hydrogen bond network in bulk water can be very accurately captured using short ranged models.

The LMF accounts for the averaged effects of the long ranged interactions and in nonuniform systems these corrections are very important. This opens the way for the general use of short ranged models in both uniform and nonuniform environments for structure and thermodynamics.  3) We used the truncated water models as analysis tools to examine the different roles the hydrogen bond network as described by the short-ranged models, and corrections from the long ranged dispersions, and dipolar interactions as described by LMF theory play in determining the properties of systems containing liquid water.
