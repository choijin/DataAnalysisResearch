<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0803213&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Steven A. Bleiler&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant partially supports the speakers and participants at&lt;br/&gt;conferences of the Cascade Topology Seminar (CTS).  During the&lt;br/&gt;three-year grant period May 1, 2008 - April 30, 2011, meetings of&lt;br/&gt;the CTS are scheduled at semiannual intervals.  These conferences&lt;br/&gt;will be held at various universities in the Northwestern United&lt;br/&gt;States and Southwestern Canada.  Universities currently active in&lt;br/&gt;the CTS are the Universities of British Columbia, Calgary,&lt;br/&gt;Nevada-Reno, Oregon, Puget Sound, Victoria, and Washington, and&lt;br/&gt;Boise, California-Chico, Oregon, and Portland State Universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic goals of the CTS include providing for frequent&lt;br/&gt;contacts between workers in similar fields, to allow participants&lt;br/&gt;to keep abreast of recent developments by bringing in speakers&lt;br/&gt;from outside the region, to enable graduate students and&lt;br/&gt;topologists in the Pacific Northwest and Southwestern Canada to&lt;br/&gt;hear, consult, and possibly collaborate with the outside speakers&lt;br/&gt;and members of other institutions, and to provide an opportunity&lt;br/&gt;for local people to lecture on their own work.  Topics covered&lt;br/&gt;are not limited, however, the interests of the various organizers&lt;br/&gt;tend to be mirrored by the interests of the participants.  Thus,&lt;br/&gt;the seminar programs usually concern algebraic, geometric, or low&lt;br/&gt;dimensional topology, differential or algebraic geometry, or&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial group theory.  The CTS also coordinates its&lt;br/&gt;activities with the Pacific Northwest Geometry Seminar and the&lt;br/&gt;Western States Geometric Topology Workshop with whom joint&lt;br/&gt;meetings have occasionally been held.
