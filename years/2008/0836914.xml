<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;Problem solving is the primary intellectual activity of engineers and enhancing problem-solving is essential for preparing engineering students for their future workplace. In addition, new pedagogies such as problem-based learning (PBL) have been shown to be highly effective in improving overall student learning. Through this project, PBL activities are being developed for a material science course and are being implemented in an undergraduate course for mechanical engineering students. Learning outcomes from the PBL-based course are being compared to those obtained in a traditional topics-based course. Engineering curricula typically include PBL-like activities in the capstone design course; however, in this project, PBL is being introduced at the sophomore level to motivate learning and improve students' ability to solve ill-structured problems. The results from this project are being rigorously evaluated by both qualitative and quantitative means. Project results are being disseminated through a website, journal articles, and workshops for engineering faculty who may be interested in implementing PBL techniques in their undergraduate courses.</AbstractNarration>
