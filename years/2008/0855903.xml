    <AbstractNarration>The investigator studies the stability and instability of&lt;br/&gt;equilibria in fluids and plasmas, focusing on the two-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;Euler equation in fluids and on Vlasov systems in plasma physics&lt;br/&gt;and stellar dynamics. He aims to develop general methods of&lt;br/&gt;finding linearly growing modes (especially for asymmetric modes&lt;br/&gt;and boundary modes), to investigate nonlinear stability under&lt;br/&gt;sharp linear stability criteria and for non-monotonic equilibria&lt;br/&gt;that cannot be handled by the usual energy-Casimir method, and to&lt;br/&gt;establish nonlinear instability from linear instability when the&lt;br/&gt;particle trajectory is non-integrable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A plasma is a gas composed of particles, each carrying a&lt;br/&gt;positive or negative electrical charge, with approximately equal&lt;br/&gt;concentrations of each charge. Most of the universe is plasma;&lt;br/&gt;examples include the solar wind, the ionosphere, galactic nebulae,&lt;br/&gt;and comet tails. Plasmas also arise in physics and engineering,&lt;br/&gt;for instance in nuclear fusion. The investigator studies the&lt;br/&gt;stability and instability of equilibria in fluids and plasmas. &lt;br/&gt;Mathematical advances here enhance our understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;physical mechanisms that govern stability and instability, and so&lt;br/&gt;can lead to better numerical methods for simulations of these&lt;br/&gt;complex phenomena. Fluid stability is important in understanding&lt;br/&gt;the mechanisms of ocean waves and the movements of the atmosphere&lt;br/&gt;as well as in engineering applications. Questions of plasma&lt;br/&gt;stability arise in areas as diverse as sunspots, fundamental&lt;br/&gt;plasma physics, the design of fusion machines, and plasma display&lt;br/&gt;devices.</AbstractNarration>
