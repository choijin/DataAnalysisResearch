<AbstractNarration>The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) is presently creating a campus-wide, shared, interdisciplinary facility for high-performance computing with the initial purchase of a distributed-memory cluster with 33 compute nodes connected by a state-of-the-art low-latency InfiniBand interconnect. In following years, the campus aims to purchase 32 new compute nodes annually to create a 128-node cluster. The initial purchase was jointly funded by institutional seed money and contributions from individual faculty and several departments. This award  provides funding to be used by these researchers from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics to contribute money for 16 compute nodes to this facility for a total of $80,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Numerical Simulation of Calcium Waves in Heart Cells  Matthias K. Gobbert and Bradford E. Peercy Department of Mathematics and Statistics University of Maryland, Baltimore County  Calcium ions play a crucial role in driving the heart beat. Calcium is released into the heart cell at a lattice of discrete positions throughout the cell, known as calcium release units (CRUs). The probability that calcium will be released from a CRU depends on the calcium concentration at that CRU. When a CRU releases calcium (it `fires'), the local concentration of calcium ions increases sharply and the calcium that diffuses raises the probability for release at neighboring sites. As a sequence of CRUs begins to release calcium throughout the cell, the release can self-organize into a wave of increasing concentration. If the wave is triggered amongst the normal physiological signaling (i.e., the cardiac action potential) then it can lead to irregular heart beats and possibly a life threatening ventricular fibrillation.  A mathematical model for this effect has been developed by Leighton T. Izu and co-workers [Biophysical Journal, pp. 88-102 and pp. 103-120, 2001]. It consists of a system of three time-dependent partial differential equations, so-called reaction-diffusion equations, which are coupled through non-linear reaction terms. The most important component in the driving terms of the equation for the calcium concentration is the superposition of Dirac delta distributions that models the CRUs as point sources.  Realistic simulations can only be obtained using mathematical models that discretize the the three-dimensional cell domain with a high-resolution numerical mesh.  Therefore, a special-purpose computer code is needed that pays great attention to the efficient use of computer memory and that is able to pool the memory from several nodes in a parallel computing cluster.  Moreover, large final times are required to reach laboratory time scales and to simulate for long enough to allow several waves to propagate through the cell.  The numerical solution of this problem is made additionally challenging by the discontinuities caused by the Dirac delta distributions, for which the classical finite element theory does not apply. This means that standard numerical analysis cannot guarantee the convergence of the numerical method, which is necessary to trust the computed solutions.  Initial work by graduate student Alexander Hanhart [M.S. thesis, 2002], funded by a UMBC DRIF grant, demonstrated that a parallel implementation can achieve the required high resolution of the numerical mesh.  Moreover, it confirmed computationally that a finite element method with tri-linear nodal basis functions converges for this problem [Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, pp. 431-458, 2004].   Work involving several students, including the undergraduate student Kevin Allen and the high school senior Greg McGlynn, created a full special-purpose code for the application that uses state-of-the-art time-stepping and matrix-free linear solvers. Its confirmed numerical convergence, scalable parallel performance, ability to achieve spontaneous wave-initiation, and correct representation of vital physical effects such as mass conservation make it suitable for long-time simulations on the scales needed for the application [Gobbert, SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, pp. 2922-2947, 2008].  Such simulations are made possible by the computing cluster tara with state-of-the-art Intel Nehalem processors and extended memory of 24 GB per node that is part of the UMBC High Performance Computing Facility (www.umbc.edu/hpcf), funded in part by the National Science Foundation through MRI and SCREMS grants with additional significant support from UMBC.    Very recent work in the department has allowed us to solve two key issues: The convergence of the finite element method is now rigorously established together with departmental colleague Thomas I.
