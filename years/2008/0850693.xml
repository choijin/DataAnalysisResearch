<AbstractNarration>This international ten-week ThaiREU summer program is designed to give eight students recruited from across the United States an intensive, hands-on research experience in organic chemistry in Bangkok, Thailand: in laboratories at the Chulabhorn Research Institute, Chulalongkorn University and at Mahidol University. Each American undergraduate will be paired with a Thai graduate student. The American ThaiREU students will be housed together at the Chulabhorn Research Institute, and will receive an initial Thai culture, history and language course, which will be supplemented throughout the summer by cultural enrichment outings to important religious and historical locations.  Weekly research meetings will be followed by a final Research Colloquium for both American and Thai student participants. In addition, the ThaiREU students will submit written research reports to complete their formal research experience. This 10-week research experience in organic chemistry will provide an intensive, hands-on research experience in a sophisticated, modern Thai laboratory under the personalized mentorship of a Thai faculty member and partnership with a Thai graduate student. Scientifically, the long-range impact of this program will give undergraduates a realistic understanding of the research endeavor, and encourage students to pursue graduate studies. Culturally, this experience will foster cross-cultural communication and understanding, and establish long-term bonds between young American and Thai scientists. This experience will promote the growth of a globally engaged scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
