<AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY( Revised August 6, 2008) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quantum entanglement and ways to entangle qubits and continues variables have been extensively developed and continue to be at the heart of quantum information processing. While entanglement of atoms and photons is relatively well understood; one still has to go long way in understanding and achieving entanglement of macroscopic systems like Bose Einstein condensates and system of quantum dots. Besides now one has to think of important applications of the new resource that we have at our disposal. We thus propose to develop and study entangled source of matter waves   we propose schemes to produce entanglement of two Bose condensates. Each condensate could be either single component or multi component. This involves multi particle entanglement as we deal with collective coordinates. We further propose to use entanglement for Heisenberg limited interferometry. Note that a recent conference [http://portale.unitn.it/events/interf08/] organized by Aspect, Phillips and others discussed how quantum optics of Bose condensates is a new direction of research. Another novel system that we propose to study is the system of quantum dots which act like super atoms. It is possible to produce a system with two dots where the relative separation between dots could be in the range of few nano meters leading to prominent d-d interaction. We propose to study the quantum entanglement in a double dot system which results from d-d interactions and consider its manipulation by a coherent drive.  &lt;br/&gt; Intellectual Merit of Research. We propose  fundamental studies.  Theoretical models for producing entanglement between two quantum dots or two Bose condensates would be developed. In such systems it is also possible to entangle matter and photonic degrees of freedom. Further newer aspects of such systems emerge by applying the ideas from quantum optics such as squeezing and photon-photon correlations.  &lt;br/&gt; Broader Impact of the Research. Here we propose to continue our earlier collaboration involving the fields of quantum optics and condensed matter physics . We propose to use ideas and techniques from different fields. For example, the master equation techniques from quantum optics should be useful for the study of photon photon correlations in emission from system of quantum dots and in studying decoherence. The idea of collective excitations and projective measurements are appropriate for the study of entanglement of independent Bose condensates. We have active collaboration with our cold atom group. All this would be supplemented by the international collaboration that we have built up during the period of the recent NSF support  (CCF-0524673) which ended in June 2008. An important element of our proposal is to train graduate students in the emerging interdisciplinary area of quantum information science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
