<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided for a service project to collect, quality control, analyze and distribute to all BEST investigators the core chlorophyll-a data.  This project will support one person on each summer cruise.  Data will be freely available on databases at PMEL, NODC, and the Alaska Ocean Observation System (AOOS).  In addition to the service portion of this proposal, the PIs will use the biological data from this proposal combined with a) physical and chemical data collected on spring and summer BEST cruises b) data from a September NPCREP cruise c) data from moorings and from satellite-tracked drifters to address one hypothesis:&lt;br/&gt;The marked difference between the more pelagic southern shelf and the more&lt;br/&gt;benthic northern shelf is a result of the position of the sea-ice edge during the&lt;br/&gt;transition from strong winter winds to milder summer conditions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was funded as a service proposal to provide chlorophyll data to the Bering Sea Ecosystem Study (BEST) program scientists on the summer research cruises in 2008, 2009 and 2010.  For the three years, approximately 240 CTD profiles were taken during each summer cruise that collected a total of almost 7000 water samples that were filtered and analyzed for their chlorophyll a content.  Chlorophylls samples were typically collected from 6 depths (routinely 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 meters), filtered onboard and frozen for later analysis in the laboratory.  Concurrently, approximately 2100 samples were collected to determine the approximate size (i.e., &gt;5 and &lt;5 &mu;m) of the phytoplankton organisms at selected locations.   Approximately 150 additional chlorophyll samples were also collected from the shipÃ†s underway sampling port to calibrate the surface underway fluorescence measurements.  All the chlorophyll data were integrated with the hydrological data and were submitted to data archive.  For safety, the NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Lab in Seattle also archived the data.   Presentations using this data were made at two national/international scientific meetings:  Stoecker, D., K. Blattner, and D. Stockwell.  2010.
