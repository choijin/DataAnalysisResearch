<AbstractNarration>Abstract: EMSW21-MCTP Mathematical &amp; Theoretical Biology Institute Undergraduate Research Program   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mathematical and Theoretical Biology Institute (MTBI) for undergraduate research was established in 1996. The objectives of the Mathematical &amp; Theoretical Biology Institute (MTBI) Undergraduate Research Program are to encourage and facilitate the access to and the successful completion of graduate studies by mostly under-represented minority students in mathematics and science.  The MTBI Summer Program at Arizona State University exposes undergraduates to scientific research by letting them address relevant questions in theoretical biology. The consecutive summer research experiences take place at Arizona State University and lasts 8 weeks. Students receive four weeks of intensive training in mathematical and computational techniques in order to develop and carry out their own research projects during the remainder of the program. The research experience ends with the completion of a formal research paper and public oral and poster presentations of students? findings.&lt;br/&gt;Supporting an environment in which high quality undergraduate research is recognized and expected (MTBI technical reports provide the best examples. Since 1996 MTBI students have produced 120 papers some of which have been published in peer reviewed journals (abstracts and last five years of papers available through our website - http://mtbi.asu.edu/Research.html). MTBI students typically present their work at national conferences. MTBI provides its alumni continued academic encouragement and support throughout their graduate studies and afterwards. Since the program?s inception 153 US alumni have pursued advanced degrees, and 110 (87 URM) have or are pursuing PhDs; 79 (68 URM) have received advanced degrees and 25 (21 URM) have received PhD?s.  MTBI?s summer research activities have been supported with grants from the National Science Foundation and from grants from the National Security Agency. Substantial additional support comes from Arizona State University and from the Sloan Foundation. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The highlight of the institute is an 8-week intensive experience with mentors from around the country and abroad who, together with the students, form a supportive community for ongoing mentorship and support throughout their careers. Students are prepared and supported to enter doctoral programs or a wide range of careers in desperate need of highly trained computational scientists. Through 2013, 69% of the MTBI students had enrolled in graduate or professional programs -- 72% of them were underrepresented minorities.  Students were given the opportunity to participate in national conferences including SACNAS, JMM, MAA-Math Fest and SIAM-Life Sciences conferences and won a number of awards for their work. Each summer, student-led research projects produced a dozen or so technical reports accessible through the MTBI program website.  MTBI has greatly increased diversity at the PhD level in a wide range of STEM disciplines, and particularly in Mathematical Biology. It is conservatively estimated that 50% of the PhDs in mathematical biology awarded to US Latinos each year are going to MTBI alumni.  In recognition of its contribution to increasing the number of mathematically trained graduates, MTBI was recently awarded a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring.
