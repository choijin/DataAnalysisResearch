<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for Dr. Matthew Johnson, Assistant Professor, Department of Wildlife, and Dr. Michael Mesler, Professor, Department of Biological Sciences, Humboldt State University, to provide research experiences for 5 U.S. undergraduate students per year for 3 years to study the interaction of tropical forests and agricultural habitats in Jamaica.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on training students in applied ecological research, investigating how birds and bees provide pest control and pollination services to coffee farms adjacent to forested nature reserves, through a year-long classroom and international field-based learning experience. Students will take a fall class on ecology, research methods and Jamaican culture prior to their 5-week winter research experience in Jamaica. This will be followed by additional class work which includes substantial mentoring in data analysis and writing. Furthermore, students will have the opportunity to present their research at conferences, workshops and through publications. The PI's have included a strong collaboration with Dr. Dwight Robinson of the University of the West Indies, that will involve partnerships between faculty and students, as well as use of lab space, equipment, and assistance in communication with local farmers and Jamaican agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will help advance our understanding of the interaction of tropical forest ecology with agriculture while helping to develop new scientists competent in collaborative international research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Interdisciplinary and international team of students and professors show that birds, bees, and forest habitats are good for coffee farmers.  This project engaged small groups of undergraduate and graduate students in applied ecological research in Jamaica during the winters of 2008-2011.  Previous research had shown that insect-eating songbirds were helping to control economically damaging pests on coffee farms, an example benefit of nature that ecologists call an æecosystem serviceÆ.  This project was aimed at understanding how farmers and agricultural policy makers might attract these birds and the ecosystem they provide to their farms.  By putting small radio transmitters on the birds, the team discovered that most birds commute to roost at night in patches of forest habitat adjacent to the coffee farms.  This finding was important because it linked the delivery of pest control to forests surrounding a farm.  In addition, the team discovered that even when the birds are feeding in the coffee farm, they spend much of their time in trees that grow above the coffee bushes, called æshade trees.Æ  Using sophisticated mathematical models that predict system consequences from the behavior of individual birds, the team documented that intermediate amounts of shade trees optimized the delivery of pest control:  too few shade trees and there are too few birds on the farm, too many shade trees and the birds spend too much time in the tree canopy and do not feed as much on the pests in the coffee bushes.  These results have been published in peer reviewed journals, presented at scientific conferences, and disseminated to agricultural policy makers in Jamaica, who now recommend that coffee farmers maintain 40 shade trees per acre on their coffee farms.  Simultaneously, the team conducted experiments to see if bees help pollinate and increase the fruit set on coffee bushes &ndash; another example of an ecosystem service.  The team confirmed that bees do indeed contribute to coffee pollination and fruit set, but this was accomplished largely by non-native European honey bees, so there was not a strong implication for native bee conservation from this work.  Nonetheless, the experiments do suggest that coffee farmers may benefit from managing bees in the landscapes around their farms.  All of these findings on ecosystem services were made collaboratively, with professors and graduate and undergraduate students from Humboldt State University working in cooperation with entomologists from the University of West Indies and JamaicaÆs Coffee Industry Board.  In addition, several undergraduate students conducted smaller complementary projects while contributing to the overall research program described above.  Several of these projects led to significant findings.  For example, one student conducted an experiment with stuffed bird decoys to invite territorial responses in birds, and he confirmed that birds are able to recognize variation in the supply of insects within their territories, most aggressively defending areas with the most abundant insects.  Another student documented that a small nectar-feeding Jamaican bird, the bananaquit, builds and roosts nocturnally in dome-like structures to conserve heat loss.  Other students examined the species composition of birds in relation to habitat variables, the relationship between fat on birds and shade on coffee farms, the foraging behaviors of birds in coffee bushes versus shade trees, and insect abundance in coffee, shade trees, and forest habitats.  All of these projects led to undergraduate theses, conference presentations, and several led to manuscripts that are currently in review process and may soon be published in peer-reviewed journals.
