<AbstractNarration>CSR-DMSS, SM: DoC - Distributed Opportunistic Computing (0834493)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to carry out preliminary, fundamental research work in the area of opportunistic computing. When pairs of devices come within each others? communication range, opportunistically, short-lived links (or opportunistic links) are created. Opportunistic computing exploits the opportunistic links created by pair-wise contacts, to share information content, resources and services, leading to a wide variety of applications. Groups of computing nodes and their associated pair-wise contacts in an opportunistic network give rise to a distributed opportunistic computing system. Essentially, opportunistic computing can be described as distributed computing with the caveats of intermittent connectivity and delay tolerance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The novelty of the proposed work lies in the exploitation of opportunistic communication contacts to provide collaborative computing services to applications and users. The unique contributions of this project include the development of an adaptive protocol for opportunistic communication in support of computing, a middleware architecture for masking the disruptive nature of the underlying network from applications and users, and a mechanism for delay tolerant, remote execution of tasks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will lead to tangible contributions to the improvement in human quality of life and make significant impact on Internet based applications, computer science and engineering. The project outcomes have relevance to applications in crisis management situations, entertainment, transportation, education and military. In general, the outcomes of this project have broad applicability in such areas as entertainment, health care, transportation and automobiles, military and education. Research findings will be incorporated into graduate and undergraduate courses. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
