<AbstractNarration>The overall objective of this IT Start proposal is to gather information that will enable us to devise a comprehensive plan to support and empower the growing number of female STEM faculty at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. Our goal is to develop an effective plan for institutional transformation that is data-driven, institution specific, and broadly sustainable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cal Poly is a predominantly undergraduate, comprehensive institution with an enrollment of approximately 18,700 students, the vast majority of whom are in technical fields. Nationally, Cal Poly plays a major role in STEM education, graduating the largest cohort of engineering degrees of any non-PhD granting institution in the country last year (974 BS degrees); many Cal Poly STEM department and programs are nationally ranked. Yet despite a reputation for excellence, the university does not successfully retain a diverse student body, especially in engineering: while the national average for undergraduate women in engineering is 17.2%, Cal Poly only enrolls 14% women. As part of its mission to prepare the scientific and technical leaders of the twenty-first century, Cal Poly is committed to increasing the diversity of STEM faculty. A diverse faculty will create a more welcoming climate and transform the experiences of Cal Poly students who study in STEM areas. And, given the prominence of Cal Poly in many technical fields, effectively supporting our female STEM faculty will have broad impact on diversity within the STEM disciplines nationwide, as well. The absence of significant diversity among STEM faculty has been an ongoing challenge for Cal Poly. However, the institution has lacked the resources needed to systemically address those concerns. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several factors make this the ideal time to assess our institution and design a plan for sustainable change. The leadership is dedicated to comprehensive transformation and has committed resources to support this assessment project. Additionally, current university-wide preparations for reaccreditation are strongly focused on campus diversity and will provide opportunities for institutional self-study. Moreover, waves of faculty retirements are in progress and will continue: 46% of the tenured faculty are over 55 years of age. It is urgent that we understand how to support the retention and leadership development of the many new female STEM faculty that recently have been (and will be) hired. This is the right moment to design and implement institutional changes that will transform Cal Poly into a polytechnic university that attracts and retains diverse faculty and students. [Broader Impact]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our current plan has merit because it identifies and utilizes the expertise of key faculty, engages the institution at every level, and is supported by executive administrators, college leaders, and the leaders of faculty-lead initiatives, both in principle and by allocation of resources. We have three central goals: 1) Develop and refine an institutional infrastructure that will administer our assessment efforts and coordinate existing climate-related initiatives. 2) Assess the current status of women STEM faculty at Cal Poly. 3) Establish "institutional mentoring" relationships with existing ADVANCE institutions.
