<AbstractNarration>Abstract: Sustainability Science for Sustainable Schools&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project teams faculty and graduate-student researchers from Arizona State University?s School of Sustainability with high-school teachers, students, and administrators to address the challenge of becoming a ?sustainable school.? &lt;br/&gt;Fellows, guided by faculty members, will help teachers and students use scientific methods and tools to collect data on sustainability indicators on food, energy, water, waste, landscaping, and quality of life at their schools. Students will collect, analyze, and graphically represent scientific data and then communicate their findings and solutions at community forums and science fairs. &lt;br/&gt;?Sustainable Schools? will influence the curriculum and practices of three large school districts in Greater Phoenix. School districts, teachers, and students across many city boundaries will gain access to original research in a new and exploding field of inquiry of sustainability science.&lt;br/&gt;In turn, the K-12 community will greatly assist graduate students in the world?s first School of Sustainability. The project will: 1) enhance graduate training and career trajectories; &lt;br/&gt;2) sharpen collaboration, problem-solving, and interdisciplinary skills in real-world contexts; &lt;br/&gt;3) empower Fellows to be better teachers by training them in curriculum and science-based instruction; 4) help school districts integrate sustainability research into curriculum and operations; 5) improve teachers? ability to integrate sustainability concepts into their teaching; 6) expand teachers? ability to develop interdisciplinary curriculum; 7) increase awareness of high-school students about global and local sustainability challenges and encourage them to pursue careers in science, engineering, math, and technology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF-funded GK-12 program entitled Sustainability Science for Sustainable Schools (S4) at Arizona State University was designed to include graduate students, high school teachers and sustainability researchers working together to incorporate sustainability science into local high schoolsÆ curriculum, campuses, and larger communities by developing and implemented sustainability projects. By teaching sustainability science to high school students, our goal was to help promote a sustainable future for the Phoenix metro area.  Over the course of the S4 program, a total of 38 fellows, engaged directly with 21 schools across 5 districts, and partnered with over 100 teachers across 30 teaching discipline areas in dedicated work on sustainability science focused on curriculum, campus and community engagement projects. Additionally, fellows shared sustainability science with a variety of community groups such as Big Brothers/Big Sisters through outreach events. Our program evolved to become a reliable vehicle for graduate fellows to successfully vision, design, and co-develop program plans and charters with their schools and teaching teams in order to advance innovative processes, and for development of sustainability projects and long-lasting products that spanned the curriculum, campus and community.  Over the course of a year each school completed at least one, but more typically 2 to 4 sustainability projects ranging from school-wide "no impact weeks" to creating school gardens to establishing on-going recycling programs.     The main objectives of the program were to:  1) Increase integration of sustainability science into high school instruction.  Graduate fellows worked with teachers and district leadership to engage in delivery of interdisciplinary curriculum and project-based learning. Fellows brought state-of-the-art sustainability science research to teachers to strengthen STEM teaching, which in turn advanced the STEM skills of high school students.  2) Expand university outreach and relationships with high schools.  Partnerships were developed with high school districts to strengthen the delivery of STEM education and build the capacity of teachers and students to implement sustainability projects.  3) Enhance fellowsÆ graduate experience and career trajectories.  Graduate fellows were exposed to real-world experiences that enhanced their training and career trajectories. Weekly work in the classroom was supplemented by outreach activities to public and private entities, allowing fellows to gain experience presenting sustainability content to a wide range of audiences.  4) Improve graduate studentsÆ communication and teaching skills.  Graduate students were empowered to be better sustainability educators through training in curriculum development and collaborative instructional strategies. Fellows worked in interdisciplinary teams and honed their skills in communication, collaboration, problem solving, conflict resolution and project management.  Formal program evaluation indicated that the S4 program offered high quality services to both graduate students and the K-12 community that consistently met the objectives specified in the original proposal.
