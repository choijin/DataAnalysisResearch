<AbstractNarration>[This proposal is part of a funded CRP from the EuroCORES HumVIB competition.]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can electoral institutions overcome the political consequences of social exclusion and poverty? What role did political parties play in incorporating the working classes into the electorates of European democracies? And, why are so many Americans, particularly the working and lower middle people, still alienated from participation in their countrys electoral processes? This research begins with the premise that these questions reflect different perspectives on the same political phenomenon: The context of electoral competition especially the rules governing legislative elections and their interactions with the geographic distribution income shapes the incentives of political actors to mobilize and incorporate low-income and working-class citizens. The proposed research contributes to a recommended Collaborative Research Proposal from the EuroCORES HumVIB competition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earlier accounts of the relationship redistributive policy emphasize a stark division between multimember district (MMD) electoral rules and single-member district (SMD) rules (e.g., Iversen &amp; Soskice 2006, Persson &amp; Tabellini 2000). These accounts, however, miss the important modifying effect of electoral context - specifically, the geographic distribution of citizens of different types - on the effect of electoral rules in structuring legislators' policy-making incentives. The intellectual merits of this proposal lie, therefore, in the recognition that given the national context in which elections are held - in particular, the geographic distribution of income - the electoral institutions of contemporary democracies may undermine the opportunities for those societies to achieve their democratic ideals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of a European Science Foundation Collaborative Research Scheme (EUROCORES), the proposed research will contribute to a broadly collaborative and highly integrated project that is motivated by questions about voter turnout. The proposed research will contribute to the theoretical development and data collection exercises of this larger project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This project began with the intuition that three questions -- Can electoral institutions overcome the political consequences of social exclusion and poverty? What role did political parties play in incorporating the working classes into the electorates of European democracies? Why are so many Americans, particularly the working-class and low-income citizens, still alienated from participation in their country?s electoral processes? --- are really about the same phenomenon.  Specifically, this project investigated the ways in which the electoral geography of income structures the incentives of legislators and parties to represent the interests of a low-income constituency.    In the end, by focusing of low-income voters, this project was able to provide an innovative explanation for why parties represent some groups and not others--- a major, outstanding question in political science--- and offers empirical support for the following claims:  1.  Contemporary electoral geography matters for the quality of political representation.   Policies tend to favor those groups that are more frequently pivotal in the election of legislators.  Specifically, when low-income voters are potentially more frequently pivotal (e.g., form the numerical majority of their single-member districts) in election, levels of social spending tend to be more generous.  Even single-member district electoral rules can create incentives for legislators to mobilize a low-income constituency and to be responsive to its interests.    2. Parties represent groups who were favored by historical changes in electoral geography.  (a)  New parties enter electoral competition following changes in electoral geography, or the geographic distribution of groups across districts, that favor a particular group, especially when that group is excluded from local partisan networks and is ripe for mobilziation. The political entrepreneurs who bare the costs of organizing new parties  tailor their appeals to these newly pivotal groups.     (b)  At least around the turn of the 20th century, in the US, migration and immigration created electoral opportunities in mostly rural districts and, as a consqeuence, new parties tailored their appeals to agricultural workers.  In other countries, predominantly in Europe, migration (and exogenous suffrage expansion, in the case of Sweden and Norway) concentrated newly arrived or newly eligible voters in districts with large industrial sectors.  As a consequence, the appeals of new parties more often reflected the industrial workers' interests.  What this evidence suggests is that new parties result from changes in their electoral opportunity structures, that are created by changes in electoral geography, rather than from the emergence of new demands or grievances.  This account of new party formation has the advantage of linking earlier accounts that major social changes, to those that emphasize the importance of institution, by making concrete the cost-benefit analysis of political entrepreneurs.  As a consequence, the argument offered by this research can account for the overall stability of party systems, the timing of of new party entry, and the nature of new parties' appeals.   This research, therefore, offers an innovative perspective on the nature of party systems, and more generally, on the quality of representation in contemporary democratic societies.  This Project supported the extensive historical data collection that provides the empirical foundation of a major book project, Who Speaks for the Poor?  Electoral Geography, Party Entry, and Representation (Cambridge Series in Comparative Politics, Cambridge UP, 2017). This Project also supported the collection of data that describe the contemporary electoral geography of income, in the US, in the American states, and in a subset of contemporary democratic societies.
