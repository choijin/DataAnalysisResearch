<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site at the University of New Orleans (UNO) provides research experience for undergraduates in the area of integrated sensing and data processing for surveillance missions and automated scene understanding. The project recruits groups of diverse and talented undergraduate students from around the nation to actively engage in this cutting-edge Integrated Sensing and Automated Scene Understanding (ISASU) research, and to enhance the Electrical Engineering program at UNO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The participants are  performing research that is expected to  impact the field of ISASU, as well as  other associated scientific disciplines  such as Image Processing,&lt;br/&gt;Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition, Computer Vision, Bioinformatics, Data Mining, Knowledge Discovery, Automated Decision Making &amp; Planning, and Information Fusion, among others. The REU PIs have extensive expertise in ISASU, as evidenced by their publications and current funded support. The student projects address cutting-edge research themes, directly stemming from the PIs? current research, and the PI has significant experience in student advising, as evidenced by the large number of graduate and undergraduate advisees. The proposed REU experience is expected to be successful in training undergraduates in ISASU; the goal is for this work to lead to significant results in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The recruitment plan, in conjunction with strong commitment from faculties at affiliated institutions attracts undergraduate students, including females and under-represented groups, to the REU UNO site. The project engages in total a diverse group of 30 students, and two graduate students who will be involved in undergraduate teaching, research and mentoring activities. The REU research results will be published in peer reviewed conferences, and potentially, technical journals. These REU research advances are fed back and integrated into the teaching of related courses at UNO, and/or affiliated institutions. Finally, the project leverages industrial contacts through the Information and Systems Technology Research Center (IST-RC) and UNO?s Research and Technology Park.</AbstractNarration>
