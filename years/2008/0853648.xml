<AbstractNarration>0853648&lt;br/&gt;M. Solomon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gels of colloidal particles are systems with slow, constrained dynamics and unusual, viscoelastic rheology. They are central to the chemical processing of ceramics, the formation of membranes for microfiltration and the quality of paints, finishes, coatings and consumer products.  Next generation technologies such as direct-write assembly and microfluidic valving also rely on the gelation transition and the rheological properties of colloidal particle gels. A unifying feature of these technologies is their dependence on the fact that gels yield if a stress or strain of sufficient magnitude is applied. This yielding is a poorly understood convolution of colloid pair interactions and gel microstructure. Yielding has features common with mechanical failure: a dramatic rheological transition results in fluidization of the previously rigid material. Recently, substantial progress has been made in both experimental description and theoretical explanation of the origin of&lt;br/&gt;gelation. However, from the point of view of engineering design and practice we require more: we must also understand stress-induced yielding, rupture and fluidization. Whether our interest is to produce a microfluidic valve that will open at a critical stress, or a detergent that will remain homogeneous and stable over its product life, we should address: What is the sequence of events that leads to gel rupture and internal failure upon application of strain and how does manipulating gel structure affect this sequence? How do these transitions feedback into suspension microdynamics to determine the local yield rate? How does an applied strain induce evolution of the stress bearing backbone of a gel network? To address these scientific questions, we will execute a research program to directly visualize strain-induced yielding and internal failure in gels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of our research plan arises from our comprehensive application of confocal optical microscopy in pursuit of these aims and our development of novel, well posed methods to induce yielding in colloidal gels and study its implications. First, the power of confocal microscopy rests on its ability to directly visualize local, colloid-level structure and dynamics in three dimensions (3D) and with nanoscale resolution. Since yielding is a local phenomena, the direct visualization methodology is a key strength of our approach. Second, we recognize that previous attempts to visualize internal failure and rupture of gels have foundered because the nonideality of shear banding was encountered. Because shear banding is particular to the flow geometry studied, it does not directly characterize yielding, an intrinsic material property of broad fundamental interest. To address this issue, we will directly visualize yielding by high-rate stepstrain deformation. The literature and our prior work demonstrate that this flow avoids shear banding by generating homogeneous yielding and rupture of colloidal gels. In this project, we seek to extend fundamental understanding to the microscopic scale by probing the step-strain induced rupture of gels comprised of micron-scale sterically-stabilized colloidal poly(methyl methacrylate) in refractive-index and density-matched solvents. Because this system's pair potential interactions are both tunable and well characterized, results for this model system are applicable to the broad range of materials and gel structures encountered in engineering practice. Three tasks will be executed to address the three fundamental questions posed above. Project outcomes will include the first experimental assessment of the local yield rate of a colloidal gel, a key input to the successful soft glassy and model coupling models of gel rheology. This study will broadly impact technology and engineering in diverse areas such as ceramic, membranes, consumer products and direct write assembly by discovering fundamental features of the relationship between gel yielding and microstructure. Additional outcomes with broader impact include: (i) the training of a graduate student in state-of-the-art methods in confocal microscopy, colloidal science and rheology; (ii) development of a new engineering design component for a summer outreach program that introduces middle school girls to chemical engineering and materials science through hands on lab activities and experiments in complex fluids.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has advanced fundamental understanding of the microstructural properties of colloidal gels as they undergo strong, non-linear flows characteristic of industrial processing.  Colloidal gels are dynamically arrested, space-spanning networks of particles formed when the forces between colloids are strongly attractive at small separations. They are used to generate solid-like properties in a broad range of materials such as direct-write inks, tissue engineering scaffolds, and mesoporous membranes. When gels undergo large deformations, their network ruptures into clusters via a complex process known as yielding. The ability to connect these structural changes to suspension rheology is critical to material performance. However, observations of three-dimensional gel structure under conditions useful for testing theories of yielding and rupture are currently lacking.  This project addressed this lack of understanding by performing in situ confocal microscopy visualization of gel structured under strong flows.  Project outcomes in research were principally in three areas: (1) Non-linear elasticity of colloidal gels was found to be strongly correlated with high contact number, locally rigid microstructures, as observed by confocal microscopy; (2) Incorporation of a rough surface onto colloidal particles allowed industrially important parameter to be studied in a model depletion gel system; (3) particle-tracking microheology showed that the localization length of individual, slow, rigid colloids after yielding is highly correlated with the measured non-linear relaxation modulus of the gel.  This project was the principal means of support for one graduate student who will complete her dissertation research within approximately one year.  Two other graduate students were partially supported; both continue their doctoral studies by other means of support.  Each summer of the project, these three students engaged with middle school girls in an outreach program designed to introduce the middle school girls to chemical engineering and materials science and engineering.  Examples of activities performed included setting up of a cornstarch pool for the girls to run on (to demonstrate shear thickening rheology), the creation of a complex fluids laboratory involving the making of oobleck, gak, Boger fluids, and ice cream making, and in the last year, incorporation of molecular gastronomy experiment to show applications of complex fluids to foods.  The broader impact of this project was to show that it is possible to engineer nonlinear elasticity of colloidal gels through careful manipulation of the microstructural rigidity of the system. Moreover, we developed a new series of direct visualization techniques (involving image analysis) and rheological measurements that have broad applicability.  The work suggests new directions for investigating the role of structural rigidity within colloidal soft matter.
