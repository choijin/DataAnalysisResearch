<AbstractNarration>This project is called META: Math, Engineering and Technology Awards Program. META provides scholarships and student support to 105-140 economically disadvantaged students with GPAs of 2.5 or higher. Degrees/certificates targeted include Biotechnology, Microbiology, Forensics, Geology, Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, four Computer Information Systems degrees, Engineering Technology, Engineering Technology for Civil Engineering, Surveying Engineering Technology, Electronics Technology, Computer Electronics Technology, Communications Electronics Technology, Nuclear Electronics, Computer-Aided Engineering Drafting, Computer-Aided Drafting and Design, and Geographic Information Systems. META services include comprehensive academic/career counseling, supplemental instruction/cohort learning communities, tutoring, study groups and STEM club activities in a MESA Center for STEM students, and field trips; scholars meet weekly with faculty, counselors, and/or faculty/peer mentors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;META integrates research on best practices in persistence and retention strategies for disadvantaged students into STEM programs, and advances discovery and understanding about these issues among educators, while promoting teaching, training, and learning through faculty and student training and mentorships. The goal of META is to broaden participation in STEM fields, increasing the number of STEM certificates and associate degrees awarded. With potential to attract and prepare 30-40 predominantly minority students annually to enter four-year STEM programs, META increases the STEM applicant pool, raises the number of individuals employed in technical areas of national need, and attracts new industries to this area.</AbstractNarration>
