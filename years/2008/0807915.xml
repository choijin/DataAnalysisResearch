<AbstractNarration>Wang&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807915&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     During recent years, the energetic phase field approach has&lt;br/&gt;emerged as a successful modeling and simulation method with many&lt;br/&gt;advantages in studying microstructure evolutions.  The idea of&lt;br/&gt;phase field methods is to introduce a set of phase field&lt;br/&gt;variables to implicitly track the moving surfaces of&lt;br/&gt;microstructures, which can be very complex and nonlinear.  In&lt;br/&gt;this project, the investigator and his collaborators apply phase&lt;br/&gt;field methods to study biological microstructures, especially&lt;br/&gt;cell membranes.  The project is mainly concerned with further&lt;br/&gt;analysis on phase field methods, and the broadening of&lt;br/&gt;applications in studying the evolution of biological&lt;br/&gt;microstructures for which phase field methods and related&lt;br/&gt;concepts can be used as a basis for more convenient or efficient&lt;br/&gt;treatments.  The project includes modeling, numerical methods,&lt;br/&gt;and theoretical analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator studies some theoretic and algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;problems in phase field methods that still remain unsolved or&lt;br/&gt;partly unsolved today, such as asymptotic behavior of phase field&lt;br/&gt;variables (which is related to the De Giorgi conjecture), the&lt;br/&gt;consistency of the fluid coupled phase field model to the sharp&lt;br/&gt;interface model, topological information retrieval formulations,&lt;br/&gt;and convergence and acceleration of some popular algorithms.  He&lt;br/&gt;also applies the theoretical results to the modeling and&lt;br/&gt;simulation of some complex microstructure systems, especially&lt;br/&gt;cellular adhesion and rolling in a shear flow, which can be used&lt;br/&gt;in the study of blood flows.  Cell motility is another complex&lt;br/&gt;biological phenomenon that can be simulated using phase field&lt;br/&gt;models.  Also considered is the simulation of acto-myosin driven&lt;br/&gt;cell oscillations, which can be applied to study cell division&lt;br/&gt;and migration, two of the most important functions of living&lt;br/&gt;cells.  Besides simulating some observed phenomenon, phase field&lt;br/&gt;models can also be applied to predict details of some structures&lt;br/&gt;that are not yet fully known, such as highly folded membranes. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
