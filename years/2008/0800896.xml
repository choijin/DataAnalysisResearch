<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this award is to take a systematic and integral approach to study interfaces in SWNT reinforced nanocomposites, using combinations of Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) based testing platforms, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The proposed research involves the following tasks, (1) Development of novel, versatile and reliable MEMS based testing platforms to perform nanotube pull-out experiments for quantitative characterization of interfacial interaction between (a) SWNT and epoxy matrix, (b) SWNT and PDMS matrix, (c) SWNT and Au matrix; (2) Quantitative AFM study in both normal and lateral mode to provide direct and accurate assessment of adhesion and friction forces between the above mentioned reinforcement/matrix interfaces, in particular after the occurrence of de-bonding events; (3) Investigation of modified SWNT/matrix interfaces by different sidewall chemical functionalization methods using both the MEMS testing platform and AFM; (4) Theory and MD simulation of the key interfacial structures and relaxation mechanisms between SWNT reinforcement and matrix in correlation with observations from the experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will be a vital step towards fundamental understanding of the physical nature of interfacial behaviors in nanocomposites, which in turn will enable the design of synthetic nanocomposites for improved mechanical performance. Graduate students and under-represented undergraduates will be recruited to work on this cutting-edge research, and will be given opportunities to present their results at research conferences and to local communities. Founded by the PI, the newly established Paslay Nanoscale Science and Engineering Educational Lab at Rice University will serve as a platform for outreach activities involving high school students and science teachers in greater Houston area, and introduce the findings from this research to the general public. In addition, the insights gained through this research will be effectively disseminated to students affiliate with the Clarkson Aerospace Minority Leader Research and Education Program, which is one of the minority outreach program here at Rice, focusing on Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
