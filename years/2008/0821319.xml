<AbstractNarration>Proposal #: CNS 08-21319&lt;br/&gt;PI(s):  Zhao, Wenbing&lt;br/&gt;  Fu, Yongijian; Sridhar, Nigamanth; Yu, Chansu&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Cleveland State University &lt;br/&gt;  Cleveland, OH 4415-2214&lt;br/&gt;Title:   MRI/Acq.: Acq. of  Equipment to Establish a Secure and Dependable Computing Infrastructure for Research and Education at Cleveland State  University&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project, acquiring server and networking equipment for activities in the area of secure and dependable computing, supports research in enterprise distributed systems, wireless mobile networks, and sensor networks. Projects include&lt;br/&gt;- Byzantine fault tolerance for long-running, nondeterministic systems,&lt;br/&gt;- Performability in wireless mobile networks, and&lt;br/&gt;- Hybrid emulation of wireless sensor networks.&lt;br/&gt;Novel methods are sought for providing Byzantine fault tolerance to long-running, nondeterministic distributed systems. Performance in highly stressed mobile wireless network is investigated in terms of high node mobility and strong interference, as is understanding of nodes? boundary behavior under extreme conditions seeking novel methods to survive the stress via cooperation. Lastly, a novel framework for hybrid emulation of wireless sensor networks is proposed to enable affordable experimentation at scale. The instrumentation consists of a cluster of servers connected by a managed high-speed switch forming a dynamically-configurable distributed computing testbed, servers to join the PlanetLab Consortium, and networking equipment to connect the testbed with an existing wireless network testbed. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;This project should have broad impact on security and dependability education. The tools and methodologies produced will be used by collaborators both in academia and industry (e.g., factory automation and highway work-zone safety).  The infrastructure and outcomes will be integrated with the education curriculum; courses on fault tolerant computing and performance analysis will be developed. Moreover, the team collaborates with high schools providing research experience for teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The research outcomes in the first research area include:  The design and implementation of a Byzantine fault tolerance framework that is capable of handling various replica nondeterministic behaviors and proactively recover itself to support long-running mission critical applications. The design and implementation of a Byzantine fault tolerance framework that enables concurrent execution of clientÆs requests for applications that use software-transactional memory. The design and implementation of a Byzantine fault tolerance framework for Web services business transactions and activities that use complicated system models. The framework significantly reduces the runtime overhead by exploiting the application semantics. The design and implementation of a low latency fault tolerance system for generic distributed applications.
