<AbstractNarration>Though their field was once thought to be reasonably well-understood, astronomers in the massive-star community are now faced with a number of new and fundamental questions about the non-spherical character of stellar mass loss. The nature and extent of wind clumping remains an unsolved problem; recent studies suggest that due to this clumpiness, O star mass-loss rates should be revised downward by an order of magnitude or more. In addition, a growing body of evidence shows that magnetic fields can influence the geometry of mass loss in hot star winds in unanticipated ways. The effects of stellar rotation on the structure and formation of disks around some main sequence and post-main sequence massive stars are still not fully understood. Meanwhile, detailed observations of supernovae reveal that many more core-collapse objects interact extensively with aspherical circumstellar environments than previously realized, and signatures of this interaction may be mined for clues to the mass-loss histories of massive supernova progenitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a comprehensive study of clumpy and aspherical structures in the circumstellar media of massive stars and supernovae. Motivated by access to high-resolution spectropolarimetric data and using an established Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, Drs. Ignace and Hoffman, and their team, will construct simulations of variable line and continuum polarization in the stochastically clumped winds of Wolf Rayet, luminous blue variable, and O stars; in the disks and rotating magnetospheres of other active stars; and in core-collapse supernovae interacting with their immediate environments. They will also develop algorithms that will allow the modeling code to simulate line polarization arising from the Zeeman and Hanle effects from the circumstellar fields of magnetized stars. The investigators have broad experience in both radiation transport techniques and interpreting spectropolarimetric observations of hot star winds and interacting supernovae. By confronting detailed 3D models of these systems with multiwavelength and polarimetric data, the goal is a better understanding of how the mass-loss history of main-sequence and evolved massive stars can be extracted from their observation and those of core collapse supernovae.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes a unique outreach program, Promoting Careers in Science, through which Drs. Ignace and Hoffman will each implement innovative strategies for improving science education and literacy in their respective communities. Dr. Ignace will reach out to school counselors to enhance science education among Appalachian middle- and high-school students. Dr. Hoffman will partner with the University of Denver's Women's College to create new entry points into the scientific career 'pipeline' for non-traditional female undergraduate students. In addition, Dr. Ignace will continue supervising undergraduate research projects both through East Tennessee State University and through involvement in an REU site program. The bulk of the 5-year funding will go to support the training and professional development of a postdoctoral researcher at East Tennessee State University and a graduate student at the University of Denver who will be trained in the theoretical modeling of radiation transfer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Light is polarized.  Many people encounter the term "polarized"  when buying sunglasses.  It turns out that light is comprised of  waves.  We are all familiar with waves such as water waves at the  ocean.  Those waves bounce up and down.  But now think of viewing  the Earth from space.  Our planet is round.  It is largely covered  in oceans as well.  Which way are the waves bouncing?  Suddenly  "up" is no longer simple.  Ocean waves are perpendicular to the  surface of the Earth.  If the Earth were completely covered in  ocean, and the same waves were everywhere around the Earth, then  there is no direction will more or bigger waves.  Although the  ocean-covering Earth picture just described is not quite an accurate  representation, unpolarized light waves can be considered as a  bundle of many waves with equal oscillations in different directions  (but in directions orthogonal to the motion of the light).     The Sun and other stars emit largely unpolarized light.  But there  are ways to cause light to be polarized, which is when the light  has more oscillating waves in some directions than in others.  One  way is through scattering.  Scattering of sunlight by the Earth's  atmosphere gives the sky its blue color and also leads to polarization  of the scattered light.  Sunlight that is scattered off oceans and  puddles on the road tend to produce polarized light, with more waves  oscillating horizontal to the surface.  Polarized sunglasses allow  for the transmission of waves that oscillate in one direction, so  that when worn normally, they cut down the glare from scattered  sunlight.     Research supported by the National Science Foundation for this  project focused in large part on the use of polarization for light  to understand massive stars (the kind that explode as supernovae)  and their environments.  Massive stars are far more luminous than  our Sun and have substantial gaseous stellar wind outflows.  Our  work dealt mainly with the wind outflows, and was often concerned  with the magnetic properties of the stars.     Stars tend to be unresolved objects, meaning that although astronomers  observe their light, stars are so distant that our technology is  generally unable to map their surfaces in pictures.  Instead,  astronomers apply a range of "tricks" to probe the stars despite  imaging limitations.  Polarization represents one "bag of tricks"  used by astronomers.     For example, a property called "circular polarization" is a direct  indicator (via the Zeeman effect) for the presence of magnetism in  a medium and can be used as a tool for measuring stellar magnetism.  Ignace is part of an international team to detect and catalog  magnetic properties of massive stars.  As an example, Ignace took  part in the discovery of two analogues of a famous magnetic massive  star called tau Sco; prior to this discovery, tau Sco was unique  in its unusual properties.  Ignace collaborated with a researcher  at the University of Iowa to develop a better understanding of  circular polarization in features called "spectral lines" that form  in the winds of massive stars.  To date, the telltale signs of  magnetism in wind lines have yet to be measured, but the quality  of observations are becoming better.  Once detected it will be  possible to test our understanding of how magnetism is transported,  via wind outflows, from their stellar atmospheres (where magnetism  is easier to detect) to the surrounding interstellar environment.     Ignace also employed different methodologies for use with linear  polarization.  One application involved Faraday rotation for radio  light polarization.  Ignace investigated polarization mapping across  "astrospheres", bubbles formed by stellar winds that blow into their  surrounding interstellar environment.  The initial work focused on  simulations of polarization mapping for magnetized winds.  Ignace  developed diagnostics for stellar magnetism in stellar atmospheres  and circumstellar disks using...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
