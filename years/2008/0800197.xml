<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to develop and validate a novel modeling and computational platform for optimization of deep-drawing of textured metal sheets. A multi-scale approach will be used to model the directional hardening associated with texture and microstructure evolution during multi-stage forming operations. Emphasis will be placed on the accurate description of the interplay between slip and twinning and its effect on the macroscopic response for complex strain paths. By using the developed directional hardening models in conjunction with finite-element formulations, non-circular convolute blank design solutions will be proposed. To reduce the computational time, an iterative constant strain-based optimization method will be used. The design optimization solutions based on the developed analytical and numerical models will be experimentally validated in partnership with ALCOA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will address important strategic needs of the US manufacturing industry for more aggressive products designs, for decrease in cost of components, and in reduction to the time to market of new products. Specifically, the application of the proposed anisotropic models will improve forming of otherwise difficult to fabricate advanced light-weight materials such as aluminum alloys and magnesium alloys. Verification and validation of the new mathematical tools will allow the designer to assess the behavior of a given alloy during the finite element analysis phase of the design process and thus reduce the lead time. Environmental benefits are anticipated through the increased recycling of lightweight materials in the rigid-packaging industry. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
