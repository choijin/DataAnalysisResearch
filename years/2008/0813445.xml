<AbstractNarration>DMS-0245606&lt;br/&gt;Vogan, David A.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Arthur's Conjecture, Spectural Theory, and Analytic Number Theory in Higher Rank&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The proposal concerns two problems with applications to&lt;br/&gt;automorphic forms.  The first problem is in representation theory:&lt;br/&gt;it is a conjecture in local harmonic analysis that is&lt;br/&gt;motivated by taking Arthur's conjectures together with results&lt;br/&gt;of Burger, Li and Sarnak. This problem is of interest as a&lt;br/&gt;question in representation theory; it also offers a testing&lt;br/&gt;ground for Arthur's conjectures and affords the possibility&lt;br/&gt;of a better understanding of the automorphic spectrum. The&lt;br/&gt;second problem is to study analytic number theory in the context&lt;br/&gt;of automorphic forms on groups of higher rank.  The dream goal of&lt;br/&gt;this is a better understanding of higher moments of L-functions,&lt;br/&gt;but there are a number of easier and concrete problems, such as&lt;br/&gt;the development of large-sieve inequalities, whose solution would&lt;br/&gt;also have immediate consequences for analytic number theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project concerns two questions in the field of&lt;br/&gt;``automorphic forms.'' This is a relatively new field of mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;guided by the Langlands program -- it seeks to establish&lt;br/&gt;connections between certain (apparently) far-separated&lt;br/&gt;areas of mathematics. These connections have allowed work in&lt;br/&gt;automorphic forms to have a significant impact in other fields.&lt;br/&gt;Many cryptographic algorithms -- necessary for secure communication&lt;br/&gt;over the Internet --  are based on&lt;br/&gt;very subtle properties of prime numbers, and underlying&lt;br/&gt;many of these algorithms are difficult results from analytic number&lt;br/&gt;theory and automorphic forms. Another application&lt;br/&gt;of automorphic forms has been the construction of ``Ramanujan graphs''&lt;br/&gt;-- these are graphs with remarkable connectivity, and have had&lt;br/&gt;application to communication networks and to theoretical computer&lt;br/&gt;science. The questions under consideration will deepen&lt;br/&gt;our understanding of automorphic forms. In addition&lt;br/&gt;to the type of application just discussed,&lt;br/&gt;these questions lie at the intersection of different fields of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, and will encourage collaboration between experts&lt;br/&gt;in these different fields.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
