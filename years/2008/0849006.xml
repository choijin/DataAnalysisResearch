<AbstractNarration>This Phase II Small Business Innovation Research project is to develop an integrated optical and electrical packaging technique that allows for the precision placement of high density, large arrays of VCSELs, LEDs, or photodetectors coupled with arrays of microlenses. The project extends the limits of integration for device to device pitch, and device counts, of VCSELs and microlenses that have not previously been achieved. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This innovation has immediate application to existing computed radiography, scanning and printing applications. The computed radiography market is $1B annually, and is shared by U.S. and Japanese companies. The proposed innovation enables smaller, more reliable and higher resolution systems. In the long run, the application of precision optical assembly techniques may have an impact on the revolution taking place in chemical, biological and medical analytical instrument and sensing devices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Under this SBIR project , a new laser packaging technology was developed.  The goal was to develop a package that is very small, can easily be mounted on a circuit board, provides heat removal from the laser, and incorporates a lens that is automatically aligned to the laser.     The lasers (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers, or VCSELs) are very small, and unlike other semiconductor they emit from the surface of the chip, and so can be incorporated into wearable, miniaturized, and portable devices.  However, a package, which provides the electrical and optical interface to the laser, must be commensurately small.  Current semiconductor laser packages are large and require hand assembly onto boards.     With SBIR funding, we demonstrated a package that is only 3mm on a side and incorporates an array of 16 lasers.  Lenses are also incorporated into the package that are already precisely aligned to the laser.  The package can be incorporated onto a board with industry standard surface mount techniques.  The packages are fabricated in a large array on a silicon wafer and then sawn apart, so that costs are kept low.  In this project we demonstrated the ability to fabricate the packages on a silicon wafer, deposited the lenses and attached the VCSEL chips while still in wafer form, and then sawed the wafers and demonstrated the ability to mount onto printed circuit boards with industry standard processes.  The attached figure contains a picture of the finished package mounted on a circuit board, with one laser beam activated (the red spot).     This technology can enable new medical devices that incorporate lasers into wearable or implantable devices that require very small size, for continuous monitoring or management of a disease.  The small size also enables very small industrial sensors for better control of manufacturing or movement of materials.  It could also enable precise clocks or optically based medical diagnostic, or environmental sensors to be incorporated into a handheld device such as a cell phone or tablet computer.     Vixar expects to combine this packaging technology with our unique laser technology to address a number of medical, industrial, consumer electronics and military applications.
