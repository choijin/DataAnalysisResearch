<AbstractNarration>In this laboratory-based project, the chemical transformation of biomass burning aerosol (BBA) particles will be studied.  BBA are ubiquitous in the atmosphere, have a source strength of similar magnitude to fossil fuel burning, and can affect the atmosphere on local to global scales.  The overall goal of this project is to obtain a comprehensive picture of the BBA life-cycle by: 1) Determination of the heterogeneous oxidation kinetics and reaction products of BBA with atmospheric trace gases; 2) Evaluation of the photochemical stability of biomolecular markers; 3) Measurement of the photosensitized heterogeneous kinetics and reaction products of BBA; and 4) Implementation of the detailed heterogeneous chemistry of BBA into atmospheric models.  The heterogeneous oxidation kinetics experiments will be carried out with a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) coupled to various flow reactors with samples in the bulk (coated wall) and aerosol phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational objectives involve undergraduate participation in research, development of new curricula, education of middle and high school students and teachers, and increasing diversity in the atmospheric sciences.  Middle and high school students from local school districts, including members of underrepresented groups, will be recruited through Stony Brook University.  The students will participate in an atmospheric sciences summer workshop on campus, which will involve classes, experimental demonstrations, computer simulations, and hands-on field experience such as conducting meteorological measurements and collecting aerosol particles with subsequent analysis in the laboratory.  Subsequent exposure at conferences sponsored by the Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program (C-STEP) will strengthen the students' knowledge and understanding.  A summer workshop will be also be set up to educate secondary school teachers in atmospheric sciences, air pollution, and climate change.  Diversity in atmospheric sciences will be further achieved by mentoring and providing research opportunities to minority and low-income students at the undergraduate level.</AbstractNarration>
