<AbstractNarration>The PI will explore three related projects in tropical geometry, the Schubert calculus, and convexity, through a combinatorial study of matroids, convex geometries, and similar structures. Tropical linear spaces, perhaps the simplest and most fundamental tropical varieties, have a very interesting discrete structure that is far from understood. The first project is the combinatorial study of these and other related objects such as tropical hyperplane arrangements and oriented matroids. The second project is the study of the Littlewood-Richardson numbers of the flag variety, driven by the open questions of computing them combinatorially, and determining when they vanish. The third project explores convex geometries and their role in three contexts: metric spaces of non-positive curvature, tropical geometry, and random processes involving pruning procedures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is driven by the philosophy that many objects, relationships, and procedures in pure and applied mathematics are best understood by studying the rich discrete structures underlying them. The PI will apply this philosophy to various geometric and combinatorial questions which are firmly rooted in pure mathematics, and which are often motivated by and used in concrete applications in optimization and phylogenetics. This research program is the academic backbone of the San Francisco State University-Colombia Combinatorics Initiative, an ongoing teaching and research collaboration between students in these two locations, many of whom are members of underrepresented groups in mathematics. Through joint courses and research projects, students participate in their first international academic experience, while making significant scientific contributions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In many different branches of mathematics and its applications, one can often understand objects by investigating the discrete structures underlying them. This philosophy motivates most of the work in this project. The field of tropical geometry is a prominent manifestation of this strategy: It takes algebraic varieties - fundamental mathematical objects which are difficult to analyze - and 'tropicalizes' them into discrete objects built by gluing flat pieces (polyhedra) together. One then hopes to gather information about the original objects from their tropical counterparts. This has been done successfully in a number of different settings, but the tropical objects that arise are extremely subtle, and the truth is that we know very little about them in general.  Much of the research in this proposal is devoted to understanding some of the simplest tropical objects: the tropical counterparts of linear objects, such as lines, planes, higher linear spaces, and "hyperplane arrangements" (collections of planes). These already have a very interesting and intricate structure, which we have made significant progress in understanding.  One of the main contributions of this project has been to study tropical linear spaces and hyperplane arrangements by investigating their "dual" objects, which are certain "nice" ways of subdividing certain polytopes into smaller pieces. Those subdivisions are almost equivalent objects, and they are more amenable to combinatorial analysis. They had appeared in several contexts in the literature, but had not been studied in great detail from a combinatorial point of view. Combining ideas from matroid theory, commutative algebra, and discrete geometry among others, my collaborators and I have been able to offer several new perspectives, and prove some of the strongest known results on these objects.         As is often the case in mathematical research, unexpected connections with other fields arose in this investigation. In studying tropical linear spaces, we were led to a subtle, and not yet fully understood mathematical structure on the "space of phylogenetic trees", the space of all possible evolutionary trees for a given set of species.  We also studied a related family of spaces called "CAT(0) cube complexes". We gave a complete combinatorial description of those spaces, which allowed us to construct an algorithm to navigate them optimally. These spaces first arose in pure mathematics, but they also appear in numerous "applied" processes (robotic motion planning, phylogenetic tree mutation, moving non-colliding particles on a graph), and our algorithm sheds light on the most efficient way to perform such processes.
