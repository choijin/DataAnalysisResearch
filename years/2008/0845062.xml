<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The responses of a cell to its environment result largely from the movement of signals from receptor proteins on the outer cell surface to the cytoplasm and nucleus. Strict regulation of this signal transduction is crucial for cell survival, differentiation, growth and other activities. However, many aspects of how the cell maintains control of signaling pathways remain unclear. The objective of this project is to reveal new details about the molecular mechanisms that regulate signaling.  Specifically, we will examine signaling mechanisms of the erbB protein family to 1) characterize receptor dynamics and their influence on protein interactions; 2) determine the order and rate of protein recruitment to signaling complexes; and 3) measure the conformational changes that induce erbB activation. Comparisons between normal and mutant erbB receptors that exhibit altered signaling will provide further insight into regulation mechanisms. New imaging techniques and analyses will be developed for the study of dynamic protein events at the molecular level on living cells. This research will result in quantification of protein dynamics at the single molecule level, revealing information that cannot be elucidated by traditional biochemical techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  This multi-disciplinary project will train students in research at the interface of biological and physical sciences.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be introduced to exciting new research in cell biology and fluorescence microscopy through development of a cross-campus light microscopy course.  Working with the Explora Science Center and Children's Museum of Albuquerque, artistically and scientifically compelling videos and presentations based on live cell imaging will be developed.  Explora's visitors include &gt; 60% minority students of all ages, allowing us to reach an underrepresented group in science and providing an ideal forum to introduce the world of cell biology to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is being co-funded by the Cellular Biosystems Cluster and Physics of Living Systems Program.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual merit:  We have focused on signaling by the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) family of membrane proteins.

We simultaneously track, at the single protein level, receptors labeled with differently colored tags, allowing for direct visualization of interactions between individual EGFR receptors and quantification of receptor dimerizaition.  Tracking single proteins involves acquiring a digital time series of the fluorescently labeled receptor.  We have developed sophisticated new analysis routines to extract quantitative parameters about protein diffusion, clustering and interactions times from such movies. Comparison of these parameters between reagents that activate or do not activate receptors revealed that EGFR interactions are stabilized by binding of its ligand (EGF).  These results support the predominant model of EGFR activation, but this is the first time that dimerization has been directly quantified on living cells.  We also compared normal EGFR with oncogenic mutants and have shown that the tumorigenic activity of two Non-small Cell Lung Cancer EGFR mutants can be linked to stable dimer formation in the absence of ligand that is a result of structural changes in the protein.

The imaging probes and techniques developed here are useful for the study of many different membrane proteins in living cells, thus opening up new avenues of basic and translational research on signal transduction.   Broader Impacts: A major activity for the grant was to develop outreach projects for high school age students.  This included creating educational videos targeted at high school students and featuring the use of microscopy to study cell biology.  Two educational videos (in English and Spanish) are posted at http://stmc.health.unm.edu/education/educational-videos.html and are freely available for download.  We have also developed and participated in outreach activities at two local high schools.  These involved visiting the classrooms, giving presentations, assisting students in activities focused on microscopy and providing tours of the UNM facilities.  Lidke has trained several URM students (undergraduate and high school) as part of this project.  Lidke           Last Modified: 01/31/2016       Submitted by: Diane Lidke]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
