<AbstractNarration>This project has four key focus areas which are designed to &lt;br/&gt;provide opportunities for student learning, retention and success. The Outreach component &lt;br/&gt;targets the K-12 system to foster science exploration and success with the ultimate goal of &lt;br/&gt;increasing the number of students choosing STEM science careers. At the college level, the &lt;br/&gt;project will increase enrollment of STEM science majors through the development of new &lt;br/&gt;courses and programs. For retention of STEM students, the project will foster increased &lt;br/&gt;opportunities for student success.  To increase completion/transfer/four year graduation &lt;br/&gt;rates, TMCC will initiate partnerships with four year schools to upgrade its curricula, initiate joint &lt;br/&gt;research and aid students in developing familiarity with four year schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will conduct an in-depth review and revision of the existing &lt;br/&gt;TMCC science courses.  This effort meets two critical needs: enhancing student learning by &lt;br/&gt;providing more hands-on activities and ensuring the curricula is consistent with the standards at &lt;br/&gt;four year schools.  In the latter area, the project will foster partnerships between the college and &lt;br/&gt;four year colleges.  These partnerships are expected to bridge the rural isolation experienced by &lt;br/&gt;the TMCC faculty and provide four year school familiarity to students prior to transfer. &lt;br/&gt; As this project is the demonstration of how involvement in learning impacts student &lt;br/&gt;achievement and career choices, it is applicable not only in STEM subjects but across the &lt;br/&gt;curriculum.  The current literature suggests student learning is heavily impacted by how &lt;br/&gt;engaged the student is in the learning process.  Using a results driven approach, the project will &lt;br/&gt;identify what enhancements positively impact student learning not only at the college level, but &lt;br/&gt;across the continuum of education.  The results of this project can be replicated not only at the &lt;br/&gt;college level but in K-12 Native American programs. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
