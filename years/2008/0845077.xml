<AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 0845077         PI: Boutis,Gregory             ORG: CUNY-York College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: CAREER: Integrating Education and Research in NMR Structure-Function Studies of Mechanically Strained Elastin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  The goal of the proposed research effort is to integrate research and education in NMR structure-function studies of elastin, a remarkable biopolymer that confers elasticity to many vertebrate tissues.  Combining high resolution Q-space imaging, deuterium quadrupolar echo spectroscopy and double quantum filtered NMR experiments, the complex morphology and interaction with water that confers elasticity to elastin will be studied.  Q-space imaging is an experimental method for directly measuring the probability of displacement of nuclear spins in a confining structure.  State of the art technology has been developed recently in the PI?s laboratory allowing for noncommercial pulsed gradient fields on the order of 20,000 G/cm that can be delivered to a sample approximately 2 mm3 in volume in a standard NMR magnet.  Important characteristics of elastin, such as the surface to volume ratio and surface tension of pores that confine mobile water molecules within single elastin fibers can be readily probed with this technology.  Double quantum filtered NMR experiments of deuterium hydrated samples will allow for additional probe of anisotropic motion and local order of water in elastin.  In addition, quadrupolar echo spectroscopy of deuterium labeled elastin mimetic peptides will provide for a concomitant measurement of molecular dynamics, such as backbone motion and side-chain flips over time scales ranging from 10-7 s to 10-3 s.  Together, these studies will be used to probe the complex structure-function relationship of elastin, as a function of deformation, to give insight into the morphology and interaction with water that imparts elasticity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  The proposed work promises to open a new window into the role of water in determining the dynamics of protein conformational change.  The PI works in the setting of a urban university campus with a 62% minority and 69% female student population.  He has already demonstrated his ability to engage undergraduate students from these groups in a high caliber research operation that will certainly help to prepare them to join the ranks of STEM scientists.  The PI also has access to a diverse group of graduate research students through the city-wide CUNY graduate center.  The PI has also demonstrated a strong and effective commitment to K-12 outreach, and he takes appropriate advantage of institutional resources in the city and university to connect with students and teachers at the K-12 level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
