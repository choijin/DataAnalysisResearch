<AbstractNarration>This proposal creates a Diffusion and Evaluation Center for the Research in Education and Evaluation in Science and Engineering (REESE) program.  Specifically, this Center: &lt;br/&gt;1. Provides support and capacity building opportunities for the REESE PIs through technical assistance that strengthens methodological and analytic approaches;&lt;br/&gt;2. Creates opportunities for dialogue and interaction through PI and other themed meetings, online resources, and provides mechanisms for PIs to share instrumentation, data and findings;&lt;br/&gt;3. Produces studies and reports based on various aspects of the REESE portfolio through (in consultation with NSF) identifying criteria to assess the rigor of studies and provide information on the effectiveness of the program and the studies it supports; &lt;br/&gt;4. Summarizes key findings of REESE projects to various audiences such as researchers, policymakers, and practitioners; &lt;br/&gt;5. Contributes to the creation of an evaluation framework for the REESE program, and&lt;br/&gt;6. Conducts original research on salient issues related to the portfolio.</AbstractNarration>
