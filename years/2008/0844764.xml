<AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry will support the CAREER development plan of Prof. Jennifer Shumaker-Parry of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah. Prof. Shumaker-Parry and her students will develop and study unique plasmonic architectures with optical properties that may be tailored through organized assembly and controlled fabrication methods. Fundamental studies of the correlation of optical properties with structure shape and assembly will form a basis for tailoring and optimizing these plasmonic systems as enhanced platforms for sensing and spectroscopy applications. The research will provide multidisciplinary training for graduate and undergraduate students. Prof. Shumaker-Parry also will integrate research in nanomaterials and spectroscopy with educational activities focused on development of a week-long module for a summer scholars program for in-coming freshman women interested in math and science careers and a mentoring program for local middle school Mathematics Engineering Science Achievement (MESA) clubs to encourage minority and female students to continue on a STEM-based track into high school and in their careers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This NSF Career Award supported research focused on tailoring the physical properties of metal nanostructures to control the optical properties. The research led to design guidelines for controlling the spectral range of the plasmonic response of metal nanostructures.

Because surface chemistry drives particle stability and is essential for controlling behavior in applications, studies of the citrate at gold nanoparticles has implications for a broad range of applications of these nanomaterials. The research on tailoring the optical properties of plasmonic antennas has implications for the very broad range of applications relying on light-matter interactions, including biological and chemical sensing, new platforms for solar energy conversion, plasmon-driven chemistry for photocatalysis, and medical applications in nanomedicine for drug delivery and localized phototherapeutics.&nbsp;Through the studies, graduate students and undergraduate students gained expertise in synthesis, fabrication methods, materials characterization, surface analysis and spectroscopy studies.

Graduate and undergraduate students learned to communicate research findings through manuscript preparation and poster and oral presentations at local, national, and international conferences. Educational activities were developed for multiple groups, including female undergraduate students in the College of Science ACCESS Program at the University of Utah, MESA Clubs in the Salt Lake City School District, and elementary student groups. A week-long set of activities was developed and implemented in a summer program that is part of the ACCESS experience for in-coming freshman women with the purpose of providing the women with an interdisciplinary experience.
