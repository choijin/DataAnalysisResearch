    <AbstractNarration>This project will create a discipline-specific, well-designed program focusing on women&lt;br/&gt;in atmospheric science/meteorology to create leaders for advancement.&lt;br/&gt;The emphasis during the proposed three-day Atmospheric Science Collaborations and&lt;br/&gt;Enriching Networks (ASCENT) summer workshop program and follow-up reunion&lt;br/&gt;events will be to initiate positive professional relationships, among female faculty of&lt;br/&gt;different ranks and postdoctoral researchers. These individuals will work in teams (each&lt;br/&gt;senior scientist will be paired with two junior scientists) and foster connections.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, while networking with like-minded women scientists, participants will have&lt;br/&gt;the opportunity to explore specific promising practices toward eliminating the "leaky&lt;br/&gt;pipeline," defined by the attrition of women at different stages in their academic careers.&lt;br/&gt;By fostering relationships among women faculty and researchers, ASCENT will&lt;br/&gt;demonstrate a commitment to developing research bases and improve the quality of&lt;br/&gt;collaborative atmospheric research conducted at multiple universities and colleges.&lt;br/&gt;ASCENT has been designed to achieve the following specific goals:&lt;br/&gt;1) Ensure that junior women scientists know about and have access to resources and&lt;br/&gt;people who can help guide them through their career and life path.&lt;br/&gt;2) Encourage positive mentorship and create mentoring opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;3) Learn and teach others about primary obstacles for women in atmospheric sciences&lt;br/&gt;and meteorological fields, and develop or share communication tools to assist in&lt;br/&gt;navigating these obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;4) Meet potential scientific collaborators at other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;In order to ensure success and longevity of the proposed workshop and collaborative&lt;br/&gt;experience, an extensive evaluation program will be implemented. The process will&lt;br/&gt;begin at the initial stage of workshop development; continue throughout duration of the&lt;br/&gt;workshop and past termination to determine long-term outcomes. Evaluation findings&lt;br/&gt;will be disseminated in professional forums, such as conferences or refereed journals.&lt;br/&gt;Throughout these workshops, the organizers will assemble knowledge on techniques&lt;br/&gt;and methodology to strength the participation of women within the fields of atmospheric&lt;br/&gt;science and meteorology. This information will be disseminated to this academic&lt;br/&gt;community via Eos and Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (BAMS).&lt;br/&gt;ASCENT will also produce a bi-annual electronic newsletter to provide summaries of&lt;br/&gt;"lessons learned" and current literature regarding the advancement of women in&lt;br/&gt;geoscience. This newsletter will be sent to all participants in the workshops, the Earth&lt;br/&gt;Science Women's Network (ESWN) list serve, and other interested parties.</AbstractNarration>
