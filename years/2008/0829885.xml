    <AbstractNarration>Computation with Nanomechanical Oscillator Networks&lt;br/&gt;PI: Pritiraj Mohanty&lt;br/&gt;Boston University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Layman Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The neural computing paradigm is inspired by a simple understanding: synchronization of oscillations in a network of individual units in the brain is somehow related to the associative memory and learning functions. This concept of storage and retrieval of complex patterns in the synchronized states of an oscillatory network extends from pattern recognition in the brain to a number of fascinating natural occurring phenomena of synchronization such as the rhythmic blinking of a congregation of fireflies and clock-like beating of pacemaker cells in a human heart. However, practical realization of neurocomputers has been elusive in spite of intense theoretical activity in bio-inspired computing. This research involves the development of a scalable architecture, based on silicon-based nanomechanical oscillator networks as building blocks, towards a hardware implementation of nueorocomputing. Graduate, undergraduate and high school students are trained on advanced concepts of new computing paradigms, nanofabrication and ultra-sensitive mechanical measurements. The students are given a multidisciplinary exposure while undergoing specialized training at the frontiers of technological and scientific advances. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves an experimental approach, which uses nanomechanical oscillator networks as building blocks of a bio-inspired computation paradigm. Drawing on advances and insights from computing in neurophysiological systems, the investigators study a network of nanomechanical oscillators, capable of storing and retrieving information in the synchronized states of the network. This research involves design, modeling, fabrication, and characterization of prototypes of nanomechanical oscillator networks. The investigators study the response of such networks to complex input patterns to determine whether the network is capable of ?learning.? This research involves the education and training of graduate, undergraduate and high school students in a vertically integrated structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-------</AbstractNarration>
