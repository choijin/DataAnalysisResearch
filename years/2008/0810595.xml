<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop smart antimicrobial coatings that will be able to effectively neutralize both vegetative and spore forms of harmful bacteria with at least 3-6 log reductions. The coatings combine two biocidal chemical entities optimized for synergistic impact and operational lifetime advantages. Spore-killing activity is enhanced through the incorporation of a cocktail of known small molecule spore germinants. The coatings will be targeted toward fighting hospital acquired (nosocomial) infections as the first priority, and defense/homeland security applications as the second priority. While the first and best line of defense against nosocomial infections is scrupulous hand washing and diligent cleaning of environmental surfaces, these antimicrobial coatings will help compensate for unavoidable inconsistencies in compliance with recommended protocols. The coatings to be tested here are expected to possess key advantages over emerging commercial antimicrobial coatings that contain silver, and as a consequence, would not be sufficiently biocidal against spores. In the course of this program, fabrication of the coatings will be demonstrated, followed by testing of their ability to germinate and kill bacterial spores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is estimated that as many as 10% of the hospital patients in the U.S. will acquire a nosocomial infection (e.g., 2 million patients a year), at an annual cost of $4-11 billion. In 1995, nosocomial infections contributed to 88,000 deaths in the U.S., and Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) represented a significant portion of the problem. The CDC estimates that there were 400,000-500,000 cases of CDAD in 2004, with an estimated cost of $3,669 per case, or $1.1 billion a year, and an average lifetime cost of $10,970 per person. It is estimated that public health officials would be willing to spend up to 5% of this annual cost ($55 million) on promising new antimicrobial approaches. In addition to their contribution to public health, these coatings are also expected to serve critical needs in defense and homeland security applications, and hence, they will be tested against spores of well known anthrax mimics, including Bacillus subtilis, and the Sterne strain of Bacillus anthracis. Arrangements with the Biomedical Laboratory Diagnostics Program at Michigan State University for biological testing of the coatings will directly facilitate the integration of education and research for an M.S. student.</AbstractNarration>
