<AbstractNarration>Principal Investigators: Dr. M. Denise Dearing, Dr. Kirk Thomas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Number: IOS-0817527&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Functional Genomics of a Dietary Shift in a Mammalian Herbivore: Creosote Feeding in Neotoma lepida&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For mammals that consume plants, one of the greatest challenges in shifting from one diet to another is the detoxification of novel plant toxins.  We propose to advance our knowledge of the mechanisms used by mammalian herbivores by capitalizing on population differences in the feeding behavior of the desert woodrat.  Approximately 11,000 before present, populations of desert woodrats occupying what is now the Mojave desert, underwent a major shift from feeding on a diet of juniper to that of a natural invader, creosote. Populations of woodrats that currently live in the Mojave have adapted to highly toxic creosote as evidenced by their ability to ingest greater quantities of creosote compared to populations that have no prior experience. In this project, the investigators will determine the underlying mechanisms for this difference in ability to process creosote.  The investigators will use a combination of approaches from pharmacology and molecular ecology as well as cutting edge genomics techniques.  The investigators expect to find specific liver enzymes that convey the ability to consume creosote toxins.  The differences in liver enzymes between woodrats may be valuable in explaining differences among human populations in the metabolism of pharmaceutical and nutraceutical compounds.  This work will promote the understanding of how mammals adapt to radical changes in diet after natural climate change.  The data can be extrapolated to predicting how woodrats will respond to current and future climate change.  One of the broader impacts is a contribution to scientific infrastructure in the form of a transcriptome of a non-model organism that will be available to other scientists.  The investigators are committed to scientific outreach and participate in one or more outreach events annually in the community (e.g., science fairs, public lectures).  The project will provide cutting edge, interdisciplinary training for a postdoctoral fellow, graduate students, undergraduates, summer high school students and for an assistant professor from an undergraduate institution. Trainees on this project will come from underrepresented groups in science, e.g., women and ethnic minorities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the greatest challenges confronting mammals that eat plants is the toxins that the plants themselves generate to defend against being eaten.  The mammalian liver produces hundreds enzymes whose primary job is break down these toxins in a process called biotransformation.  The process of biotransformation is the same one engaged by humans to deal with plant toxins in their diet (like caffeine) as well as drugs and accidental chemical contaminants.  We investigated the capacity, specificity and diversity of mammalian liver enzymes using a group of wild herbivores called woodrats.  To explore biotransformation in woodrats, we capitalized on differences in dietary preferences among populations and species of woodrats, some of whom specialize on poisonous plants and others of whom are na&iuml;ve to those plants. (1) We found that, when plant toxins are added to their diet, woodrat populations experienced with a particular plant and its toxins turn their liver enzymes on (or off) in different patterns than animals with no experience. Animals with experience turn on biotransformation enzymes to neutralize the toxins.  Animals with no experience turn on genes associated with stress and self-repair as a result of the damage inflicted by plant toxins. Surprisingly, it does not seem to require manipulating the full complement of biotransformation enzymes to make a toxic plant product safe, but just a couple dozen select enzymes.  This is important because it means that it maybe possible to target only one or a few critical enzymes and change an animalÆs or humanÆs ability to biotransform a toxic compound.  (2) Within the enzymes of interest, one large family called cytochrome P450 (CYP) seems to be of particular importance to woodrats. We pharmacologically blocked the function of CYP enzyme in woodrats fed a diet laced with juniper bush foliage, a plant rich in defense toxins called terpenes.  Woodrats with the CYP enzymes blocked could not eat as much juniper and took much longer to biotransform the juniper toxins that they did eat.  Not having access to the correct biotransformation enzyme exacts a high cost from woodrat herbivores.  (3) We then focused on the genetic basis of one subfamily of CYP enzymes called CYP 2B. We discovered a surprising diversity of CYP2B enzymes in woodrats with a correlating diversity in the predicted function of those enzymes.  Tests of a few of these enzymes revealed that, with changes in just a few of the amino acid building blocks, woodrats are able to biotransform new and different toxic compounds.  This provides a potential mechanistic explanation for how the liver of wild herbivores adapts to the novel toxins from new plants in its diet without having to evolve completely novel genes and enzymes.  (4) Finally, we investigated the potential function of a second biotransformation organ in woodrats:  the nasal epithelium (the outer layer of tissue in the nasal cavity).  In most mammals, there is only a very thin barrier between the brain and the air breathed in as it travels through the nose.  If toxins, often sensed as bad odors like paint fumes, could pass that barrier they could inflict damage directly to the brain itself.  Herbivores that eat toxic plants every day are likely exposed to extremely high levels of volatile plant toxins.  In response, we found that the nasal epithelium of herbivores turns on the same biotransformation enzymes active in the liver to make these toxins safe.  Woodrats exposed to familiar plant odors turn on a different suite of enzymes than those exposed to novel odors, suggesting this is an adaptive, beneficial response, similar to what we found in woodrat livers.   In this work, weÆve drawn from the fields of pharmacology, toxicology, molecular ecology and genomics to approach our questions.  WeÆve learned that the biotransformation process of wild herbivorous mammals is well-adapted to the dietary conditions animals experience in the wild; it is complex but evol...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
