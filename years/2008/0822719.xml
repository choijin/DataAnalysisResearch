<AbstractNarration>This workshop award supports undergraduate and graduate student participation in a week-long linguistics "Mini-Institute" aimed at training members of the next generation of linguistic researchers in state-of-the-art analytic tools and methodologies. The Mini-Institute will take place immediately following the 2008 Linguistic Society of America Summer Meeting (June 10-13, 2008) at The Ohio State University and will complement the students' experiences from the LSA Summer Meeting. At that meeting, students will have the opportunity to present and receive feedback on their research, and to learn about various aspects of the profession through targeted professional development workshops and panels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mini-Institute will enhance the learning experiences of research-oriented students by exposing them to a suite of tools and methods taught by experts. Five workshops will be offered by faculty and researchers from The Ohio State University and other institutions on (i) quantitative methods for linguistics, (ii) corpus-based computational linguistics, (iii) Tones and Break Indices (ToBI) labeling of speech transcripts, (iv) eye tracking, and (v) analytic methods for sociophonetic research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
