<AbstractNarration>0831875 University of Maryland, Baltimore County (lead institution) - Milton Halem &lt;br/&gt;0831358 University of California, San Diego - Sheldon Brown &lt;br/&gt;0831110 Georgia Institute of Technology - David Bader &lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this planning grant proposal is to establish a "Center of Multicore Productivity Research" (CMPR). The CMPR consists of sites at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the University of California, San Diego. The proposed center will develop, test and optimize prototype formulations of computationally intensive applications and systems relevant to industry and government partnering sponsors on emerging multicore processors.  The proposed work addresses a real-world problem, and there is a number of processor-intensive computer processes that can benefit immediately from this technology.  The unifying theme uniting these separate research institutions into a Center for Multicore Productivity Research is their synergistic computational research endeavors in multicore computing, available multicore processor resources and the expertise of their staffs to support the computer science inherent in the parallel processing algorithms that are required to optimize the performance and scalability of intensive computations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of CMPR addresses the future needs of the computer industry as this new multi core processor technology evolves. Breakthroughs in multi core productivity will enable real-time use of more sophisticated artificial-intelligence based control systems, providing additional productivity savings to multiple manufacturing and process industries. All CMPR sites are incorporating multicore computing into their core course curricula, and CMPR plans to significantly expand the number of industry or government organizations sponsoring relevant student research.  CMPR also plans to capitalize on its relationships with local schools to provide opportunities for high school educators and students to participate in projects at the center.  The collaboration with Maryland public schools and the charter school at UCSD are highly innovative.  The Meyerhoff program and the Georgia Tech interaction with Atlanta area HCBUs should provide an excellent source for research students. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
