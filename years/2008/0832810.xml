<AbstractNarration>Communication networks are critically important in the&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of information in today's technological&lt;br/&gt;society.  Several academic disciplines have undertaken&lt;br/&gt;the study of various aspects of their operation, but&lt;br/&gt;an integrated theory of networking has been elusive.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of network optimization theory is to&lt;br/&gt;most effectively use network resources, but recent&lt;br/&gt;work in network coding has demonstrated that a standard&lt;br/&gt;assumption of flow conservation from this theory has&lt;br/&gt;imposed artificial restrictions on the workings of&lt;br/&gt;communication networks.  Network information theory&lt;br/&gt;considers more general models of communication and&lt;br/&gt;offers some bound on the limits of information transfer&lt;br/&gt;in a communication system involving multiple senders&lt;br/&gt;and receivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research fuses aspects of network optimization&lt;br/&gt;theory and network information theory in order to find&lt;br/&gt;and specify new limits of information transfer across&lt;br/&gt;a communication network.  The investigators use the&lt;br/&gt;two-way channel from information theory as a general&lt;br/&gt;model of the transmission medium between neighboring&lt;br/&gt;processors of a communication network and address&lt;br/&gt;fundamental optimization problems pertaining to the&lt;br/&gt;analysis and design of networks of two-way channels.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators seek optimal routing algorithms in&lt;br/&gt;multicast settings and a broad classification of&lt;br/&gt;situations where network coding can or cannot improve&lt;br/&gt;upon routing.  The investigators further aim to&lt;br/&gt;categorize network scenarios in which a bidirected&lt;br/&gt;cut set bound derived using information theoretic&lt;br/&gt;arguments is tight and to explore a network information&lt;br/&gt;counterpart to Kirchoff's law when the bidirected&lt;br/&gt;cut set bound is not tight.  The research also&lt;br/&gt;involves extending the notion of minimal cost flow&lt;br/&gt;as an initial approach to treating quality-of-service&lt;br/&gt;issues and devising networks with least cost or&lt;br/&gt;capacity that meet requirements on information transfer.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
