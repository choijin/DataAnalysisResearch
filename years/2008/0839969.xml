<AbstractNarration>Full center proposal to join the I/UCRC in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0839969 Arizona State University; Jesus Villalobos &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;Arizona State University (ASU) seeks to join as an additional site the I/UCRC in Engineering Logistics and Distribution (CELDi).  ASU should complement CELDi research by focusing on two major areas of research: (i) supporting the development and implementation of efficient and effective International Logistics practices, and (ii) enabling further productivity improvements as well as state-of-art supply chain and logistics practices in the regional industry.  Research housed by the ASU site will contribute to improvements in the cost, quality, and responsiveness of a regional industrial base that is increasingly global. This effort will focus on increasing the relative and absolute competitiveness of this industry, by providing access to leading-edge knowledge, tools, systems, and benchmarking opportunities. The initial activities at ASU will focus on efficient international logistics practices, as well as productivity and cost improvements in production and supply chain operations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center will be a catalyst for the regional economic development and also for increasing the number of students who decide to pursue advanced degrees in logistics and productivity related fields.  Students will not only have direct access to research initiatives at ASU, but will also have the opportunity to interact with students and researchers from other institutions, listen to visiting speakers, and become involved in a variety of projects directly sponsored by CELDi. The center plans to include undergraduate, women and minority students in research teams.  It is anticipated that every project will have at least one undergraduate student participating in it.  ASU has a clear  commitment to diversity.</AbstractNarration>

In this document, we give a brief explanation of the outcomes of the activities funded by the National Science Foundation from two different perspectives: intellectual merit and broader impact. In particular, we use one of the projects funded through CELDi to highlight the outcomes, namely, the project entitled "Forecast and Capacity Planning for NogalesÆ Ports of Entry." Intellectual Merit  A summary of the outcomes related to intellectual merit include:  Development of forecast methods for land ports of entry that take into account macroeconomic metrics, Development of methodology based on total landed costs to compare competing ports, Development of methodology for the establishment of logistics platforms for fresh produce, Development of methodology for the opportunistic shipment of fresh produce, and  Development of metrics and forecasts models for domestic freight transportation.   Broader impact  The participation of students in the research activities of the CELDi site at Arizona State University is one of the broader impacts we want to highlight. Over ten students participated in the research activities, five of which were undergraduate students. Two of these undergraduate students went on to pursue graduate degrees, one of them at the Ph.D. level.  The activities also had indirect broader impacts. For instance, the forecast methods developed for the project "Forecast and Capacity Planning for NogalesÆ Ports of Entry" will support better decisions in terms of infrastructure and inspection resources planning that in turn will result in higher economic activity, and ideally in lower environmental impact from the operations of the land ports of entry. A quick summary of this project follows.  The two international port of entries (POEs) connecting the cities of Nogales, Arizona, with Nogales, Sonora in Mexico are vital for the economies of these two cities as well as the surrounding region.

Including analysis of historical data for these POEs, a visit to the Mariposa POE and conclusions gathered from any relevant previous studies. Testing of various model alternatives on the historical data for the different modes of traffic to find the best methods for creating our forecasts. Using the chosen models to provide forecasts of border crossings for the next 5, 10 and 15 years into the future.
