<AbstractNarration>The ever-shrinking feature size in CMOS process technology has enabled the integration of a large number of devices such as cores, caches, and other special engines in a single chip. The growing popularity of Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs) has ushered in the arrival of a communication-centric system where the design of interconnection architecture has a significant impact on the overall system performance as well as power dissipation and area of a chip. To overcome traditional interconnects problems, Network-on-chip (NoC), using switch-based networks, has been widely accepted as a promising architecture to orchestrate chip-wide communication. Although there has been significant research on NoC designs, there is still a lack of a unified design methodology integrating system and NoC design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator is developing a comprehensive design paradigm for exploring the on-chip interconnect design space, especially focusing on how it interacts with the rest of the CMP architecture. This research program is comprised of four intertwined research objectives. First, simulation testbeds and traffic analysis methodologies are developed to understand the interplay between applications and system architecture.  Traffic analysis tools are used to capture the runtime behavior of various applications in CMPs. Second, solutions for high and predictable performance within power and area budgets in current and future technology generations are provided. Third, the PI is  developing a domain specific NoC design for CMP memory systems. As the last objective, the PI  explores new opportunities and challenges posed by future applications of next-generation CMP. The research is integrated into the education curriculum, through existing and new graduate courses, and in undergraduate research programs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

For this task, we proposed an Adaptive Physical Channel Regulator (APCR) for NoC routers to exploit huge wiring resources. The flit size in an APCR router is less than the physical channel width (phit size) to provide finer granularity flow control. An APCR router allows flits from different packets or flows to share the same physical channel in a single cycle.  Third, we explored to exploit emersing technologies in future NoC design.  Nanophotonics has been proposed to design low latency and high bandwidth NoC for future CMPs. Recent nanophotonic NOC designs adopt the token-based arbitration coupled with credit-based flow control, which leads to low bandwidth utilization. In this work, we proposed handshake schemes for nanophotonic interconnects in CMPs. They get rid of the traditional credit based flow control, reduce the average token waiting time, and finally improve the network throughput. The other emerging technology we explored is STT-MRAM (Spin-Torque Transfer Magnetic RAM) for its nature of high density and near zero leakage power. But its long latency and high power consumption in write operations still need to be addressed. We explored the design issues in using STT-MRAM for NoC input buffers. Motivated by short intra-router latency, we proposed a hybrid design of input buffers using both SRAM and STT-MRAM to hide the long write latency efficiently. Finally, we further investigated intelligent network management schemes to improve performance and to reduce power consumption of existing NoC architectures. In this study, we accelerated network communication by exploiting communication temporal locality with minimal additional hardware cost in the exi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
