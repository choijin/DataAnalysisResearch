<AbstractNarration>Archaeology and Anthropology (81) &lt;br/&gt;History (83) &lt;br/&gt;Linguistics (84) &lt;br/&gt;Geography (88) &lt;br/&gt;Interdisciplinary (99) &lt;br/&gt;     The Mesolore Project (TMP) was developed at Brown University and tested by instructors in a variety of institutions of higher education during its initial phase of NSF support in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The first phase of TMP concentrated on creating upper-level seminars focused on Mixtec documents from the pre- and post-1520 period in Meso-America in a set of connected social science fields. This was the period in which the cultural influence of Spain was interjected into the native culture. This CCLI Phase 2 project is building on the initial collection of interactive and interdisciplinary learning materials by &lt;br/&gt;(1) Adding three more interactive "laboratories" of Aztec-related primary documents to its holdings, namely the "Lienzo de Tlaxcala," the "Matr√≠cula de Tributos," and a 16th century Nahuatl-Spanish "Vocabulario."&lt;br/&gt;(2) Engaging in national dissemination activities to assist instructors in the social science fields of history, geography, archaeology, and cultural anthropology in the task of integrating these online materials into undergraduate courses. &lt;br/&gt;(3) Adding supplementary teaching sources--tutorials, essays, a new debate, an expanded list of secondary listings and links, and an interactive atlas to include Central Mexico, not only the Mixteca.   &lt;br/&gt;(4) Engaging in a variety of evaluation activities.&lt;br/&gt;     A CD ROM set ("Mesolore: Exploring Mesoamerican Cultures") was disseminated during TMP's first phase.  In this phase 2 Project, Mesolore is expanding its presence using the Internet and is also continuing to cultivate a national community of faculty and student users by placing them at the center of research on Mesoamerica. This expansion connects learning materials from the disciplines of archaeology, anthropology, linguistics, geography, and history in the study of a real-world situation.</AbstractNarration>
