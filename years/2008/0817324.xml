<AbstractNarration>The long-term goal of these studies is a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms that ensure the proper expression of genetic information in the form of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in eukaryotic cells. The experiments focus on a nuclear mRNA surveillance pathway in cells that destroys aberrant mRNAs before they cause toxic effects on cell growth. Central to this pathway is a conserved complex of proteins called the exosome, which degrades mRNA molecules that fail to undergo critical steps during their formation. A major unanswered question addressed by this research is how this complex distinguishes between normal and aberrant mRNAs. Previous studies identified Rrp6p, a nuclear exoribonuclease component of the exosome and showed that it plays a critical role in degrading aberrant mRNAs in the nucleus. Recent evidence indicates that a second complex called TRAMP plays a key role in activating mRNA substrates for degradation by the nuclear exosome. Experiments described here aim to (i) identify the components of the TRAMP complex required for enhancement of Rrp6p activity, (ii) elucidate the role that TRAMP and Rrp6p play in a general and a specific pathway for mRNA degradation. These studies should shed light on the mechanisms that cells use to recognize and destroy potentially toxic RNA molecules, a process essential for the survival of all organisms. These studies will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students, including women and minorities. These studies will also generate novel cell lines that will be made available to the general scientific community for experimentation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Project Outcomes Report  The project had as its overarching goal the determination of the specific molecular mechanisms that determine how gene expression is controlled in eukaryotic cells.  Specifically, the research sought to determine how a molecular surveillance system in the nuclei of cells distinguishes between correctly formed gene products and those containing errors (Publication 5).  All living cells utilize molecular systems to correct errors in gene expression as a way to improve fitness.  This project studied a system that destoys ribonucleic acids (RNAs) produced by reading the genetic code.  Some of these RNAs require additional steps to prepare them for their functions and these steps sometimes cause imperfections in the RNAs.  A complex of proteins called the RNA exosome destroys the misshapen RNAs before they can cause problems in cell functions.  The exosome also uses its activity to regulate the levels of some normal RNAs, thereby contributing to the control of gene expression and cellular metabolism.  This project sought to understand how the exosome determines which RNAs to destroy, regulate or ignore.  The project identified a second complex of proteins, called TRAMP, that functions as an enhancer of a component of the exosome, Rrp6 (Publication 1) and discovered that Rrp6 sometimes functions alone, without interacting with the exosome (Publication 2).  Next, the research discovered that two proteins associated with TRAMP play unexpected roles in identifying RNAs destined for degradation by the exosome.  These proteins play important roles in regulating cellular metabolism and inheritance (Publication 3).  Finally, the research determined that the exosome directly regulates the genetic expression of a protein that plays a central role in the metabolism of all messenger RNAs in the cell and that this mechanism is fundamentally different that that used by other genes (Publication 4).  In summary, this project discovered new roles for an RNA surveillance system found in all eukaryotic cells, including humans.  Broader Impacts.
