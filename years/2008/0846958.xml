<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research aims to develop a family of crystalline boron-imidazolate based nanoporous materials with compositional and topological features that mimic porous zeolites. These materials are unique because they are capable of integrating the advantages of coordination polymers (e.g., compositional and topological diversity) and covalent organic framework materials (e.g., lightweight). The synthetic strategy involves two major steps. The first is to create a library of boron-imidazolate molecular building blocks capable of serving as tetrahedral or trigonal vertices. These various pre-synthesized molecular building units will then be assembled with metal cations or clusters into three-dimensional infinite porous frameworks. This strategy is especially suited for the creation of ultra-light porous materials using the lightest possible elements from the periodic table (e.g., Li and B) and permits the development of materials with a variety of compositional and topological features. These crystalline porous materials will be structurally characterized and their various properties, particularly porosity and gas sorption characteristics, will be characterized to determine their application potentials in energy and environmental applications such as hydrogen storage, carbon dioxide sequestration, and selection gas separation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research program aims to create a family of sponge-like porous materials for energy and environmental applications. Such materials may serve as high capacity adsorbents for on-board fuel storage or waste gas sequestration and they may also selectively trap toxic and radioactive metals for environmental remediation. The award will help the PI to design curricula and a range of research activities in solid state and materials chemistry that will provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, leading to publications and scholarly presentations involving these students. Because a large fraction of students in the PI's university and laboratory are from underrepresented groups, the program will broaden the participation of these students and promote diversity in solid state and materials research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merits     This NSF CAREER award, which started in February 2009 and ended in January 2015, has been a dramatic success in both research and education. A total of 44 peer-reviewed publications acknowledges the support of this award. In addition to the creation of many novel materials, new synthetic and structural concepts and new synthetic methods have been developed and promptly reported in high-impact journals. Some of these new concepts have already been used by research groups worldwide in their own research programs, as evidenced by citations in their published research.     Some specific research accomplishments include (i) development of new lithium cluster chemistry, (ii) development of ligand-charge-complementarity as a materials-design principle, (iii) development of heterometallic MOFs, (iv) development of novel metal cluster units as MOF building blocks, (v) systematization of indium cluster chemistry in MOFs, (vi) development of new solvent systems for MOF synthesis, (vii) contribution to the development of pore-space partition strategy based on polyfunctional ligands and homo- and hetero-metallic systems, and (viii) contribution to the development of pore-space partition strategy based on mixed ligand systems.        Broader Impact     This NSF CAREER award has made dramatic changes in the careers of the PI and his many students, because of the awardÆs focus on both educational and research aspects.     Five graduate students performed research on projects supported by this grant and completed their graduate thesis (MS degree, which is the highest degree awarded by the PIÆs department) during this period (degrees awarded in 2011, 2012, 2012, 2013, and 2015). These five students are leading or co-authors in 10 high-impact publications. Three students continued into the PhD programs following the graduation, one student started in an industrial position, and the fifth student will start an academic teaching position.     Over a dozen of undergraduate students participated in this project and among these, six students are co-authors on a total of 10 high-impact publications. Two high-school students also participated in this project, and one of them co-authored a publication.           Last Modified: 04/19/2015       Submitted by: Xianhui Bu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
