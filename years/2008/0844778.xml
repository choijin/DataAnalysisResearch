<AbstractNarration>Urban areas are dominated by three physical features: 1) buildings, 2) surfaces, such as pavement and bare soil, and 3) vegetation.  The amount and arrangement of these features on the urban landscape may influence a city?s capacity to retain surface storm water and dissipate heat. These capacities are important because cities are frequently prone to flash flooding and extreme heat.  High temperatures exacerbate ground level ozone formation, an air quality concern, and lead to high water and energy use.  The urban landscape is characterized by complex combinations of these features, which change over very short distances.  Understanding how land cover determines the capacity to retain surface water and dissipate heat is difficult because current methods to describe urban land cover focus on how the land is used, such as for residential or commercial purposes, and do not recognize the variation in physical features that may exist within these different use categories.  This research will apply a new descriptor of land cover to Sacramento, California, that captures variation in the physical features and will test whether this new land cover methodology improves understanding of the link between physical features and water retention and heat dissipation.  Stream discharge will be quantified in 5 small city catchments that drain areas of contrasting variation.  Fine scale measurements of land surface temperature will be derived from satellite data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flooding and heat exposure in urban areas put human, as well as animal and plant populations at risk.  Results from this research will inform design and management decisions in urban systems to reduce these risks.  New undergraduate courses and research opportunities to expose students to the highly interdisciplinary, and rapidly changing, field of urban ecology will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ To understand how cities function ecologically, urban ecologists investigate how variation within the city affects environmental measures such as temperature and water flow.  One common way to describe urban variation is to use categories such as residential, commercial, and industrial.  This approach describes variation by how people use the land, and it does not describe the physical features of the land that could affect the environment.  For example, summer temperatures vary across the city and urban residents living in residential neighborhoods with higher tree cover or lower amounts of paved surfaces will likely experience cooler temperatures than those residents living in dense residential neighborhoods that lack trees.  This difference in physical structure &ndash; building density, amount of vegetation &ndash; is typically not captured by land use classification systems that would describe both areas as residential.  This project developed a new classification system based on the physical features of the environment expected to influence environmental conditions -- amount and type of vegetation, surfaces, and buildings.  The new classification was tested in Sacramento, CA to determine whether it better predicted the variation of land surface temperature, stream hydrology and water quality than a classification built on land use as the descriptor.  Land cover was the primary driver of land surface temperature suggesting that the new classification better predicts variation in land surface temperature.  This has important implications for social equity and exposure to excess urban heat.  Neighborhoods characterized by lower income residents and a greater proportion of residents of color were found to be, in general, hotter.  In Sacramento, these neighborhoods were also found to have less tree canopy cover.  In a comparative study examining the equity of tree canopy distribution in Baltimore, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, Raleigh, Sacramento, and Washington, D.C. the expected pattern of low tree canopy cover in neighborhoods with a high percentage of racial and ethnic minorities was only found in the two California.  This may be because these cities rely on irrigation to maintain the trees which places an additional maintenance burden on residents.  The natural aridity of Sacramento and Los Angeles may amplify socioeconomic differences in neighborhood tree cover more than in the humid temperate cities included in the comparison.  Sacramento experiences a Mediterranean climate with distinct wet and dry seasons.  Typically rainfall occurs during the cooler winter months and no rain is received during the hotter summer months.  Small streams, therefore, are expected to flow intermittently, meaning they may not flow during the dry season.  Urbanization, however, has altered this hydrology and lawn irrigation and other water use may provide enough water subsidies to extend the flow such that they flow year round.  These activities may also bring nutrients and pollutants into the streams with the water.  Nitrogen is of particular concern because it is a crucial water pollutant worldwide and can diminish water quality.  This project determined whether the new land cover classification tool could predict the amount and quality of water in streams draining small residential areas of Sacramento.  The amount of buildings, pavement and vegetation in these residential areas did not directly correlate with the amount of nitrogen in the water, but did correlate with how much water was flowing in the streams. As buildings and pavement increased and vegetation decreased, more water moved to the streams.  As water yields increased, nitrogen yields also increased suggesting that the influence of the physical features on water quality is mediated through their effects on water quantity.  A key conclusion was that hydrologic changes in urban watersheds, specifically the introduction of drainage infrastructure, are more important pred...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
