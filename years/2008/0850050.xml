<AbstractNarration>The ETHOS (Engineers for Technical Opportunities for Service-Learning) Scholars project awards scholarships to primarily underrepresented minorities and women undergraduate engineering students in all disciplines. Through its emphasis on Sustainable Innovation Learning Communities, this scholars program seeks to: i) provide both the necessary mission, community, and support needed to increase enrollment of underrepresented minorities and women into engineering; ii) increase retention of this population through graduation; iii) pilot integrated sustainable engineering curriculum which can serve as a national model for similar practice elsewhere; and iv) enhance relationships with employers seeking graduates prepared&lt;br/&gt;to meet the most critical national and international need for engineering in a resource constrained world with global environmental consequences of technology development and usage.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: A signle guiding question framed the University of Dayton (UD) ETHOS Sustainable Engineering Scholars (SES) S-STEM program; namely "Can minority and women recruitment and retention in engineering be increased by uniting such students in community by a mission of engineering to create a sustainable world?"  The SES program particularly relied scholars student organized professional development delivered by practicing æsustainable engineersÆ, curricular connections to sustainability, energy, and the environment, and extra-curricular student-led experiential service-learning sustainable engineering projects with meaningful impact to the local community to answer this question.   The results were significant. Ninety percent of students who were offered the SES scholarship after applying by writing an essay to describe their interest and commitment to sustainable engineering chose to attend UD versus the typical yield of 22%. With respect to retention, 84% of the admitted SES scholars were retained through graduation, significantly higher than the typical graduation rate of 60% in the School of Engineering. Interviews with some of the graduates demonstrated that their involvement in this program was the reason why they remained committed to engineering and to a career in engineering.  Not really a goal of the program, all SES scholars graduating from engineering have expressed commitment to working for the cause of sustainability throughout their career.     Broader Impacts:  Successful demonstration of the linkage between the establishment of communities united by the mission of sustainable engineering and enrollment and retention of women and minorities has potentially national impact, and not just with respect to recruiting minorities and women. It is clear that the future needs engineers prepared to create a sustainable world, who are able to address the triple bottom line (environment, profit, and social benefit). The ETHOS Sustainable Engineering Scholars model helps to inform a translatable process for all universities for educating engineers capable of succeeding relative to this objective.
