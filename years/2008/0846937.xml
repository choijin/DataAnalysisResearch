<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to study the crystalline morphologies that naturally form (or can deliberately be formed) during the processing and manufacturing of semicrystalline polymer nanocomposites. These studies will in turn inform efforts to leverage nanoparticle-induced crystallization to directly address two pervasive issues related to the processing of these materials: 1) the ability to quantitatively assess the level of nanoparticle dispersion within the polymer, and 2) the ability to judiciously tailor the nanoparticle-polymer interface in a manner that does not inherently damage the structure, and hence degrade the properties, of the embedded nanoreinforcement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will enable new approaches to address two far-reaching impediments to the manufacture and optimization of semicrystalline polymer nanocomposites, an emerging technology being widely pursued to impart enhanced multifunctional behavior and properties to this technologically important class of polymers. The proposed research program is coupled to an educational initiative that will develop, pilot, and disseminate pedagogically-inspired, simulation-based learning modules which utilize modern engineering software tools to assist undergraduate students in visualizing various fundamental concepts covered within the mechanical engineering curriculum. In pursuing the proposed research and educational efforts the PI will: 1) enthusiastically recruit and mentor undergraduate and graduate students working in these areas, 2) collaborate with local high school teachers and the Center for Innovation in Engineering and Science Education at Stevens to adapt related materials for use within the K-12 STEM curriculum, 3) actively participate in outreach programs to broaden the number of students exposed to engineering and nanotechnology, and 4) develop and strengthen national and international collaborations in these areas. The PI has a proven track record of recruiting from student populations traditionally under-represented in STEM careers.</AbstractNarration>
