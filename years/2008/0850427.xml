    <AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System Integrated Program Office (NPOESS IPO) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), have entered into an interagency Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for the purpose of establishing direct reception at McMurdo Station, Antarctica, of environmental operational satellite data from the future NPOESS polar-orbiting satellite fleet and from related international collaborator satellites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF and NPOESS IPO have agreed that each agency benefits from increased bandwidth and data transmission from McMurdo Station, Antarctica to the United States. Provisioning occurs in two major phases: (a) Phase 1 ? implementation of 10 Mb/s symmetric bi-directional satellite transmission service for exclusive NSF use and (2) Phase 2 ? implementation of 60Mb/s / 20 Mb/s (outbound/inbound) asymmetric bi-directional services. Phase 1 allows NSF earth station resources to be reconfigured for Phase 2 service while maintaining continuity of NSF mission communications. This funding action addresses services delivered and managed by NPOESS IPO to NSF during Phase 1, with service description, terms, conditions, and pricing addressed in a Program Service Level Agreement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Responsibilities and funding arrangements required for Phase 1 and Phase 2 implementation are documented in an Implementation Plan, which is a requirement of the MOA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NPOESS IPO has agreed to an annual Phase 1 services cost of $1,000,000. Service commenced on 1 January, 2008 for Fiscal Year 2008. The pro rata cost for the period 1 Jan 2008 ? 30 Sep 2008 is $750,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed annual funding totaling $750,000 is recommended for award to NPOESS IPO. There are no prior awards from NSF to NPOESS IPO under the MOA for this activity. The annual award under a new interagency agreement will start the cumulative tracking at the recommended award funding of $750,000.</AbstractNarration>
