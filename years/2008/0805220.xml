<AbstractNarration>Technical. This project combines a theoretical and experimental approach to address resistance, photoconductivity, light emission, photovoltaic, and field effect transistor response of organic- and polymer-based organic materials at room temperature and low magnetic fields (&lt;100 Oe), with the objective of establishing a broadly applicable model that describes and predicts mag-netic field effects at low fields. Experiments will be guided by predictions of competing mecha-nisms for low field behavior, magnetoresistance due to interconversion of singlets and triplets (MIST mechanism) and magnetic field control of bipolaron transport. Experiments will be car-ried out to explore the roles of chemical composition, processing, and microstructure to clarify and understand mechanisms or develop new models for magnetotransport in several classes of organic-based semiconductors including small molecules, oligomers, conjugated polymers, and non-conjugated polymers. Organic based LEDs with different spin-orbit and hyperfine interac-tion strengths will be fabricated and studied as a function of magnetic field and electric field. In particular, oligomers where there are long lived excitons and carbon-based material such as C60, graphene, where the hyperfine constant is anticipated to be negligible are of special interest. In situ EPR study of organic- and polymer-based LEDs will also be used to study spin transfer. &lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical. The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of elec-tronic/photonic materials science having technological relevance. Basic understanding gained is expected to lead to improved device performance, and to allow design of other important com-ponents for future plastics electronics. Magnetic field effects in organic- and polymer-based semiconductors represents an emerging field in nanoscience with impact in areas such as or-ganic- and polymer based photovoltaics, light emitters, and spintronics. The project integrates re-search and education providing students with hands-on laboratory experience and training while conducting forefront research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The observation of large MR ~ 10% in organic semiconductors at relatively small magnetic fields of 100 Oe at room temperature is fascinating phenomenon (see Fig. 1).

In past few years the MIST model received wide recognition. It  already received  over 120 citations. Understanding the detailed mechanism of MR enables the design of devices with very high sensitivity to magnetic field. We expect that the flexibility and variety of the organic chemistry will enable us to continuously improve the parameters of our devices.  The another new paradigm of electronics, æspintronicsÆ, promises to extend the functionality of information storage and processing in conventional electronics. The principal spintronics device, the æspin valveÆ, consists of two magnetic layers decoupled by a spin-transporting spacer. The device resistance depends on the spin alignment controlled by the external magnetic field. In pursuit of semiconductor spintronics there have been intensive efforts devoted to develop room temperature magnetic semiconductors and also to incorporate organic semiconductors and carbon-based materials as the spin-transporting channels.  We reported a Giant MR (GMR) for spin valve with organic semiconductors as a spacer. Early reports that organic semiconductor thin films of a-sexithiophene (T6) and Alq3 were used for spin valve operating are very controversial because of weak temperature and bias field dependencies and wrong sign of MR. Our results for GMR in rubrene are free from similar objections. The MR of spin valve with 20 nm rubrene film as a spacer is shown on Fig. 4 at different temperatures. The MR as a function of temperature (Fig. 5) shows a maximum at ~ 100 K. The decrease of MR, as temperature increases above 100 K, is attributed to the decrease of surface spin polarization of the LSMO film.
