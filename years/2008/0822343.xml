<AbstractNarration>The goal of this three-year collaborative research project between Texas A&amp;M and Sam Houston State University is to improve the science achievement and the academic English language proficiency of middle school Spanish-speaking English language learners (ELLs). To accomplish this goal, Project MSSELL will conduct a two-year randomized trial longitudinal evaluation of an enhanced standards-based science curriculum model previously developed through a five-year longitudinal randomized trial study funded by the Institute of Education Sciences of the U.S. Department of Education. The model consists of five major components: (a) English language acquisition strategies integrated into the science curriculum, (b) technology-assisted instruction, (c) bi-weekly teacher professional development, (d) family involvement, and (e) paraprofessionals in working with individual ELLs. In Year 1, the project will refine and pilot the model based on learnings from its previous developmental phase and implementation with K-3 grade students. In Years 2 and 3, the enhanced model will be implemented and studied with fifth and sixth grade students.</AbstractNarration>
