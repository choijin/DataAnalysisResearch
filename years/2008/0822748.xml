<AbstractNarration>Complex tasks frequently require holding in mind several ideas at once.  For example, when performing mental addition we must juggle several numbers in mind while applying operations to update those numbers.  It is well-established that there are distinct limits to the amount of information that can be held in mind at any given time and that these limits have a close relationship to our abilities to reason and to comprehend  -- in short, to our intelligence.  However, the fundamental architecture of the short-term memory system responsible for these capacity limits remains unclear.  Recent psychological research suggests that distinctions can be drawn between a single piece of information at the forefront of the mind, other information that is being held in mind, but currently not the focus of attention, and information that is not being held in mind, but available in long-term memory.  The goal of this project is to understand the brain mechanisms responsible for representing these different states of information.  With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. John Jonides and colleagues at the University of Michigan will investigate the architecture of short-term memory using functional magnetic resonance imaging.  The research will examine neural responses as human volunteers retain, retrieve, and update information in the various putative states of short-term memory.  In addition to traditional measures that afford brain localization of function, the research will employ analyses that examine functional networks of brain activation, thus elucidating brain mechanisms by which short-term memory is achieved.  The work will also examine neural responses to different types of information, such as verbal, spatial, and pictorial information and examine the brain networks involved in subserving short-term memory of each form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since much of human intelligence depends on capacity limits of short-term memory, understanding how the brain implements short-term memory could have substantial impact on cognition as a whole.  The understanding furthered by this research may inform methods that aim to increase short-term memory capacity and intelligence.  This research project will also provide comprehensive training functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques to undergraduate and graduate students involved in the project.  Findings from this study will be disseminated widely through publications and a seminar.</AbstractNarration>

Then, to calculate "421 x 3", you might sequentially compute each sub-part of the operation (i.e. "1 x 3" then "2 x 3" then "4 x 3"). This formulation suggests a trisection of maintenance: items that are passively maintained to be returned to at a later time ("+ 67"), items that are actively maintained to be operated upon ("421 x 3"), and items that are the current focus of operation ("1 x 3").
