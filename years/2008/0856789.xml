<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to understand how arrays of nanofibers can capture and release nanometer to micrometer size particles. The research will result in methods which are general enough to apply across a wide range of particle sizes and materials, and which are relevant to diverse applications. In nature, the nanofibers in natural gecko adhere to surfaces, yet shed dirt particles. The research will first develop a model for particle capture and release in both natural and synthetic fiber arrays. Using the developed self-cleaning model, arrays of nanofibers will be created to control particle adhesion, transport, and removal. The research results will be compared on a wide range of particle sizes and materials using both the natural gecko and synthesized nanofibers to validate models. Deliverables include models of particle capture and release mechanisms, demonstration particle cleaning surfaces, documentation of research results, engineering student and post-doc education, and research experiences for undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide the understanding to create dry self-cleaning surfaces, and adhesives which work reusably in dirty environments. These dry self-cleaning surfaces could be used for applications such as coatings which keep surfaces clean without water, surfaces which shed bacteria to stay sterile, air cleaning systems, and dirt shedding apparel. Electrically controlled fibers will allow particles to be captured and released when desired. Results of this research will be disseminated to allow the creation of commercial devices in which surfaces can self-clean without water. The project will educate undergraduate and graduate students in both biomimetics and nanotechnology.  Through a summer research program, under-represented students in science and engineering will be provided an opportunity to experience research. Through the popular press, biomimetic research will be presented to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
