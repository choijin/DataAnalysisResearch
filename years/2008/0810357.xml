    <AbstractNarration>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I will study the feasibility of the technology of multilevel magnetic recording. This technology is potentially suitable for densities beyond 10 terabit/in2 and data rates faster than 1 gigabit/s. This project will include the study of the industry standard spinstand for a device prototype capable of achieving more than 16 signal levels to store information with effective aerial densities above 1 terabit/in2 and demonstrate a potential to extend the technology beyond 10 terabit/in2. The proof of concept system will consist of a high-field transducer built via focused ion beam trimming of regular magnetic recording heads and three-dimensional (3D) media. To prove the feasibility of multilevel recording, the innovative multilevel encoding channel will be integrated into a state-of-the art spinstand Guzik V2002. Spinstand testing with the new channel will be used to combine 3D recording media and transducers into a viable multilevel recording system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful the outcome of the feasibility study for this cost-effective and long-term solution may have great impact on the multibillion data storage industry. With the introduction of multilevel signal processing this proposed solution has potential to leapfrog the existing information related technologies. Not only data storage related but also other electronics applications could benefit from the introduction of multilevel signal format.</AbstractNarration>
