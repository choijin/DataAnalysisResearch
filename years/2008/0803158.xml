<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research project is to enhance, develop, and publish faint standard star sequences. There is a long-term need for accurate photometric standard stars with known intensities and colors at a variety of optical wavelengths. Use of such standard stars permits the combination and inter-comparison of the brightness and color measurements of different celestial phenomena made by different investigators. Examples of uses include the calibration of magnitudes and color indices of celestial objects to further the understanding of stellar evolution, ages and distances of star clusters, studies of variable stars, and to define the distance scale through our Milky Way Galaxy, the local group of galaxies, and onward to the edge of the Universe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here, using telescopes at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory in Chile, Dr. Landolt will complete the development of new standard stars that will be about 100 times fainter than those now available. He will also begin development of the next set of even fainter standard stars at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona. These calibration stars are needed for, and will be usable by the entire ensemble of the largest ground-based and space-based optical detectors, both presently built, those under construction, and those in the planning stage. The overall goal of this project is to extend the calibration sequences to fainter limits so the limits of interpretation will be scientific, and not those of calibration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the grant entitled UBVRI Photometric Standard Stars was the enhancement, extension and definition of a group of stars of known brightnesses and colors distributed around the sky.  An objective of this program, whose data were gathered at the United States' national optical telescopes in Chile and Arizona, and at the Lowell Observatory, was to make available to the astronomical community, professional and amateur, and to the public, accurate photometric standard stars which would enable the calibration of the intensities and colors of objects on and projected against the celestial sphere.  Different groups of observers use standard stars such as these to intercompare their data in a meaningful way.  The new standard stars are usable by the entire emsemble of the largest ground-based and space-based optical detectors, both presently built, those under construction, and those in the planning stage.  Calibrated optical telescopic data based on this project will provide the basis for, the calibrations for transformative research wherein data from new fields of research and revolutionary ideas can be compared with accepted theories and perspectives.  As an example, the behavior of stars, galaxies, and the exotic inhabitants of space, as well as their physical characteristics, could be studied, defined and deciphered.  College and university classrooms used these photometric standard stars for their teaching, research, and outreach educational informative purposes.    In another form of outreach, amateur organizations, such as the American Association of Variable Star Observers and the Astronomical League, use the publications which resulted from this observational program both to gather and calibrate, intercompare, their astronomical data for stars which vary in brightness, as well as to introduce the public to the glories of the night sky.
