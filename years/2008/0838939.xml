<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop and employ novel cost-effective lithium salts for mass production of full size lithium-ion batteries for EV/HEV applications. Small lithium-ion batteries containing fluorinated low lattice energy lithium salts are used in computers, cell phones, cameras, and medical devices. For mass production of full size batteries to be used in electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles (EV/HEV), the electrolytes derived from these salts are far too expensive and are potentially hazardous to the environment. In a Li-ion battery, the liquid electrolyte is the second most expensive component after cathode materials. Therefore, there is a great demand for lithium salts that are inexpensive compared to that of the current lithium salts. The availability of such salts will be a major advance in Li-ion battery technology. This project will develop low-cost lithium salts that have excellent electrochemical properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to introduce to the marketplace new lithium salts for large-scale production of full-size lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and consumer products. These environmentally safer and less costly materials will provide improved batteries compared to those currently available. Due to worldwide concerns about environmental issues and the depletion of natural fossil fuels, there have been increasing demands for sustainable EVs (electric vehicles) and FCEVs (fuel cell electric vehicles). These electric powertrains need secondary batteries that can be charged and discharged frequently. One of the most promising types of secondary batteries is the lithium-ion(Li-ion) battery, because of its high energy and power densities and because it has the potential to last the lifetime of the car. Li-ion batteries are also currently in large-scale commercial production for use in consumer electronic products, such as laptop computers and cellphones. However, the high cost of small cells precludes their use in economically-demanding mass-market vehicles. To improve their competitive position and with a view to potential long-term expansion of the vehicle market, considerable research and development must be devoted to lowering the costs of Li-ion batteries. The technology developed in this project will advance this goal.</AbstractNarration>
