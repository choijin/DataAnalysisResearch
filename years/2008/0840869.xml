<AbstractNarration>Enzyme RCN Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extracellular enzymes produced by bacteria and fungi are involved in innumerable biogeochemical processes and are central to providing services to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. One very important process is the biological decomposition of organic matter in soils and sediments, which is a critical component of the global carbon cycle. Furthermore, the natural attenuation of polluted soils and waters depends on the activities of extracellular enzymes. However, our ability to understand and manage biogeochemical processes for beneficial outcomes such as carbon sequestration, optimizing ecosystem productivity, and bioremediation is constrained by our limited knowledge of the diversity and functional capabilities of extracellular enzymes.  The overall goal of this Research Coordination Network is to advance our understanding of enzymes in the environment through improved communication, collaboration, and spurring new initiatives.  The network will accomplish this goal by organizing workshops, data synthesizing, standardizing methods, and through maintaining a project website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Coordination Network addresses a need to advance our understanding of the controls on the production of enzymes by different microbes, their stabilization and turnover, and their in-situ activity. Currently, our understanding is constrained by (1) limited methods for measuring actual enzyme activities in various environments, (2) limited discourse across disciplinary and ecosystem boundaries, and (3) limited synthesis of current research into an integrated conceptual framework that feeds into ecosystem models.  New advances in genomics and other molecular approaches will allow for rapid advances in this field.   This network will enhance collaboration and communication between the international community of scientists involved in various aspects of this research. Broadening participation of underrepresented groups in science will be promoted by active recruitment, participation in a lab exchange program to gain research experience, and by promoting participation of a diverse group of researchers in various network activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Enzymes play critical roles in natural and managed environments, from enabling nutrient recycling to breaking down pollutants.  Enzymes catalyze chemical reactions, and in the environment, they can break down complex molecules into simpler and smaller molecules. Microbes, plants, and other organisms release enzymes into their environment in the hopeful act that the products of enzymatic activity will diffuse back to them, providing them with food and energy.  But, what controls the production of different types of enzymes, their persistence and activity in the environment, and their eventual breakdown?  We formed the Enzymes in the Environment Research Coordination Network to bring together scientists working on different facets of these questions and advance our fundamental knowledge.  Over the course of the project, we held several workshops and symposia.  Topics included developing advanced technologies to study enzymes in the environment, approaches to modeling the role of enzymes in nutrient cycling, and exploring the commonalities and differences of enzyme behavior in aquatic versus soil environments.  We also worked to standardize techniques so that results from different studies were more directly comparable, and to train hundreds of scientists in these techniques through workshops, protocols, and on-line videos.  The Enzymes in the Environment Research Coordination Network was highly successful in advancing this scientific field, and spurring a new generation of researchers to advance our understanding of these critical but invisible components of our environment.  This fundamental research is critical for new innovations that can harness the power of enzymes to sustain our environment&shy;&ndash;from breaking down contaminants to improving fertilizer efficiency in agriculture.
