    <AbstractNarration>This collaborative project investigates a number of fundamental &lt;br/&gt;problems that are very critical to wireless mesh network (WMN) &lt;br/&gt;throughput optimization. Wireless mesh networking is believed to &lt;br/&gt;be the most effective and efficient technology for the last-mile &lt;br/&gt;data connection to the Internet. The proposed research targets &lt;br/&gt;to solve the following challenges: 1) Throughput optimization in &lt;br/&gt;MR-MC WMNs: the complexity of throughput-optimal scheduling, &lt;br/&gt;real-time logical topology characterization and inference, the &lt;br/&gt;joint exploitation of both rate diversity and channel diversity, &lt;br/&gt;and game theory based throughput optimization. 2) Non information &lt;br/&gt;theory based approaches to throughput optimization in multi-hop &lt;br/&gt;MIMO-enabled WMNs: stochastically modeling different aspects of &lt;br/&gt;the mesh network, constructing Network Utility Maximization &lt;br/&gt;formulations, and applying Information Geometric Programming to &lt;br/&gt;solve global optimization problems. 3) Biologically-inspired WMN &lt;br/&gt;design for throughput optimizatio n. 4) A testbed to accomplish &lt;br/&gt;experimental tasks to validate the effectiveness of the design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is in nature multidisciplinary. It requires the &lt;br/&gt;joint effort from computer science, electrical engineering, &lt;br/&gt;mathematics, statistics, and biology, and therefore has the &lt;br/&gt;potential to inspire revolutionary methodologies that could be &lt;br/&gt;applied to many domains. In addition, the novelty of the proposed &lt;br/&gt;research has strong impact on wireless research. Furthermore, the &lt;br/&gt;success of this project is able to enhance the four universities? &lt;br/&gt;ability to educate, through the multi-disciplinary research effort, &lt;br/&gt;future scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>
