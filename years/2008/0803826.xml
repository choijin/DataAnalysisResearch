<AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: RI-Medium: Collaborative Research: Robotic Parkour--Dynamic&lt;br/&gt;Climbing&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Northwestern University&lt;br/&gt;Abstract Date: 05/29/08&lt;br/&gt;We propose to explore design, control, and motion planning for robotic parkour---the&lt;br/&gt;highly dynamic form of locomotion that includes ascending chutes by leaping back and&lt;br/&gt;forth between opposing walls.&lt;br/&gt;Our broad goal is to give robots access to difficult-to-reach places by taking full&lt;br/&gt;advantage of their dynamics and the potential reaction forces afforded by the&lt;br/&gt;environment. The proposed work will address two challenge problems:&lt;br/&gt;1. To design, build, and control a planar robot to dynamically climb in a rigid vertical&lt;br/&gt;chute, and&lt;br/&gt;2. To design, build, and control a planar robot to reliably move from an initial state to&lt;br/&gt;any dynamically reachable goal state in a complex vertical environment of footholds at&lt;br/&gt;various orientations.&lt;br/&gt;The true goal of this work is not to build speci&amp;#64257;c-climbing robots, but rather to&lt;br/&gt;address scienti&amp;#64257;c issues fundamental to dynamic legged locomotion in&lt;br/&gt;non-trivial terrains by confronting these two challenges.&lt;br/&gt;NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:0803734 PI Name:Lynch, Kevin&lt;br/&gt;Printed</AbstractNarration>
