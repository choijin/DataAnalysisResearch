<AbstractNarration>This project will develop a design-oriented science of online volunteer communities (OLVCs) such as Wikipedia, SourceForge, and TripAdvisor.  These web sites attract hundreds of thousands of people - not to play games or socialize - but to produce content. The content produced by OLVCs is valuable. Wikipedia is among the ten most popular sites on the Web. SourceForge is the hub of the open source software movement, used by thousands of projects to organize their work. TripAdvisor brings together travelers whose reviews help each other find and vet hotels and services.  Despite these successes, OLVCs face real challenges. Most fail quickly, and even the most successful have problems. Over two-thirds of SourceForge projects become inactive fairly quickly. Even Wikipedia struggles: vandalism is a constant problem, two thirds of the articles are stubs - the lowest quality article, which are too short to provide encyclopedic coverage - and recent data suggests that Wikipedia's constant growth may have halted and even reversed.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A design-oriented science of OLVCs could help solve these problems.  Four specific research activities will be carried out to produce this science.  First, the project will mine results from prior research to create models, formulate hypotheses, and define key success metrics. Second, it will develop algorithms and interfaces to help OLVCs function better. Third, it will evaluate the mechanisms in real OLVCs, for example, with experiments that measure the extent to which different social comparison interfaces motivate volunteers to step up their activity.  Finally, the project will abstract the results to develop generalizable design principles for online volunteer communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a broad set of software mechanisms to solve important and general problems of online volunteer communities.  The algorithms and interfaces will be evaluated systematically in real OLVCs, thus providing an empirically grounded body of knowledge about their effectiveness.  In addition, the results of this project can feed back to advance social science theories originally developed for offline volunteering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many online communities are built around volunteers contributing information and effort towards a common goal.  Wikipedia, for example, depends on tens of thousands of editors who contribute and refine its content.  Rating and review sites depend on people writing and contributing their opinions on products or services.    This project carried out interdisciplinary research to explore how online communitiies can more effectively make use of volunteers by looking at several factors that bring together computer science, psychology, communication, and other disciplines.  We studied why people contribute, what leads them to want to continue contributing (or to stop), and how to design quality-control mechanisms to ensure the high quality of their contributions.    More specifically, we tested a number of theories about human behavior.  For example, we looked at how people react differently to interpersonal bonds (having or making friends in the community) vs. personal identity (feeling like part of the community, but not through relationships with others).  We also looked at how different messages and appeals lead people to want to contribute--or not.  For example, it is usually more effective to ask someone for information or effort that they feel only they (or few others) can provide, even if that effort may benefit a smaller number of people than general information (specifically, people like to believe they have a unique contribution to offer, not just to feel like a source of free labor).    Three things distinguish this research from many other attempts to understand how people contribute information online:  First, this study was carried out across a diverse set of different communities.  We looked at online recommender systems (a movie review site), at Wikipedia, at geographic systems (including a bike-route mapping system), at online question-and-answer sites, and much more.  Second, the study involved a variety of different research techniques in an attempt to elicit a more comprehensive picture of how people volunteer.  We included surveys, studies of past behavior, and controlled experiments that we carried out in real online systems.    Third, the study built computational models of how people would perform, and tested those models against data gathered from systems.   This allows us to make the knowledge gained operational in real systems.    As a publicly-funded research project, we also took steps to ensure the public benefit from our work:  *  We have released datasets and software for public use;  *  We have published out results so that others can read about and build upon what we've done;  *  We have incorporated our results into courses, textbooks, and online courses to help others learn from our experience; and   *  Most of the research was carried out by students in training; we trained more than 40 students (undergraduate and graduate) through this project--many of them are now faculty or working in industry jobs where they can use their skills on new projects.
