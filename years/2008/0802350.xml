<AbstractNarration>The Technology and Innovation in Manufacturing and Engineering (TIME) Center is continuing its transformational activities and broadening its focus on manufacturing and engineering technology at the secondary and postsecondary levels. Center partners are pursuing a comprehensive strategy to: &lt;br/&gt;     1. Develop secondary and post-secondary manufacturing and engineering technology curricula in demand-driven program areas. &lt;br/&gt;     2. Provide professional development opportunities for secondary and post-secondary manufacturing, engineering technology and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty. &lt;br/&gt;     3. Collaborate with partners and key stakeholder groups to enhance the visibility and image of manufacturing and engineering technology as viable career options. &lt;br/&gt;     4. Explore innovative instructional methodology to support more effective delivery of manufacturing and engineering technology education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The target audiences for these strategies include students from middle school through college, parents, K-12 teachers, college faculty, high school and college career counselors, adult learners, incumbent workers, and members of the employment community. In order to reach these diverse constituencies, the TIME Center is working with a wide variety of local, regional and national partners. Among the collaborators are seven community colleges, three universities, state and local K-12 educational systems, state and local workforce and economic development agencies, six business organizations, and individual companies. The objectives of the TIME Center build upon its many successes to date, continue the transformation in manufacturing and engineering technology education already begun, and expand involvement and expertise into new areas that enhance capabilities to address these changes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Activities systematically build upon successes and lessons learned to date by continuing the redesign and restructuring of secondary and post-secondary manufacturing and engineering technology programs in Maryland; identifying new, emerging areas for coursework and possible degree options that continue to meet the industry's need for trained technicians; ensuring that faculty have access to current instructional materials, technologies, and state-of-the practice professional development; exploring innovative instructional delivery approaches; and institutionalizing products and expertise into partner programs at various educational levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Activities continue to involve the Center in regional and statewide workforce development partnerships and initiatives; maintain close interaction with the employer community; broaden the participation of underrepresented groups; advance efforts to create systemic educational change at the secondary and post-secondary levels; more effectively assess the impact of collective efforts on student learning; collaborate with other ATE Centers on professional development and research on alternate instructional delivery options; and ensure sustainability and institutionalization of products and services.</AbstractNarration>

To implement these strategies, TIME partnered and collaborated with a variety of regional and national industry, education, workforce development and labor organizations, including several NSF ATE Centers.  The TIME CenterÆs objectives built upon its many successes to date, continued the transformation in manufacturing and engineering technology education already begun in Maryland, and expanded its involvement and expertise into new areas of opportunity and challenge.  Intellectual Merit  Grant activities built upon our successes and lessons learned since our inception in 2003 by: continuing to restructure secondary and post-secondary manufacturing and engineering technology programs in Maryland; identifying emerging areas for coursework and certification options that addressed regional industry needs for trained technicians; ensuring that faculty had access to current instructional materials, technologies, and state-of-the practice professional development; implementing innovative instructional delivery approaches; continuing to build and deepen the educational pipeline for our targeted programs; and institutionalizing our products and expertise into partner programs at various educational levels.   Broader Impact  Grant activities continued to: involve the Center in regional and statewide workforce development partnerships and initiatives; maintain our close interaction and collaboration with our employer community; increase the participation of underrepresented groups; advance our efforts to create systemic educational change at the secondary and post-secondary levels; effectively assess the impact of our collective efforts on faculty and student learning; build collaboration with other ATE Centers on professional development, program development, skill standards and innovative instructional delivery options; create competency frameworks and degree models with broader regional and national impact; and ensure sustainability and institutionalization of TIME Center products and services.  The Center was very successful in meeting and exceeding its goals and objectives, creating substantial value and impact for our student, faculty, educational, employer and partner stakeholders. Secondary and post-secondary enrollments increased, underrepresented students increased their participation rates, high quality professional development activities served over 2,000 faculty, meaningful STEM activities en...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
