<AbstractNarration>This project involves a formal partnership to improve and positively impact the education of engineering technicians in an underdeveloped service area where recently announced economic development opportunities are creating 5,500-8,000 new jobs through a billion dollar industrial project. The partnership is a formal alliance of ten school districts; industry; a predominately minority technical college, a private Historically Black College or University (HBCU); and a publicly funded HBCU. The project also includes a State Department of Education (SDE) and the State Board for Technical and Comprehensive Education (SBTCE). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stated goal of the partnership is to increase both the number and diversity of students who enter and complete associate degrees in existing and emerging science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) cluster disciplines. It  accomplishes the following objectives: (1) Increasing both the number and diversity of students entering associate degree programs in the computer engineering, instrumentation, and other engineering technology disciplines through the implementation and articulation of high school STEM cluster majors (programs of study); (2) Improving success rates and professional advancement opportunities for transitioning students from both high schools and industry through a formal articulated K-16 STEM career pathway and Bridge Program designed to provide transition courses in science, mathematics and engineering technology; (3) Improving postsecondary delivery of science, mathematics, and technology workplace skills, focusing on Mechatronics, Advanced Manufacturing, and Computer Technology; and (4) Improving employer satisfaction with graduates in core competencies and workplace skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is promoting access to STEM careers and provides courses for under prepared students, especially women and under represented minorities. Strategies include high school STEM career majors and STEM College Academies that build on national models, such as Project Lead the Way; middle school STEM exploration activities and summer camps, high school Individual Graduation Plans; program revision that includes secondary and postsecondary faculty and student cooperative projects and mentoring using a technology platform for remote equipment and process diagnostics and collaboration; faculty development; and broad industry involvement in curriculum development, internships and co-op opportunities, scholarships, and Foundation support.</AbstractNarration>

The project aimed to affect over 1200 secondary and postsecondary students and over 45 secondary and postsecondary faculty.  Initiatives under the Diverse Engineering Pathways Project embraced area students, K-12 teachers and guidance counselors, college faculty and neighboring employers. As a result of the Diverse Engineering Pathways there are now 1353 students in area high schools who have declared a STEM major on their IGP, as captured by data collection and communication through database and technology tools, i.e. the web-based Palmetto Pathways Career System, Palmetto Pathways IGP System. The Diverse Engineering Pathways project exceeded its goal of attaining a 10% annual increase in the number of minorities enrolled in associate degree and certificate programs.  At implementation onset (fall 2007), there were 171 (baseline) non-white students enrolled in associate degree and certificate programs at OCtech.  In the second year of implementation 9/08 &ndash; 8/09), these programs recorded a total of 260 enrollees (a 52% increase).  During the project's third year, enrollment reached 375 students, more than doubling baseline data and a 44% increase over the project's prior year. Ninety-five (95) PLTW certified K-12 and postsecondary instructors participated in a one-day on-going training hosted by OCtech. The Project provided professional development to 100% of area guidance counselors, career development facilitators, and principals regarding the use of the ACT World of Work map and ACT assessment system products for use in career development and college readiness. Two faculty members have participated in PLTW Virtual Academy training on a continuing basis. One OCtech faculty member has become a national instructor for PLTW. The total new enrollees in OCtech STEM programs during the project's third year reached 375 students, more than doubling baseline data and a 44% increase over the project's prior year.  This suggests that OCtech will be instrumental in increasing the pipeline of stem-ready employees. Also, it should be noted that renovated OCtech space was designated as the campus "Innovation Center." This Project outcome will impact and enhance the scope of learning available to students. Of significance to funding agencies is the determination of "what works."   The Diverse Engineering Pathways Project ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
