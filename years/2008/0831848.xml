<AbstractNarration>As the evolution of living species is determined by few basic mechanisms, &lt;br/&gt;such as genetic heritage, genetic variation, and natural selection, &lt;br/&gt;it may be that the evolution of large-scale internetworks is similarly &lt;br/&gt;determined by simple, but still unknown, principles.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators aim to discover the fundamental character of network &lt;br/&gt;evolution, the laws that describe it, and ways in which networking &lt;br/&gt;researchers or innovators can effectively influence this process.&lt;br/&gt;This research can cause a paradigm shift in the way we understand the &lt;br/&gt;Internet and on how we attempt to introduce new features and correct its &lt;br/&gt;problems. The project also has a significant education component, including &lt;br/&gt;a new course that is cross-listed in the computer science and biology &lt;br/&gt;graduate programs of Georgia Tech. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first thread of this research focuses on the evolution of the &lt;br/&gt;Internet Autonomous System (AS) ecosystem. The goal is to better understand &lt;br/&gt;this complex and dynamic ecosystem, the behavior of entities that constitute &lt;br/&gt;it, and the nature of interactions between those entities. ASes attempt to &lt;br/&gt;optimize their utility or financial gains by dynamically changing the ASes &lt;br/&gt;they interact with, and thus by changing the organization of their ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;In the second research thread, the focus is on the evolution of network &lt;br/&gt;design and architecture and on the laws and principles that determine the &lt;br/&gt;evolution of large-scale internetworks. The investigators will explore &lt;br/&gt;questions about the price of evolution in network design, the trade-offs &lt;br/&gt;between evolutionary and clean-slate architectures and the evolutionary &lt;br/&gt;implications of layered network organization. The objective is not only to &lt;br/&gt;understand the evolution of the Internet, but also to provide concrete &lt;br/&gt;guidelines for the design of evolvable architectures for the Future Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
