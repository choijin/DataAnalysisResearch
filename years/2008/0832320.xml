<AbstractNarration>Recent field experiments in the High Plains of the United States indicate that severe thunderstorms emit infrasound at frequencies between 0.1 and 10 Hz much more intensely than non-severe weather systems.  The unsteady motion of a developing or mature tornado is one likely source of the relatively strong signal.  This hypothesis motivated a field study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to evaluate the use of infrasound detection for tornado warning.  The results were promising, but in order to improve the skill in distinguishing vortex signals from extraneous noise, it is essential to advance current knowledge of the various mechanisms that produce infrasound in a convective storm. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the general theory of vortex acoustics is highly developed, current understanding of the structure and unsteady motions of a developing tornado is limited. Consequently, there is no definitive theory for tornado infrasound. Moreover, there is insufficient understanding of the infrasound that is produced by other flow structures or diabatic cloud processes within a convective storm.  In the absence of detailed observations, numerical modeling provides the best method for obtaining the missing knowledge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will involve a systematic computational study of the production of infrasound by progressively complex forms of atmospheric convection.  The forms considered will include a dry thermal, a non-precipitating cumulus, a towering cumulonimbus and a non-supercell tornado. The dominant sources of 0.1-10 Hz infrasound will be identified.  The scaling of acoustic power (intensity) and peak emission frequencies with the control parameters of each convective system will be investigated.  Sensitivity to modifications of microphysics and subgrid turbulence parameterizations will be examined.  The principal studies will be carried out with a fully compressible version of the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System. Adaptation of the NCAR Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) for the purpose of studying infrasound will also be pursued. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research will explore a new frontier of atmospheric modeling: the simulation of infrasound generated by turbulence, microphysical processes and vortices in convective storms. The intellectual merit of this project lies in the effort to elucidate the physical processes that are responsible for generating detectable infrasound, and to clarify the exact structure of the acoustic emissions. The results will build a foundation for improving current methods to connect observed emissions to specific events or objects within an evolving storm. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The principal broader impact of this study is the potential for improvement of tornado warning by contributing to the refinement of infrasonic detection methods that are intended to compliment radar systems.  In addition, this project will further develop a synergy between the atmospheric science and aeroacoustical engineering communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Observational studies have shown that tornadic thunderstorms persistently emit infrasound with an unusually strong component in the 0.5-10 Hz frequency range  [A.J. Bedard Jr., Mon. Wea. Rev., 133, 241-263 (2005)].  A widely held view is that the 0.5-10 Hz signal is directly associated with a tornado, or with storm rotation conducive to tornado genesis.  If true, then infrasonic observations can be used to enhance tornado warning systems.  That being said, there remains some ambiguity in the interpretation of the data.  To reliably distinguish a vortex signal from extraneous noise, it is essential  to advance our fundamental understanding of the infrasound generated by vortices and other elements of a severe storm.  Since direct observation of acoustic sources in a severe storm is impractical, computer simulations may be the best method of investigation.  This avenue of research was explored with a customized version of the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (c-RAMS). Standard RAMS is a state-of-the-art weather research model that was developed over several decades by scientists and engineers in the atmospheric science community [Cotton et al., Meterol. Atmos. Phys., 82, 5-29 (2003)].  Customization was necessary to include acoustic sources that standard RAMS neglects for computational efficiency in more common applications.  Careful experiments with c-RAMS showed that several proposed mechanisms by which a tornado could generate discernible infrasound might not occur under ordinary circumstances.  This surprising result was attributed to oversights in earlier theories, which upon revision proved to be consistent with the experiments.  The experiments performed to date excluded some complicating factors by design, in order to cleanly test specific hypotheses.   More realistic simulations are planned for the next phase of research that will aim to resolve current discrepancies between c-RAMS and observations.  To assist future investigations, the PI developed a new computational tool for diagnosing the sources of infrasound in complex storm simulations.   The Infrasonic Source Analysis Routine (ISAR) will allow scientists to compare the infrasound generated by tornadic or turbulent wind fluctuations to the infrasound generated by phase transitions of moisture (or other processes) in a simulated storm.  Such comparisons will be necessary, in light of new theoretical developments that suggest the prevailing source of infrasound under certain conditions could be the condensation of water vapor that occurs during the mixing of temperature inhomogeneities in vigorous cloud turbulence.  At the onset of this research project, it was recognized that simulating phase transitions of cloud moisture is a subtle and imperfect component of any weather model.   It is part of the so-called "microphysics parameterization" that determines the amount and type of precipitation produced by a storm.  Notably, the microphysics parameterization controls heat and mass transfers between hydrometeors (cloud droplets, rain, hail, ice-crystals, etc.) and surrounding air.  Such transfers can be important sources of infrasound.  The variation of infrasonic emissions with different microphysics parameterizations was examined.  Changing the constraints (from one commonly used set to another) on the evolution of the hydrometeors only affected minor details of the infrasound.  However, changing basic parameters within realistic bounds, such as the average hydrometeor size or local relative humidity, dramatically changed the amplitude and duration of the emission.  Other subtleties were discovered during the course of research, such as the potential contamination of infrasound by spurious emissions during the conversion of hail into rain.  Such discoveries underscored a need to further elucidate the acoustic peculiarities of standard microphysics parameterizations and eliminate any defects that could weaken the credibility of future simulations.
