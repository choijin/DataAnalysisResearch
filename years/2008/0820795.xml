<AbstractNarration>The End User Opt-In Working Group, which is one of five Working Groups dedicated to particular areas of technical design for a suite of experimental network infrastructure currently in its planning stages, holds three workshops each year that, on a continuing basis: 1) identify and resolve design issues, 2) identify areas of technical risk, 3) review documents prepared by the GENI Project Office, and 4) engage in outreach. This award gives the co-chairs funds for their participation in a one-year set of workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By having an open, transparent, well-managed design process, the community will have ample opportunities to comment and contribute to the design of a suite of experimental network infrastructure. Engaging the community early in the design process will ensure that the infrastructure will have the functionality and capabilities required by many in the research community. Workshop topics include: detailed open design issues and tradeoffs, risk assessment and mitigation, common vocabulary and models, design and integration activities, use cases, and the evaluation of software and services, for example. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chairs will be responsible for workshop preparation, chairing workshops, results dissemination, and progress reporting. These funds will enable the chairs to recruit a diverse set of attendees, conduct and attend meetings, and broadly disseminate the results.</AbstractNarration>
