<AbstractNarration>This award establishes Virginia Polytechnic Institute as a research site of the Industry/University Collaborative Research Center (IUCRC) for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing. Other sites of this collaborative research center include the University of Florida (2007), George Washington University (2007), and Brigham Young University (2008). Reconfigurable computing (RC) technology can be divided into two areas of use: High Performance Computing (HPC) and High Performance Embedded Computing (HPEC). RC technology is used in the field of HPC to accelerate demanding computations that would otherwise be performed in software on a large-scale computing system. RC technology is used in HPEC to create high-performance embedded computing solutions in areas such as signal and image processing, real-time vision, cryptography, and network processing. The mission of this center is to investigate, develop, and evaluate new concepts, methods, infrastructure, and tools in reconfigurable HPC and HPEC, from building-block devices to infrastructure to applications, and advance these technologies through research and education for the benefit of center members, students, and the discipline at large. The research BYU will address; 1) Novel Core Architectures and Related Components for Aerospace &amp; Defense Applications, 2) Application Mapping of HPC Codes to High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing Systems, 3) Profiling, Analysis, &amp; Performance Optimization for Reconfigurable Computing Applications, 4) Middleware, Interfaces, &amp; other Infrastructure for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing should significantly enhance the U.S. effort to maintain a strong leadership position within their area of information technology. It may also serve to bring industry and users together to define common standards. Industry members, researchers and students will gain from the interactions throughout the life of the research center. Advances in RC affect virtually all disciplines of science and engineering which require high-performance computing, be it mainframe-oriented or embedded. RC technology promises to produce computing systems combining the flexibility of software-programmable computations with the computational power of custom hardware. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    In its first six years of operation, CHREC has been one of the most successful Phase-I I/UCRC centers at NSF. Despite economic recession and other national setbacks, CHREC has grown since 2007 to have more than 40 full memberships with almost 30 industry members during Phase 1. Scholarship has been strong throughout this period, in terms of refereed journal and conference publications. Graduations, especially Ph.D. and M.S. students, have also been strong. Our industry members are very pleased with CHREC and find it to be highly effective in terms of R&amp;D achievement, technology transfer, recruiting, and return on investment.   The value attained by the CHREC Center is of major significance to all participants. For NSF, its mission to "promote the progress of science," to "advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare," and to "secure the national defense" is directly supported at minimal cost. For the university sites, their mission of success in basic and applied research with high-quality graduate education is fulfilled. For the industry members of the Center, their research and development needs are directly addressed by the research thrusts of the Center and specific tasks within each thrust, typically at a small fraction of the cost of pursuing and funding the same tasks outside of the Center. Each industry member of CHREC plays a key role in selecting and monitoring tasks of mutual interest, and ultimately reaping the benefits of the research via technology transfer and student recruitment to industry and ultimately the marketplace.   The Virginia Tech CHREC site, through the support of the industrial affiliates and the National Science Foundation, has completed several projects, and worked with the affiliates in transferring the technology.  The projects include:  V1-08: Model-Based Engineering Framework for HPRC Applications   V2-08: Process-to-Core Mapping for Advanced Architectures  V3-08: Advancing HPRC Development Environments  V1-09: Characterizing and Optimizing Emerging Devices  V3-09: Autonomous Adaptive Systems  V1-10: On the Performance, Programmability, and Power of Accelerators  V1-11: On the Performance, Programmability, and Power of Accelerators  V2-11- Back-end Productivity Enhancements for HPC  V1-12: Performance, Programmability, and Portability of Heterogenous Computing V2-12: End-to-End Tool Flow for FPGA Productivity       The VT site directors have been active in organizing several national and international  conferences on technologies related to the CHREC theme. Over the course of this project, some of the  activities include: International Conference on Field Programmable Logic, International  Conference on ReConFigurable Computing and FPGAs, International Symposium on Applied  Reconfigurable Computing, Supercomputing, and the NII Shonan Workshop.
