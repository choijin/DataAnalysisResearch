<AbstractNarration>This award is for a project to build an ultra-stable frequency calibrator for high resolution optical spectrography using a comb laser. The purpose of developing such a system is to be able to extend the indirect detection of extra-solar planets to lower mass objects, i.e. those comparable to the Solar System's terrestrial planets rather than the gas-giants. The indirect spectroscopic techniques have proven to be successful at finding extra-solar planets and the technology to be developed in this award will permit the spectral line positional changes of the parent star, which infer the existence and mass of a planetary companion, to be measured to significantly higher accuracy than before, thereby extending the technique to lower mass planets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will demonstrate that comb lasers can be used for this application and the technology and techniques will be distributed to the general community.  In addition, undergraduate and graduate students will undergo training in instrumentation.  This is a very topical field and the existence of extra-solar planets, especially those resembling the Earth, will capture the public imagination.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project we developed and tested a new type of laser-based device to enable precise calibration of the spectral analysis capability of astronomical telescopes and spectrographs used for searches for planets around other stars ("exoplanets").  We refer to this laser calibration device as an "astro-comb," as it employs a special type of laser known as a laser frequency comb, which can be referenced to atomic clocks and modified for wavelength calibration of stellar light observed with telescopes and analyzed with spectrographs.  The astro-comb we developed in this project operates over about a 100 nanometer span in the near-infrared part of the optical spectrum.  After fabrication and testing of the red astro-comb in our laboratory at the Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, MA, we relocated the device to the Whipple Observatory on Mt. Hopkins, AZ, and operated it successfully as a wavelength calibrator for the TRES spectrograph, used with the Tillinghast telescope (which has a 1.5 meter diameter mirror).  The results from this project pave the way to improved precision and stability of astrophysical spectroscopy using astro-combs.  As a broader impact of this research, we showed that laser frequency combs, which had previously been delicate laboratory instruments, can be successfully adapted for long-term operation in non-laboratory environments such as mountain-top astronomical observatories.  Students and postdoctoral researchers were active participants in all phases of this research: design, construction, and execution of experiments; detailed calculations; analysis of data; presentation of results at scientific meetings; and writing scientific papers.  In addition, the investigators on this NSF-supported project described the scientific process and results in a wide variety of presentations ranging from scientific conferences and seminars to public lectures.
