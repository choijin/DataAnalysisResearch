<AbstractNarration>The goals of the Computer Science and Information Technology and Systems (CS/ITS) Cohort Scholarship Program are to recruit and graduate an initial cohort of academically-talented and financially-disadvantaged students; to improve the program for future cohorts, and to recruit new cohorts each year. Full scholarships are provided to an initial cohort of 12 eligible students. The college covers the remainder of the cost of attendance after all financial aid and NSF scholarships are awarded. Process and outcome evaluations are conducted. Results are used to modify the program as needed to benefit future cohorts that are enrolled each subsequent academic year. &lt;br/&gt;Planning focuses on coordinating academic and social support structures needed to recruit and retain students. A freshman year experience establishes the cohort as a learning community through a four-day summer orientation, a two-semester course in game development and design, a self-management course with an information technology focus, and shared housing. Throughout their college experience, supplemental instruction and tutoring, industry mentoring and career placement services, applied research and internship opportunities, and extracurricular activities are offered to cohort students. Students are paired with industry mentors and based on their skills and interests have opportunities to work directly with industry through internships and applied research. An existing game development program is expanded to a two-course sequence to introduce computer science and information technology concepts and best practices. Applications include scientific visualization, modeling, and physics and mathematical simulations, and training. Cohort students may choose to pursue further game studies through the Game Design and Programming Concentration or elect to pursue other concentrations within the CS/ITS major.&lt;br/&gt;The project broadens the participation of underrepresented groups in computer science and information technology systems and enhances the infrastructure for research, education, mentoring, and employment opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to increase the number and the diversity of computer science and information technology (CS/ITS) graduates.  With NSF funding, Marist offered full tuition, room and board scholarships to a cohort of 12 academically-talented and financially-disadvantaged students.  The students were recruited from across the country and entered Marist as freshmen in fall 2010.  The PI, the school Dean, and the Director of the Academic Learning Center acted as advisors for all 12 students.  A special freshman learning community was set up for the students.  They were housed in the same residence hall, took two specially designed freshman game development courses, two mathematics courses and a tailored self-management course as a cohort    Programs were developed to stimulate student interest and persistence in the major.  Students were given a solid structure of academic and financial support.  They participated in applied research projects and paid internships, and worked with industry mentors and tutors.  Several students studied abroad (e.g. UK, Japan, Italy) for a semester during their junior year.  The original cohort consisted of nine young men and three young women in the class of 2014.  Ten of the original 12 graduated with degrees in either CS or IT in in May 2014.  One of the original cohort students left Marist for personal reasons at the end of his freshman year.  A new student entered Marist in September 2011 as a freshman replacing the student who left.  The new student is on track to graduate in May 2015 with a degree in CS. One of the original cohort students is pursuing her M.S. in IS at Marist. Another was Valedictorian for the College in May 2014 and was hired by a Fortune 500 financial institution upon graduation.  Yet another co-founded a new software business that was already highly profitable by the time he graduated.  The NSF Scholarship program proved very effective in attracting students to the CS and ITS majors.   Marist College continues to offer a number of full Technology Scholarships each year.  Goldman Sachs now provides funding each year for 3 additional full scholarships modeled after the NSF Technology Scholarships.  A total of 17 full scholarships were awarded to CS/ITS majors who entered Marist as freshmen in September 2014.  Marist's Admissions Office promotes all the Technology Scholarships during their recruitment visits across the country.  They also promote the scholarships to all students visiting the college and hold a special Technology Open House each October.  Admissions ensures that they visit schools that have a high percentage of ethnically underrepresented students.  The scholarships have clearly increased the number of applications and enrollments in Marist's School of Computer Science and Mathematics, e.g. CS/ITS applications were 398 in 2013 and grew to 686 in 2014, a 72.4% increase.  Enrollments increased from the 54 in 2013 to 119 in 2014, a 120% increase.  The 4 year graduation rate for the cohort students exceeded 83%, with 10 cohort members of the original 12 graduating on time in May 2014 with bachelor degrees in either CS or IT.  Comparisons of the cohortÆs four-year graduation rate show that it exceeds at a statistically significant level (p &lt; .05) the four-year graduation rate at the national level (all, public, nonprofit, and for-profit), New York State institutions (public and private), as well as MaristÆs prior graduation rates for computer science.  Many of the cohort students participated in the School Open House events each October, greeting prospective students and their parents and talking with them about the technology majors at Marist. The cohort students studied and socialized together, even forming a group on one of the major social networking sites. They often attended off-campus events together.  The cohort model and the special Self-Management course, tutoring sessions, social outings, and resume preparation workshops have proved to be ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
