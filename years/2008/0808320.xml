<AbstractNarration>Biological invasions are one of our most pressing conservation challenges.  These invasions are currently considered to be one of the major drivers of global biodiversity loss, among other ills.  This research examines the mechanisms and effects of one unusual invasion: the introduction of the coconut palm throughout the Pacific.  Specifically, this work looks at the negative association between the relative abundances of this palm and of seabirds.  Seabirds will not use the coconut palm as habitat; therefore palm-invaded islands become depleted in the nutrients these birds usually bring from the ocean to the land. Because the tree species native to these islands are adapted to the higher nutrient conditions usually created by the birds, they can no longer compete and regenerate in these new, more nutrient deprived conditions. The seabird decline thus ultimately results in an invasion spiral of coconut palms.  This research also examines other potential feedbacks in this invasion, such as increases to predation on native species seeds or seedlings in invaded forests.  This work has important applications to conservation science and management.  On a global scale, by increasing knowledge of the breadth of invasion mechanisms, this work will provide insight into the best way to manage invasive species and prevent their future spread. Regionally, it will provide tangible recommendations about how this widely used crop should be managed in the Pacific.  Finally, by demonstrating the role seabirds play in maintaining native species, it will expand our knowledge about the importance of seabirds and their conservation.</AbstractNarration>
