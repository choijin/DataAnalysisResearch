<AbstractNarration>The project is a collaborative effort between a four-year school (Arizona State University) and five non-metropolitan feeder schools (Arizona Western College, Central Arizona College, Cochise College, Eastern Arizona College, and Mohave Community College). The team is working to significantly increase the number of transfer students, especially women and underrepresented minority students, that graduate in engineering and computer science. In order to accomplish this, they are: 1) providing scholarships to students in the feeder schools and to transfer students at Arizona State University , 2) supporting student outreach activities at the feeder schools, 3) supporting engineering courses at the feeder schools by providing materials, tutoring, local engineering speakers, and tuition scholarships, 4) conducting "Be an Engineer" events at the feeder schools for both students and their parents, 5) providing classes, workshops, and seminars using live broadcast and videotape, 6) providing an engaged community of mentors with extensive experience and commitment for all students, 7) hosting an orientation at Arizona State University for engineering transfer students, 8) managing a center where engineering transfer students can study together and get the support needed to survive, and 9) working with transfer students through a time-tested "career shaping" academic scholarship workshop program. The project is building on an earlier successful program between Arizona State University and a set of metropolitan community colleges with similar goals. Evaluation efforts, involving formative and summative aspects, are being conducted by internal and external evaluators who are developing and monitoring indices for enrollment, persistence, and graduation. Broader impacts include the development and dissemination of models for collaboration between community colleges and four-year schools and the efforts to increase the number of women and minorities in engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Participation in this grant was as a partner with Arizona State University, who was the major "owner" of the grant.  It connected engineering programs at Arizona community colleges with the ASU Fulton Schools of Engineering.  Some of the major accomplishments of this grant project (followed by example statistics) were as follows:  Provided opportunities for Cochise College students to attend an orientation at ASU specifically for engineering transfer students (for the 2013-2104 school year, a total of 26 students participated; for 2012-2013, 27 students; for 2010-2011; 15 students).  Provide tuition scholarships to engineering and mechatronics students (for 2013-2014, 5 scholarships were awarded; for 2010-11, 15 were awarded).  Organize and meet with an Advisory Board composed of local engineering industry professionals (STEM advisory board meetings were held in conjunction with CIS instructors and professionals in 2010-2013; in 2014, the Engineering part of the advisory board became own board to better serve the Engineering program).  Conducted three "Engineering Night" events on the Cochise College campuses for college students and local HS students and their parents (this was done in 2011, 2012 and 2013).  The grant ended in June 2014, however, a no-cost extention for 2014-2015 was requested for a very small amount of remaining funds, which were used to fund small engineering student projects and send students to ASU to learn more about the ASU EGR program.  This no-cost extention ended in June 2015.  Cochise College is currently a partner in ASUÃ†s application for another similar grant for engineering programs.  For more information about this completed project, the official NSF Project Report for Award ID 0856852 may be consulted.
