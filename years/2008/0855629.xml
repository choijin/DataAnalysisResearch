<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the study of collisions between polarized electrons (with well-defined spin) and chiral, or "handed" molecules as well as simple diatomic molecules.  These experiments address physics questions about the dynamics of electron-molecule scattering, particularly with regard to the role played by electron spin in such collisions. They would also provide important information for applications requiring knowledge of basic electron-molecule scattering cross sections, including the modeling of industrial, astrophysical, and atmospheric plasmas.  Improved sources and analyzers of polarized electrons will also be developed.  This latter work holds the promise of providing new analytical tools for biological and materials research, and for industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These experiments will have an impact beyond the immediate community of atomic, molecular, and optical science. In addition to its broader scientific implications, this work will have a significant educational component. Undergraduates working on these projects will have their first experience in scientific research. In an effort to expand the talent pool for atomic, molecular, and optical physics, women and underrepresented minorities will be especially recruited for these positions. The experiments with chiral molecules and their connection to astrobiological issues make an excellent topic for talks that will be given regularly to high school and civic groups, and serve to illustrate the beauty of basic physics to a large lay audience.</AbstractNarration>
