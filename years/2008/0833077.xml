    <AbstractNarration>ARI:MA- Novel neutron detectors made of conjugated polymers and inorganic nanoparticles: New Science and Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is the development of two novel neutron detection systems, polymer quantum rods and inorganic semiconductor nanoparticle composites, and elucidating the fundamental mechanisms underlying the operation of these systems. An understanding of the device physics and the creation of new material systems could create new science and transform neutron detection technology. The proposed approaches employ non-vacuum techniques of semiconductor film deposition, reducing device fabrication cost, enabling large-area detector films, and facilitating dispersion of the neutron sensitizing materials throughout the detector active layer.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed research is a deeper understanding of high performance novel composites for neutron detection device applications. The proposed investigations will generate information about the interplay between the structural order, charge transfer, and carrier transport in composites made of both organic polymer quantum rod and inorganic semiconductor nanoparticle neutron-sensitizing materials.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the research could lead to the development of large area, and low cost "printable" neutron detectors for guarding against dangerous radioactive materials and weapons entering the United States. Also, the proposed research is involved with developing novel semiconductor systems that are compatible with large-area semiconductor films that are of interest to other applications, such as low cost solar cells, another important and urgent societal need. Finally, the research experience gained by the students and post docs engaged with this project will benefit society at large and them in particular by exposing them to state of the art experimental techniques in a cutting edge research area.</AbstractNarration>
