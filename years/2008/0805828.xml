<AbstractNarration>Motivated by considerations in topology, geometry, arithmetic and group theory the proposal intends to study real, complex and quaternionic hyperbolic manifolds. This will involve the study of discrete groups, their connections with number theory, and expanding graphs. We will also explore various interconnections between these topics with a view to better understanding the topology of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three dimensional manifolds are locally like the space we live in and understanding these objects have been one of the central themes of research in the last 30 years.  The importance of these objects extends far beyond their intrinsic interest, since their study connects to mathematical physics, mathematical biology and computer science. One of the aims of this proposal is to explore some of these connections via families of "expanding graphs". These graphs are well-known in computer science because of their importance in building efficient networks. Remarkably, this is connected to the main study of the proposal, "finite covers of 3-manifolds".&lt;br/&gt;By their nature, many of the problems in the proposal are cross-disciplinary, and hence progress will have a broader impact. In addition, these have proved to be fertile grounds for the training of graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The study of spaces that look locally like 3-dimensional space in which we live has been a central theme of research since the late 1970's. These spaces called 3-dimensional manifolds are at the intersection of large variety of mathematical discplines as well having links to computer science, physics and biology.   In particular, the study of these manifolds can be done from a variety of viewpoints: their classification, analyzing geometric properties such distance on the manifold or volume of the manifold, as well as properties of 1 - and 2-dimensional submanifolds of these 3-dimensional manifolds.  This in turn leads to connections with group theory, number theory, combinatorics, and representation theory.  Over the course of the grant the PI worked on problems related to the above discussion.  Some highlights of the results obtained during the award are:  Work with M. Lackenby (Oxford) and D. D. Long(UCSB) that describes arithmetic aspects of  certain 3-dimensional manifolds,as wellas developing a deeper connections with   discrete mathematics through our work related to so-called expander  graphs.  Work with my former Ph.D student D. B. McReynolds (now at Purdue University)  that introduced a new spectrum for certain of these 3-dimensional manifolds. This,  by analogy with the length spectrum, counts with multiplities of certain 2-dimensional submanifolds of  a fixed  type.  In more recent work with M. R. Bridson (Oxford) and M.Conder(Auckland) we have taken as motivation a recognition problem for the so-called fundamental group of 3-dimensional manifolds to answer a classsification type problem for certain classes of groups. This bring new tools from very different areas of mathematics to bear and will liable have much more application.  The broader impacts have mainly been on the PI's continued training Ph.D students.  The subject matter that the PI studies is well-suited to training students and the PI has had a strong record in this regard.  The PI has been invited to many national and international conferences to deliver lectures on the work described above.
