<AbstractNarration>0808399&lt;br/&gt;Shabana&lt;br/&gt;This project supports collaborative research by Dr. Ahmed Shabana, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Illinois at Chicago and Dr. Sayed Metwalli, Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt. The objective of this project is to develop a new methodology for integrating computer aided design (CAD) systems and flexible multi-body codes (FMC). This new methodology will allow for the design optimization, numerical simulation and visualization of multi-body system computer models that consist of interconnected rigid and deformable bodies. In developing the computer procedures that will be used in this investigation, the new and challenging problems of integrating optimization and design sensitivity analysis methods with large deformation finite element formulations in flexible multi-body system algorithms will be addressed. Successful integration will lead to a new generation of simulation codes that can be used in the large deformation analysis, design and performance evaluation of many mechanical and aerospace systems. The main application that will be considered in this project is vehicle dynamics. Special attention will be given to study the rollover scenarios of sport utility vehicles (SUV). Optimal design of the suspension system that consist of rigid and flexible bodies, shock absorbers, and leaf springs modeled using large deformation finite element formulations will be sought in order to improve the vehicle stability and avoid rollover resulting from brake sudden application at high speeds. Cairo University has a strong research program in the CAD and design optimization area, while the University of Illinois at Chicago has a strong program in the area of flexible multi-body dynamics and computational mechanics. Both institutions have extensive experience in software development. In particular, Cairo University developed a CAD software that has been licensed to industry and various academic institutions in North America and Egypt. Integration of this software with general purpose flexible multi-body system algorithms will be explored in this collaborative research project. It is believed that such an integration of two advanced approaches will lead to a new and sophisticated design environment that will have a significant impact on education, design methodologies and research in this field.  Both UIC and Cairo University have ongoing funded research projects in this research area.&lt;br/&gt;Technical Merit: The integration of CAD and design optimization techniques with large deformation finite element/multibody system algorithms is the subject of this proposal. This a new and emerging area which requires multi-disciplinary efforts from two institutions with different technical expertise as previously described in this summary. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The accurate analysis and successful design of detailed models requires the use of efficient iterative optimization procedures. The successful integration of CAD and large deformation finite element/multibody system algorithms is necessary for the design and virtual prototyping of such detailed models. The resulting new design environment will have, as previously mentioned, significant impact on the design procedures used in industry and academic institutions. The results obtained in this research project can also significantly impact the way computational design methods are taught at our educational institutions.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
