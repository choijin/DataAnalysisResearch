<AbstractNarration>This project seeks the financial support from the NSF Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation for eight graduate students, post-docs, and junior faculty to accompany their faculty advisor to attend the 8th International Conference on Frontiers of Design and Manufacturing (ICFDM) in Tianjin, China on September 23-26, 2008.  ICFDM is held every two years as a venue for exchange and cooperation among researchers in the field of design and manufacturing science. It is also a platform for promotion of the development of design and manufacturing technology. NSF has supported the past ICFDM conferences. The intellectual merit is on the learning and exchanging of novel ideas and new research results from top researchers around the world.  This year, the theme for the conference is Innovation and Development of Design and Manufacturing Technology.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference has traditionally provided an opportunity to bring together worldwide academic researchers and industrial practitioners for the exchange of the latest development and applications in advanced design and manufacturing science and technologies and for promoting research collaborations. The broad impacts are not only for US researchers and students participating in the conference but also for participants from China and other countries in the world.  The co-sponsors of this conference include the National Natural Science Foundation of China, National Science Foundation (USA), Shien-Ming Wu Foundation (USA), American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME), Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society (CMES), and Tianjin University.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
