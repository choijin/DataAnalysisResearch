    <AbstractNarration>This project is the first comparative analysis of the anatomy and evolution of the reproductive ducts and sexual glands of lizards and snakes. The study will reveal the diversity of structural similarities and differences among reproductive organs of lizards and snakes, and relate these findings to what is known in mammals and other vertebrate groups. A wide variety of lizards and snakes will be analyzed at the tissue and cellular levels using light and electron microscopy. Such a comprehensive survey of the cellular complexity of reproductive characters is unprecedented at this level in evolutionary studies on animals. &lt;br/&gt; The relationship of reproductive cytology to the diversification of lizards and snakes, and the consistency of cellular evolution of reproductive characters to results based upon other characters, will greatly interest those who study comparative biology. The findings may challenge some long-standing hypotheses about reproductive evolution and encourage the broader use of cellular reproductive characters in analyses of relationships among animals. The research will positively impact the infrastructure for research at an institution where 35% of college students are first generation college attendees and most students work throughout their college years. Funds will aid in the recruitment of quality students and broaden the participation of under-represented groups in biological research.</AbstractNarration>
