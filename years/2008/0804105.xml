<AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;Virtually all processes, most importantly those used in energy production and distribution, involve friction or resistance, with the consequence that the processes suffer significant losses of energy.  However, a major result of modern physics (specifically quantum mechanics) is the existence of substances which have absolutely no friction or resistance.  Notable examples include superconductors, which can carry electrical currents with no energy loss and are candidates for future electric energy applications, and superfluids, which can flow without viscosity.  A very recent discovery is the supersolid, which despite being a solid, can flow like a superfluid.  How this can happen is currently a mystery, and a thorough scientific understanding of the phenomenon is necessary before any applications may be considered.  As has been found for superconductors, the understanding of a "super" phenomenon may be advanced through measurements of the substance's elastic properties, or its rebound response to an applied force.  This award supports a project that will incorporate a new method for measuring elastic properties of a supersolid in an attempt to increase our understanding of this material. The research will train young scientists in state-of-the-art methods of the often overlooked, but nontheless important, field of acoustics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;One of the most remarkable recent discoveries in condensed matter physics has been the experimental observation of a supersolid state for 4He.  It is quite an astounding phenomenon, and its physical origin remains a mystery.  Most experimental studies involve a torsional oscillator, with the conventional interpretation that an increase in the oscillator's natural frequency indicates a "lost mass" which occurs when part of the helium in the cell becomes supersolid.  Complete decoupling of a solid requires that the solid's shear elastic modulus and its shear viscosity vanish completely.  An alternate possibility is that the frequency of the torsional oscillator increases because the 4He shear elastic modulus increases, and recent experimental measurements provide evidence for this possibility.  This individual investigator award supports a project to make precise measurements of the 4He elastic constants over a range of temperatures passing through the supersolid transition. Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, in which measurements of the cell's natural frequencies of vibration, together with a numerical (finite element) model of the cell, will be used to determine the elastic constants of the 4He.  The research will train young scientists in novel methods of acoustics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this research was to understand how a solid might appear to flow like a liquid with no viscosity or friction; such an unusual state of matter is called a supersolid.  While superconductors, which are wires through which electrical currents can flow without resistance, and superfluids, which are liquids which can flow without viscosity, have been known to exist for some time, it was believed that such frictionless flow was not possible for solids. That a solid might undergo flow like a superfluid was a major breakthrough in science.   The experiment which indicated that solids might undergo frictionless flow involved a rigid can which contained solid helium.  The can was attached to a torsion spring which allowed the can to twist back and forth (oscillate) at a particular frequency, referred to as the natural frequency of the can and spring system.  As the temperature of the system was lowered below a certain value, the natural frequency increased.  Such an observation was common for superfluids, and had a well established interpretation, as follows:  Above a certain temperature (referred to as the critical temperature), the superfluid is just a normal fluid with viscosity, and the viscosity causes the fluid to be dragged along with the can, contributing to the oscillating mass.  However, below the critical temperature, the fluid loses its viscosity (becoming the proper superfluid), and it is no longer dragged along with the can and it no longer contributes to the oscillating mass.  With less mass, the can is able to oscillate faster, and this accounts for the increase of the natural frequency as the temperature is lowered below the critical value.   Because a can filled with solid helium resulted in an observation similar to that for a superfluid, it was assumed that the solid, in a fashion analogous to that of a superfluid, had lost its viscosity and had become a supersolid. Unfortunately, this interpretation for solid helium had a shortcoming due to the fact that fluids and solids are fundamentally different: while both fluids and solids have viscosity or friction, solids have an additional property not possessed by fluids; solids have a spring-like (elastic) restoring force when layers of the solid are made to slide parallel to each other (shear).  By definition, fluids have no shear elastic force.  While the increase of the natural frequency for a can containing solid helium could be explained by a loss of viscosity, it could also be explained by a change in the solid's shear elastic force.  Thus a proper interpretation of the torsional oscillator results required a thorough study of the elastic properties of solid helium.   If the oscillating can result were to be explained with the solid helium shear elasticity, questions as to why the the elastic property changes with temperature and why the change is sufficiently large to account for the observed natural frequency increase had to be considered.  A theoretical model which addressed these questions involved the behavior of defects (deviations from perfect crystal structure) and their effect on the elastic properties of a solid. The experimental studies undertaken in this research program provided a thorough probe of the elastic properties of solid helium and verified the viability of the defect theory for the experimental observations on solid helium.   The research program trained undergraduate and graduate students in methods of contemporary physical acoustics, which is often overlooked in physics curricula.  Such acoustic methods are critical in the fields of medical imaging, geo-physical exploration, earthquake ond other seismic monitoring, and non-destructive testing of materials, including objects in industrial production, in our aging nuclear arsenal, etc.       Last Modified: 05/23/2013       Submitted by: Julian D Maynard]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
