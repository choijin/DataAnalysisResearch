<AbstractNarration>Arguably, both dark energy and inflation can currently be viewed more as paradigms than theories, since a compelling, underlying mechanism for each is still to be found. By contrast, the precision, angular coverage and depth of astrophysical observations are increasing at an impressive rate. Crucially, a number of multi-color imaging and spectroscopic large scale structure surveys are taking observations, or are being actively developed.  Dr. Rachel Bean (Cornell University) will establish the required theoretical tools and observational requirements to ensure that the large scale structure cosmological surveys in progress, or being developed, in the coming five years will be optimally applied to decipher and constrain the full array of signatures that dark energy and inflation can leave. The work will also detail the observational implications of tightly delineated theories of brane inflation and alternative theories of gravity that promise distinctive properties, but which have not, as yet, been studied in the necessary detail. In combination, these approaches will yield an improved insight into the physical origins of these two, major, outstanding questions in cosmology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program to be carried out under this award actively involves training of undergraduate and graduate students. One emphasis is on increasing interaction between the Cornell Physics and Astronomy students, giving each opportunities to develop both an understanding of, and research experience in, the underlying theories and how experimental data are used to judge a theory's merit.  Dr. Bean will also develop a middle-school "Afterschool Universe" program in astronomy and cosmology, in collaboration with the Cornell Department of Astronomy education and public outreach (EPO) coordinator.  The joint goal of Dr. Bean and the EPO coordinator is specifically to increase opportunities and involvement in physical sciences for under-represented communities in the upstate New York region.  In addition, Dr. Bean will continue giving lectures on topics in fundamental physics and the "cosmos as the ultimate laboratory" for New York State school teachers with the Cornell Center for Nanoscale Science Institute for Physics Teachers. Dr. Bean will also make a second online lecture for the Cornell Adult University "Cyber-Tower". The materials associated with the lectures, and the online lectures themselves, will be available online to educators and the public.</AbstractNarration>
