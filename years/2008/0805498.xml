<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2008. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Ludmilla Aristilde is "Investigating Cellular Regulation in Marine Phytoplankton" The host institution for this research is Princeton University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Fran√ßois M. M. Morel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phytoplankton in the ocean play a major role in global carbon and sulfur cycles by creating and secreting many different carbon-rich and sulfur-containing compounds, which affect both the chemistry of the ocean and the dynamics of microbial and algal foodwebs. Using Emilina huxleyi as a model organism, this research seeks to understand how and where in the cell one of these sulfur-containing compounds, dimethylsulfoniopropionate, is synthesized and the relationship of this synthesis to photosynthetic reactions in the plankton.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The training objectives are to learn a combination of microbiological and biochemical techniques to address a problem of global importance at the molecular level and to work at the interface of environmental health and environmental biology. As atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide continue to increase and the temperature of the ocean surface also continues to rise, plankton species may be seen to alter their metabolism including their rates of photosynthesis.  This research promises to have broader impacts by contributing to the assessment of the impacts of future climate change on the earth's ecosystems.</AbstractNarration>

Principal Investigator: Ludmilla Aristilde  Supervisor: Joshua D. Rabinowitz  Institution: Institute of Integrative Genomics, Princeton University   The last two years of the project, the focus was on understanding how Clostridium acetobutylicum, which is among the soil anaerobic bacteria exploited for biofuel production, utilize the different sugar compounds typically present in cellulosic wastes and convert it to fuel-worthy compounds. This study aimed at providing insight for biotechnological optimization of the use of complex cellulosic materials in fuel production and contributing to an understanding how anaerobic bacteria actively participate and contribute to the cycling of carbon in the environment. Our results show how C. acetobutylicum simultaneously feeds on different sugars, glucose and xylose, as their carbon sources and incorporate them into their biomass. Specifically, it was found that, when both sugars are present, glucose was preferred over xylose such that glucose is used predominantly to generate energy, precursors to proteins, and the production of fuels.
