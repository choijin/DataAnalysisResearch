<AbstractNarration>Ward&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807033&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The main object of this project is to develop new methods&lt;br/&gt;and tools for the analysis and synthesis of scattered data by&lt;br/&gt;means of radial and related basis functions.  Very recently, the&lt;br/&gt;investigators Ward and Narcowich and a collaborator introduced a&lt;br/&gt;new tool for fitting a divergence-free vector field tangent to a&lt;br/&gt;2D orientable surface contained in 3D to samples of such a field&lt;br/&gt;taken at scattered sites on the surface.  The method, which&lt;br/&gt;involves a kernel constructed from radial basis functions (RBFs),&lt;br/&gt;has applications to problems in geophysics -- for instance, the&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear flow of an incompressible fluid in a single hydrostatic&lt;br/&gt;atmospheric layer.  Mathematically, incompressibility translates&lt;br/&gt;to the velocity having vanishing surface divergence.  Fitting&lt;br/&gt;divergence-free tangent vector fields to data taken in these&lt;br/&gt;cases would help in modeling the incompressible velocity fields&lt;br/&gt;involved.  In addition to handling scattered data, it has the&lt;br/&gt;advantage of avoiding special treatment for the poles.  The&lt;br/&gt;investigators study the approximation properties of this tool,&lt;br/&gt;with a view towards estimates on its data-fitting errors as well&lt;br/&gt;how robust it is.  For certain cases, numerical experiments&lt;br/&gt;suggest both a good fit of data and robustness.  In addition,&lt;br/&gt;unstructured scattered data -- i.e., clumped, or clustered, or&lt;br/&gt;nonuniformly distributed data -- present problems for any method,&lt;br/&gt;including the traditional RBF-type algorithms based on translates&lt;br/&gt;of one conditionally positive definite function.  These clustered&lt;br/&gt;data occur naturally in learning theory, neural nets, meshless&lt;br/&gt;methods, and other situations.  To deal with clustered data, the&lt;br/&gt;investigators initiate the study of the construction of new&lt;br/&gt;bases, preconditioners, and in general a new RBF-type paradigm. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Problems that involve analyzing data taken from scattered&lt;br/&gt;sites -- that is, irregularly placed sites -- in space or on the&lt;br/&gt;surface of the earth arise frequently in diverse fields:&lt;br/&gt;computer-aided design graphics, data mining, medical imaging,&lt;br/&gt;learning networks, and geoscience, in addition to many other&lt;br/&gt;areas.  Such problems present difficulties for traditional&lt;br/&gt;methods, which are based on collecting data at uniformly placed&lt;br/&gt;sites.  For example, weather prediction is based on a&lt;br/&gt;mathematical model where the earth's surface is assumed to be a&lt;br/&gt;surface of a sphere.  The investigators develop new methods and&lt;br/&gt;tools to help in analyzing such phenomena via so-called radial&lt;br/&gt;basis function methods. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
