<AbstractNarration>Principle Investigator: Patrick H. Masson &lt;br/&gt;NSF Proposal Number IOS-0821884&lt;br/&gt;Title: Arabidopsis WVD2 and WDL Proteins Modulate Cell Expansion and Growth Behavior.&lt;br/&gt;Abstract. Plant organs grow using a combination of localized cell divisions at apical structures called the meristems, and cell expansion in sub-apical regions. The patterns of cell division and cell expansion condition the morphology of these organs. Furthermore, regulated cell expansion in the elongation zones allows plant organs to develop directional growth responses to environmental stimuli and developmental cues, further contributing to plant morphogenesis and environmental adaptation. Regulated directionality (anisotropy) of cell expansion is critical, and intracellular microtubular polymers of a protein, called tubulin, which form a dense network underneath the plasma membrane, control this process by guiding the deposition of inextensible cellulose fibrils within the surrounding wall. The investigators have identified a group of 8 conserved plant-specific proteins that modulate the alignment of microtubules in expanding cells, thereby regulating the patterns of cell expansion and the growth behavior of the corresponding organs. They will use a combination of approaches derived from Genetics, Genomics, Cell Biology, Biochemistry and Physiology to establish the mode of action of these proteins, and investigate the regulation of their activity by plant hormones. This project is expected to have a profound impact on our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern anisotropic cell expansion and organs? growth behavior in plants, with potential impact on agriculture and biomass production for bioenergy conversion. A postdoctoral fellow will carry out the project, helped by undergraduate students who will be exposed to scientific experimentation and will be introduced to state-of-the-art technologies in the fields of Genetics, Genomics, Cell Biology and biomass production. Furthermore, an outreach program will be implemented whereby K-12 teachers will join the lab each summer of the project to work in partnership with the PI, the students and other lab members to design instructional materials for testing and implementation in K-12 classrooms and undergraduate lab courses.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Our research during this funding period has uncovered a possible interaction between the WVD2 / WDL proteins on the one hand, and the cytoplasmic domain of a plant hormoneÆs receptor that was previously implicated in the control of anisotropic cell expansion.
