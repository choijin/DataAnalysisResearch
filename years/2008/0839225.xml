    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I research proposal will investigate new circuit architectures for high performance Analog-to-Digital (A/D) converters with potentially more than an order of magnitude lower power consumption and much smaller silicon area than conventional architectures. The new architectures are based on zero-crossing detectors. The zero-crossing based circuits utilize the virtual-ground based signal processing as in traditional op-amp based circuits. Therefore, they provide the same functionality and robustness and are compatible with most op-amp based circuit architectures. The zero-crossing detectors replace the virtual ground forcing function of the op-amp with virtual ground detection by a zero-crossing detector. The zero-crossing detector based circuits provide high speed operation at extremely low power consumption, are tiny in size, and are compatible with standard deep submicron Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductors (CMOS) technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research, if successful, can have far reaching impact, because A/D converters are ubiquitous in electronics systems. The power consumption represents approximately thirty (30) fold reduction from the state-of-the art. It will provide high performance A/D converters built in deep submicron CMOS technologies thereby exploiting their very low cost, high-speed capability, tiny size, high level of integration, and low power digital circuits. These may include software-defined and cognitive radios, and portable phased array radios among many other possibilities. For military applications, Portable phased-array radars, battery-operated smart sensors (e.g. smart dust), micro-robots, and small unmanned aircrafts can benefit from the low power and tiny size/weight/volume of the proposed circuits.</AbstractNarration>
