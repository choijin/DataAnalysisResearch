<AbstractNarration>We propose to explore design, control, and motion planning for robotic parkour---the highly dynamic form of locomotion that includes ascending chutes by leaping back and forth between opposing walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our broad goal is to give robots access to difficult-to-reach places by taking full advantage of their dynamics and the potential reaction forces afforded by the environment. The proposed work will address two challenge problems:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. To design, build, and control a planar robot to dynamically climb in a rigid vertical chute, and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. To design, build, and control a planar robot to reliably move from an initial state to any dynamically reachable goal state in a complex vertical environment of footholds at various orientations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The true goal of this work is not to build speci&amp;#64257;c-climbing robots, but rather to address scienti&amp;#64257;c issues fundamental to dynamic legged locomotion in non-trivial terrains by confronting these two challenges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Most robots locomote by rolling on wheels or treads.  Some robots now walk on two or more legs, and we are now beginning to see robots that can run.  In this project, we began the investigation of an even more dynamic means of locomotion called "robot parkour."  In robot parkour, any surface can be used as a source of reaction forces for a well-placed hand or foot.  This project is inspired by human parkour, or free running, where runners traverse urban environments overcoming obstacles by a variety of leaps, swings, flips, and other dynamic movements.  The long-term goal is to develop robots that can locomote quickly and efficiently in a variety of environments.  In this project, joint between Northwestern and Carnegie Mellon, we developed the ParkourBot, the first robot capable of climbing in a vertical chute by dynamically leaping back and forth between two parallel walls.  The ParkourBot consists of a body with two energy efficient legs, a gyro orientation stabilizer, and a high-speed vision system used to track the progress of the ParkourBot as it climbs up and down in the chute.  Videos of the ParkourBot can be found by googling "youtube parkourbot."  The current robot operates in reduced gravity on an inclined air table, but the principles apply to full gravity.  Attached is a motion blur image showing a single leap by the ParkourBot from the left wall to the right wall.  The ParkourBot itself is a simple demonstration of the possibilities of extreme dynamic locomotion.  As part of this project, however, we have also begun to develop theory supporting future, more capable, parkour robots.  This project also produced the Gibbot, a dynamic wall-swinging robot inspired by the gibbon that locomotes by activating and releasing electromagnets.  A further description can be found by googling "ieee spectrum gibbot."       Last Modified: 06/19/2012       Submitted by: Kevin M Lynch]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
