<AbstractNarration>Scientific research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cilia are highly conserved organelles present in all major phylogenetic groups of eukaryotic organisms.  They have been adapted for motility of single cells and for fluid transport over cell layers.  In multicellular animals, they play specialized roles in embryo development and in signaling pathways in diverse cell types.  The nine doublet microtubules in typical cilia grow from a template of nine triplet microtubules that compose the wall of the basal body (centriole).  Basal body docking with the plasma membrane provides a site for assembly of a cilium.  Components of intraflagellar transport, required for ciliary assembly and maintenance, converge at the basal body.  Initiation of ciliary assembly depends on the conversion of triplet microtubules to doublet microtubules at the distal end of the basal body. Using as a model system the unicellular, biflagellate green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, this project investigates a class of "uni" mutants with defects in docking of basal bodies with the plasma membrane and in the conversion of triplet microtubules to doublet microtubules required for ciliary assembly.  The molecular basis of these processes is investigated through biochemical characterization of the products of the UNI1 and UNI2 genes.  The role of phosphorylation in the function of the Uni2 protein is being studied. The functions of the Uni1 and Uni2 proteins are being examined through analysis of mutant phenotypes, subcellular localization of the proteins, and protein interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project integrates research and education by providing mentored research experiences for undergraduate students.  Students receive training in cell biology, molecular biology, and genetics disciplines while carrying out research.  The projects help students to develop the ability for critical thinking and the skills for written and oral science communication.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Cilia, also known as eukaryotic flagella, are hair-like organelles highly conserved in all major phylogenetic groups of eukaryotic organisms.  During evolution they have been adapted for different functions including motility and cell signaling.  Motile cilia beat with a whip-like motion to propel cells through aqueous environments and to promote fluid transport over layers of cells.  Cilia project out from the cell surface, allowing them to serve as antennae, detecting environmental cues and transmitting information to the cell.    The nine doublet microtubules in a typical cilium grow from a template provided by the nine triplet microtubules of the basal body (centriole), a cytoplasmic organelle that, when docked with the plasma membrane, allows extension of the cilium.   Basal bodies serve also as the entry and sorting point for the machinery and cargo of intraflagellar transport (IFT) required for assembly and maintenance of cilia.    Initiation of ciliary assembly requires the conversion of triplet microtubules to doublet microtubules at the distal end of the basal body. This project seeks to understand the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the microtubule conversion.    The project utilizes the single-celled alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, widely recognized as a model system for study of assembly and function of cilia due to its advantages for genetic analysis, its ease of culture, and the molecular tools available including a sequenced genome.  The cells use their two flagella for both motility in a watery environment and for mating during sexual reproduction.  The flagella on a Chlamydomonas cell are assembled from basal bodies that differ in chronological age and can be distinguished by their position on the cell with respect to a single eyespot located on one side of the cell.  Wild-type cells assemble flagella from both basal bodies, but "uniflagellar" mutants have a reduced competence for flagellar assembly, especially by the younger basal body.  Previously our group showed that in cells containing a mutation in the UNI1 gene or the UNI2 gene, the defect in flagellar assembly  is strongly correlated with a defect in the conversion of triplet microtubules to doublet microtubules.  In addition,  the Uni2 protein localizes at the distal end of the basal body, where the microtubule conversion occurs.  Seeking to understand the molecular basis of triplet-to-doublet microtubule conversion and its role in assembly of flagella, in this project we sought to isolate the UNI1 gene and to determine the protein encoded by the gene, and the cellular localization of the protein.  The gene was isolated using a strategy based on the genetic map position of uni1 mutations and other genetic and molecular markers on chromosome 17.  The gene encodes a large novel protein composed of more than 3000 amino acids.  DNA sequencing revealed the lesions in four different mutant uni1 alleles.  The cloned UNI1 gene is able to rescue the mutant phenotype when transformed into uni1 mutant cells.    A gene modified with sequences encoding an epitope tag allowed us to localize the Uni1 protein in cells.  The protein is found as two dots of approximately equal size, one at the base of each flagellum, consistent with its localization to the basal bodies.  In addition, discrete dots of Uni1 protein are found in the cytosol of the cell body.   The pattern of Uni1 protein distribution differs from that of the Uni2 protein that localizes on both the two probasal bodies and the two flagella-bearing basal bodies. Comparison of the patterns suggests that the Uni2 protein assembles earlier that the Uni1 protein during the development of a basal body.    Broader Impacts  This project provided training opportunities for four undergraduate students who gained experience with basic laboratory methods including preparation of media and solutions, sterile culture techniques, light microscopy, isolation of DNA, polymerase chain reaction me...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
