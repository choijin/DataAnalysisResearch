<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0852276&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Lewis D. Ludwig, Colin C. Adams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is to fund the first ever Undergraduate Knot Theory&lt;br/&gt;Conference to take place at Denison University in summer,&lt;br/&gt;2009. Over the last few decades, there has been a dramatic&lt;br/&gt;increase in the involvement of undergraduates in mathematical&lt;br/&gt;research. Knot theory particularly lends itself to this endeavor&lt;br/&gt;since it is highly pictorial, one can easily stated open&lt;br/&gt;problems, and students can get actively involved with examples&lt;br/&gt;from the first day. A variety of Research Experience for&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate (REU) summer programs have pursued research on this&lt;br/&gt;topic. Moreover, there have been various workshops funded by NSF&lt;br/&gt;and the MAA that have helped undergraduate faculty to pursue&lt;br/&gt;research with students in knot theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will bring together a variety of mathematicians&lt;br/&gt;at various stages in their careers: undergraduates who are either&lt;br/&gt;interested or have already done research in knot theory, graduate&lt;br/&gt;students with undergraduate knot theory experience, faculty&lt;br/&gt;members interested in working with undergraduates on knot theory&lt;br/&gt;research, and four senior researchers in the field who will give&lt;br/&gt;plenary lectures.  There will be a wide range of talks by the&lt;br/&gt;other participants, some on research and some expository.  As a&lt;br/&gt;centerpiece, we will have a collective problem session to give&lt;br/&gt;participants numerous ideas for future research directions.  This&lt;br/&gt;conference will provide an opportunity for students to experience&lt;br/&gt;a mathematics research conference that is specifically designed&lt;br/&gt;and directed toward them.  Moreover, the conference will&lt;br/&gt;establish a supportive network of students and faculty with an&lt;br/&gt;interest in knot theory research, thus furthering the involvement&lt;br/&gt;of students in the field of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.denison.edu/academics/departments/mathcs/unknot&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
