<AbstractNarration>Semi-arid ecosystems cover large portions of the world. In Africa, these savannas support some of the most spectacular large mammal biodiversity on the planet. African savannas have been studied intensively, and considerable literature documents effects of both cattle grazing and indigenous herbivores on the vegetation of these ecosystems. Despite this extensive research, surprisingly little is known about interactions among wildlife, domestic livestock, understory vegetation and woody cover. The Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment (KLEE) is the first controlled, replicated attempt to examine these intereactions, the potential for co-existence among these players, and the limits to this co-existence. To date, this controlled exclusion of livestock and three guilds of large mammalian herbivores has answered diverse questions about the ecology of a major, semi-arid ecosystem. This renewal proposal will support years 13-17 of this long-term study. The goals of the next phase are to continue studies of competition, compensation, and trophic cascades while initiating controlled experiments on the causes and consequences of variation in tree densities and to examine the ecosystem consequences of herbivore-induced and experimentally manipulated changes in tree density.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to addressing fundamental questions in ecological science, this project continues to contribute essential information for rangeland management and biodiversity conservation in one of the world's most important biomes. The project is highly collaborative and hosts both senior and junior investigators from multiple US and African institutions. Both Kenyan and US graduate students will participate in, and receive training from, the proposed research; the KLEE study will continue to host undergraduate student research as well, along with classroom visits from Kenya, the United Kingdom and the US. Researchers interact closely with local pastoralist groups and landowners to support local efforts in land and resource management. This award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Worldwide, livestock shares rangeland with native biodiversity, including wildlife.  Despite this, there have been no controlled experiments that simultaneously examine the effects of these two types of large herbivores on each other and on the land that they share.  Since 1995, the Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment (KLEE) has been measuring the separate and combined effects of livestock and wildlife by creating six different large-scale treatments comprised of different combinations of three types of large herbivores: cattle, elephants/giraffes, and other large wildlife. These experimental treatments can be considered as representing either a) different management strategies (strict rangeland, strict wildlife reserve, or mixed-used landscape) or b) different extinction scenarios (loss of megafauna, loss of all larger wildlife, and/or their replacement by livestock).  We have also engaged in several related experiments, both inside and outside the KLEE exclosures, including a) controlled burns, b) manipulations of tree densities, c) manipulations of tree saplings, and d) manipulations of livestock exclosures and the factors that may influence their effects of ecosystem function. Soils, vegetation, and invertebrate and vertebrate animals respond to these experimental treatments in a variety of complex and fascinating ways.       Over the last five years, we have published 33 scientific articles in international peer-reviewed journals, published 10 stakeholder-focused reports in local outlets, produced seven masters and doctoral dissertations, and given numerous talks about our research to both scientific and lay audiences.  Here are some of our more exciting results: 1) We have shown that although wildlife compete with livestock (cattle) during dry periods, during wet periods cattle actually gain more weight if they share their land with wildlife. 2) Elephants reduce tree densities in this rangeland, and this has important implications for wildlife and livestock use, both because trees compete with grasses, and because wildlife prefer more open rangeland that allows them to more easily locate and avoid predators.  3) Because livestock and wildlife eat the plants that fuel fire, the elimination of these herbivores leads to higher fire temperatures and more destructive fires. 4) The cattle enclosures used by East African livestock managers, when abandoned, create productive "hot spots" that have profound and long-term positive effects on both livestock and native plants and animals. 5) The relationships among all of the species in this savanna rangeland are deeply intertwined.  For example, reducing either cattle or wildlife leads to increases in rodent populations and their insect parasites and pathogens.  These rodents, in turn, eat more of the tree seedlings that would otherwise be eaten by larger herbivores. The increase in rodents also lead to increases in the snakes and small carnivores that eat them.
