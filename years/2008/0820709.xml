<AbstractNarration>The primate body hosts trillions of microbes.  Interactions between primate hosts and these microbes profoundly affect primate physiology, reproduction, health, survival and ultimately, evolution. Because females are central to population viability and because reproductive tract microbiota directly influence female health, fecundity and pregnancy outcomes, understanding both primate variation in microbial ecologies and what factors influence microbial variation is crucial to understanding patterns of primate host-microbe relations. The goals of this research are to define the microbial community compositions from a select subset of wild primates differing by phylogenetic group, socio-ecology, mating system, and morphology, and to test hypotheses that can explain microbial variation among primates. Specifically, the researchers hypothesize that primate bacterial patterns: 1) vary widely, both within and among species, and 2) co-vary with size, reproductive, taxonomic and social factors. The researchers will apply emerging genomic techniques to analyze, define, and compare both the composition and dynamics of human and nonhuman primate microbial communities. The techniques include culture independent, direct sequencing and analysis of 16S rDNA clone libraries to generate microbial phylogenies that identify the microbes in primate reproductive ecosystems. These phylogenies will illustrate microbial community composition, and will be analyzed in the contexts of primate phylogeny and reproductive and social behavior, both within and among species. Data from this study will produce fundamental information about how microbes affect primates through relationships that range from highly beneficial and codependent to severely pathological. Diverse primate species are included, enabling targeted hypothesis testing, statistical study and insights on causes of microbial community differences among primate species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The analyses in this research will utilize cutting-edge molecular genomic analyses that have not yet received wide notice or application in bioanthropology. The researchers expect comparative microbial data to provide crucial insights into the evolution of primate (including human) sexuality and reproductive health. The broader impact of this transformative research will allow an understanding of human-microbe interactions, both pathological and non-pathological, and will have valuable implications for biomedicine, such as the relationship between pathological microbes and human preterm birth, adverse pregnancy, and chronic, debilitating health problems in women. In addition, improved data on microbial forces that impact reproduction will benefit primate conservation efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Primate Comparative Microbial Ecology.    Primate bodies contain trillions of microbial cells, which vastly outnumber primate host cells.  It is increasingly clear that hosts, along with microbial inhabitants, should be considered interdependent systems or super-organisms, and that primate health cannot be understood fully without knowledge of host-microbial interactions. The study of genomics of the host microbiome is currently in its infancy, and our interdisciplinary research group is one of the first to examine primate microbiomes in comparative perspective.  The goals for this NSF funded research project "Primate Comparative Microbial Ecology" (NSF # 0820709; $299, 921) were to test specific hypotheses that explain variation in primate microbial communities, especially whether vaginal microbial communities differ according to primate phylogeny, mating system, body size or habitat.  We have made considerable advances in our understanding of primate microbial diversity. Major accomplishments include 1) the collection of a unique and invaluable primate microbial sample set, 2) extraction, amplification and sequencing of microbial 16S rDNA, 3) an expanding database of primate microbial sequences, 4) multiple analyses of microbiomes of diverse primate species, 5) training of a diverse interdisciplinary group of undergraduates, graduates, post-docs and faculty, and 6) productivity in presenting and publishing our results.   To date, we have published more than ten papers from this work with more in preparation. Our groundbreaking findings include evidence for considerable variation within and between primate microbial community compositions (Kim et al., 2009; Yildirim et al, 2010; Yildirim et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., in preparation). We find that host genetics and in particular, mating patterns are the most influential factors affecting vaginal microbiome community composition.  Our results also show that there were a substantially greater proportion of unclassified microbes among the lemurs (P. diadema) than any of the other primates (Yildirim et al, 2014; Nguyen et al., in prep.).  Our major research findings on microbiome diversity across wild primates include that human microbiomes differ significantly from other primates in their microbial diversity and abundance, with humans presenting less microbial diversity than other primates  (Yildirim et al., 2014). Specifically, lactobacilli dominate the human vaginal microbiome, in stark contrast to all other primates. This research supports the uniqueness of the human vaginal microbiome with considerable implications for understanding host microbiome evolution and human health and disease. Understanding the root of this variation has important implications for the prevention of preterm birth, a condition closely associated with microbiome disruption.   The uniqueness of the human vaginal microbiome is comparable to other well-accepted unique human anatomical, behavioral and physiological traits.

Future directions include identifying early pregnancy microbial, inflammatory, hormonal and/or structural biomarkers that predict risk of preterm birth. These results are expected to lead to modeling of early detection indicators for preterm birth, and, ultimately, to improved intervention options. This comparative primate microbiome research provides solid steps toward a new understanding of microbe-host relationships, microbiome diversity, microbial function, and and hypotheses testing on host-microbe interactions.   In addition to substantial outreach and education, our diverse research group has provided many opportunities for training and professional development among undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs and faculty.
