<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II research project will design, build and test a new type of orientation and navigation (O&amp;N) system for people with visual impairments. While GPS-based solutions show promise in outdoor environments, there are currently no widespread O&amp;N devices that are designed for use in indoor environments. This makes it difficult for people with visual impairments to navigate through indoor public spaces. The purpose of this research will be to complete development of a new type of radio frequency identification (RFID) system, in which intelligent, variable-range active RFID beacons are programmed with information about their locations and placed through indoor environments like schools, shopping malls and museums. This information will be accessible to people with visual impairments via a small RFID receiver worn on the user?s belt. Information will be conveyed to the user via a text-to-speech interface. Results from field testing have demonstrated that the device helps people with visual impairments to navigate through an unfamiliar environment. Phase II research will complete development of the communications protocols and interface techniques that give the system its unique capabilities for delivering speech-based information to people with visual impairments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 10.4 million people with visual impairments in the U.S., and this research will lead to an inexpensive commercial product that will greatly enhance their ability to navigate in unfamiliar surroundings. The market for this technology includes those who will purchase the RFID receivers and the RFID beacons. This includes people with visual impairments, as well as the owners and tenants of public spaces, such as office buildings, schools, malls, museums and government facilities. Also, because of the simplicity of the interface, the system will be useful to Orientation and  Mobility educators working with young children to develop spatial concepts.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
