<AbstractNarration>CBET-0836365&lt;br/&gt;Sandeep Anihotri, University of Tennessee Knoxville&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to test whether ozone is reactive with nanocarbons when it is in low concentrations similar to those found in clean to slightly-polluted atmosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This study will help determine the fate of nanocarbons after being released into the air. For example, carbon nanotubes are manufactured nanomaterials with potential use in electronic devices and health care. They are powdery and fluffy materials, and even a gentle movement of air or static charge can disperse them in the air. Their excellent physicochemical properties, such as lightweight, nanoscaled fibrous structure and resistance to chemical reactivity, might also impart asbestos-like toxicity and CFC-like persistence in the atmosphere. Despite ever increasing reports of advances in nanotube manufacturing, there is limited information relating to the fate and transformations of nanocarbons after being released in the air. This research will help find the key to unlocking the fate of nanocarbons in atmosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: (i) This study will be important for life cycle assessment of air-borne carbon nanotubes. It will provide the much needed scientific and practical information on interaction of nanotubes in the atmosphere. It will reveal, for the first time, if the atmosphere is capable of partially oxidizing these nanomaterials or degrading them completely into common, less harmful pollutants, say CO and CO2. (ii) Nanocarbons are generally considered inert in nature. This research will question the shelf-life of nanocarbons. The study is also relevant to the electronics industry as it will help identify the extent to which the properties of a nanotube based electronic device might change as a result of the exposure to ambient air. (iii) One graduate student will receive training here. Results from this research will also be incorporated into the PI's teaching activities for courses such as introduction to air and waste management and advanced concepts of air pollution engineering and control. Underrepresented minority students will be involved in the research.</AbstractNarration>
