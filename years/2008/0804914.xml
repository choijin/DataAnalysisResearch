<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical and computational research, and education with an aim to develop a quantum information geometry approach to critical phenomena, and to apply it to correlated many-body systems of high physical relevance. Specifically, the PIs will combine analytical, for example development of quantum distinguishability measures, application to exactly solvable models, and computational techniques, such as Quantum Monte Carlo and strong-disorder renormalization group, to investigate the emergence of topological order in quantum spin systems, analyze the effects of disorder on quantum phase transitions, and study the consequences of environment-induced decoherence on quantum criticality.&lt;br/&gt;In contrast to traditional approaches, the proposed information geometry analysis of phase transitions is not based on an a priori identification of order parameters, and hence does not require knowledge of symmetry breaking patterns. Instead, systems are analyzed using fidelity measures which quantify the proximity of two system states with different parameter sets. So, the PIs hope this strategy will enable them to gain physical insight into traditionally hard problems, systems for which the order parameter is either unknown, hidden or not defined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This metric approach shifts the traditional emphasis from Hamiltonians to the analysis of quantum states themselves, or put another way, from studying order parameters to universal geometrical structures underlying the way quantum matter organizes itself into different phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports an outreach effort that involves a collaboration with local physics teachers who work at underprivileged inner-city high schools in the Los Angeles area. This activity supports a network for participating teachers through annual workshops, training sessions and frequent campus visits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical and computational research, and education with an aim to develop a different approach to understanding how one state of matter transforms into another. The way atoms are organized can distinguish different sates of matter, for example atoms arranged on a regular array in crystalline solid verses a random arrangement of atoms in liquid. Recent research suggests that this notion is not complete and there are more subtle distinctions between states of matter. This research combines ideas from the emerging area of quantum information theory and computer simulation methods used to study magnetism and other states of matter in complex materials, to investigate new states of matter that may emerge from strong interactions among electrons that may have more subtle differences that are not distinguished in the standard theory of phase transitions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is fundamental but involves the interaction of the emerging area of quantum information science with condensed matter theory. The synergy between these areas may lead to new advances and new directions. The research may also have impact on the fundamental principles that may enable the exploitation of the ability to manipulate quantum mechanical states for computation and communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from educating the next generation of scientists in advanced theoretical methods, this award supports an outreach effort that involves a collaboration with local physics teachers who work at underprivileged inner-city high schools in the Los Angeles area. This activity supports a network for participating teachers through annual workshops, training sessions and frequent campus visits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF funded project was aimed at bringing together quantum information ideas  and condensed matter physics. In this latter field one of the most fascinating phenomena is known as quantum criticality: in materials at ultra small temperatures quantum fluctuations rule and different types of "order"  are, one may say, fighting each other to take over. Quantum phase transitions occur at those precise points where the two types of quantum fluctuations are in a delicate balance.  On on side one type will win and the other side it will loose (and the other wins).  Condensed matter theorists over the decades developed a whole conceptual paradigm to investigate this type of super cold "wars". The name for that conceptual framework, after two russian physicists, is Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. Its battlehorses are broken symmetries, effective actions and order parameters. This paradigm is beautiful, powerful and with a very broad scope. However, in the last years scientists realized that it is not omnicomprehensive: there are subtle, exotic and quite interesting phenomena that do not fall under the conceptual umbrella of Landau-Ginzburg.   In our NSF project we attacked the whole problem of quantum criticality from an entirely  novel perspective: the one provided by quantum information theory. We depicted the struggle between different quantum domains (phases) in a geometrical way in the space of information. We have shown that where the geometry gets "rough" then there is the balance (the transition point). Moreover, the precise "shape" of this roughness contains a lot of information about the type of transition and its universal physics. The key insight is that with our strategy one does not need an order parameter, in a sense we measure all the possible physical quantities at once.   We have successfully applied our newly developed quantum-information tools to a variety concrete physical models e.g., fermionic systems, spin chains. Remarkably we have been able to  address the elusive, yet important notion of  topological order. This is novel type of order is possessed by some  exotic materials and  brings along the tantalizing promise of inherently robust quantum computation. In these topological cases an "order parameter" simply does not exist and therefore it is an ideal case for testing our new ideas.  Our strategy has been diversified. When analytical calculations were either too hard to manage or just  impossible we resorted to massive computer simulations. For example for disordered systems we run for days our codes on the USC supercluster of computers. Our techniques are indeed quite suitable for improving the state-of-the-art numerical simulations of quantum systems.  In the final part of the project lifespan we extended our information-theoretic ideas to non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum systems.

Interestingly, we could make some progress in answering these time-honored fundamental questions. For example, If you monitor over time the distance between the initial state of the systems and the time evolving one you can build a "time-series" and collect data into histograms. We have demonstrated that those histograms can be classified by a few "universal" shapes. Depending on the type of shape of the particular systems you are studying you can gain a deeper understanding of its equilibration properties. We also showed that quantum criticality doed play a role in equlibration dynamics and then the latter can provided a novel dynamical way to detect and study quantum phase transitions.
