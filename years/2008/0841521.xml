<AbstractNarration>This project will examine the evolutionary processes responsible for flower-color divergence between populations of Phlox drummondii in areas with and without the closely related P. cuspidata.  This divergence represents one of the best purported cases in plants of reproductive character displacement, in which two similar species with overlapping ranges evolve to minimize the amount of hybridization due to selection against gamete wastage.  Combining both measures of individual fitness and analysis of patterns of molecular variation in the genes responsible for the flower-color change, the planned experiments will test whether this divergence satisfies a set of criteria for character displacement that have been developed over the past two decades, and thus determine whether this divergence truly constitutes character displacement.   They will also test alternative explanations for the observed divergence, including local adaptation to an environmental factor unrelated to interaction with P. cuspidata.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An integral component of the research program outlined here is the teaching and training of students at a variety of educational levels.  Funds are explicitly requested to support the training of one postdoctoral fellow and one graduate student.   As in the past, undergraduates will be actively engaged in this research, both as Independent Study students during the academic year, and as summer research assistants.  At the high school and undergraduate levels, women and minorities under-represented in science will be targeted for training in research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project examined the evolutionary mechanisms by which dark, red flowers in eastern populations of Phlox drummondii evolved from light, blue flowers found ancestrally in western populations.  We found that differences in hue and intensity are each controlled by a single genetic locus.  The evolution of dark and red variants at these loci in eastern populations appears to have been favored by natural selection.  Moreover, the dark variant at the intensity locus appears to evolved due to reinforcing selection; specifically, it is favored because it reduces inter-specific hybridization with a co-existing congener, P. cuspidata.  Pollinator observations revealed that this reinforcing selection is caused by pollinator behavor.  Transitions of pollinators between darkly pigmented P. drummondii and P. cuspidata are less likely than transitions between lightly pigmented P. drummondii and P. cuspidata, thus reducing the likelihood of hybridization.  We also found that in western populations, pollinators preferentially visit light,blue flowers over other hue and intensity combinations, and that this likely explains why the dark and red variants do not spread into these populations.  The major contribution of this project to evolutionary biology is that it provides the first direct documentation of the operation of reinforcing selection, an historical controversial process, in nature.  It also provides some of the first evidence that natural selection prevents the spread of reinforcing traits into regions where reinforcement has not occurred.  Twelve peer-reviewed publications have resulted from this project.  It has also provided training to three graduate students and one postdoctoral associate in techniques used in the study of molecular evolution as well as techniques used in field experiments.  In addition, it has provided training in grant- and manuscript-writing to these people.        Last Modified: 02/03/2016       Submitted by: Mark D Rausher]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
