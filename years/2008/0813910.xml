<AbstractNarration>Travel support will be provided for 8 young researchers from US institutions to attend the 2008 Conference on Stochastic Networks. Priority for support will be given to researchers who have received their PhD within the last five years and to graduate students in the last year of their PhD programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stochastic network models have played a fundamental role in the development of modern manufacturing, telecommunications, and computer systems. Interest in these models cuts across many scientific disciplines including operations research, computer science, engineering, mathematics, and statistics. Frequently, important problems are attacked from very different points of view, and there is great benefit to bringing together researchers with a wide variety of perspectives. In order to address these problems, we need new mathematical models and analysis techniques.  The primary goal of the conference is to identify such models and the requisite analytic and computational methodologies that will help in basic understanding of system behavior and in the design and control of these networks. The cross-fertilization of ideas from diverse areas of application is one of the major contributions of these conferences.</AbstractNarration>
