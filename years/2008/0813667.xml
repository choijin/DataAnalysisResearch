<AbstractNarration>The purpose of the Polar Research Board (PRB) is to provide independent assistance to federal agencies and the nation on science issues of importance in the Arctic, Antarctic, and cold regions broadly. The PRB is a forum for high level discussion as well as an oversight body that designs studies, workshops, and other activities that use volunteer experts to provide objective advice. Activities include program reviews, assessment of priorities, and analyses of controversial and nationally important topics. The PRB serves as US National Committee to the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), International Arctic Science Committee (IASC), and International Polar Year 2007-2008 and thus facilitates US leadership in these international groups. For 2009-2010, PRB will continue to plan activities where objective, independent discussion and analysis are needed. IPY 2007-2008 will remain a top focus, especially the final activities needed to ensure synthesis and integration of the results.</AbstractNarration>

The PRB also serves as the U.S. National Committee to two international polar science organizations -- the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC).     Board members, who meet twice a year, are responsible for identifying emerging issues, strategic planning, information-gathering, interactions with agencies and other scientists, program oversight, new initiatives, information dissemination, and outreach.   Another key set of activities is the ad hoc committee process, where specially-appointed groups conduct in-depth analysis of focused topics  Ad hoc activities carried out during this report period include:  &bull;             Scientific Value of Arctic Sea Ice Imagery Derived Products  [study]  &bull;             Martha T. Muse Prize for Science and Policy in the Antarctic [study]  &bull;             Research Access to the Russian Arctic  [discussion forum]  &bull;             Frontiers in Understanding Climate Change and Polar Ecosystems [workshop/report]  &bull;             The U.S. Antarctic Program: Future Science Opportunities in the Antarctic and Southern Ocean [study]     PRB served as a leader in planning the International Polar Year (IPY) 2007-2008, and during this reporting period. IPY efforts during the reporting period included:  &bull;             Joint with NSF-OPP, the PRB planned an IPY closing celebration and symposium in April 2009.   &bull;             PRB continued to distribute information from the IPY Programme Office to the US community.  &bull;             PRB planned and is conducting a final synthesis study ("Lessons and Legacies of IPY") to highlight the outcomes of the IPY campaign from a U.S. perspective and integrate the lessons learned from different activities.   &bull;             PRB is helping to promote and encourage U.S. participation in the IPY conference "From Knowledge to Action" to be held in Montreal in April 2012.     In its role as US National Committee for IASC, the PRB:   provided comments and recommendations on the IASC restructuring; nominated scientists for international efforts; led the process for determining the ten US representatives to the IASC working groups; facilitated US working groups interactions with the US Delegate via conference calls and  meetings.   Dr. Jacqueline Grebmeier (University of Maryland) is the U.S. Delegate to IASC.     In its role as the U.S. National Committee to SCAR, the PRB:   distributed and compiled comments on the SCAR Strategic Plan; oversaw a nominations process for US representatives to SCAR Working Groups and facilitated their participation in the SCAR 2010 meetings in Argentina;  had members serving on the SCAR 2012 Open Science Conference organizing committees;  promoted nominations for the Muse Prize; compiled and submitted comments on the Southern Ocean Observing System Plan; held an orientation event and social function at the 2010 SCAR meeting to encourage interaction of US participants; continued to support outreach activities such as the US SCAR web site.   Dr. Mahlon "Chuck" Kennicutt II (Texas A&amp;M University) is the U.S. delegate to SCAR and the Alternate Delegate is Dr. Terry Wilson (Ohio State University).      The PRB disseminates its work widely to interested audiences contributes to developing the next generation of scientists.  Activities include:  &bull;          ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
