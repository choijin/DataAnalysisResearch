<AbstractNarration>A National Science Foundation grant has been awarded to Georgia Southern University to digitize and re-curate the Georgia Southern University ? Savannah Science Museum Herpetology Collection. This collection is a valuable historical record of the biological diversity of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. The locality data from the collection of approximately 35,000 specimens will be digitized and the collection completely re-curated.  All specimenswill be removed from old storage media, inspected, individually tagged,and placed in proper storage containers and media. All paper and online&lt;br/&gt;data records will be cross-checked for accuracy, and the database shared via an online meta-search portal such as Herpnet. These improvements will dramatically increase the use and exposure of the collection such that its value to the scientific community will be strengthened. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enhancement of the collection will also improve instructional and outreach opportunities. The project will augment the graduate and undergraduate curriculum by providing a large, searchable database of natural history data for use in teaching. In addition, the project will generate broader collaborative efforts with constituents who have interests in collections, data mining, and outreach. Finally, completion of these efforts will allow for more visitations to local schools for presentations on herpetology, and the integration of herpetological resources into existing outreach programs available at the University.</AbstractNarration>
