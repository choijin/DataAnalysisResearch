<AbstractNarration>Quarks carry a color charge and nuclear matter is formed from the binding of colored quarks mediated by gluons.  Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD) is the theory that describes the interaction of these color charges. Experiments have shown than quarks come in three colors but all nuclear matter is color neutral. Separation of nuclear matter into quarks and gluons needs very large energies similar to what was present in the early universe. Since solving QCD with three colors have proven to be very difficult and since qualitative properties do not depend on the number of colors, an attempt following 't Hooft is made to solve QCD for a very large number of colors. Research using lattice gauge theory has proven to be quite useful in extracting several physics results in the last six years.  We will continue to make progress and focus on the phase of the theory that exists at high densities (like inside neutron stars) and high temperatures (close to the big-bang). Numerical computations will be used to study quark matter in this phase and we will attempt to make qualitative comparisons with current experiments in RHIC and CERN. Since QCD in the limit of large number of colors is closely related to recent developments in string theory we will also be able to make connections between field theory and string theory.  We have already shown that quarks form a colorless condensate and we have also succeeded in computing the properties of the lightest colorless particle - the pion. We will attempt to compute the masses of other heavier colorless particles as part of this proposal. We will also attempt to study the effect of temperature thereby showing evidence for the formation of nuclear matter from a primordial soup of quarks and gluons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific methods involve analytical calculations and numerical computations. A graduate student at FIU working toward a Ph.D will learn quantum field theory and numerical techniques and will make significant contributions.  Computer clusters will be used for numerical computations and the results obtained as part of this proposal will be presented at international conferences in nuclear and particle physics.</AbstractNarration>

Theoretical physicists aiming to understand various phenomena associated with QCD have found it useful to consider a larger class of QCD like theories where one considers different color gauge groups; different representations of quarks; and different space-time dimensions.      QCD is a confining theory at temperatures below the de-confining temperature which is about 264 MeV. The color flux contained by a color-current loop (Wilson loop) is proportional to the area and this leads to the string picture of QCD. Using the concept of continuum reduction in the limit of large number of colors, the string tension was computed in four dimensions and found to be close to (430 MeV)2. Even though the theory de-confines at high enough temperatures, chromo-magnetic Wilson loops still exhibit signs of confinement. A study of the chromo-magnetic string tension above the de-confinement temperature in three dimensional (two space and one time) QCD showed that it  grows with temperature in a linear form.     We proposed that one could use two dimensional (one space and one time) fermions coupled to three or four dimensional QCD as a probe of the physical transition from strongly interacting theory at large distances to a weakly interacting theory at short distances. We studied this problem in the limit of large number of colors.

Preliminary results show that a detailed investigation is worth pursuing.     Two post-doctoral fellows were supported under this grant and contributed to four research papers. Nine research papers were published in peer reviewed journals and five papers were presented in international symposiums. The PI was invited to two different summer schools to present two sets of three lectures &mdash; one set of large N gauge theories and another set on chiral fermions.
