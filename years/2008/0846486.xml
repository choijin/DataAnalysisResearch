<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to design networked underwater acoustic transceivers to achieve high network throughput and high reliability for shallow water sensor networks.  The approach is to maximize the power and bandwidth efficiency through a joint power allocation and diversity (JPAD) optimization method combined with adaptive medium access control (MAC) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) schemes.  The research is integrated with education and outreach through two new courses that bridge curricula gaps between networking and communications and between signal processing and circuit design, student training for underwater research, and collaboration with the Women's Leadership Institute and the Summer Research Academy at the Missouri University of Science and Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to intellectual merit, this project contributes to boosting network capacity and reliability for underwater communications through two major paradigm shifts:  optimization with practical discrete inputs rather than idealized Gaussian inputs to improve transceiver design and using joint power-allocation and diversity matrices instead of scheme using only adaptive power allocation.  The design methodologies developed for underwater communications in this project should also be applicable to radio frequency (RF) communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to broader impact, the project has the potential to advance the development of underwater sensor networks and enhance capabilities for environmental monitoring, disaster prevention, offshore exploration, and surveillance.  The education and outreach activities help to train the next generation of researchers, increase the participation of women and other students from underrepresented groups, advocate responsible engineering approaches for reducing sound pollution in oceans, and educate the general public about the impact of acoustic communications and sensor networks in aquatic environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research proposed in this CAREER plan aims at designing highly reliable acoustic transceivers to achieve high throughput that is near theoretical bound. We adopt the Multiple-Input Multiple Output (MIMO) block-transmission scheme and propose a unified transceiver structure for multi-node underwater networks, called JPAD-MAC: Joint Power-Allocation and Diversity (JPAD) optimization with adaptive scheduling/resource allocation.  We seek low-complexity, robust designs to address the special challenges in underwater channels through three main research thrusts:  1)     Theoretical Framework and Cross-Layer Optimization;   2)     Low-Complexity Transceiver Design;   3)     Test Bed Integration using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and digital signal processors (DSP).  The outcomes of this project include several important findings regarding precoding, several transceiver algorithms that achieve high performance for MIMO acoustic transceiver, over 20 journal publications and 40 conference publications, more than 10 invited presentations, and two hardware test beds implemented by DSP and FPGA.   major findings:  F1) MIMO underwater acoustic communications channels are extremely fast fading and a conventional precoding approach to boost data rate may suffer from mismatch of the optimized precoders being applied to outdated channel conditions, thus causing degradation of the performance rather than improvement. Even the channel statistics change very fast for underwater channels, so that the precoding design has to be applied to long-term averaged correlation functions.      F2) Spectrum and power allocation for multiple users may improve network throughput via precoding when designed for finite alphabet inputs and channel statistical information, but may degrade network performance if channel experiences fast changes which are ignored by the precoders.  F3) Frequency domain turbo equalization and dynamically adaptive channel estimation can reduce computational complexity and achieve excellent performance in fast-fading underwater acoustic channels, respectively. Therefore, combining these two techniques together can significantly improve transceiver performance with block transmission techniques such as SC-FDE (single-carrier with frequency-domain equalization) and OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing).  MIMO transceiver algorithms:  T1) Time-domain MIMO turbo equalizations with linear minimum mean squeared errors (MMSE).  T2) Time-domain MIMO turbo equalization with soft block-decision feedback;  T3) Time-domain MIMO turbo equalization with soft-decision feedback;  T4) Time-domain MIMO turbo equalization with soft-interference cancellation;  T5) Single-carrier frequency-domain MIMO turbo linear equalization with successive interference cancellation;  T6) Single-carrier frequency-domain MIMO turbo equalization with frequency-domain (soft) decision feedback.  The low-complexity algorithms have been implemented for a 2-by-2 MIMO transceiver on Taxes Instruments DSP and Altera FPGA platforms.  In addition to research outcomes, this project also supported one postdoctoral fellow, five Ph.D. students, six M.S. students, and three undergraduate students through supplement of Research Experience for Undergraduates.
