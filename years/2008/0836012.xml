<AbstractNarration>Proposal SBE 0836012: PSLC&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to renew PSLC, the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center for an additional and final five year term.  PSLC is situated at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, with the University of Pittsburgh as the principle partner institution.  Like all Science of Learning Centers, PSLC is a multi-university, multi-year, interdisciplinary project to address the theoretical and practical issues involved in conducting rigorous laboratory-quality studies of learning in real-world classrooms enhanced with intelligent tutoring systems.  Central to the vision of investigators is a focus on the conditions that enable "robust learning", learning that transfers to new situations, lasts for a long time and accelerates future learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the data generated is collected in large data-bases for mining by the broad community of learning researchers, not just by those associated with PSLC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than just a research center, PSLC is also committed to the education of undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral students; to increasing diversity among faculty, students and future scientists, and to the transfer of research results to educational practice.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Through eleven years of operation ending in January 2016, LearnLab has carried out a focused mission to leverage cognitive theory and computational modeling to identify the instructional conditions that cause robust student learning. Of many discoveries that the center produced, a distinct and unifying discovery is that within the vast space of instructional design (Fig 1), there is no one-size-fits-all answer to optimizing robust student learning.  Instead, schools, colleges, and education companies must engage in an engineering process, guided by practical learning science theory, that involves deep analysis of course content and of the learning processes that lead to its acquisition.  From the early history of the center, the development of a shared theoretical framework was a center-wide endeavor. Going beyond the usual progress of science through collaborative publications, we facilitated shared theory development through an open research wiki.  More fundamentally, LearnLab is a social cyberinfrastructure for learning science (Fig 2) that  systematically produced a vast and rich empirical basis for theory development.  It facilitated over 360 scientifically rigorous and practically relevant in vivo experiments run through educational technology used in courses in math, science, and language learning and amassed over 850 datasets on the student learning processes in the open data repository DataShop. Collectively, this data involves nearly 200 million coded observations of student learning behaviors. This data was collected through student interactions with widely disseminated and highly effective educational technologies, for example, in high school math and science and college statistics (Fig 3). Analysis of such data has led to basic research insights into the causal mechanisms of implicit and explicit learning processes and the social and motivational conditions that enable them. By integrating insights across the center, we advanced an education-relevant learning theory that culminated in the Knowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI) framework.  The KLI framework demonstrates that optimal learning depends on the nature of the knowledge to be acquired (Fig 4). This "KLI dependency" is explained in terms of elements of detailed taxonomies of knowledge types (e.g., facts, skills, and principles), of learning processes (e.g. memory, induction, and sense making), and of instructional principles. Specific theoretical alignments of these elements (e.g., facts are best learned by memory processes, skills by induction processes, and principles by sense making processes) are supported by vast amounts of empirical evidence.  KLI provides an alternative to the failed idea that learning science can be straightforwardly applied, without modification or insight, to improve educational outcomes. It has further profound practical implications in guiding the design of personalized learning methods that teachers can use and personalized learning technologies that can help students around the world at any time.  A bottom line message is that all schools, colleges, and educational companies should become LearnLabs &ndash; institutions committed to and capable of continuous improvement in robust student learning outcomes through a data-driven iterative engineering process (Fig 5).  Our focus on educational technology data was critical in the formation of a new field of Educational Data Mining. LearnLab research thrusts produced learning science results that will have lasting impact in areas of Cognitive Factors, Metacognition and Motivation, Computational Modeling and Data Mining, and Social Communication.  We also contributed to influential reviews of learning science for school and college audiences (Fig 6), of machine learning and data mining in cognitive science and education, and of the function and impact of automated personalized tutoring systems.  LearnLab researchers have produced over 2000 publications, given over 200 invited talks...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
