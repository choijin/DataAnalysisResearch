<AbstractNarration>Accurate measurements of the atmosphere?ocean fluxes of trace gases are important to an improved understanding of the cycling of climatically relevant gases. The direct eddy correlation (EC) method, which is considered to be the benchmark for accurate determination of air?sea fluxes of trace gases, relies on high? frequency measurements of the fluctuations of vertical wind velocity and gas concentration, and requires fast response sensors in combination with high sensitivity. These twin requirements have precluded oceanographic use of the EC technique for many species of interest, and direct measurements have been limited mainly to carbon dioxide at relatively high flux levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI?s request funding to develop a fast, highly sensitive, gas concentration sensor, and to integrate it with a sonic anemometer, motion sensing, and data acquisition into an EC flux package suitable for operation from buoys and other platforms, such as ships. Our gas sensor is based on infrared (IR) absorption, but utilizes a novel, highly sensitive, photoacoustic detector. The PI?s expect that this combination will result in an improvement in sensitivity of several orders of magnitude over the IR absorption sensors that are currently in oceanographic use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was submitted under the US?Ireland R&amp;D Partnership Program by E. Terray (PI-US), WHOI; B. Ward (Partner-IE), National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland; and N. Mitchell (Partner-NI), Queens University Belfast, Northern Ireland (NI).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The world's oceans are a major sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and hence are a critical component of the global balance for this greenhouse gas.  As a result it is important to know how much CO2 is entering or exiting across the air-water interface.  This quantity is known as the "mass flux", and is given by the number of kilograms of gas passing in one second through a square meter of the ocean surface.    Sensing the flux of carbon dioxide into or out of the ocean is challenging because it generally is much smaller than terrestrial fluxes (the smaller flux, however, is compensated by the much larger area of the ocean relative to forests, so that the net global uptake of carbon by each is comparable).  The most direct way to determine flux is to measure the concentration of a small volume of gas simultaneously with the component of the wind velocity into or away from the ocean surface.  This requires that very small concentration fluctuations be sensed rapidly.    Carbon dioxide absorbs light strongly in mid-infrared wavelengths.  At the time of our proposal the chief method of measuring CO2 flux at sea involved shining a narrow beam of infrared light through a sample of the gas and measuring the net absorption.  Because this is proportional to the amount of gas being illuminated, and hence to the absorption path length, the minimum size of sensors that can be constructed based on this principle is limited.    The goal of our project was to study the feasibility of constructing miniature greenhouse gas concentration sensors that can be used to measure gas flux from ships and buoys with a sensitivity 5-10 times better than conventional infrared absorption sensors, and to develop a prototype instrument for CO2.    The work reported here was carried out with NSF support by a group from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as part of a three-way international collaboration with the National University of Ireland Galway and Queen's University Belfast.  It was one of the founding projects under the "US-Ireland Research and Development Partnership" program, which was established in 2005 as a high-level diplomatic initiative on the part of the three governments.    We chose to focus on a sensing technique called photoacoustic absorption (PA).  The PA effect was first reported in 1880 by Alexander Graham Bell who noted that audible sound is generated when sunlight, whose intensity is rapidly modulated, illuminates thin disks of various materials.  To measure gas concentration, a sample is introduced into a small chamber and periodically excited optically (using an infrared laser). The subsequent collisional de-excitation of the gas leads to local heating and a corresponding pressure/acoustic response.  As a consequence of the ideal gas law, the strength of the response is larger for smaller chambers, and consequently this technique, unlike infrared absorption, is well-suited to miniaturization.    It has been common practice to detect the PA signal using a microphone embedded in the wall of the photoacoustic cell, but this technique is not sufficiently sensitive for a flux measurement.  Instead we investigated two new approaches that could have better sensitivity.    The first is a "cantilever-microphone" that is much more sensitive than a microphone because the cantilever is fixed over only a portion of its boundary.  A Finnish company, Gasera Ltd., had already developed several PA sensors using this technology. Although none had the level of performance we required, their prior experience and the clear route to commercialization led us to contract with them to develop a PA concentration sensor as part of our flux-measuring system.    The second approach, known as "Quartz Enhanced Photoacoustic Spectroscopy" (QEPAS), was invented by a group at Rice University.  It uses a miniature tuning fork, of the kind found in digital watches, to enhance the detector sensitivity.  The Rice group had fabricated several demonstratio...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
