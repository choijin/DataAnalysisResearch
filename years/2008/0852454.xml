<AbstractNarration>Luke&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0852454&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     For the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA)&lt;br/&gt;and its Participating Institutions (PI), the principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator and his colleagues organize the IMA/PI Summer School&lt;br/&gt;on the Mathematics of Inverse Problems, June 15-July 3.  In this&lt;br/&gt;project the investigators include students who are not from the&lt;br/&gt;participating institutions.  The program is geared toward&lt;br/&gt;graduate students in the mathematical sciences.  The 2009 summer&lt;br/&gt;program on the mathematics of inverse problems covers three&lt;br/&gt;different themes: inverse problems for hyperbolic partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations, inverse scattering in the frequency&lt;br/&gt;domain, and variational techniques for inverse problems.  The&lt;br/&gt;program covers the techniques used to tackle problems at the&lt;br/&gt;cutting edge of mathematical research in each of these areas. &lt;br/&gt;Week-long lectures and problem-solving sessions are presented in&lt;br/&gt;an informal environment by world leaders in each of these areas&lt;br/&gt;-- William Symes (inverse problems for waves), John Sylvester&lt;br/&gt;(inverse scattering), and Jonathan Borwein (variational&lt;br/&gt;analysis).  Two of the three lecture series (inverse scattering&lt;br/&gt;and variational techniques) are under contract to appear as&lt;br/&gt;separate chapters in a book to be published by Springer in 2010. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Inverse problems are everywhere, from determining the causes&lt;br/&gt;of global warming, to finding oil and natural gas under the&lt;br/&gt;earth's surface, to diagnosing diseases with medical imaging. &lt;br/&gt;The basic idea of an inverse problem is simple:  given an&lt;br/&gt;observation, determine the cause.  Unfortunately, most inverse&lt;br/&gt;problems are not easily solved: the model for the observation is&lt;br/&gt;often incomplete or incorrect, and, even if the model is a&lt;br/&gt;perfect match to the truth, it may be impossible to accurately&lt;br/&gt;determine the cause from an observation (the curse of so-called&lt;br/&gt;"ill-posedness").  The last 20 years has seen a dramatic shift in&lt;br/&gt;the mathematics of inverse problems and the capabilities for&lt;br/&gt;solving them, initiated largely by improvements in computing&lt;br/&gt;power and the concurrent evolution of what is often called&lt;br/&gt;"experimental mathematics."  Never before have new theoretical&lt;br/&gt;tools been able to be tested with such immediacy and practical&lt;br/&gt;import.  This IMA/PI Summer School on the Mathematics of Inverse&lt;br/&gt;Problems aims at preparing future mathematicians for research in&lt;br/&gt;this growing and increasingly vital field.  The schools bring&lt;br/&gt;students together with outstanding researchers in an intensive&lt;br/&gt;setting that is intended to lead students from the more familiar&lt;br/&gt;course-oriented problem solving skills to the frontiers of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical research.  Students gain experience not only in&lt;br/&gt;attacking problems on advanced and research-grade topics, but&lt;br/&gt;also in working collaboratively with people from different&lt;br/&gt;backgrounds.  The 2009 program has received 51 applications from&lt;br/&gt;a diverse group of individuals, 29 from participating IMA&lt;br/&gt;institutions and 22 from non-IMA institutions.  This project&lt;br/&gt;supports students from non-IMA affiliated institutions. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
