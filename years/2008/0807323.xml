<AbstractNarration>Dr. Leslie Looney (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) will fill a crucial observational gap in the understanding of how massive stars form by probing fundamental properties of a new sample of 244 massive protostars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This is the largest sample of massive young stellar objects at a well-known distance (about 50 kiloparsecs). The advantage of investigating massive protostars in the LMC is that the objects can be studied without many of the problems inherent in the study of Galactic high-mass young stellar objects, which are small in numbers, have poorly constrained distances, generally suffer from confusion along the line of sight and have high foreground extinction. These benefits will allow the first detailed study of a sample of massive protostars and the environment in which they form at a uniform distance, probing the infrared properties on size scales of 0.01 parsec and molecular gas on size scales of 0.1 parsec.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Massive stars play a fundamental role in galactic evolution at all stages of their relatively short lives, and they are the only mode of star formation seen in other galaxies. Dr. Looney and his team have a new and unique sample of massive protostars from Spitzer Space Telescope observations. This work will survey these massive protostars to understand how massive protostars evolve and how that evolution affects their environment.  The research goals in this project will push our understanding of massive star formation and cluster formation while integrating the project into the promotion of teaching, training, and learning. Dr. Looney will build upon a major revitalization of the astronomy undergraduate curriculum at the University of Illinois and a new partnership with the Astronomical Research Institute, which operates three robotically controlled telescopes in Illinois, to develop astronomical laboratory experiments that will guide students through the concepts of this research. These exercises will be made available to the general public.  Finally, two graduate students, as well as one undergraduate student, will be involved in this research project, playing pivotal roles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    We explored the questions of how massive stars form in the Large Magellanic Clouds (LMC), a nearby (160,000 light years away) satellite galaxy of the Milky Way.  During this project, we made exceptional progress on this question.  Since the LMC is nearby, we have completed a catalog of all of the massive protostars (244 in total).  Using that sample, we probed the molecular gas morphology  on the large scale (Where are the Giant Molecular Clouds in which the massive young stars form and what are their properties?) and on the small scale (What is the gas distribution around the young stars and how are the massive young effecting their birthplace?).    We have completed a survey of the Giant Molecular Clouds toward the LMC (see Figure 1).  The location of the molecular gas is indicated by the contours and the location of older stars is shown by their influence on their surroundings by the color image.  Note that they sometimes overlap and sometimes not.  These structures are on the scale of 100s of light years.  We find that the more massive clouds are more likely to contain massive protostars, and the more luminous protostars are more likely to be associated with CO emission, confirming the close link between clouds and massive star formation.   On the smaller scale (3 light years), we imaged the small scale dense gas. Show in the secondary figure, we detected clumps of gas toward many star forming regions.  The younger sources are always found near the middle of the clumps, while the older ones are found farther away.  In other words, this means that the protostars quickly disperse the gas around them as they age.  We used this to estimate that a massive protostar spends 40% of its lifetime embedded in a dense molecular clump.  This suggests that once a massive star has formed within a cluster, nearby star formation will quickly cease as the clump is destroyed. We fine that the clump dispersal time is about 1 Myrs.    Educationally, we are working on many fronts. The foremost is the training of a postdoc, three graduate students, and 13 undergraduates, who have used the combined datasets to lead 10 scientific papers. Addtionally, we developed ideas for use in the undergraduate astronomy  laboratory course developed at the University of Illinois and taught in Fall 2010 and 2011.
