<AbstractNarration>CBET-0828028&lt;br/&gt;David L Kaplan, Tufts University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigators (PIs) plan to design, synthesize, and characterize the properties of a new family of silk-based diblock copolymers. This work builds on a recently completed NSF grant, in which the PIs have described many aspects of silk-protein biophysical features related to material properties for this unique family of proteins. These studies provided insight into the mechanistic behavior of silk protein self-assembly into organized material structures, as well as various biomaterial applications for these assembled materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the planned studies will be both technical and educational.&lt;br/&gt;The new polymers may have impact in many areas of specialty materials as well as providing fundamental insight into self-assembly. Impact on green chemistry is anticipated due to the all aqueous processing in the designs, assembly, and degradability of the structures derived from the proteins. Educational outreach for undergraduate and graduate students as well as the faculty involved will also be significant. This will be realized via laboratory rotations in the labs of the coPIs to gain a complete interdisciplinary experience; classroom impact for K-12 programs run through the Center for Engineering Education Outreach (CEEO); and opportunities to engage a wide range of undergraduate students, such as through the Summer Scholars, NIH-sponsored BREEM (Biomedical Research Experiences for Engineering Majors) and NIH-sponsored BEND (Bringing Engineers into New Disciplines) programs at Tufts. The coPIs will develop new course modules for both the new Engineering Biology Course and the Biophysics Course under this activity. Specific plans to address Women and Underrepresented Minorities are an integrated aspect of the program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our research takes its inspiration from materials of Nature.  We are designing new materials based on the drag line silk fiber of the Golden Orb weaver spider, Nephila Clavipes.  Here in Figure 1 is the spider on her golden web.  If we use a high powered magnifier we can examine a strand of the dragline silk fiber and identify key sequences of the amino acids that make up the fiber.  Two important amino acid sequences are identified.  One is the crystal region, shown in purple, containing many alanines (symbol A), which gives the dragline silk its strength and toughness.   A second important region of the silk fiber is an elastic section, with amino acids having 2 glycines followed by some other group.  This region, shown in green, gives the fiber its elasticity.  Using these two regions as our inspiration, we synthesized a new family of materials containing sequences of amino acids related to the crystal region and elastic region of the spider silk fiber.  Our materials are copolymers, which are long chain molecules containing both groups, in variable number.  By tailoring the number and length of these groups, we can control both the crystallinity and the self-assembled morphologies of these specially synthesized materials.  Our interest in new materials using spider silk as inspiration is based on potential applications in the field of biomedical engineering.  Figure 2 shows one suggested future application for materials with self-assembled structure and morphology.  Micelles in the dry, solid state, could be used as vehicles for drug delivery in human disease therapies.  Such micelles could be either filled up, or coated on their exterior surfaces, with a drug, and then placed inside the body for theraeputic effect.  An example of our block co-polymer is shown in cartoon form, where B-block is the elastic block, and A-block is the crystalline block (shown in green and purple, respectively).  BA6 contains one B-block and 6 A-blocks, and is capped at the end.  A molecular model of the BA6 molecule is shown, and a giant micelle that forms from BA6 is pictured here using scanning electron microscopy.  One advantage of using silk-based materials is that they are completely biocompatible.  Silk is made of exactly the same amino acids that are found in the human body, and therefore such drug delivery vehicles would resist being rejected by the body and would minimize any adverse reaction.  Another benefit of our silk-inspired materials is that they can be made using "green"all water-based processing.  This avoids the use of organic solvents that are typical in processing of synthetic block-co-polymers.  This makes our materials processing an environmentally friendly one.  Finally, a third benefit is that we can control the bio-degradabilitiy of our new materials.  By adjusting the crystalline portion, we control the ability of the body to dissolve the materials.  Therefore, we can control the rate at which such material will be re-absorbed by the body, simply by controlling the crystallinity.  Summary: New materials have been created, based on spider drag-line silk.  Their properties and structures are well controlled, and giant hollow vesicles have been formed.  The materials are eco-friendly, bio-compatible, and bio-degradable, and  have potential for application in the biomedical field.
