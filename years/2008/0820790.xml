<AbstractNarration>This project entails accelerator radiocarbon dating (AMS) and stable isotope analysis of human remains from the Nuvuk Cemetery site at Point Barrow, Alaska.  It is complimentary to genetic research directed by Dennis O'Rourke and M. Geoffrey Hayes (OPP-0732846) designed to establish the relationship between burials from this prehistoric cemetery, which are rapidly eroding into the Arctic Ocean, and modern groups now living both along the North Slope of Alaska and in the eastern Arctic.  Previous research suggests that eastern Arctic groups originated at Point Barrow; however Nuvuk Cemetery lacks the chronological control necessary to anchor prehistoric genetic variability and provide the temporal framework needed to reconstruct migratory events.  Here, the research team will extract and purify bone collagen from 100 individuals for AMS dating and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis.  The former procedure will establish much needed temporal control while the latter will allow the investigators to examine dietary patterning over the temporal span of the study.  The research at Nuvuk is in collaboration with the community of Barrow, including the participation of Barrow high school students in research activities.</AbstractNarration>

Of particular interest was detecting the Medieval Warm Period at ca.

Research Background   In the summer of 2005, Dennis OÆRourke and students from the University of Utah began working with a Point Barrow archaeological team to recover and relocate prehistoric burials from the Nuvuk cemetery site. The Inupiaq village of Nuvuk is located at Point Barrow, the northernmost site in Alaska at the interface of the Chuckchi and Beaufort Seas.

Approximately 50 burials have been recovered. Isotope studies and radiocarbon dating on 32 of these burials is complete.  Prehistoric Background: The Thule  The Classic Thule coincide with the Medieval Warm Period, ca. AD 1000-1350, and are distinguished from later Thule adaptive strategies by greater winter sedentism, technological advances in weaponry, marked investment in residential structures and a distinctive material culture. This period saw the expansion of Thule material culture as far south as the Alaska Peninsula and the migration of Thule people into the eastern Arctic coincident with the opening of sea-lanes through the Canadian archipelago for summer-feeding whales, walrus and bearded seal.   Post-dating the Classic Thule, Modified Thule material culture appears to indicate a reduction in the importance of whaling. Winter villages decline suggesting depopulation perhaps driven by a return to cooler temperatures. A reduction in the encounter rate of whales may have undermined Classic Thule social structure, organized under whaling captains, contributing to an overall decrease in population size. Foraging groups were more mobile and residential sites both more numerous and less complicated. Modified Thule subsistence patterns were much like those observed at European contact. Changes in Thule diet and settlement pattern vary regionally but generally coincide with the onset of Neo-boreal cooling, culminating in the "little ice age" (ca. AD 1550-1850).   Radiocarbon Dating Results  Nuvuk burials (n=32) have a two-sigma age range of AD 1066-1663 with confidence interval median values between AD 1189-1579; thus Nuvuk burials date from the Classic Thule through the Modified Thule period. Importantly, some of these burials date to the era of Thule migrations into the eastern Arctic. Thus, their genetic signatures provide information regarding the origins of eastern Arctic and Greenland Thule populations and are consistent with an exclusive Thule ancestry for modern Inupiat/Inuit groups.   Radiocarbon dates also indicate that these burials spanned the Medieval Warm period to Neo-boreal cooling, with a few individuals dating as late as the Little Ice Age. However, Nuvuk oxygen isotope value...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
