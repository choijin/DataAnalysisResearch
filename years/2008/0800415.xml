<AbstractNarration>DMR-0800415  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to discover novel materials as porous materials using hydrothermal techniques and ionic solvents. Characterization of the atomic architectures, which impart the selective properties unique to porous materials, will be accomplished by studying their structures in situ, including at high pressures, and uncovering general mechanisms responsible for storage and selectivity.  The development of sample cells at synchrotron X-ray and neutron facilities, where the penetrating beams allow studies of materials under their operating conditions, will be continued. These devices are available to the solid-state and materials chemistry community. Transformational materials needed for energy storage and waste clean up require a varied approach for their synthesis and for studies of their structures.  Solutions for gas storage and toxic ion sequestration may include novel synthetic porous materials operating at high-pressures to increase their capacity. Relatively few studies focus on in situ diffraction, leaving the storage mechanism under the material's operating conditions largely unaddressed. Graduate students will train in interdisciplinary settings at Stony Brook and at the national laboratories. The PI and his group are active in bringing science to a wider audience through well-attended annual lectures to the public and Suffolk County high-school teachers. The research proposed bridges synthetic chemistry and high-pressure research, a burgeoning field in condensed matter research in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed solutions to the energy challenges of the next half centaury include the synthesis, manipulation and disposal of materials at extreme conditions, including pressure. Examples of the use of extreme conditions include the sequestration of carbon dioxide in deep reservoirs and the potential to store hydrogen in porous materials at high pressure. While characterization of porous materials at room pressure is convenient, the understanding of the pressure-induced changes is pivotal to the development of real-world applications for new classes of materials being synthesized. The graduate students involved will explore a new world in "extreme conditions" research that requires new tools for synthesis and characterization, including state-of-the-art synchrotron X-ray and neutron scattering techniques capable of penetrating the cells we develop.  Outreach to a broad community will raise awareness of the need for transformational materials to address global issues.  These ideas are distilled into a freshmen seminar "On being human" which emphasizes how scientists view the world, into undergraduate courses on environmental chemistry and graduate courses. These endeavors will be presented annually to the public as part of a Friday-night lecture series, in a summer teacher training course and to high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This NSF DMR grant funded graduate students and postdoctoral workers searching for new framework materials that might be useful in the storage and separation of gases, and that might possess other interesting and important properties such as ionic conductivity.  The utility of these novel materials depends on several criteria, which individually or in combination, impart on framework materials their unique properties.  For example, selectivity toward separating a particular gas depends upon the frameworks possessing structures with regularly shaped pores, or with chemical functionality built into the pores that favors one reactant over another.  High lithium ionic conductivity depends upon a structure that contains lithium ions and vacancies to allow "hoping" and transport of lithium.  Selective removal of un-desirable radionucleides from waste streams requires frameworks that are capable of removing small quantities of ions from concentrated brine solutions, and this requires frameworks that are resistant to corrosion as well as selective. Understanding how these materials succeed, and indeed why they fail, at the atomistic level, is key to developing more effective functionality.  We developed several new frameworks concentrating on main group elements over more "traditional" first row transition metals, partly because of the biocompatibility of s-block metal ions of potassium, sodium, magnesium and calcium.  Further, porous network constructed from lightweight s-block metal ions like lithium possess gravimetric advantages for gas storage applications and potentially as electrode materials with superior thermal stability and biocompatibility.  These ultra-lightweight frameworks were tested for gas sorption and some also possess interesting luminescent properties that might be useful as gas sensors.   Using the national x-ray synchrotron and neutron sources we studied how some of these materials reacted to pressure and how they obtain their selectivity.  For example we studied the underlying atomistic mechanisms responsible for crystalline silicotitinate (CST) selective removal of radioactive cesium ions from waste solutions, even in highly alkaline and corrosive solutions. Time-resolved X-ray/Neutron diffraction (TR-XRD/ND) studies supplemented by computer modeling revealed the sequence in which sites are exchanged. The selective exchange is the result of a "double lever mechanism" where sorption of a small amount of cesium "triggers" repulsion of a nearby water molecule which opens up a second site suitable only for cesium, even in the presence of an excess of other ions. Rather than a simple ion-for-ion displacement reaction, this selective exchange proceeds via a two-step process that ensures only cesium can be absorbed is revealed with TR-XRD/ND.  Using data from high pressure experiments, we are gaining insight into changes in crystal structures and correlating this with how the frameworks behave at high gas pressures that will be encountered under operating conditions.  Over the course of this grant, we have actively involved students, including minorities and women, in these and other research projects. In doing so, we are contributing to the research experience and graduate education of under-represented groups in the U.S.  Others at Stony Brook University and at the national facilities have used the techniques and instruments funded by this program. The protocols developed to study frameworks in this way will aid greatly in the preparation and execution of future NSF grant proposals.
