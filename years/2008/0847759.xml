<AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 0847759         PI: Detamore, Michael            ORG: University of Kansas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: CAREER: Gradients and Umbilical Cord Stem Cells in Osteochondral&lt;br/&gt;Tissue Engineering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  The long-term scientific objective is to apply a gradient-based approach to the field of tissue engineering to regenerate tissues in the joints of patients suffering from sports injuries and arthritis.  The first step toward this objective is to apply methods for generating 3D bioactive signal and mechanical stiffness gradients to accelerate osteochondral tissue formation.  The overall strategy will be to measure the responses of stem cells to specific combinations of signal and stiffness gradients.  The stem cells to be evaluated are human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal stem cells (hUCMSCs), an exciting new cell source in musculoskeletal tissue engineering.  Gradients will be achieved by one of two means: a diffusion-driven hydrogel system and a novel microparticle-based scaffold. Combinations of signal and stiffness gradients will be explored, culminating in a construct in the shape of a mandibular condyle. Gradients have been used in a variety of other disciplines, and are crucial to guiding cell behavior in fundamental biological processes such as embryonic development and wound healing, but have yet to be investigated in musculoskeletal tissue engineering.  hUCMSCs remain virtually unexplored in musculoskeletal tissue engineering, and will have broad application.  Successful completion of this project will lead to a better fundamental understanding of hUCMSCs and gradient strategies, which will have a tremendous impact, offering the deliverable of a new cell source and a new paradigm of chemical and mechanical gradients for musculoskeletal tissue engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  The educational objectives of the proposal are to (1) create a new project for high school girls at an existing summer engineering camp, (2) establish a formal link between the School of Engineering and an existing undergraduate research program (IMSD) for underrepresented groups, and (3) expand the burgeoning bioengineering graduate program at KU. The PI took an active leadership role in spearheading a multidisciplinary bioengineering graduate program that began in the Fall of 2007 at the University of Kansas.  Graduate students recruited for this project are likely to be from this degree program, identified as an educational and economic priority for Kansas.  The aforementioned undergraduate initiative will impact underrepresented groups across the School of Engineering. Elements of the research project will be incorporated into the tissue engineering course already developed by the PI, and will provide a new hands-on experiment in the PI?s annual ?Project Discovery? program, a week-long engineering summer camp for female high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The focus of the project was to establish new technology for regenerating tissues with a complex interface, in particular the trachea (with an airway epithelium on the inside and a cartilage-like exterior sruface) and bone-cartilage interfaces.  The educational objectives were to advance the Bioengineering Graduate Degree Program at the University of Kansas and to engage Kindergarten through high school students in these topics via a variety of programs.  The outcomes of the cartilage/bone interface technology have been quite encouraging.  Using microspheres, we are able to build a cylindrical plug that an orthopedic surgeon can use to fill a hole after drilling out injured cartilage following an impact injury to the knee.  We are pleased to report that this technology has secured additional external funding, and is the process of being commercialized.  Two U.S. patents have been awarded, and another is pending.  This line of research has branced off in an exciting new direction based on decellularized cartilage, which is a new technology that is still in the early stages of development, and which is covered in yet another U.S. patent application.  In addition, we are working to bring the trachea technology to the clinic.  In collaboration with an otolaryngologist (head and neck surgeon), we have demonstrated the ability to regenerate defects in rabbit tracheas, as demonstrated in the Figure.  A U.S. patent applicaiton is currently under consideration for this technology as well.   In terms of educational initiatives, we have had dozens of outreach efforts ranging from elementary school children to high school students, and even including three elementary school teachers.  In these outreach efforts, a variety of projects were developed to engage K-12 students in hands-on projects to familiarize them with tissue engineering and biomaterials.
