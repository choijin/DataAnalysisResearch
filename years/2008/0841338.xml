<AbstractNarration>From Hectares to Nanometers: GK-12 Multidisciplinary Explorations of &lt;br/&gt;Tropical Ecosystems and Functional Nanoscience&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This GK-12 project builds a strategic interdisciplinary partnership between the University of Puerto Rico?s Institute of Tropical Ecosystem Studies and Institute for Functional Nanomaterials, which together provide doctoral research projects to over eighty PhD students in chemistry, biology, chemical physics, and environmental science. It will strengthen 7th-9th teachers and students? scientific knowledge through multidisciplinary explorations of tropical ecosystems and functional nanoscience, while improving graduate students? abilities to communicate and teach science. Through this GK 12 project: 24 graduate students will be better prepared to be leaders and to communicate and collaborate effectively with colleagues and peer reviewers as well as with teachers, students, and the general public; 48 science teachers in eight 7th-9th level schools will broaden their science content knowledge and have a better understanding of nano and environmental sciences; 165 additional teachers will participate in the Summer Institute gaining science content knowledge and acquire educational materials development skills; 3,000 7th?9th students will experience the excitement of scientific research and improved understanding of science. This GK-12 project will increase and diversify the national pool of competent scientists, enhance teachers? content knowledge in two multidisciplinary science fields, provide 7th 9th students understanding of the core concepts and ideas in nano and environmental sciences, and develop modern educational materials. The GK-12 educational materials and other products will be incorporated into the Pre Service Teacher Science Methodology Course, impacting future teachers and their students, and they will be available online for teachers and students around the world. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

A digital magazine Ciencia X 10-9 was created by the program fellows and staff.  It is a free digital magazine dedicated to the integration of Nanoscience and Environmental Sciences and can be assessed at http://gk12.upr.edu/index.php/revista. Each issue is packed with articles, activities and colorful illustrations on interesting topics in these areas. The magazine is written in a format that allows the teachers to use it as a resource in their classrooms. It can be used as a supplement to activities offered by teachers, since its content is aligned to the science standards of the Department of Education. Although the content was created mainly for middle and high schools, it is written to be accessible and attractive to different ages and to the general pu...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
