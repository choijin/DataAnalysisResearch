<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to investigate a number of technologies for virtual manufacturing and web-based machining process simulation and learning for research and education: 1) virtual modeling of computer numerical control mill, lathe and vertical machining center, 2) mechanistic modeling of cutting forces and surface roughness in high speed end-milling of thin-walled components of difficult-to-machine metals, such as titanium alloys used in aerospace manufacturing, 3) web-based machining process simulation and learning. The research approach will be based on integration of three-dimension simulation environment, mechanistic models, finite element analysis, sensor data, design of experiment, and experimental verification for modeling and simulating cutting forces and surface roughness, and simulation of machining processes. The effects of cutting parameters (spindle speed, feed per tooth, axial and radial depth of cut, and corner radius) and cutting tools will be investigated.   Cutting force models will consider end-mill corner radius and number of flutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits and broader impacts of the research will be: mechanistic models for simulating and predicting cutting forces and surface finish in high speed end-milling of titanium alloys; reliable tool for virtual manufacturing , that is, computer simulation of machining processes; improved knowledge of cutting forces and the effect of cutting parameters; increased manufacturing efficiency, quality and productivity; reduced lead-time and cost of making both commercial and military aircraft parts; reduced training time for computer numerical control programmers and operators; innovative use of technology to teach students with interest in 3-dimensional environment; reduced teaching time on physical machines with associated cost savings; portable web-based learning environment that allows teaching computer numerical control course off campus to researchers and engineers in industry worldwide; and involvement of underrepresented minority students. The research results will be disseminated to the engineering community through journal and conference publications.</AbstractNarration>
