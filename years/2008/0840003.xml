<AbstractNarration>This project, "An Artist Unpacks Palmer Station" would consist of drawings chronicling an artist?s immersion in this remote setting dedicated to scientific pursuit. The drawings would inventory visible manifestations of climate change and to seek to explain them through interaction with the station?s scientific community. The routines of daily life would also be recorded, allowing the drawings to present a full picture of human existence in this singular location. By deconstructing and then reassembling the details of travel, research, life forms, and landscape, the project would allow parallels to emerge between scientific study and art-making as paths to understanding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with the artist?s previous projects, the drawings would be executed in colored pencil on vertically oriented, scroll-like sheets of white paper, uniform in width but varying in length as the subject requires. (Twelve inches wide and up to five feet in length.) In style, they present visual inventories, collections of discreet objects drawn in miniature (about one-inch square) and set row upon row. Each drawing in turn becomes a page in a vast pictographic text that gives viewers insight into what it takes to perform specific tasks or be in particular settings. Photography would also be used to record objects and circumstances so that the more time-consuming process of drawing could be extended beyond the stay in Antarctica and to minimize the artist?s presence when necessary.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Unpacking Antarctica  During the close to two months spent in Antarctica I drew, made gouache and watercolor paintings from observation, and took (digital) photographs as well as videos at all sites visited.

Wherever I went, I gathered visual information, and made finished works or accumulated images for later reference.   I also kept a blog with text and photos throughout http://elise-on-ice.blogspot.com It provided pictures and text for the many people (including elementary school students) following my travels.  I left Antarctica having finished many postcard-sized paintings, a dozen 10 x 14" paintings, two 22 x 30" watercolors and two 30 x 42 gouache and watercolor landscape paintings. The two large landscape paintings, one done at Lake Hoare, the other from the library in Crary Lab at McMurdo Station, served as backgrounds for a vertical "list" of significant camp /McMurdo objects, respectively, drawn with colored pencils, upon return to NYC. Lake Hoare Field Camp is included in this reportÆs images. For the most part I worked outside, adding layers of clothing and gloves the longer I sat. I knew it was time to quit when my watercolors froze and became unworkable on the glass palette.

In addition there are narratives and images from helicopter journeys with Luigi as he collected samples and I drew. By following the green "directional" arrows on the drawings one can read and view a complete narrative of the preparation, transit to, and time spent in Antarctica. Four of the drawings are pictured here....]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
