<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use the opportunity afforded by the PRE-Depression Investigation of Cloud-systems in the Tropics (PREDICT) field experiment, currently planned for August and September 2010, to investigate the pre-genesis and genesis of North Atlantic tropical cyclones (TCs). The proposed work is motivated by previous research that identified six distinct objectively defined North Atlantic TC genesis pathways.  A distinctive aspect of the proposed research is that TC genesis/null events will be stratified by the six previously identified genesis pathways and analyzed over several complete TC seasons to facilitate uncovering distinctive pathway-dependent dynamical signatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project tasks will be: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(i) construct a TC climatology over recent North Atlantic TC seasons (not just&lt;br/&gt;TC cases since null events are important and will outnumber TC developments) for each of the identified six genesis pathways;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(ii) develop a diagnostic parameter indicating the preferred genesis pathway in a region from analysis of recent North Atlantic TC seasons for use during PREDICT and establish which genesis parameters are important for TC development depending on genesis path;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(iii) perform detailed diagnostic analyses of TC genesis/null events prior to and during PREDICT to identify genesis pathway-dependent governing physical relationships;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(iv) create genesis pathway composite analysis ensembles using ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) techniques to highlight pathway-dependent environmental signatures and dynamically important features and relationships; and &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(v) conduct high-resolution modeling studies of archetype TC events during PREDICT to evaluate pathway-dependent model sensitivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to the intellectual-merit criterion, the research will advance scientific understanding by isolating the various environmental and dynamical factors that control TC development along individual genesis pathways; establishing the governing dynamical and thermodynamical processes applicable to the individual TC genesis pathways; and increasing our understanding of the physical mechanisms that control TC predictability and error growth along different genesis pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to the broader impact criterion, the anticipated advances in scientific understanding will translate into improved medium- and short-range forecasts of TC genesis over the North; contribute to the specialized research training and advanced education of the two graduate students to be supported by this project; and enrich and enhance the teaching and scholarship of the PI and his colleagues in the areas of synoptic-dynamic and tropical meteorology.</AbstractNarration>
