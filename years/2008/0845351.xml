<AbstractNarration>This research will examine two related issues: (1) how to motivate people to contribute more to communities such as open source software and Wikipedia that produce public goods, and (2) how to strengthen people's self-concepts and relationships with others by using content they create online to support reminiscence.  This work deeply intertwines computing and social science, using insight about people's motivation, goals, and behavior to drive models, algorithms, and interfaces that leverage people's online activity to create value for individuals and society. The online nature of this activity allows it to be aggregated into large data sets for modeling (e.g., social network analysis) and mining (e.g., collaborative filtering); a major theme of the research is to effectively wring more value out of the activities people already do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding why people act online will lead to process models that explain important features of the data people generate through their actions as well as new algorithms for exploiting that data. For example, the research will model how critical events and roles people adopt affect people's contributions over time in Wikipedia. Such models models will drive algorithms that expose people to other people, groups, tools, policies, and group norms in contexts the models suggest will increase people's motivation to contribute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding users' goals will also lead to new applications for data and more effective interfaces for presenting it. The research will study how and why people reminisce through a series of lightweight prototypes that cue memories, as well as through analysis of online behavior in social media. This work will lead to algorithms that capture memory-laden content from activity in social media and interfaces that effectively use that content to support reminiscence. Preliminary work suggests that spontaneous, mobile delivery of appropriately chosen reminders promises to increase the value people derive from the content they create.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More broadly, the process of designing these models, algorithms, and interfaces will lead to insights about using social science theory in design that can be captured and shared with practitioners, new methodologies for analyzing complex social data, and the production of useful behavioral datasets that will benefit other researchers. Increasing participation in public goods like Wikipedia will improve the individual experience of members and the social goods they create. Tools developed in the domain of reminiscing have the potential to improve many people's lives, especially as the population ages.  The education plan provides for richer research experiences through conference attendance and summer exchange programs with other labs. It also helps students develop the interdisciplinary attitudes and skills needed for this work through courses that look at real systems and the data they provide from both technological and social perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to build models of people's behavior in online systems including Wikipedia and Facebook, and to build systems that help people be more effective at creating knowledge and understanding themselves.   On the Wikipedia/creating knowledge side, we made a number of advances, including:  Better models of people's writing behavior on Wikipedia, and ways to predict which pages they choose to contribute to.  The modeling methodology we used here has been followed by a number of people studying other online collaborative systems. A deeper understanding of how people collaborate when working on Wikipedia.  Notably, unlike many projects where people plan and coordinate before doing the work, on Wikipedia people often coordinate by discovering other people who are independently working on the same articles and then working together to resolve differences. Methods for looking at the different kinds of behavior people exhibit and inferring what their roles are in an online group; knowing who is doing what kinds of work is important for increasing the effectiveness of the groups. Simple ways to estimate the quality of an English Wikipedia article and provide concrete suggestions on how to improve it, such as improving the references or adding images.   On the self-understanding side, our key advances include:  Building systems that use content people create in Facebook and other social media to help them reminisce about their past and reflect on their well-being, and demonstrating the potential for these systems to improve people's well-being.  This work contributed to the initial development of several important research topics, including studies of self-tracking and the value of digital possessions.  Learning moreabout the limitations of using that content for reflection.  Showing individual items tends to focus people's attention on specific moments rather than the bigger picture of themselves or of their relationships with others, but showing patterns and graphs that focus only on that big picture isn't very effective without some details to help people connect the graphs to specific events. Increasing our understanding of just what kinds of content people do and don't create online, and why.  Notably, mundane, sensitive, and negative content--all of which might be useful for self-understanding and reflection--are often not available because of the norms people have when using online systems and because of their fear of what systems might do with it.   Discovering that despite those problems, people do wish they could capture more about themselves because they see the value of having a personal archive, and showing both the ways they currently use systems to accomplish all of these goals and suggesting new designs that might make this easier.   The project also has had practical impacts on real systems.  Wikipedia's SuggestBot tool, created by the lead researcher to help people find useful articles to work on, has been used tens of thousands of times and was significantly upgraded as part of this grant. The systems for self-understanding have been used by around a thousand people, and a student from the self-understanding project became a senior engineer at TimeHop, which is very similar to our work and has over a million users.     The project has also led to a number of educational advances.  A course around data analysis for understanding people, developed around the methods and topics from the project, has been offered five times and is now an important part of the core graduate curriculum in Cornell's Information Science department.  Dozens of undergrads have gotten the chance to do research around this project and many of them have successfully contributed to published papers and gone on to good careers and/or good grad schools.  The NSF also values diversity; in computing and information science, projects are often disproportionately staffed and run by men, but in this project, women have been equal an...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
