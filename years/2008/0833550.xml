<AbstractNarration>France ? U.S. Young Engineering Scientists Nanotechnology Symposium 2008&lt;br/&gt;0833550&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to Duke University will support a nanotechnology workshop to spur collaboration between researchers in France and in the United States.  The three-day workshop will be held at the French Embassy in Washington, DC in July of 2008 and will include the participation of thirty U.S.-based researchers and an equivalent number of French researchers, all at early stages in their careers.  The workshop has three thrusts:  ?Beyond Silicon? Nano electronics, Medical and Health Applications, and Societal Impacts.  The U.S. participants are mostly at the assistant professor level.  Partner funding is provided by the French government to support the participation of the French researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The senior researchers who are organizing the conference include the principal investigator Mark Wiesner from Duke University, Jim Yardley from Columbia University, Barbara Harthorn from UCSB, Dominique Vuillaume from the Insitut d?Electronique, Micro-électronique et Nanotechologie - CNRS, Bertrand Foucade from Université Joseph Fourier de Grenoble, and Jean-Yves Bottero from the Centre Européen de Recherche et d?Enseignement de Géosciences de l?Environnement-CNRS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
