<AbstractNarration>Most of the Internet's complexity resides in software running on Internet routers.  Bugs in this software are a highly critical problem, leading to a number of recent high-profile attacks and outages, and are increasingly becoming a bottleneck in building highly reliable networks.  The PIs are designing and evaluating techniques to make the Internet resilient to software bugs. Their approach consists of two key components.  First, they are building a highly reliable single instance of a network router. This involves performing a characteristic study of bugs in router software, by using static and dynamic code analysis and by taxonomizing publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. They also apply and extend techniques such as rollback, reordering inputs, microreboots, and automated debugging to construct a software router resilient to implementation bugs.  Second, the PIs are developing and building an architecture for highly-available bug-resistant networks.  Their design leverages the principle of "control and data diversity", which simultaneously runs multiple functionally-equivalent instances of a piece of software or data.  Each instance is changed from the others in a way that makes it unlikely multiple copies will simultaneously undergo the same bug, for example by randomizing the execution environment, having each instance be responsible for a subset of routes, or by having different programmers implement each instance.  In addition to producing designs and algorithms that enable these networks, the PIs will also make available tools and implementations to enable their use.  &lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this project will significantly improve the Internet's ability to avoid and recover from failures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Computer networks like the Internet underlie how we live, work, and play.  These networks consist of a tremendous amount of complex software to support networked applications, servers in data centers, and the routers and switches connecting them together.  Making this software more reliable is key to making the Internet, and the many services that rely on the Internet, worthy of society's trust.   In this project, we investigated the root causes of "bugs" in networked software, designed tools and techniques for detecting and diagnosing bugs, and explored ways to make future networked systems inherently more reliable.  The research focused on the reliability of fourmain parts of network software:   - Routers: the underlying equipment that directs traffic between computers on the Internet    - Controllers: the software that network administrators run to to tell their equipment what to do   - Hypervisors: the software servers run to share computers across multiple virtual machines   - Applications: the cloud services that offer search, email, and other critical functions   In our project, we designed and prototyped (i) a bug-tolerant router that survives bugs in router software, (ii) a tool for generating tests to uncover bugs in controller platforms, (iii) a novel way to support multiple virtual machines without the risk of compromises of a buggy hypervisor, and (iv) a tool for detecting network performance bugs in multi-tier cloud applications.  These projects led to internationally-visible research publications, open-source software, and technology transfer to cloud service providers.
