<AbstractNarration>The project provides funds for student travel to the 2008 Dynamic Systems and Control Conference in Ann Arbor,MI, USA, to be held from October 19-22, 2008. The DSCC is the first conference to be held by the Dynamic Systems and Control division of ASME separate from the  annual IMECE conference with an expected level of participation of over 400 scientists, students, and practicing engineers. The intellectual merit of the project is that it will enable US students to participate in a high quality, peer-reviewed technical conference that is attended by leaders in the systems and control area. With over 200 research presentations, numerous technical workshops, plenary lectures,  and group panel discussions by leaders on numerous special issues of importance 2008 DSCC will expose the students to the state-of-the-art and emerging areas of research and technology in the systems and control area. The conference provides a unique opportunity for students to present their work to their peers and renowned researchers. The conference provides special activities for students seeking to expand educational opportunities and for those nearing graduation to seek employment in industry, academia, and government labs. The broader impact of the project is that it will assist in training the next generation of control researchers and engineers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control systems are ubiquitous; they can be found in such diverse areas as automated manufacturing systems, automobiles, airplanes, refineries, power plants, electrical power grid, Internet, communication, chemical processes, civil infrastructures, and nanotechnology. With the wide spread use of engineering devices in the modern society, control technology is playing an ever increasing role in the advancement and modernization of these devices using low-cost sensors and actuators. Control technology is a critical area for the US industry, the future technological edge and security of the United States depends on keeping a pool of trained scientists and engineers. The students funded under this project will be future leaders of control technology. Participation from underrepresented groups such as women, minorities, and disabled students is strongly encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
