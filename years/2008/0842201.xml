<AbstractNarration>   Understanding the genetic control of animal body patterning is the long-term goal of the Mahaffey laboratory. Hox genes are master regulators of body pattern, specifying anterior-posterior anatomical structures along the body axis of all animals. The Hox genes encode transcription factors that activate downstream genes required for proper embryonic development along the anterior-posterior body axis. However, it is not clear how specific Hox proteins regulate distinct downstream genes because they all bind to similar DNA sequences in their target genes.  Likewise, it is not clear how such highly conserved factors generate the diversity of animal body forms observed throughout nature. What is clear is that these genes specify similar body parts in diverse species and also contribute to developmental defects and cancers when miss-expressed in the wrong tissues. With this award, the Mahaffey lab will study how Hox proteins integrate with other transcription factors to specify body patterns, using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. Drosophila has proved to be an excellent model for biomedical research. In their studies, the Mahaffey lab is taking a two-pronged approach. One relies on the extensive genetic tools developed in the fruit fly to discover molecular processes of developmental regulation by Hox genes. The other involves taking a less-standard, population genetics approach for systems biological studies. In this manner, they hope to extend what is known about the function of Hox proteins and how they integrate into the network of genes governing animal development. While medical relevance of this work has been mentioned above, this award will provide opportunities for undergraduate and even high school students, in addition to graduate students, to have an opportunity to participate in and learn about scientific research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit  The major goals of this project were to investigate the genetic architecture governing development of complex animal body structures, using leg development in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster as a model system. Animal genomes contain thousands of genes, which are used over and over during development of body structures and organs.  We know the roles of some of these genes, but for many we have little information of what processes they are involved in.      Many genes and developmental processes are conserved in most animals, so model organisms such as the fruit fly Drosophila often are excellent tools to investigate gene function, and our studies are often quite relevant to human biology. Though prior studies had identified many genes important for leg development, we had indications that not all key players had been discovered. Our goal was to identify new genetic processes in this system.

Interestingly, one of the genes that we identified in this study, disco-related was part of our next aim described below.     In the other aim of this project, we examined further the roles of two already known genes that function redundantly during Drosophila leg development, the genes disconnected and disco-related. Our previous work demonstrated that if either of these genes was expressed in the developing wing, the wing was transformed into a leg.  Not very useful for the fly, but very useful for studying how these genes controlled leg development.

We discovered that these genes are required to maintain the expression of other major genetic pathways of signaling and gene expression that specify the leg cells fates.
