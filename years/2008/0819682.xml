<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Dynamic Factor Demand: Frictions and Aggregate Productivity Effects&lt;br/&gt;PI: Russell W. Cooper, University of Texas, SES-0819682&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research studies the dynamics of capital and labor utilization and adjustment in the firm. The goal of the research is to specify and solve dynamic optimization problems of a firm, or its plants, taking into account the difficulties faced in adjusting capital and labor inputs. Capturing the complexity of this adjustment is one of the research accomplishments. &lt;br/&gt;One novel feature of the research is the use of an "Euler equation" continuous-optimization approach to estimation even though adjustment of the factors is intermittent. The project develops an approach for estimating the demand for capital in this way. Other research extends this approach to applications with occasionally binding constraints. This includes the study of a problem in which a firm faces financial restrictions which only bind in some states, and a household problem of limited access to capital markets.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding dynamic factor demand is quite important for policy purposes. For instance, the analysis of a reduction in the cost of capital through an investment tax credit, must be consistent with the nature of micro-level adjustment frictions. Otherwise, the predictions of the policy effects may be erroneous.&lt;br/&gt;Studies of aggregate productivity likewise need to take account of the significance of frictions in the reallocation of capital and labor. This research builds upon characterizations of the micro-level frictions to study the dynamics of aggregate productivity. Specifically, it provides an environment to evaluate the significance of endogenous reallocation costs for measured aggregate productivity. The methods developed then are applied to study productivity behavior during disruptions such as those caused by the Great Depression in the United States.</AbstractNarration>

When factors of production are reallocated to their most efficient uses, productivity will be high. But there are a number of impediments to reallocation including the costs of literally moving workers and capital between production sites and policy measures that impede these flows.  The research funded under this grant looked at the role of reallocation on productivity in both the United States and China. These studies contained theoretical as well as empirical components.  One study focused on how reallocation influenced productivity over the business cycle in the United States.  For this analysis, there were costs of adjusting the capital stock across heterogeneous plants. The point was to understand how these frictions contributed to variations in aggregate productivity over the business cycles. The analysis highlighted the interaction between the dispersion of productivity over and level of productivity over the business cycle.  Two other studies addressed reallocation in China, both between public and private plants as well as the impediments to reallocation brought about by recent labor market reforms in China.  The analysis identified modest productivity differences between public and private plants in China. Recent policy interventions, particularly the imposition of severance pay, were identified as increasing the frictions to reallocation and thus contributing to a reduction in productivity of private plants in China.
