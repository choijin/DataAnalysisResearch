<AbstractNarration>Scheduling problems are among the most widely studied class of problems in Computer Science.  These problems have applications is several areas, e.g., in large-scale communication networks.  There is strong evidence that most kinds of scheduling problems cannot be optimally solved in a reasonable amount of time.  However, the question of finding approximately optimal solutions for many kinds of scheduling problems is unresolved.  The goal of this research is to develop new techniques to determine which scheduling problems can be solved approximately optimally in a reasonable amount of computing time, and to develop efficient algorithms for the positive examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Gandhi has an excellent record of preparing undergraduates for this kind of research, as well as guiding them in it.  This project continues his program of helping students at Rutgers Camden to discover their own potential by working very closely with them -- working on research problems with them, mentoring them, and encouraging their interest in discrete mathematics and algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
