<AbstractNarration>0846719&lt;br/&gt;Kirisits&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanomaterials are being produced globally - the worldwide market for products incorporating nanotechnology is estimated to be $2.4 trillion dollars by 2014. Nanomaterials have a tremendous range of beneficial uses including controlled delivery of therapeutic agents, efficient conversion of solar energy to electrical energy, and effective removal of micropollutants from water. In spite of their many beneficial applications, nanomaterials may have unintended adverse effects on natural and engineered systems. The principal objective of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the effect of a variety of nanomaterials on bacteria, particularly those found in engineered systems pertaining to drinking water, wastewater, and water reuse.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research tasks will be conducted to test the following four hypotheses: (1) &lt;br/&gt;bacteria develop increased tolerance and resistance to nanomaterial insults, (2) &lt;br/&gt;nanomaterial insults change microbial community structure, (3) biofilm bacteria respond differently than planktonic bacteria to a nanomaterial insult and (4) biofilm mechanical properties are affected by nanomaterials. In this research, six common nanomaterials &lt;br/&gt;carbon fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, nanoscale cerium oxide, nanosilver, nanoscale titanium dioxide, and nanoscale zero valent iron  will be examined for their effects on pure bacterial cultures and on mixed microbial communities representative of drinking water, wastewater, and water reuse applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational plan includes shadowing a high school class of predominantly minority students through 4 years, creating a program to increase interactions between graduate engineering and science students, and organizing a student symposium on nanomaterials in the environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The global use of engineered nanomaterials, which are synthetic materials that have at least one dimension less than 100 nm, has exploded.  While nanomaterials have a tremendous range of beneficial uses, their environmental impacts must be considered because nanomaterials have and will continue to find their way into the environment.  In this project, the impacts of nanomaterials on bacteria that occur in natural and engineered water systems were studied.  The main goal of the project was to advance our understanding of the tolerance (i.e., the ability to survive an insult) and resistance (i.e., the ability to grow in the presence of an insult) of bacteria to nanomaterials; in particular, we examined how tolerance and resistance are impacted by water chemistry and the state of the bacteria (i.e., free-swimming planktonic cells or attached assemblages of sessile biofilm cells) and how low-level nanomaterial exposures impact antibiotic resistance.     Intellectual Merit:   In this research, laboratory studies were conducted with bacteria that are common in water systems, including Escherichia coli, which is sometimes enteropathogenic, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is an opportunistic human pathogen. Although a variety of nanomaterials were employed in the project, much of the work was conducted with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) because they are commonly used for their antimicrobial effects in medical applications such as catheters and wound dressings.   As opposed to the generally increased antibiotic tolerance of biofilm bacteria as compared to planktonic bacteria, the tolerance of biofilms to AgNPs was very similar to that of their planktonic counterparts.  However, when the bacteria were initially grown in the presence of a sub-lethal concentration of AgNPs and then were challenged with higher concentrations of AgNPs, the tolerance of biofilms exceeded that of planktonic cells.  Interestingly, initially growing P. aeruginosa cells in the presence of a sub-lethal concentration of AgNPs spurred an increased tolerance to subsequent exposures of lethal AgNP concentrations (as compared to the tolerance of cells that had not initially been grown in the presence of a sub-lethal AgNP concentration). This is concerning because it is quite likely that bacteria will be exposed to sub-lethal AgNP concentrations in the environment; this exposure could make it more difficult for medical professionals to thwart bacterial infections with AgNPs.  Water chemistry greatly impacted the toxicity of AgNPs to bacteria, underscoring that the environmental impacts of nanomaterials must be evaluated under site-relevant water chemistry conditions.  In particular, water chemistry conditions that produced an increased Ag+ concentration from the dissolution of AgNPs caused increased toxicity to E. coli; water chemistry conditions that produced increased concentrations of negatively charged AgClx(x-1)- species from the dissolution of AgNPs caused decreased toxicity to E. coli.   Exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of AgNPs caused changes in the resistance of P. aeruginosa to multiple antibiotics.  For instance, P. aeruginosa became more resistant to chlortetracycline but less resistant to erythromycin.  The cases where AgNP exposure increased bacterial resistance to antibiotics are troubling, given that antibiotic resistance already costs U.S. households billions of dollars annually.  The cases where AgNP exposure decreased bacterial resistance to antibiotics are exciting because it suggests that AgNPs and antibiotics could be used synergistically to combat recalcitrant infections.  Broader Impacts:   A unique science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) outreach program was created in which our university team adopted the 38-person freshman class at a local high school and worked with them throughout their four years.  Most of the students in the adopted cohort were from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields (e.g., the cohort was 80% Hispanic, 57% female).  Two smaller STEM activities were conducted in the first two years, building toward three extensive, applied, active-learning engineering modules in the last two years.  Surveys were conducted periodically to evaluate the students? perception of and interest/confidence in STEM. The repeated interactions between the team and the students were designed to build personal mentoring relationships, such that the students could enjoy STEM in a supportive atmosphere. This study found that providing recurrent outreach to the adopted cohort over four years with a diverse team of mentors improved students? comfort in the classroom, enjoyment of hands-on activities, and perception of engineering.   One symposium (Translating Graduate Nano-Experience to an Academic Career: Integrating Social Aspects in Engineering Education through Active Learning) was organized by PI Kirisits and Dr. Navid Saleh; fifteen graduate students and postdoctoral fellows participated.   Results from this project were disseminated to the scientific community.  Four journal papers, ten conference presentations, and four graduate theses were produced. Additionally, research results were incorporated into two new undergraduate nanotechnology classes at the University of Texas at Austin.    Fourteen undergraduate students, thirteen graduate students, and two postdoctoral fellows contributed to the research and/or the STEM outreach program, representing significant diversity with respect to gender, race, ethnicity, and economic status.
