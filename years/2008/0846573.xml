<AbstractNarration>Technical: This CAREER award includes a multifaceted research project on silicon and germanium nanowires and heterostructures. The research plan aims to develop novel Si/Ge heterostructures at the nanoscale using bottom up growth techniques, to investigate their intrinsic electronic properties (e.g. carrier mobility, carrier concentration), and to design and fabricate novel, one-dimensional electronic devices with high electron mobility. Specifically, the research will address the following vectors in the area of nanowire growth and fabrication: (1) Design and grow high mobility one-dimensional electron systems using radial band-structure engineering and modulation doping in Si/Ge core/shell structures. (2) Develop new methods to fabricate low resistance contacts to semiconductor nanowires, which will make it possible to explore the intrinsic electronic properties, as well as to enable high performance nanowire transistors. (3) Investigate the magneto-transport properties of nanowire devices down to low temperature as a spectroscopic method, and in particular to measure electron density and intrinsic mobility.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. Silicon and germanium nanowires represent a particularly attractive platform for future device fabrication at the nanoscale because of their compatibility to the current electronics architecture: complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS). The project offers an excellent opportunity for training of students in an interdisciplinary environment. Through this CAREER, the PI will integrate the results of his research activities with the courses taught at the undergraduate and graduate level, and with outreach activities and events; include undergraduate students as participants in the proposed research activities, with an emphasis on diversity; and inspire hundreds of K-12 underrepresented students in outreach activities and events organized in collaboration with the Women in Engineering Program at the University of Texas in Austin.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of this research effort is to develop a new class of high mobility bottomuponedimensionalsilicongermaniumnanowire heterostructures by combining band engineering and modulation doping, investigate theirelectronic and structural properties, and demonstrate electron devices enabled by this learning.  We have developed novel growth techniques for epitaxial coreshellnanowireheterostructures, which combine nanowire growth using the vapor liquid solid mechanism with epitaxial, conformal growth by ultra-high-vacuum chemical vapor deposition.  We have introduced characterization techniques to probe the elastic strainusing micro Raman spectroscopy of individual nanowires, combined with latticedynamic theory.By controlling the dopant incorporation during shell growth we demonstrated radial modulation doping in core-shell nanowires, a technique which enhances the carrier mobility, allows a decoupling of electron transport in the core and the shell, and provides a method to determine the band offset between core and shell in nanowire heterostructures.  Students were trained in state-of-art semiconductor growth techniques by chemical vapor deposition, as well as thecharacterization by transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and electron device fabrication andcharacterization.  Twelve journal articles, eight refereed conference proceeding papers, and one book chapter resulted from researchsupported by this grant.   Three Ph.D. and two M.S. theses have resulted from the work performed under this award. Topicsfrom this research effort, such as Ge nanowire growth and electron transport in Ge-SixGe1-x core-shell nanowires havebeen integrated in one undergraduate course (EE339, Solid State Devices), and one graduate course (Semiconductor nanostructures) the PI teaches at The University of Texas at Austin.
