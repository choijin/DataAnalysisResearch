<AbstractNarration>CBET-0829092&lt;br/&gt;Cannon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerous U.S. groundwater sources host unacceptable levels of perchlorate, nitrate, chromate, vanadate, etc.  Available processes for removing these contaminants generally invoke use of petrochemical-based ion exchange media or membranes, which force municipalities and their suppliers to rely on non-renewable raw materials that are mined from non-sustainable and uncertain sources.  The investigators are targeting to devise means of employing instead lignocellulosic biomaterials (biocarbons) that originate naturally from within America.  The team will build on their recently-devised means of functionalizing the porous biocarbons with reduced-nitrogen groups that remove perchlorate and other oxyanions.  The project will link into the Sloan Fellowship program for Minority Ph.D. candidates at Penn State, which is co-led by PI Dr. Cannon.  There will also be participation in Penn State's CURO program, which facilitates minority undergraduate research.</AbstractNarration>

By means of multiple analyses, the authors surmised that the active quaternary ammonium sites within the tailored bituminous-based GAC were more exposed and thus more accessible for perchlorate adsorption than those within wood based GAC.  The effect of the preparation temperature (T), solution pH (pH) and the dry mass ratio of QAE-to-GAC (R) over the perchlorate adsorption capacity (Qe) were studied by the Response Surface Methodology.  Statistical analysis revealed that the more favorable preparation protocols were: (a) 75?, pH 11 and R of 1.73 g QAE/ g GAC, or (b) 35?, pH 14 and R of 4.00 g QAE/ g GAC.  In rapid small scale column test, it was observed that the tailored carbons that were made by means of these two protocols exhibited 18 to 20 times longer bed life than did a Pristine GAC, when processing groundwater that had...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
