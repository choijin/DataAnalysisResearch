<AbstractNarration>The Northeastern University ADVANCE Institutional Transformation project will systematically integrate concerns about interdisciplinary and international research into the project model for change.  The Advancing Women within Interdisciplinary and International Networks (AWIIN) model for change will transform recruitment practices; strengthen professional networks for women; and develop a forum for comprehensive engagement of leadership to increase accountability and to instill long-lasting changes in institutional policies and practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific interventions target the isolation of women due to their solo status and the challenge to succeed in interdisciplinary and international research environments at Northeastern and beyond. Efforts to improve retention include Interdisciplinary Recruitment Workshops integrated with campus research center conferences and a new Dual Career Network Committee through the New England Higher Education Recruitment Consortium (HERC). Women?s mixed gender networks are strengthened with External Career Mentoring Teams, the improved existing faculty mentoring program, grants to stimulate interdisciplinary and international collaborations, campus-wide networks, and Greater Boston Area Faculty Seminars. The new Leadership Academy is a forum to engage institutional leaders, influential faculty, and rising women leaders in changing institutional policy and organizational practices. The Academy will also be a forum to enhance intercultural gender competence.  A comprehensive research and evaluation program will accompany the interventions to guide design, possible modifications, and to disseminate findings and best practices. The interdisciplinary AWIIN team includes social scientists, faculty, and administrators from science and engineering. All activities are aligned in the current changing environment guided by the new 2007 Academic Plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The two original research projects will provide new insights about the skills of individuals, the tools and organizational practices and policies that allow women and men faculty to succeed in and contribute to an increasing interdisciplinary, global enterprise of science and technology. The project on gender and globalization of the academy will identify gender-specific barriers and strategies to international networks and collaboration. The project on gender and social networks will provide insights into gender differences in the involvement of faculty in professional, interdisciplinary, and international networks. These findings will be of interest to individual faculty, researchers, and institutions that are interested in promoting women scientists and engineers in interdisciplinary and international universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AWINN?s broader impacts include the entire institution as interventions will be rolled out to all colleges in the long-term affecting the climate for all students and faculty at Northeastern University. The Leadership Academy will result in a general improvement of management practices and skills across the institution.  Regional workshops will be held to disseminate best practices into colleges and universities in New England. A national conference on gender and internationalization of science in academia will raise national awareness. In addition, Northeastern University will create a Dual Career Network committee as part of the New England Higher Education Recruitment Consortium (HERC) that facilitates dual career needs in the broader Boston academic community. The AWIIN website will provide guides and tools for individuals and other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Founded in 1898, Northeastern is a global, experiential research university built on a tradition of engagement with the world. The university offers a comprehensive range of undergraduate and graduate programs leading to degrees through the doctorate in nine colleges and schools, and select advanced degrees at graduate campuses in Charlotte, Seattle, Silicon Valley, and Toronto.   Northeastern was awarded a NSF ADVANCE Institutional Transformation grant in 2008 to integrate institutional goals for increasing interdisciplinary and international research. Northeastern ADVANCE goals were to:  1) increase the representation of women in STEM and social science careers, in particular women of color; 2) use mentoring and interdisciplinary and international networks to advance faculty careers; 3) promote best practices for diversity and excellence in faculty development, and 4) identify gender-specific barriers to international collaboration.  During the ADVANCE years, the University undertook an aggressive plan to hire 300 new faculty members (150 new and 150 replacement positions).  In the University as a whole, in 2007-08 there were 621 tenured and tenure-track faculty members with 30% (185) women.  In 2014-15 there were 754 tenured and tenure-track faculty members with 33% (246) women.  In the STEM-SS fields that were the focus of ADVANCE, women faculty showed a greater increase, from 21% in 2007-08 to 26% in 2014-15.     To bring about this positive change, ADVANCE created a STRIDE (Strategies and Tactics for Recruiting to Improve Diversity and Excellence) Committee that worked with faculty serving on search committees to raise their awareness of implicit biases and to share good practices in equitable faculty searches. A total of 384 faculty members participated in STRIDE workshops over the grant years, or 51% of the tenured and tenure-track faculty.  By the third year of STRIDE, STEM-SS deans required faculty serving on search committees to participate.  In year four (2011-12) STRIDE workshops were expanded to all academic disciplines.  To further support faculty recruitment, the Future Faculty Fellowship (FFF) began in 2012-13. Designed to promote excellence and diversity in the pool of future faculty candidates at Northeastern, the FFF introduces postdoctoral researchers who are considering faculty careers to Northeastern?s academic community.  Two female faculty members were hired through this initiative.  It was expanded to all university disciplines at the end of the grant.   ADVANCE experimented with and evaluated several mentoring initiatives, ranging from one-on-one departmental mentors to group mentoring including both internal and external mentors.  These initiatives have raised the visibility and prestige of faculty mentoring and are creating a culture of mentoring.   A highly visible and successful Research Leadership Development Initiative (ReDI) was created to develop a cohort of emerging academic leaders.  A total of 54 mid-career faculty (59% women) have participated with 19 moving into leadership positions and 16 currently participating in the program.  Women in administrative leadership roles increased from 14 in 2007-08 to 21 in 2014-15.  Female academic deans have increased from 1 in 2007-08 to 4 in 2015-16.   A social network analysis concluded that women faculty members have more than doubled their efforts in both writing proposals and receiving research funding between 2007-08 and 2014-15.  Overall grant activity has increased substantially.  For funded grants, the rates of increased participation are:  Individual grants:                     Men up   73%, Women up 152%  Collaborative grants:               Men up 270%, Women up 367%  Collaboration between women and men on grants has increased significantly over the period of the grant, as has interdisciplinary grant activity.  The ADVANCE Office of Faculty Development is sustaining the grant activities and reports to the Provost through the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and a Steering Committee composed of faculty, department chairs and deans. A strong and effective faculty development strategy is part of Northeastern?s institutional mission.  The ADVANCE faculty and staff team worked with numerous institutions as they adopt successful program models meant to enhance the academic careers of faculty members.  They served on advisory boards and traveled to other countries as people focus on changing institutional and organizational climates.
