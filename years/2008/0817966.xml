<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop advanced single molecule spectroscopy methods for quantitative analysis of protein-nucleic acid interactions, as well as in their application to understand the physical mechanisms by which the zinc finger protein Nab2 binds to nucleic acids with sequence specificity and discriminates between single stranded RNA and DNA.   Protein-nucleic acid interactions control all phases of gene expression from maintenance of the genome to RNA expression to translation and protein synthesis.  This project has two broad research aims: advancing fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) methods as quantitative tools to investigate molecular interactions; and applying these methods to investigate the biophysical mechanisms underlying molecular recognition in the interaction of an essential mRNA processing and export protein, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nuclear Abundant Poly(A) Binding Protein (Nab2) with nucleic acids.  The methods developed will be widely useful for molecular interaction studies.  The projects described here are the collaborative effort of the Berland (Physics Department, Emory College) and Corbett (Biochemistry Department, Emory School of Medicine) laboratories.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have a broad impact through teaching and training opportunities that enable undergraduate and graduate students to work at the interface between physics and biochemistry.  Importantly, these studies will set the stage for interdisciplinary learning both in the laboratory and in the classroom.  This work also affords opportunities for interfacing with the community beyond Emory as both PIs laboratories have a history of interactions with high schools in Atlanta through hosting both students and teachers in the lab.</AbstractNarration>
