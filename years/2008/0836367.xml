<AbstractNarration>The focus of the project is to investigate solar cyclic and climatic trends in geocoronal hydrogen using the Wisconsin long-term mid-latitude geocoronal emission record and the NCAR global mean model.  The data have been acquired with two similarly designed ground-based Fabry-Perot Interferometers located in Wisconsin and Arizona.  High signal-to-noise observations over solar cycle 23 have quantified a statistically significant solar cyclic influence on the geocoronal hydrogen column emission intensity.  Observations from three solar minima (1985, 1997, 2006) agree to within 15% over most of the shadow altitude range.  This project will continue the analysis of the Wisconsin northern hemisphere geocoronal data set now spanning three solar cycles to investigate solar cycle influences and to establish additional well-calibrated data sets for long-term comparisons into the future.  The project includes an archival study to extend the Wisconsin data set backwards through reanalysis of observations taken in the 1970-80s using updated analysis techniques and the most recent Galactic background information from the Wisconsin H-alpha Mapper Fabry-Perot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A seminal study by Roble and Dickinson [1989] used the NCAR global mean model of the mesosphere, thermosphere, and ionosphere to study the response of the middle and upper atmosphere to a doubling of carbon dioxide and methane.  The results showed found an increase of 40-50% in upper thermospheric hydrogen in response to a doubling of methane.  Additional studies with global mean model were carried out with historical time-dependent values of CO2 and solar UV fluxes to investigate the thermospheric density response to the solar cycle and to CO2 increases.  This project will extend the model studies by adding historical concentrations of methane to the global mean model to investigate the magnitude of predicted solar cyclic and secular changes in thermospheric hydrogen over the 30-year period of the Wisconsin long-term mid-latitude data set.  In order to facilitate comparison between these model predictions and the Wisconsin observations, output from the global mean model will be used as input to the LYAO_RT global resonance radiative transfer code to extend the hydrogen density profile into the exosphere and to calculate the corresponding hydrogen column emission intensity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project goal is to increase understanding of solar-terrestrial interactions, long-term variations, and lower-upper atmospheric coupling.  The research would also result in the compilation of an observational dataset with high signal-to-noise ratios for past and future data and model comparisons.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scientists are studying the EarthÆs climate system by comparing observations at many locations across the globe and different altitudes to predictions from climate models.  This NSF grant "CEDAR: Solar Cyclic and Climatic Trends in Geocoronal Hydrogen" contributes to the goal of understanding connections between different regions of the atmosphere.     Molecules containing hydrogen play key roles in determining the balance of energy in the EarthÆs atmosphere.  Methane (CH4) is one of the primary greenhouse gases increasing due to human activities.  Water vapor (H2O) is affected indirectly by human activities.  Atomic hydrogen (H) in the top most regions of the EarthÆs atmosphere (thermosphere and exosphere) is produced by chemical and physical processes lower in the atmosphere that involve methane, water vapor, and molecular hydrogen (H2).  At the top of the atmosphere, the atoms are so far apart that they can travel on long trajectories before colliding with another atom.  Thus, this region is relatively more uniformly mixed compared with lower regions of the atmosphere.  A major goal of our research is to use observations and model predictions of the upper atmosphere regions together with those from lower regions to better understand processes affecting the whole atmosphere system.     The focus of our research is to better understand the effects of natural and human factors on hydrogen at the top of the atmosphere using both observations and climate models.  The major natural factor that influences this region is the 11-year solar cycle that mainly affects the higher energy part of the sunÆs light (the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum).  Thus the solar cycle has a large influence on the upper atmosphere, but only a very small influence on the climate of the lower atmosphere as most of the sunÆs higher energy light is absorbed before reaching the surface of the Earth.     The University of Wisconsin group studies atomic hydrogen in the upper atmosphere by using very sensitive optical instruments to observe light that is emitted by the hydrogen atoms in the upper atmosphere.  Ultraviolet light from the sun causes these hydrogen atoms in the atmosphere to give off the light that we observe.  The University of Wisconsin group has acquired a data set of atmospheric hydrogen emissions observations spanning more than twenty years.  These observations were taken from observatories in the Northern mid-latitudes and show variation connected to the SunÆs 11- year cycle.     The University of WisconsinÆs data set of observations from Northern mid-latitudes of upper atmospheric hydrogen emissions spanning two solar cycles also shows an apparent upward trend in brightness.  Funding from this NSF grant enabled us to more accurately study analysis factors that could affect the brightness of the light emitted by the hydrogen atoms.  We studied how the lower atmosphere (troposphere) affects the hydrogen emissions as well as how the characteristics of the SunÆs ultraviolet light affect the details of the structure of the light emitted by the atmospheric hydrogen atoms.  Our results suggest that neither of these factors could account for the apparent upward trend.     This NSF grant also funded our modeling studies to investigate the effects of solar cycle and greenhouse gas increases on atomic hydrogen in the upper atmosphere.  We used a global average version of an upper atmospheric climate model developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model).  Our modeling studies predicted that the natural 11-year solar cycle and increases in greenhouse gases both affect hydrogen at the top of the atmosphere.  These model results of the influence of the solar cycle agree well with observations.  Further, our modeling results predicted that cooling in the upper atmosphere due to increases in carbon dioxide, the major greenhouse gas increasing due to human activitie...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
