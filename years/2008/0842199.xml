<AbstractNarration>This research continues a study of a long-lived seabird that lives in the Gal√°pagos Islands.  After 24 years of marking members of the population, individuals are available from all age classes to test hypotheses regarding the causes and consequences of aging.  Previous work has shown that the reproductive success of members of the population declines after they reach middle age, around 16 years old.  Annual survival declines rapidly in elderly members over 20 years old.  The new research will use several different methods to examine aging processes in this long-lived animal; the approaches include a genomic survey of individuals that die at young versus old ages, and pedigree analysis to estimate the genetic effect on rate of aging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aging and senescent decline have received considerable attention in the biomedical community, including laboratory research on short-lived models like fruit flies, mice, and worms.  Our study gives a rare opportunity to study aging in a long-lived animal much like ourselves in terms of demography, in a pristine, natural environment.  These birds have mechanisms, like a robust immune system, that delay senescent decline in performance.  The research to be conducted will attempt to reveal some of those mechanisms. Results will contribute significantly to conservation of long-lived seabirds; the Ecuadorian government relies on the PI to collect information necessary to influence policy development for seabirds in Ecuador. Latin American and US students will be trained as part of this research, providing both groups with a valuable international experience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our long-term (32 years) research on an oceanic seabird, the Nazca booby in the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands, emphasizes several aspects of evolution and behavior.  It has revealed that these birds show a behavior very similar to child abuse in humans.  We have shown that adult Nazca boobies that are temporarily out of the breeding pool have a strong social attraction to unrelated nestlings.  When these nestlings are left unattended by their parents due to the nestling√Üs increasing food demands, these "unemployed" birds seek out these nestlings and interact with them with a mixture of friendly, aggressive, and sexual behavior.  These early life experiences as a victim of the adults√Ü social attraction are traumatic, both in terms of physical injury and in activation of the physiological stress response (the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis).  All of these characteristics parallel those of human child abuse.  Our most important finding in this area is that the degree of victimization when young is an excellent predictor of the propensity to be a "victimizer" in the future, as an adult.  This predictive ability of victimization and the possible hormonal/stress response mechanism make the Nazca booby system the only naturally-occurring model of the human "cycle of violence", in which traumatic abuse when young predisposes a victim to show the same abusive behavior later in life.  The long-term perspective on histories of individuals fostered by the extended awards of the Long Term Research in Environmental Biology made this research approach possible: it required detailed behavioral work on individual nestling birds, and then a wait of 4-7 years for them to mature and return to the breeding colony as adults, when their adult behavior could be documented.  These results in the area of enduring "organizational effects" of early life trauma on later behavior are an important advance in both behavioral ecology and human biology.   During the term of the recent grant we also made significant progress analyzing the role of personality (a.k.a., behavioral syndromes) in Nazca booby behavioral ecology.  In the largest study of its kind, we demonstrated repeatability (consistency of differences between individuals) over periods up to three years in both personality and the closely related coping (stress response) style.  Demonstrating that individuals differ in consistent ways in these parameters opens the door to the possibility that the evolutionary fitness of individuals varies with personality and coping style, and, indeed, they do.  In a fascinating twist, the two sexes experience opposite selection pressures on these variables: using 21 years of data, we found that highly aggressive and less socially anxious males fledged more chicks in the long term than did less aggressive and more anxious males, while the opposite was true for females.  The amount of the stress hormone corticosterone predicted age at first successful reproduction negatively for females and positively for males. These results support the emerging trend that fitness consequences of personality traits and/or coping styles can be highly sex-specific in wild animals, and suggest that sexually antagonistic selection (opposite trends in selection in the same species) may prevent either sex from reaching an optimal expression of behavior or stress response, maintaining differences in a population even when natural selection favors particular characteristics.  During the five years of this award our group trained two Latin Americans.  David Anchundia, an Ecuadorian, earned his M.S. with his work funded in part by the award, and has returned to Ecuador to work in the conservation sector.  Felipe Estela, a Colombian, is finishing his Ph.D. with the field work supported mostly by the LTREB award, and he has returned to Colombia to teach at the Universidad Javeriana in Cali, Colombia.
