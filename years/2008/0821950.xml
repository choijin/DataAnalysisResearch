<AbstractNarration>Fostering Mathematics Success of English Language Learners (ELLs), a 4-year DR-K12 project, is an efficacy study of the Fostering Geometrical Thinking Toolkit (FGTT) previously developed with NSF support.  FGTT is a 40-hour professional development intervention focusing on properties of geometric figures, geometric transformations, and measurement of length, area, and volume. The study addresses four research questions, three examining participating teachers and one examining the impact of teachers' professional development on ELL students.  It tests the hypothesis that geometric problem solving invites diagramming, drawing, use of colloquial language, and gesturing to complement mathematical communication and affords teachers opportunities to support ELL learning. The research design uses a randomized block design, with 25 pairs of professional development facilitators matched according to their district?s demographic information.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ FMSELL Project Outcomes Report (written for general public)     Fostering Mathematics Success of English Language Learners investigated the impact on teachers and their students of the Fostering Geometric Thinking Toolkit (FGTT) professional development materials, which focus on geometric ways of thinking and teachersÃ† analysis of student work. The project supported professional development providers in facilitating the 40-hour professional development program for middle grades mathematics teachers in schools serving large proportions of English Language Learners. More than 300 teachers and professional development leaders from 34 communities across the United States participated in FGTT professional development in 2009-10 or 2010-11.     Intellectual Merit  The FMSELL study included three research questions focused on the extent to which participation in the professional development program influences teachersÃ† knowledge of geometry, their attention to studentsÃ† geometric thinking, and their use of instructional practices known to benefit English Language Learners. A fourth research question addressed one aspect of how teachersÃ† experience with the professional development impacts students, specifically ELL students.  Participating teachersÃ† knowledge of geometry increased following their participation in the program. Observations of teachersÃ† classroom instruction revealed that teachers who had participated in FGTT, compared to teachers prior to participation, provided instruction offering more evident opportunities for students to engage in geometric thinking, and use of instructional practices known to benefit English Language Learners.      Broader Impacts  Publications and presentations stemming from FMSELLÃ†s research:     document evidence of the FGTT programÃ†s impacts on teachers and teaching,  provide tools for middle grades mathematics teachers to plan and conduct lessons that employ instructional practices that benefit English Language Learners to support opportunities for students to engage in challenging geometric thinking and to develop academic language, describe features of mathematics problems that support geometric thinking, especially for English Language Learners, and illustrate for teachers ways that studentsÃ† geometric thinking and academic language learning can be encouraged and developed through attention to both verbal and non-verbal mathematics communication.      The last bullet is illustrated in the attached photos, drawn from taped interviews of ELL students as they solved two geometric reasoning problems.  The pictures show the power of drawing, gesturing, and using tools to convey mathematical thinking, particularly conjectural thinking.
