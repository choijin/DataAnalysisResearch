    <AbstractNarration>Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for Advanced Radioactive Materials Processing &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0856024 Boise State University; Darryl P. Butt &lt;br/&gt;0856480 Utah State University; Brent Stucker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Advanced Radioactive Materials Processing (CARMaP) will focus on the development of unique fabrication solutions for radioactive elements and their isotopes and for hard-to-process materials in functionally-optimized structures that include ceramics, metals, and their composites. Boise State University (BSU) and Utah State University (USU) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with BSU as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CARMaP research will support commercial-scale material and fabrication advances that promote the expanded use of nuclear technology while reducing risks from nuclear proliferation and long lived nuclear waste. The Center would draw upon the research and fabrication capabilities at both universities, as well as at Idaho National Lab. The research proposed as potential topics will advance the capabilities of industries engaged in all phases of the nuclear fuel cycle, nuclear medicine, and aerospace, as well as renewable energy generation and storage. BSU and USU plan to hold a meeting with prospective industrial partners, and to develop an initial research agenda for CARMaP of sufficient commercial interest that attendees will be willing to invest in and sustain the Center. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes proposed include new classes of validated materials and material joining and fabrication techniques for extreme environments characterized by high temperatures, corrosiveness and radiation. This research will become increasingly more important when the nation begins to shift more of its requirements for more energy from fossil fuel generation to nuclear generation. CARMaP will leverage existing collaborative relationships through the Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES) to engage graduate students in industrial research, to develop innovative curricula, to host industry/university short courses and seminars, to manage intellectual capital and to develop the regional technical workforce through outreach to the under-represented and underemployed. CARMaP research findings will be broadly disseminated through university networks that include the U. S. Department of Energy National University Consortium.</AbstractNarration>
