<AbstractNarration>Twenty four New York State Initially Certified Teachers in science and mathematics teachers are being trained for employment in high needs inner city middle schools (grades 5 - 9).  Two cohorts, each consisting of 12 students, selected from culturally and linguistically diverse undergraduate seniors majoring in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are receiving scholarships. The MASTER Program provides one-year scholarships for full-time undergraduate STEM seniors to complete their Bachelors Degrees and to obtain a Transitional B Certificate as qualification to teach in New York State public schools. For the next two years as in-service teachers, they continue to receive a scholarship enabling them to complete their Master's Degrees in these STEM shortage areas and earn their initial teaching credential for New York State. Each Noyce scholar receives a total of $22,340 of financial support during their three year program of study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During their first year, Noyce scholars join a teacher education program that requires them to complete a degree in an undergraduate STEM discipline, helps them to understand teaching and learning through rigorous and innovative coursework, provides comprehensive pre-service internships in high-need elementary and middle schools, and prepares them to receive a New York State Transitional B Certificate to teach in New York State public schools. As new teachers, the Noyce scholars receive in-depth mentoring during the two years of graduate study. The comprehensive mentoring system consists of several components: (a) continued mentoring and support from college mentors and expert teachers in school, (b) participation in an education seminar, and (c) support from peers.</AbstractNarration>
