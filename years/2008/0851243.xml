<AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the REU site in Physics &amp; Astrophysics at the University of Rochester.   This site supports twelve undergraduate students and two high school teachers each summer for ten weeks per summer in research projects on a variety of topics including astrophysics, particle and nuclear physics, quantum optics, condensed matter, biological, plasma, geo- and environmental physics, and physics education.   Each student works with a faculty adviser on a specific project within the context of the overall research focus of the group. The program may include mini-courses in machining and electronics and a GRE preparation course offered in conjunction with other summer undergraduate programs. REU students attend weekly presentations by University faculty, tours of University research facilities, social outings and may also take part in the department?s summer outreach activities. The program concludes with a student symposium, at which each student speaks on his/her research project; students submit written abstracts and reports of their research experiences.   The RET program sponsors teachers selected from area high schools. RET activities engage teachers in projects such as physical chemistry, cosmic ray and high energy particle detection, and geo- and astrophysics data analysis using web-based databases.   This award is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the Physics and Astronomical Sciences Divisions in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of the REU Site in Physics and Astrophysics at the University of Rochester is to offer undergraduate students nationwide the opportunity to take part in forefront physics research in eight subfields: particle and nuclear physics, quantum optics, condensed matter, biological, plasma, astrophysics, geo- and environmental physics, and physics education. The REU program has shown success in the participation of women, a highly underrepresented group in physics, and serves a significant number of students from non-research institutions each year.  A range of recruitment strategies for minority students is in place both at the department and at the institutional level.  Stipend support and on-site housing are available for all participants.  Each student works with a faculty adviser on a specific project within the context of the overall research focus of the group. The program may include mini-courses in machining, Linux/Unix, and MATLAB course.  REU students attend weekly presentations by University faculty, tours of University research facilities, social outings, and may also take part in the departmentÆs summer outreach activities.  The program concludes with a student symposium, at which each student speaks on his/her research project; students submit written abstracts and reports of their research experiences. Students are strongly encouraged to continue their projects toward publication and are eligible for additional support to present their results at national student and professional conferences. REU activities engage undergraduates in projects such as physical chemistry, cosmic ray and high-energy particle detection, and geo- and astrophysics data analysis using web-based databases.  Intellectual merit: The intellectual merit of the program is demonstrated by the strong record of publications, conference presentations, and awards among REU participants.  Many of the research projects in which students have participated are attracting growing interest from the scientific community.  The facultyÆs research groupÆs combination of enthusiasm and discipline motivates students and contributes to the quality of their research.  Individual guidance and mentoring fosters each studentÆs skill at navigating the world of science - giving talks, writing articles - and as well as his or her intellectual development as an independent researcher.   Broader impacts:  The further benefit of the REU programÆs "culture of mentoring" comes in retaining undergraduates in physical sciences and instilling in them the desire and skill to mentor others.  The program clearly contributes to the goal of building the nationÆs scientific workforce and leadership. Many of the REU participants cite the program as pivotal in their decision to follow a research career.  Others, through contact with high school teachers who are working on a neutrino project during the summer, are drawn to teaching, yet another means of building the future scientific workforce and improving scientific literacy in the U.S. population generally. The REU program demonstrates the possibility and potential of responding to societal concerns and at the same time producing excellent science.
