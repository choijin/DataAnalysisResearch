<AbstractNarration>This work will examine relationships between wetland plant species, soil chemical reactions, and greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide are trapping increasing levels of radiation within the atmosphere, warming the globe. Wetlands are large sources of both methane and nitrous oxide, which are produced by chemical reactions in wet soil. Such processes are altered by the physical presence and chemical signatures of plants. Plant species possess different suites of traits that influence the environment plants inhabit, leading to possible species-specific effects on greenhouse gas emissions. The traits most likely to affect greenhouse gas emissions are those traits that shape chemical transformations of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen in wetland soils. This work will compare methane and nitrous oxide emissions with soil conditions and plant traits in single-species plots of 10 herbaceous plant species at a wetland restoration site in Durham, NC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wetland restoration projects are typically conducted to improve hydrology and water quality, yet they can also increase greenhouse gas production. This research will identify plant species and plant traits that help achieve restoration goals while minimizing emissions of greenhouse gases. As the climate and rates of wetland destruction and restoration change, understanding the roles of different plant species in wetland greenhouse gas dynamics will help to predict greenhouse gas fluxes and manage wetland ecosystem functions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
