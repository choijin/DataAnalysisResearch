<AbstractNarration>This STTR Phase II project will develop commercially viable atomic force microscope (AFM) probes fabricated from ultrananocrystalline diamond.  The project will refine the processes developed in Phase I and bring contact and non-contact all-diamond probes to market. Probes using conducting diamond that are chemically and electronically tunable and have superb tribological properties will also be developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will facilitate new industrial applications for AFM, including high-throughput imaging, metrology, and characterization of large quantities of materials, local electrical characterization for process control in micro/nanoelectronics, nanomechanical characterization of MEMS/NEMS devices, and ultraprecise hard mask correction for the micro/nanolithography industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Diamond Nanoprobes for Atomic Force Microscopy - Imaging, Metrology, Material Property Measurement, Process Control, and Manipulation with Ultrahigh Performance    Project Outcomes Report   Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a leading technique to visualize and investigate non-destructively various properties of nano-scale objects, such as nanoelectronic circuits and biological molecules, and is an important tool in the materials science. AFM uses ultra-sharp tips to tap or swipe along the samples, while reconstructing the image electronically from the fine displacement of the tips. In this process, tips made of usual materials (silicon, silicon nitride, metals) wear off fast, degrading the image quality. This Small Business Technology Transfer project, a collaboration of a small business company &ndash; Advanced Diamond Technologies &ndash; with two universities (University of Wisconsin, Madison and University of Pennsylvania) investigated the feasibility of fabricating atomic force microscopy probes made of a new species of diamond, ultra-nanocrystalline diamond (UNCD&reg;), known for its exquisite hardness, low friction, and low wear properties. A total of 26 different probes designs, including for contact, dynamic, immersion, conductive, and scanning spreading resistance (SSRM) modes, were investigated and underwent several stages of improvement (Fig. 1).  Most of the developed probes are now commercialized by Advanced Diamond Technologies under the family name of "NaDiaProbes", and the STTR team won an R&amp;D 100 award in 2009 for the initial commercialization of NaDiaProbes. Two more types are under development, and a virtual doubling of the number of probe options is possible by sharpening the probe tips into extremely sharp "spike" probes, by using a recently-developed post-processing method. Thus, the developed product line covers most of the application fields for AFM. Distribution chains and strategic partnerships for developing new, customized diamond probes were established. Furthermore, these probes far surpass other commercial probes in terms of having highly wear resistant, hard, sharp, and conductive tips, as proven both by in-house tests and by beta-tests and feedback from customers. The demand for ultrahard, high-performance probes is further increasing due to the development of fast-scanning AFM metrology in semiconductor foundries, and also for enabling new applications such as mask repair, piezo-force spectrometry, sub-surface acoustic imaging, and tip-based nanomanufacturing.    The main distinguishing features of these UNCD-based probes are their superior tip sharpness (compared to the nearest commercial competitor, diamond-coated silicon probes), hardness, and their outstanding resistance to wear, which makes them attractive for applications where measuring the dimensions of small objects is crucial. The sharpness and hardness of diamond tips make the size of contact between the tip and the sample it is probing even smaller, which therefore increases the resolution of imaging. Furthermore, the low wear property of UNCD assures long-lasting tip shape stability during large amounts of heavy use. The probe performance was thoroughly investigated, both by marathon scan sequences (Small, No. 6, 10, 2010, pp. 1140), and by wear tests conducted inside of a transmission electron microscope where we could directly observe the contact. This established that the small wear that occurred was a result of individual atoms being removed from the tip only at very occasional intervals. The rate of wear was very low due to the strong covalent bonds holding the carbon atoms together inside the UNCD.    See Figures 1 and 2.
