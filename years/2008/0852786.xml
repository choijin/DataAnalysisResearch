<AbstractNarration>This project will aid the theoretical program on the interaction of radiation with free and confined atoms and ions at Georgia State University. The PI will continue to develop theoretical methodologies and perform a series of calculations that explore ionizing collisions of electromagnetic radiation and charged particles with matter and investigate the details of their deposition of energy. The PI will develop/enhance theoretical methodologies and apply them to investigations of electromagnetic radiation impinging on free atoms and ions, with emphasis on breakdowns in fundamental approximations and processes for which many-body interactions dominate, e.g., negative ion photodetachment. In addition, the PI will study the collisions of atoms and ions with atoms with particular emphases on the role of projectile electrons and higher order contributions. All of these investigations shall be carried out in close collaboration with experimental groups in an effort to insure the quantitative accuracy of the theoretical methodologies developed. In addition, the PI will continue to study the interaction of radiation with confined atoms and ions, e.g., confined in fullerenes. Of great importance will be the realistic handling of the confining potential, e.g., treating all 60 carbon atoms of C60. The results will provide further insight into the nature of these fundamental atomic processes that are of importance in plasma physics and controlled thermonuclear research, atmospheric, solar, and astrophysics, radiation and radiological physics and therapy, and for studies of x-ray laser mechanics. In addition, understanding the properties of confined atoms will lead to insight into the qualitatively new physics of a largely unexplored area. The project will bring more minorities in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research program aimed at understanding the dynamics of atoms and molecules as revealed through their interaction with ionizing electromagnetic and charged particle radiation.  We have developped/enhanced theoretical methodologies, along with using other state-of-the-art methods, and applied them to investigations of ionizing radiation impinging on free atoms and ions, with emphasis on breakdowns in fundamental approximations, processes for which many-body interactions dominate, e.g., simultaneous ionization-plus-excitation and negative ion photodetachment, the influence of relativistic interactions, confined open-shell atoms, and processes that can be studied at the new free-electron lasers, e.g., attosecond  time delay in photoionization.  In addition considered charged-particle impact ionization of confined atoms. Many of these investigations were carried out in collaboration with experimental groups in an effort to insure the quantitative accuracy of the theoretical results, as well as to guide the experimental effort.  In addition, we continued our studies aimed at understanding how the confinement of an atomic system influences its properties.  Specifically we explored the interaction of radiation with confined atoms and ions, e.g., confined in fullerenes. We particularly concentrated upon charged-particle impact ionization of confined atoms which had not yet been studied extensively.  Using the methods developed and tested in the realm of free atoms and ions, we further developped our program of research into the structural and spectral properties of confined atoms and ions, adapting the methods to confined species, as well as new methodologies aimed specifically at confined species.  Particular emphasis was placed upon the how the details of the confinement alter the properties of free atoms and ions, as well as the juxtaposition of confinement with correlation and relativistic effects.  The results provided further insight into the nature of these fundamental atomic processes that are of importance in plasma physics and controlled thermonuclear research, atmospheric, solar, and astrophysics, radiation and radiological physics and therapy, and for studies of x-ray laser mechanisms.  In addition, understanding the properties of confined atoms will give us insight into the qualitatively new physics of a largely unexplored area.  Furthermore, this understanding could lead to whole new classes of materials and devices for use in various applications, e.g., quantum computing, quantum control, and ultrafast switching.  Furthermore, atoms are the elementary particles of the macroscopic world--molecules and condensed matter.  The properties of these complex systems often reflect atomic phenomena.  This gives further importance to the results of our studies of the properties of free and confined atoms.          Last Modified: 10/05/2017       Submitted by: Steven T Manson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
