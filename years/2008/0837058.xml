<AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many universities, experiences in designing and conducting research that address scientific questions are limited to graduate students or upper-division undergraduates.  This leaves many students unfamiliar with methods of experimental design and the role of argumentation in science, and presents a view of science that is inconsistent with practice.  These concerns are particularly troubling to future teachers.  The project develops a course for pre-service teachers using open-inquiry in science that engages students in crafting and investigating their own scientific questions in topics that span several disciplines.  The coursework scaffolds students' inquiry activities, requiring them to move beyond simple experiments and seek to find correlations.  The inquiry activities move students toward a deeper understanding of investigation and experimentation as methodologies for evaluating scientific arguments.  Evaluations of the course assess the degree to which the course supports students in developing a more sophisticated understanding of the nature of science and improves their confidence in teaching scientific ideas and inquiry.  The project develops an instructor's guide to aid in the implementation of open-inquiry courses at other institutions.  The guide is patterned after facilitation guides as described in social work literature, with careful attention to fostering dialog and building community.  The guide will aid faculty in undergraduate sciences in promoting discussion and inquiry.</AbstractNarration>
