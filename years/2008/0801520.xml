<AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 0801520        PI: Jia, Xinqiao      ORG: University of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Travel Support for Students, Post-Docs, and Young Faculty to Attend the Symposium on "Controlling Cellular Behavior with Polymer Synthesis and Engineering" at the 235th ACS Meeting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  This American Chemical Society (ACS) symposium will cover recent advances in the design, synthesis, and engineering of polymeric biomaterials that are capable of eliciting desired cellular responses and fostering functional tissue regeneration.  The objectives of the symposium are: (1) to highlight recent advances in the design, synthesis, and application of tailored polymeric materials for fundamental understanding of cell biology and practical application to tissue engineering, (2) to provide a platform for polymer scientists, bioengineers, and biologists to establish connections and exchange ideas, and (3) to facilitate opportunities for minority and junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students to present their most recent research results.  Over recent years there have been many biomaterials-related symposia at the ACS, Materials Research Society, and Society for Biomaterials meetings and at Gordon Conferences.  None, however, has systematically explored the cell-guiding capability of polymeric materials.  This symposium, summarizing the polymer synthesis and engineering methodologies that have been utilized to induce cellular behavior and tissue function, will be of interest to a broad spectrum of scientists and engineers.  A total of 16 internationally respected speakers have been invited and have confirmed their intention to participate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  The organizers have made significant efforts to enhance the involvement of women, minorities, and disabled persons in this symposium.  Approximately 25% of the invited speakers are women as is one of the organizers.  The organizers have presented a strategy for identifying laboratories with significant minority representation, and these laboratories will be solicited to attend and to make contributed talks.  The funds requested from NSF will be used to provide approximately 10 travel awards to support the attendance of graduate students, post-docs, and young faculty at the symposium.  Priority will be given to graduate students who would be attending their first national meeting, to young faculty who will be making oral presentations, and to underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
