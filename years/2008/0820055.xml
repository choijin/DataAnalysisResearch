<AbstractNarration>Hormones integrate behavior and physiology by responding to environmental signals and altering gene expression in target tissues in the brain and the body.  However, when the environment of a species changes, the most adaptive response might be to lose hormone sensitivity at some of the target tissues.  An open question is whether hormone-mediated traits can be decoupled in such a way.  This research will focus on the steroid hormone testosterone and its integrating effect on the behavior and physiology of males and females of a songbird species, the dark-eyed junco.  The relative importance of phenotypic integration or independence of hormonally mediated traits has significant implications for the evolution of life histories, sex differences, and the formation of new species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will help to train future scientists of diverse backgrounds in the conduct of laboratory and field research that combines techniques and perspectives from multiple disciplines.  Potential societal implications of the research include greater knowledge of the impact of hormonally active agents in the environment, and the ability of natural populations to respond effectively to environments altered by climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ellen D. Ketterson, Proposal # 0820055, Hormones and phenotypic integration: comparing sexes, individuals and populations     Animals vary greatly in their behavior, physiology and appearance.  Collectively these traits constitute the animalÆs phenotype, and individuals whose phenotypes are well matched to the environment are more likely to survive and reproduce.      Hormones circulate through the animalÆs body and serve to integrate behavior and physiology by responding to environmental signals and altering gene expression in target tissues in the brain and the periphery that are sensitive to the hormone. The resulting co-expression of behavior and physiology is referred to as phenotypic integration.     While it is clear that hormones give rise to integrated phenotypes, contention surrounds the relative ease with which hormone-mediated traits can be expressed independently in response to changes in the environment. The relative importance of phenotypic integration and independence of hormonally mediated traits has significant implications for the evolution of life histories, sex differences, the formation of new species, and response to environmental change.     The research just completed focused on the steroid hormone testosterone and its integrating effect on the phenotype of males and females of a songbird species, the dark-eyed junco.  Studies were conducted in California, Virginia, and South Dakota with a special emphasis on stress and reproduction.  Populations differed in the wild in the timing of reproduction and in aggressive behavior and ability to cope with novelty.   Some of those differences appear to be genetic and thus potentially slow to respond to changing environments.  Others however were highly plastic, that is they were different in the wild but not when animals lived together.  Results indicate a surprising capacity for organisms to adjust their behavior to a variable environment.     Broader Impacts:     The research supported by this award helped to train future scientists of diverse backgrounds in the conduct of laboratory and field research that combined techniques and perspectives from multiple disciplines.     The research supported by this award was disseminated to a wide variety of audiences through the following outlets 1) a research-based web site, http://www.indiana.edu/~kettlab/index.html, a web site that presents a documentary science film for high school and adult audiences, http://juncoproject.org, talks presented at museums and other public gatherings, and posters and presentations by students in training to professional and public audiences.     Potential societal implications of the research include greater knowledge of how hormonally active agents in the environment may influence behavior and physiology and how effectively natural populations are likely to respond to environments altered by climate change.
