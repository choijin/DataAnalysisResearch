<AbstractNarration>Scientific Research&lt;br/&gt;This project uses a combination of genetics, cell biology, and molecular biology to determine the structure and function of the mouse gene Cyclin B1 interacting protein 1 (Ccnb1IP1) during male and female meiosis. This research has three components: (1) to determine the complete gene and messenger RNA transcript structure for Ccnb1IP1, (2) to determine specific protein-protein interactions involving CCNB1IP1 during meiosis in mice, and (3) to identify the extent and cause of chromosomal defects in female meiosis. This research will advance knowledge across the field of meiotic biology by providing a new mouse resource for study, by elucidating the protein networks necessary for progression through meiosis, and by determining the key constituents of female meiosis. This work represents an important contribution to the research community because it increases the understanding of meiosis, a process of central importance for the generation of life's diversity through sexual reproduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project describes a program to conduct state-of-the-art molecular biological research and to integrate that research into the curricula of local public schools. An outreach program will be developed and staffed by Middlebury College undergraduate students, using a mobile DNA lab called the Gene Wagon, as an integral part of the undergraduate research program.  Students will travel to local schools and, in collaboration with local teachers, will design and implement genetics-based educational laboratories.  Additionally, this project will engage public school teachers through direct participation in primary research each summer.  This project will improve interest and learning in biology in a school district with high rates of students below the poverty level. The benefits to society of this project are that basic research in meiosis will provide fundamental information regarding how organisms reproduce, generate genetic diversity, and as a result how they evolve. Further the principal investigator will be preparing teachers and students to succeed as scientists.  The community outreach program will directly affect all local students but will be particularly beneficial to the rural poor.  As a model, this program will also serve to stimulate the implementation of other such outreach programs in the area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ At the outset, our goals were to perform high-level reproductive biology research while simultaneously contributing significantly to elementary education in a rural school district. We have done both and met both the intellectual merit and broader impacts as defined by the NSF.  Toward the first goal, we have identified and characterized two genes, Hei10 and Akap9, which are essential for reproduction in mammals.  To address the intellectual merit criteria, we determined the expression pattern of the RNA and proteins encoded by the genes during mouse development, identified other proteins that interact with these genes, and determined the role they play in reproduction. We have also begun using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) to identify how changes in genes essential for reproduction will affect regions of the brain.  The work completed has been published in broadly read and high impact journals such as Genetics and Nature Genetics.      This work also had strong broader impact in that it was all carried out by undergraduate researchers ages 18-22.  These individuals learned important transferable skills such as teamwork, project planning, and interpretation of complex outcomes in addition to the specific molecular genetic skills learned.  They have since gone on to pursue careers in healthcare (as nurses and doctors) and as scientists, educators, and entrepreneurs in genetics. The group of students impacted by this work attended Yale, Cambridge, University of California at Berkeley, University of California at San Francisco, and Johns Hopkins for graduate school.     The combination of the genetic and protein biology we have demonstrated and the impact on young scientists who carried out the work yields both strong intellectual merit and significant broader impacts on society.     Towards the second goal, we spent five years working with area elementary schools collaborating with them on developing science curricula and infrastructure. As a rural state, Vermont has a high number of children who live at or below poverty level.  Science education outreach via our NSF work reached five area elementary schools and hundreds of young students who would never have been able to do the hands on science they did without our program.  We were able to work with elementary instructors to develop curricula and utilize equipment and infrastructure to broaden the experience of these children considerably.  To accomplish this goal, college students collaborated with educators and students along with our outreach coordinator to visit and work with all elementary grade levels through out the school year.  In a typical year we made over 30 visits to three different schools.  The curricula we developed included mounting and viewing onion cells under a microscope, isolation of DNA from fruit, and a 4-5 week plant growth unit to study nutrition. Overall, our outreach program, called The Gene Wagon, has had significant impact on our community and has exposed a large number of elementary students and educators to molecular science. This work thus has had strong broader impact on society.     Collectively, this program has trained a group of young molecular scientists and mentors and significantly influenced a six-year cohort of elementary students in a rural state with few resources for science education.  Through the work of Middlebury undergraduates via this award the field of reproductive molecular genetics and elementary science pedagogy have been significantly and positively impacted.
