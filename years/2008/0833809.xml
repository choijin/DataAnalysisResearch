<AbstractNarration>NSF is providing partial financial support for a Student Research Workshop &lt;br/&gt;at the AMTA-2008 conference in Waikiki, Hawaii.  The Association for Machine&lt;br/&gt;Translation in the Americas (AMTA) is a non-profit professional organization&lt;br/&gt;in the area of Machine Translation (MT) in the US and the American continent.&lt;br/&gt;The main mission of AMTA is to facilitate and promote the exchange of&lt;br/&gt;knowledge and information between the communities of researchers, developers&lt;br/&gt;and users of Machine Translation and related translation technologies.  In its&lt;br/&gt;effort to foster the professional growth of the next generation of MT&lt;br/&gt;researchers, AMTA-2008 is featuring a new Student Research Workshop, embedded&lt;br/&gt;as an integral part of the research program at the conference.  Students at&lt;br/&gt;all levels of study (undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate) are invited to&lt;br/&gt;submit papers describing their research work.  NSF is providing funding to&lt;br/&gt;subsidize travel, conference and accommodation expenses for up to 10 students&lt;br/&gt;that have been selected to present their research work at the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AMTA-2008 Student Research Workshop will greatly facilitate professional&lt;br/&gt;growth for the brightest young researchers in the field of MT, in the early&lt;br/&gt;stages of their professional career.  The workshop will contribute to the&lt;br/&gt;professional development of a skilled and diverse workforce in the area of&lt;br/&gt;Machine Translation and computational processing of natural language.  MT and&lt;br/&gt;other language processing applications are becoming vital technologies in the&lt;br/&gt;global information age.  Strength in these areas is crucial to American&lt;br/&gt;competitiveness in the global economy of the 21st century.</AbstractNarration>
