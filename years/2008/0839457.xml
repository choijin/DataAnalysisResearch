    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on the&lt;br/&gt;evaluation and optimization of a promising sorbent, Silica-Titania Composites&lt;br/&gt;(STC), for mercury removal from coal-fired power plant scrubber water to&lt;br/&gt;below 10 ppt. Coal-fired power plants are a predominant mercury emitter in&lt;br/&gt;gases and liquids. There are no commercial technologies for mercury removal&lt;br/&gt;from scrubber water to levels anticipated under future regulations (i.e., 1 to&lt;br/&gt;10 ppt). Sol-gel Solutions, LLC (Sol-gel) has obtained mercury concentrations&lt;br/&gt;below 1.3 ppt when evaluating the STC for mercury removal from a mixed&lt;br/&gt;wastewater from a coal-fired power plant. These levels would comply with the&lt;br/&gt;Great Lakes Initiative, a strict criterion that will be enforced in parts of&lt;br/&gt;the U.S. in 2010. The objective for the proposed project is to optimize the&lt;br/&gt;technology for mercury removal from scrubber water from several coal-fired&lt;br/&gt;power plants, with the ultimate goal of designing a commercial system. It is&lt;br/&gt;expected that the STC will effectively remove mercury to below 10 ppt, with&lt;br/&gt;the potential of being recovered and reused.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are the protection of humans and&lt;br/&gt;wildlife from exposure to mercury. In humans, this exposure may impair&lt;br/&gt;neurological development, particularly in fetuses and during early childhood.&lt;br/&gt;A key element of the proposed work will be the promotion of interest in&lt;br/&gt;science and engineering via dissemination of the learnings from the proposed&lt;br/&gt;work and related fundamental science to high school and community college&lt;br/&gt;students, among others, via a targeted "webinar" and newsletter.</AbstractNarration>
