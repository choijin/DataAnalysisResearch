<AbstractNarration>COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: HOW DID THE GRASSLAND BIOME EVOLVE IN SOUTH AMERICA?: INTEGRATING CENOZOIC CLIMATE, FLORAL AND FAUNAL RECORDS FROM PATAGONIA, ARGENTINA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STROMBERG, KOHN AND MADDEN PIS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grasslands, which today form ~1/4 of Earth?s vegetative cover, are thought to have developed earlier in South America than on other continents, based on floral, faunal, and sedimentological evidence at Gran Barranca, Argentina, and nearby.  However, the timing and rate of change remain unclear, as well as causal mechanisms. We will determine the timing and nature of climatic, vegetational, and faunal events related to the evolution of Earth?s earliest grassland ecosystems in southern Argentina by integrating floral, stable isotopic, and faunal data through the long, well-dated, and nearly continuous sedimentological record at Gran Barranca (~42.0 to ~18.5 Ma). We will focus on evaluating whether: (1) The rise to dominance of open-habitat grasses in South America occurred in parallel with their appearance, (2) An increase in openness of habitats occurred in parallel with the rise to ecological dominance of open-habitat grasses, (3) Changes in vegetation were correlated with climate change, and (4) Hypsodonty in South American mammalian herbivores responded rapidly to the spread of open, grass-dominated habitats. Fossil phytoliths (plant silica) will be analyzed to provide detailed, continuous floral records of grasses as well as other climate- or ecology-sensitive plant groups (e.g., palms, sedges). Fossil teeth will be analyzed for stable isotope compositions, focusing on bulk d13C values and isotopic zoning of d13C and 18O values. Together with phytolith assemblage data and sedimentology, this isotopic information will be used to infer changes in habitat openness, aridity, and seasonality in terms of temperature and precipitation. Comparison with records of faunal community composition and functional morphology will elucidate the patterns of grassland expansion and faunal responses. Our data will additionally help answer the following two questions: (1) How does the timing and rate of climate change in Argentina compare with the marine record? (2) How do patterns of fauna-flora-climate evolution in South America compare with putatively similar changes that occurred later, e.g., in central North America? The proposed project incorporates several avenues for disseminating the research to the public through the Burke Museum, including an in-museum exhibit, materials for traveling study kits on the evolution of grasslands, and development of a phytolith database with images accessible on-line through the Museum?s website.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our research examined conventional thinking in paleontology that the distinctive high-crowned teeth of herbivores are best suited to the ingestion of grass with characteristically high concentrations of little silica crystal abrasives.  The little silica crystals (sometimes called "plant stones" or phytoliths) occur in the leaf epidermis of many different kinds of plants, but are most highly concentrated in the leaves of grasses.  Grass phytoliths have distinctive shapes that reflect how the cells of the leaf epidermis are organized between multiple parallel veins that extend the length of leaves.      Prior to our work, it was generally understood that high-crowned teeth evolved in response to the establishment and spread of the earth?s oldest grasslands in Patagonia.  There, this evolution occurred simultaneously in many diverse kinds of mammalian plant-eaters, both large and small.  We were able to date the oldest occurrence of this kind of tooth, and we dated the long, gradually increasing prevalence of herbivore species with high-crowned teeth.     With NSF support, we travelled to Patagonia and collected samples of fossil-bearing sediment containing these microscopic silica phytoliths.  We looked for little silica crystals in the sediments that buried the herbivores and preserved their teeth.  We took these samples back to the lab, and there carefully separated, counted and described the phytoliths.  We found they were not the sort of crystals that are typical of grasses.  Instead, they were the less abundant but distinctive kinds of trees, shrubs, and palms.  That is, instead of grasslands, high-crowned teeth evolved in animals living in woody shrub or forest.      How then, did such teeth evolve?  Instead of evolving in grass-eating mammals, we found that the distinctive teeth evolved in response to something unanticipated.     Indeed, the animals lived in open vegetation, but without grasses.  They lived where volcanic ash was generated and when the environment was windy and dusty.  Apparently, teeth become high-crowned in response to environmental abrasives, not plant abrasives, at times when these are actively eroded, transported and redeposited as accumulations of ash.     To help us imagine how this could have happened, we undertook to re-examine everything we thought we knew about tooth wear and the evolution of high-crowned teeth.  We examined the evolutionary pattern in detail, documenting how many times independently and at what rate this evolution occurred.  We compared the chronology of this record against the chronology of every environmental variable possible, including atmospheric temperature and rainfall, wind intensity, volcanic eruption frequency, sea-level and land surface area, diverse evidence of charred vegetation and wildfire, downwind productivity of the ocean surface, sediment accumulation rates, and change in the dominant mechanism of sedimentation (wind vs water).     Importantly, we developed a new way of reconstructing the density of vegetation.  Knowing that leaf cell size and shape varies whether leaves unfold in the spring under direct sunlight or in shade, we measured the proportion of large to small phytoliths and quantified the degree to which their cell walls were smooth or undulated.  One participant travelled to Costa Rica and collected samples of soil under different kinds of vegetation, from dense tropical forest to open tropical grassland.  While there, she measured the amount of leaf cover to land surface area using a hemispherical "fish-eye" lens on a camera pointed directly upward.  By comparing modern phytolith (cell) size and shape in soil under different kinds of vegetation, she developed a rule by which ancient vegetation density (or Leaf Area Index) could be reconstructed.     At the same time, we examined all available evidence for soil ingestion in mammals, especially in domestic sheep where it has been most intensively studied in New Zealand.  There, rates of tooth wear vary with the intensity of soil erosion, and storm-induced erosion triggers the onset of rapid tooth wear because volcanic-ash soil contaminates the plants and the sheep eat more soil grit.  We examined the distribution of high-crowned teeth in mammals around South America and the world and found an association between prevalence of high-crowned teeth with dust-storm frequency.  We noted that large teeth (lots of enamel volume) in modern humans occur in areas where volcanic ash and dust-storms are frequent.  Additionally, feral goat tooth wear is highest on islands where active volcanism or thick accumulations of volcanic ash occur at the surface, not where soils are organic and soil minerals are not exposed at the surface.      Finally, when we examined rates of evolution of high-crowned or large teeth in the fossil record of diverse mammals that inhabited the volcanic Ethiopian rift system, and found that the highest rates of change were coincident with the highest rates of windblown sediment (and ash) accumulation downwind on the floor of the north Indian Ocean (see NSF Award 0819842).     All these discoveries have led us to propose a unique and novel explanation for the evolution of high-crowned teeth and the history of South American grasslands.
