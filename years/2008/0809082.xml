<AbstractNarration>This study will investigate sediment transport and channel evolution in gravel-bed rivers&lt;br/&gt;in response to sediment pulses, taking advantage of the field-scale experiment that will be&lt;br/&gt;created by the removal of Milltown Dam on the Clark Fork of the Columbia River, MT. Through&lt;br/&gt;data collection on pre- and post-dam removal channel conditions and on bedload and suspended&lt;br/&gt;load transport out of Milltown reservoir during high flow periods, this research will address&lt;br/&gt;fundamental questions about fluvial processes, sediment transport and deposition, and dam&lt;br/&gt;removal. Several hypotheses will be investigated about how pulses of fine sediment infiltrate&lt;br/&gt;into and affect the mobility of armored river beds, about spatial and temporal patterns of&lt;br/&gt;sediment transport and deposition, and about effective discharges for transporting sediment&lt;br/&gt;pulses. This research will provide an excellent opportunity to evaluate how previous flume&lt;br/&gt;research or field studies of small channels, upon which much of what is known about sediment&lt;br/&gt;transport and related aspects of fluvial processes is based, scale up to larger rivers. The&lt;br/&gt;data collected here will also be evaluated in the context of the implications of geomorphic&lt;br/&gt;responses and sediment geochemistry for habitat and biological processes.&lt;br/&gt;Removal of Milltown Dam, which will begin in spring 2008 and continue the following winter,&lt;br/&gt;is especially notable because (1) it is the largest dam removal to date in the United States&lt;br/&gt;in terms of the volume of reservoir sediment potentially available for downstream transport&lt;br/&gt;(approximately 3 million m3; another 2 million m3 are being mechanically removed); (2) the&lt;br/&gt;dam is the downstream end of the largest Superfund site in the United States, the Clark Fork&lt;br/&gt;Complex, and reservoir sediments are composed largely of contaminated mine tailings; (3) it&lt;br/&gt;is occurring on a regionally important river that includes designated Critical Habitat for&lt;br/&gt;bull trout, a federally threatened species. Systematic study of this dam removal will therefore&lt;br/&gt;have broader impacts on multiple levels, including for understanding the sediment and metals&lt;br/&gt;transport associated with a significant dam removal, for the insights it lends to upcoming&lt;br/&gt;planned removals of large dams, and for its broader contribution to understanding how gravel-bed&lt;br/&gt;rivers respond to increased sediment fluxes. Broader impacts will also derive from the project?s&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary nature, whereby analyses of geomorphic processes, geochemistry, hydrology,&lt;br/&gt;and fish response will be combined to understand downstream effects of dam removal.&lt;br/&gt;This project will help a new faculty member build a research program in fluvial geomorphic&lt;br/&gt;processes and will directly support one graduate and one undergraduate student. The project&lt;br/&gt;will also foster ongoing collaboration efforts between University of Montana and Salish-Kootenai&lt;br/&gt;College, a tribal college in Pablo, MT, whose students will assist field data collection and&lt;br/&gt;analysis under the guidance of the PI. Further, data collection and analysis related to Milltown&lt;br/&gt;Dam removal will be incorporated into graduate and undergraduate geomorphology and geochemistry&lt;br/&gt;courses, an integration of teaching and research that will be facilitated by the project?s&lt;br/&gt;close proximity to the University of Montana.</AbstractNarration>
