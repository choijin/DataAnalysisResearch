<AbstractNarration>Individuals who have an interdisciplinary outlook and a strong quantitative background will be in high demand to meet the future scientific and technological workforce needs. The purpose of this project is to increase the number of successful graduates in the sciences and mathematics and to enhance their level of quantitative skills through a program called Q-STEP. A fundamental activity of the Q-STEP program is the creation of a community of scholars in the quantitative sciences. This community of scholars provides a supportive social network, increased chances for group study and problem-solving, peer tutoring, and opportunities for early and consistent involvement in undergraduate research. As part o this project, faculty are redesigning the undergraduate mathematics and science courses so that they incorporate best practices for effective instruction including experiential learning, group exercises, and a consistent clear demonstration of the relevance of the various disciplines to each other and to the real world. The impact of the project is being rigorously assessed for student learning, motivation, and retention. Project dissemination is occurring widely through the web and through various national and regional venues.</AbstractNarration>

The more recent experiential component of Q-STEP has been an emphasis on student tutoring in STEM-related courses in K12 schools in the impoverished local school district. This activity is supported by Project Ignite of the Chancellor&rsquo;s office of RUC and continues in the institutionalized QSTEP program.</p> <p>The Q-STEP community provides a supportive social network, increased chances for group study and problem-solving, and peer mentoring in a dedicated Q-STEP space.&nbsp; Two distinct groups of students are targeted.

Q-STEP Scholars are mentored and tutored by more advanced Q-STEP Mentors.&nbsp; In most current cases, the Q-STEP Mentors have previously been Q-STEP Scholars. Q-STEP Scholars are required to attend a Mentoring session for an hour weekly. The Q-STEP facility is an approximately 600 square-foot room with lockers for the students, special tables including built-in computers for group work, and white boards to facilitate discussions and presentations.&nbsp; Weekly mandatory meetings of Q-STEP members offer opportunities for group problem-solving, seminars on the research activities of the faculty and graduate students and presentations on the variety of STEM-related careers.</p> <p>Up until now, the program has had seven cohorts with over 125 students. Over time, Q-STEP has progressively retained students who regularly attend the program and now has 81 members.&nbsp; The evaluation of the program was based on quantitative data collected from each student via a mandatory online survey at entry into the program and a voluntary on-line survey of students who participated in Q-STEP.&nbsp; Furthermore, exit interviews with the third cohort took place late May 2016. &nbsp;The overall findings of the evaluation of the program are as follows:</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Q-STEP program&nbsp; offers a vibrant and active learning community, particularly between students but also between students and Q-STEP professors.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cooperative learning is successful through the peer mentoring program.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peer mentoring helps students academically and socially and is viewed as a motivation to stay in the Q-STEP program but also to finish degrees.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having a designated space for Q-STEP participants creates a safe environment for exchange and interaction.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guest Speaker sessions and support through Q-STEP professors increased an understanding of relevance between disciplines.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confidence levels in advanced math stayed at high levels.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most Q-STEP participants intend to apply to graduate school.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Graduate school major choices are in STEM-related fields.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surveyed participants continue to recommend Q-STEP to other students.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q-STEP participants have a 100% retention rate in their major.</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The average GPA of active Q-STEP members is consistently higher than that of STEM majors who never attended Q-STEP or those who dropped out of Q-STEP.&nbsp; (See Figure 1.)</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The average number of credits taken by active Q-STEP members is consistently higher than that of STEM majors who never attended Q-STEP or those who dropped out of Q-STEP.&nbsp; (See Figure 2.)</p> <p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the beginning of the Q-STEP program in 2008, there has been an increase in numbers of STEM students and in STEM majors graduating with Bachelor&rsquo;s degrees.&nbsp; (See Figure 3.)</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/30/2016<br>      Modified by: Joseph&nbsp;V&nbsp;Martin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0856435/0856435_10194958_1475252656797_2015GPA--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0856435/0856435_10194958_1475252656797_2015GPA--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1.

Q-STEP aimed to: 1) redesign the undergraduate curriculum, 2) enhance the experiential aspect of STEM education, and 3) create a community of scholars in the quantitative sciences.   A primary focus of the redesign of the undergraduate curriculum was the creation of an interdisciplinary major in Computational and Integrative Biology.  This rigorous new major was started in 2012 and already has two graduates.  The major is the counterpart of a new research center and doctoral program that have recently been initiated in the academic area.  In addition, there have been substantial changes to the traditional STEM major requirements, including biology, chemistry and physics.  These changes have put a heavy emphasis on early and consistent involvement of the students in research.  The experiential aspect of STEM education was facilitated, especially during the first three years of the program, by supporting students in research activities.  This intense research involvement, particularly during the summer months, strongly influenced a subgroup of the Q-STEP students, who gave research presentations in regional venues.

(See Figure 1.)  &bull;           The average number of credits taken by active Q-STEP members is consistently higher than that of STEM majors who never attended Q-STEP or those who dropped out of Q-STEP.  (See Figure 2.)  &bull;           Since the beginning of the Q-STEP program in 2008, there has been an increase in numbers of STEM students and in STEM majors graduating with Bachelor?s degrees.
