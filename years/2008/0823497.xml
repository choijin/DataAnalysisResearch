<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to exploit the concept of near-field focusing-imaging devices offering high-resolution features. The approach is to enhance decaying fields and tailor phases of propagating waves emanating from an object. This will be accomplished utilizing coupled dielectric metamaterials modeling impedance surfaces. Arrays of plasmonic dipoles will also be tailored to achieve terahertz sub-wavelength imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The core of this project is to investigate theoretically and numerically the foundations for achieving high-resolution focusing-imaging components. The goal is to exceed the current diffraction limit in microwave imaging of one wavelength by a factor of more than five and obtain sub-wavelength features.  To achieve this goal, we develop a new approach to reconstruct the evanescent fields of an object. Dielectric particles are tailored to provide electric-magnetic resonances and define impedance surfaces. Coupled meta-surfaces will support surface waves launched by the evanescent fields. This can enable sub-wavelength focusing with resolution of a fifth of a wavelength. Optical sub-wavelength imaging using an array of resonant dipoles is also exploited for terahertz sub-wavelength focusing with the goal of better than a twentieth of a wavelength resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed research is expected to impact the area of near-field focusing and imaging, enabling nanoscale imaging with significantly improved resolution over current technologies.  Possible applications include medical and molecular imaging. A wide range of educational initiatives together with the Northeastern STEM and multicultural PRIME centers are planned. This includes involvement of K-12, high-school, and graduate students. New courses will also be developed.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
