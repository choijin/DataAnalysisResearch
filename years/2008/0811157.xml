<AbstractNarration>Talladega College, a small, private HBCU in Alabama, will implement activities funded by the HBCU-UP aimed at the following goals:&lt;br/&gt;1. To enhance teaching skills of the faculty and improve and broaden undergraduate research activities across STEM disciplines, including biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, physics and psychology;&lt;br/&gt;2. To establish a computerized mathematics laboratory to help improve teaching and learning in lower level mathematics courses;&lt;br/&gt;3. To develop a test-taking skills course to aid students in preparing to achieve competitive scores on graduate school entrance exams; and&lt;br/&gt;4. To provide STEM activities for middle school students and initiate a high school-to-college bridge program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to institutionalize practices aimed at increasing the number of students involved in research. Students in all STEM disciplines will be encouraged to participate in research activities, including presentation of scientific articles, and participation in faculty mentored research projects.  Faculty will be supported in research activities across STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student success in mathematics will be addressed in two ways.  Successful strategies for the teaching of mathematics will be adapted from University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Universidad Interamericana, and Virginia Tech in order to increase success in mathematics courses.  This will involve incorporation of the use of technology, and the use of other teaching strategies.  In addition to teaching strategies in the classroom, a computerized mathematics laboratory will be established to improve teaching and learning in lower level mathematics courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to increase the number of student matriculating into graduate and professional schools, all students will be required to take a course that strengthens test taking abilities.  This course should increase student knowledge of the GRE examination, thus indirectly encouraging students to apply to graduate schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to increase retention through outreach activities including school-to-college bridge programs for students, and collaboration with middle school teachers to develop inquiry based science activities.  Faculty and students from Talladega will also work with middle school teachers and students in designing science fair projects, and for in class demonstrations.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
