<AbstractNarration>The retina is part of the central nervous system and has long been recognized as one of the best experimental systems for neurobiological research. Many important principles of synaptic communication, neuronal circuitry, signal transduction, circadian biology and development were first established in the retina. The FASEB conference on Retinal Neurobiology and Visual Processing builds on this tradition and brings together the best speakers, scientists and trainees to discuss cutting-edge retinal research.  This meeting is held biennially and is considered the premier meeting in the field.  The 2008 conference will explore recent findings and new trends in retinal research, spanning fields from the basic science of visual processing to novel approaches to treat blindness.  This broad focus and high quality meeting attracts first-rate scientists and trainees, and provides an intimate scientific setting that is unique in the retina field.  Research findings are presented in two formats: formal talks and poster sessions.  When not in sessions, participants remain at the meeting site, where they engage in informal discussions and exchange ideas. The FASEB meeting plays an important role in attracting and retaining talented trainees and researchers in the area of retinal biology. Ideas and discussions at these FASEB conferences have stimulated novel, high-impact research and generated new scientific collaborations.  This meeting always receives rave reviews from the attendees and is a key element in promoting and fostering the highest quality retinal research.</AbstractNarration>
