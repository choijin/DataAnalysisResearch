<AbstractNarration>The Cryptoclub:  Cryptography and Mathematics Afterschool and Online is a five -year project designed to introduce middle school students across the country to cryptography and mathematics. Project partners include the Young Peoples Project (YPP), the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, and Eduweb, an award-winning educational software design and development firm. The intended impacts on youth are to improve knowledge and interest in cryptography, increase skills in mathematics, and improve attitudes towards mathematics. The secondary audience is leaders in afterschool programs who will gain an increased awareness of cryptography as a tool for teaching mathematics and adopt the program for use in their afterschool programs. Project deliverables include online activities, online cryptography adventure games, interactive offline games, a leader's manual, and training workshops for afterschool leaders. The project materials will be developed in collaboration with YPP staff and pilot tested in Year 3 at local afterschool programs and YPP sites in Chicago in addition to four national sites. Field testing and dissemination occurs in Year 4 at both local sites in Chicago and national locations such as afterschool programs, science centers, and community programs. Six 3-day training workshops will be provided (2 per year in Years 3-5) to train afterschool leaders. It is anticipated that this project will reach up to 11,000 youth, including underserved youth in urban settings, and 275 professional staff. Strategic impact resulting from this project includes increased awareness of cryptography as a STEM topic with connections to mathematics as well a greater understanding of effective strategies for integrating and supporting web-based and offline activities within informal learning settings. The Cryptoclub project has the potential to have a transformative impact on youth and their understanding of cryptography and may serve as a national model for partnerships between afterschool and mentoring programs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The main outcomes of this grant were the development of online and offline materials that harness the allure of secret messages to teach cryptography and related mathematics for middle-grade students. In addition, the project offered training and resources for teachers and informal educators to introduce their students to an exciting and important application of mathematics in a playful and engaging way. The materials were tested by teachers and students in an iterative design process over six years, including a 2012-13 field test in 29 national sites. The project has trained over 250 educators who have led CryptoClub programs for over 3000 students in locations around the country, including schools, libraries, Boys and Girls Clubs, 4-H Clubs, YMCAs, and other informal educational sites.</p> <p>The project has two main components:&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><em>CryptoClub Afterschool Curriculum</em></strong><em>.<strong> </strong></em>In a CryptoClub afterschool program, middle-grade students explore cryptography while applying mathematics to make and break secret codes. &nbsp;The playfulness and mystery of the subject engages them, and the afterschool environment allows them to learn at their own pace. Some activities involve moving around, for example, following a trail of encrypted clues to find a hidden treasure, or running back and forth in a relay race, competing to be the first to gather and decrypt the parts of a secret message. Other activities involve sitting more quietly and thinking deeply about patterns that might help break a code.</p> <p>At the same time, CryptoClub activities give students the opportunity to apply a range of mathematical topics appropriate for middle school. In the real-world setting of cryptography, students improve their understanding, reinforce their skills, and increase their appreciation of mathematics.</p> <p>The CryptoClub curriculum centers on the student <em>Cipher Handbook</em> and accompanying <em>Leader Manual</em>. The curriculum is flexible and accommodates a variety of teaching formats and learning styles, so it is easily adapted in the afterschool environment. &nbsp;The curriculum has also been implemented during the regular school day in elective classes.&nbsp; The handbook provides enough activities for 20 one-hour sessions, but is flexible enough to be used in other formats.</p> <p>When field test participants were asked what students liked best about CryptoClub, the most common themes in responses were: problem solving, working with ciphers, a sense of community, learning new skills, and playing games.</p> <p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>The CryptoClub Project has develop a system for introducing and training future CryptoClub leaders. Summer leader trainings workshops have been offered annually starting in 2012. &nbsp;Future CryptoClub leaders have always appreciated the opportunity to learn cryptography and to see how they might incorporate mathematics in a real-world application that requires students to think more deeply about the mathematics they have learned in class. One teacher commented: &ldquo;<em>I liked how they had us do the activities, so we would see how it would be done for the students. That part really helped a lot.&rdquo;</em> Over the course of the grant and through the 13 workshops, we have developed a small network of CryptoClub leaders. We enjoy visiting and videotaping their CryptoClubs and have always learned from them how to improve our program and our workshops.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><em>CryptoClub Online</em></strong>. The CryptoClub Website <a href="http://cryptoclub.org/">(<em>cryptoclub.org)</em></a>, developed in collaboration with Eduweb, provides additional opportunities for applying and learning cryptography. &nbsp;It includes cipher tools for encrypting and decrypting, message and joke boards where users decrypt messages or submit their own encrypted messages, historical comics about cryptography, adventure games that involve secret messages, and a treasure hunt clue-generator for teachers to create land-based treasure hunts with encrypted clues. Currently the games include <em>Desert Oasis</em>, which uses the Caesar cipher, <em>Rogue Computer</em>, which uses the keyword cipher, and soon-to-be released <em>Village of Numbers</em>, which uses the additive cipher. All three combine an element of adventure with cryptography activities. Each can be played without previous knowledge of the others and each can be enjoyed multiple times.</p> <p>The website has a registration system, so users can keep track of their progress and earn points for activities they complete. In addition, there is a private group system, so CryptoClub leaders can set up a private message board for their students. Students in a private group can encrypt and submit messages for the group and the leaders can view reports of their activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Some website users are enrolled as part of their afterschool or classroom CryptoClub. Others find the website independently and are not connected to any organized educational program. &nbsp;The growing number of users come from all around the world and every age group.</p> <p>&nbsp;The website is being rebuilt using HTML5 to enable multiplatform deployment and 3D games developed in Unity. The new website will be released in the summer 2018. We expect development of the website to continue in the coming years to incorporate more games and activities.</p> <p>Please visit our project website &nbsp;<a href="http://cryptoclubproject.uchicago.edu/"><strong><em>cryptoclubproject.uchicago.edu</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>to learn more about CryptoClub and <a href="http://www.cryptoclub.org/"><em>cryptoclub.org</em></a> to enjoy our online tools and games.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/21/2018<br>      Modified by: Janet&nbsp;S&nbsp;Beissinger</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/0840313/0840313_10092435_1521562757059_2.HomePagecryptoclub.org--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/0840313/0840313_10092435_1521562757059_2.HomePagecryptoclub.org--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Home page of Cryptoclub.org"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/0840313/0840313_10092435_1521562757059_2.HomePagecryptoclub.org--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Home page of Cryptoclub.org"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The CryptoClub.org is a website where students can learn and apply cryptography.
