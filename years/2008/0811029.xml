<AbstractNarration>The focus of this project is the development and analysis of numerical&lt;br/&gt;algorithms to simulate materials which exhibit intricate rheological&lt;br/&gt;behavior or mechanical response due to their microstructural&lt;br/&gt;makeup. For example, elastic properties of particulates, molecules, or&lt;br/&gt;cells of a material frequently influence the macroscopic properties.&lt;br/&gt;These materials are modeled by formidable systems of partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations, and it is important to develop numerical&lt;br/&gt;schemes to faithfully represent the mathematical structure of these&lt;br/&gt;models.  Tools from partial differential equations, continuum&lt;br/&gt;mechanics, and numerical analysis, will be used to analyze numerical&lt;br/&gt;schemes to simulate these systems. Past experience has shown that new&lt;br/&gt;mathematical tools can lead to numerical schemes which inherit&lt;br/&gt;important structural properties of these models, and that a deeper&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the current schemes frequently leads to improved and&lt;br/&gt;simpler algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Essentially all biological and manufactured materials exhibit complex&lt;br/&gt;macroscopic behavior due to their fine scale makeup. Examples include&lt;br/&gt;micro electromechanical systems (MEMS); biological fluids; ink for ink&lt;br/&gt;jet devices; semiconductors; liquid crystals; and metals undergoing&lt;br/&gt;plastic deformation.  Predicting material response is an essential&lt;br/&gt;technology needed to determine biological or physiological function;&lt;br/&gt;or to design and manufacture these materials; or for the design of the&lt;br/&gt;multitudes of devices which use their special properties. This&lt;br/&gt;research will improve our understanding of the mathematical models and&lt;br/&gt;the computational tools used to accomplish these tasks.  The equations&lt;br/&gt;used to model such phenomena are complex and poorly understood, and&lt;br/&gt;much of the research is directed to revealing the theoretical&lt;br/&gt;(mathematical) properties of these models. This work complements the&lt;br/&gt;more practical approaches undertaken in the engineering community and&lt;br/&gt;at the national laboratories.</AbstractNarration>
