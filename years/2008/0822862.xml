    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase II research targets innovative means for controlling ectoparasite pests in open ocean aquaculture. Offshore fish farming offers tremendous growth opportunities. Adaptive fish health management offshore remains a challenge for environmentally sound expansion of this potentially lucrative industry. PEDICURe (Passive Ectoparasite Device In Counter-current Underwater Reservoir) prototypes showed great efficacy in treating ectoparasite pests in marine fish in tank trials. Phase II research will refine therapeutic treatments, PEDICURe designs and protocols for use. Commercial-scale prototypes will be deployed and tested in offshore cages. PEDICURes could be sold or licensed to fish farms worldwide. PEDICURes could also provide compelling competitive advantages to drive expanded production in Hawaii, U.S. waters, or globally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are in increasing the environmentally sound means for optimizing fish health in open ocean aquaculture, and thereby aiding the growth in this innovative, exciting and potentially lucrative industry. Offshore farms can produce high-value marine fish without significant impacts on water quality, benthic habitats or other ocean user groups. Cost savings to a $1 billion U.S. offshore farming industry could be $115 million p.a. There are potential applications worldwide.</AbstractNarration>
