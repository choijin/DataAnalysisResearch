<AbstractNarration>The Compact Object Binaries and Gravitational Radiation project focuses on computational modeling of astrophysical phenomena that enter the LIGO sensitivity band, thus exploiting the predictive power of numerical relativity. The effort capitalizes on both the latest advances of LIGO and its partners in gathering data and operating at design sensitivity and on the recent revolution in numerical relativity that has made binary black hole simulations possible. The project consists of the following areas: (i) Enhancement of computational infrastructure to improve performance and accuracy of black hole collision simulations and their associated gravitational waves, (ii) binary black hole simulations with unequal mass and spinning black holes in support of LIGO observational efforts, and (iii) black hole and neutron star simulations to model central engines for short gamma-ray bursts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project transforms the focus of the numerical relativity at Georgia Tech from development to applications, with the aim of producing results that capture broad interest and involving scientific computing that pushes the frontiers of high performing computing. Specifically, the project further enhances the computational infrastructure and enables the development of flexible and reusable community tools essential to collaborative effort in support of the detection and interpretation of gravitational wave observations.Â  In addition, the project provides valuable sources of ideas and materials for interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students in gravitational wave physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Compact Object Binaries and Gravitational Radiation award supported research, training and education activities that exploited the predictive power of numerical relativity to model astrophysical phenomena. The effort produced results in the following areas:  Development of innovative computational infrastructure to improve the performance and accuracy of simulations used to study astrophysical phenomena involving black hole singularities. Simulations of binary black holes as sources of gravitational radiation in support of LIGO data analysis observational efforts. Studies of massive black holes in astrophysical environments such as hot gas clouds and circum-binary disks. Simulations of the disruption of solar-type stars by tidal forces from a supermassive black hole.       Intellectual Merit:  The results obtained in these areas contributed to enhance our understanding of astrophysical events in which dynamical gravity or the curvature of space-time plays a key role. Regarding binary black holes, the results unveiled the importance, as well as the challenge, of modeling spinning black holes. The results from the study of binary black holes in gaseous environments and from the disruption of stars demonstrated situations in which the emission of gravitational waves is accompanied with electromagnetic radiation, providing examples of multi-messenger astronomy.  The tools and methodologies developed by this project will enhance the conversation between the data collected by gravitational wave interferometric detectors and the questions posed by relativity and astrophysics.     Broad Impact:  This award supported the training and education of one postdoctoral fellow and two graduate students. The experience they gained in high performance computing and software engineering will further their careers.
