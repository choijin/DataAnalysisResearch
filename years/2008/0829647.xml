<AbstractNarration>This CPATH Conceptual Development and Planning project creates linkages between computer science and many other disciplines at the University of Nebraska through a redesigned computing core and an infusion of computational thinking concepts and learning environments into a broad range of courses and academic disciplines.  The faculty team plans to use a holistic approach called Renaissance Computing that covers both computer science and other disciplines and creates a computing student population with multidisciplinary backgrounds. The activities include arranging workshops and meetings to determine the needs of the many participating departments, designing a cohesive curriculum to support computational thinking, conducting a pilot study of two interdisciplinary courses, and developing an implementation plan for full scaled institutional transformation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in expertise and commitment of a large interdisciplinary project team from a number of different academic divisions across the campus. The holistic approach and computational thinking vision are sound and timely. The project has the potential for national impact and to provide new models for computing education of the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project lie in the potential to address changing demands on computing professionals and to attract a diverse audience of students. The project has the potential to engage the entire faculty and student body and to foster computational thinking throughout each academic program, thus producing students much better prepared for the computational intense professional careers of the future. The project includes outreach to high school students as well as dissemination of resources and results to a broad computing community.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the narrowest sense, "computational thinking" is the mindset that students need to acquire in order to work effectively with computational systems. More broadly, however, it is a way of understanding the world &ndash; one that transcends mere methodology and which is likewise transportable across a wide variety of human endeavors. In our view, computer science curricula that do not address this broadening do not address the ways in which computational thinking pervades life in the modern world.  We consider a radical re&ndash;thinking not only of our core curriculum in computer science, but of the role of computer science at the university level. In our conception, "computational thinking" is neither easily separated from other endeavors nor easily balkanized into a single department. We thus imagine a computer science program that is inextricably linked to other domains. We further understand these domains to include not only the subjects ordinarily thought of as cognate with computational thinking (like bioinformatics), but with such notions as "humanities computing," "arts computing, " and "music computing."     Our term for this new approach, Renaissance Computing, is intended to evoke that period of history in which computational thinking arguably first began&ndash;a period marked by the signal lack of hard and fast lines between subjects that has now overtaken university curricula. We imagine an undergraduate program in which students are prepared for the challenges of any one computational domain by virtue of their exposure to multiple domains in which computational thinking plays prominent a role. Our program imagines discrete tracks into computational thinking, but also emphasizes learning environments in which students are able to see the broad transferability of computational notions into other areas. The intellectual merit of this concept development and planning proposal was twofold.  First, the overall Renaissance Computing framework was holistic: it covers introductory, depth, and capstone courses--though the focus of the funded project was on introductory courses, i.e., CS1, and targets CS majors and non-majors.  Further, it was aimed to develop interdisciplinary courses in sciences and engineering (which are traditionally aligned with CS) and arts and humanities (which are gaining significance as key applications areas for CS).  In addition, the framework embraced collaborative learning, which has been shown to improve learning performance.  Finally, the framework recognized the flexibility of learning objects to supplement course delivery, affording students the luxury of perusing modules of other courses of other flavors.   The broader impacts of the proposed project were threefold.  First, as a result of the concept development and planning, through our workshop, more academic units on campus were exposed to the importance of computational thinking and computing, giving the Renaissance Computing framework a stronger foothold at UNL.  This has indeed helped us establish one interdisciplinary minor in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics and working towards another interdisciplinary minor in another on-going initiative.  Second, online courseware--CS1 learning objects--and computer-supported collaborative learning systems are available online and have been used in courses not beyond the scope of Renaissance Computing.   The research results published and disseminated at journals and conferences also informed the community of our findings, in particular on motivation and self-regulation's impact on student learning.  Third, the percentages of female students in sciences, arts, and humanities are significantly higher than those in engineering, particularly CS.  With Renaissance Computing, we exposed computational thinking to reach a much larger portion of female students, and thus increase female participation in undergraduate computing.  Furthermore, with the RET supplements, two middle school teachers...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
