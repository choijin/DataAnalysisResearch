<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to define the role of the solvent in the self?]assembly synthesis of nanoporous zeolitic materials. The proposed work will combine the lead PI?fs (JLA) experience of experimentally investigating ionic liquid solvation properties and zeolite syntheses with the co?]PI?fs (TIM) experience in molecular modeling of ionic liquids systems. This collaborative project will establish a foundation for understanding the fundamental interactions between the ionic liquid and the nanomaterial precursor compounds that will then enable the rational selection of ionic liquids as solvents for the syntheses of new nanoporous materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes using a combination of solubility and spectroscopy measurements, thermodynamic theory, and molecular modeling to study materials made via ionothermal synthesis, where the solvent is an ionic liquid. The intellectual merit of the proposed research includes a detailed investigation into how systematic changes to the ionic liquid structure influence the interactions with the nanomaterial precursors and how that in turn affects the formation of the final material. At the conclusion of this work, the investigators will have reported (1) the first solubility measurements of nanomaterial precursors in ionic liquids, (2) thermodynamic models to describe the phase behavior of the precursors and ionic liquids, (3) the crucial validation of molecular dynamics simulations for ionic liquid / precursor systems, (4) the quantification of the chemical complexes formed between the solute and solvent in the initial stages of zeolite synthesis, and (5) the elucidation of trends between the solute/solvent phase behavior and material formation that will be used to rationally select ionic liquids solvents for synthesis of novel nanoporous materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project  are multifold. Specifically, with respect to impacts on the broad fields of ionic liquids and nanoporous materials, this work will (1) enrich the literature on ionic liquid solution behavior and ionothermal synthesis of nanoporous zeolitic materials, (2) provide solute/solvent relationships that can be extended to the ionothermal synthesis of other materials (e.g. silicates, metal organic frameworks, nanometal oxides, etc.), and (3) provide fundamental data critical for the development of computer simulations and predictive modeling techniques that will be important for designing materials. Additionally, both PIs are committed to the education and recruitment of engineering students. The proposed work will enable the inclusion of both graduate and undergraduate students in the research laboratory, facilitate an interactive collaboration between research groups at two universities, and allow the PIs to work with existing outreach infrastructure at their respective institutions to recruit students from underrepresented groups to the fields of science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the materials research field there has been a high emphasis on ædesigner materialsÆ that are made for specific applications.   Zeolites and zeolite-like materials have potential to become such designer materials in a wide range of applications, such as highly specific materials for a targeted sensing device, low dielectric constant films for fuel-cell membranes or even supports for medical diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) agents that would be toxic if not permanently fixed within the zeolite pores.  Although there have been more than 900,000 theoretical structures proposed, the vast majority have never been made or tested.  In fact, only 218 distinct zeolite-like structures have been synthesized and assigned identification codes by the International Zeolite Association.1  Of those, only 11 zeolites are commercially available, with only three structures, faujasite (zeolite X and zeolite Y), Linde Type A (zeolite A), and ZSM-5 making up the bulk of industrial processes.  There remains a huge range of untapped prospective materials with unique structures and properties.     In the past, these materials have been primarily limited to hydrothermal synthesis where water is the solvent.  In 2006, a new ionothermal synthesis technique using ionic liquids as the solvent was reported and has since yielded a number of new zeolitic structures.  This novel technique presents many exciting possibilities for unique materials processing and a high potential for greater synthetic control.  With more than 1016 proposed possible ionic liquid combinations, this new ionothermal technique is opening a door where the untapped structures will likely become accessible.  In addition to enabling the synthesis of new materials, the non-volatile nature of ionic liquids offers unique processing opportunities, such as the synthesis of materials in thin films of ionic liquids at elevated temperatures with no concern for loss of solvent, which was not previously possible.  This project is aimed at investigating the behavior of precursors of zeolites  synthesis because these fundamental properties could be useful in the current and future synthesis of aluminophosphates.  First, solubilities of different precursors, including Syloid 63 silica particles, aluminum isopropoxide and phosphoric acid in different ionic liquids are reported. Parameters such as activity coefficient and HenryÆs constant are also calculated. Influence of ILsÆ structures could make a great influence on the solubility of precursors. In addition, with the presence of phosphoric acid in ILs, more aluminum isopropoxide could be dissolved in ILs, indicating an interaction of phosphoric acid with aluminum isopropoxide in ILs. Then in order to reuse ionic liquids in ionothermal synthesis of aluminophosphates, influence of phosphoric acid on structures of ionic liquids is investigated. It is found at 50 oC, a very small amount of [C2mim][Br] is decomposed by phosphoric acid even after 18 days. And after heated at 150 oC either for one hour or five days, the decomposed amount of [C4mim][Br] is extremely small and negligible. As a result, the reuse of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bromides should not be hindered by the use of phosphoric acid.  Second, interaction between precursors and ILs are studied by 27Al solid state NMR. The precursor is mainly aluminum isopropoxide. At room temperature, Al(VI) is the primary confirmation of aluminum atoms in aluminum isopropoxide, as compared to Al(IV) in as-synthesized molecular sieves. It is found that in [Cnmim][Br] (n=2, 4, 6) and at 70 oC, some Al atoms with Al(VI) confirmation begins to change to Al(IV). The change is more significant with the presence of phosphoric acid. At lower temperature, this change is not as remarkable as at 70 oC. With the increase of alkyl chain of ILs, ratio of Al(IV) to Al(VI) increases regardless at room temperature or at 70 oC, suggesting [C6mim][Br] could possibly accelerates the formation of Al-O-P bonds.    ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
