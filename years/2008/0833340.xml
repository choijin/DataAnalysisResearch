<AbstractNarration>The three academic divisions that prepare STEM undergraduates and science and&lt;br/&gt;mathematics teachers in the M.A./credential program (MAT) are joining forces with three regional school districts, each with well established teacher induction programs, to build an effective pipeline into mathematics and science teaching jobs in these high-need districts. The partner districts are aiding in the selection of thirty-two STEM majors planning to teach in the areas of specialization that are most needed in their districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Noyce Scholarship Program provides support to: 1) strengthen outreach to and support of a diverse pool of prospective mathematics and science teachers as undergraduates, 2) increase the number and quality of students to be prepared as mathematics and science teachers, 3) further develop close partnerships between the university and regional high-need school districts in order to enhance the recruitment and retention of new teachers in key areas of district shortages, and 4) develop a central piece of work in the dissertation research of a graduate student studying issues of teacher retention and educational policy. Over the course of the project, the Noyce Scholarships are supporting the preparation of 32 new mathematics and science teachers to enter into teaching positions in high-need rural and suburban school districts serving large numbers of low income and English learner students in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) was designed to help recruit and prepare college science and math majors for successful teaching careers and to support them in their early professional lives.

The Noyce Scholarship program provided scholarships to enable students to attend a high-quality, but expensive, teacher preparation program at UCSC.

Scholarship support ranged from $16,800 to $24,700 per student, and it typically covered tuition and required fees, but not living expenses, for four of the five academic quarters of the program. In exchange for the scholarship support, Noyce Scholars committed to two years of teaching in a high-need public school within eight years after graduation. Supplemental Noyce funding supported additional activities, summer teaching and laboratory internships for prospective Noyce Scholars.
