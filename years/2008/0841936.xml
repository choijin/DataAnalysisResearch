<AbstractNarration>Wheat, oats, rice, and other cereal grains are key pillars of human societies worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;Along with other members of the grass family, these plants provide the majority of the&lt;br/&gt;calories humans eat, either directly as grains or indirectly as meat and milk produced by&lt;br/&gt;grazing animals. Unfortunately, these important grasses are plagued by several families&lt;br/&gt;of plant viruses, including the barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses, which damage&lt;br/&gt;cereal grain production worldwide. These viruses also harm wild grasses and can&lt;br/&gt;advance the spread of invasive species in nature. How have influential viruses like&lt;br/&gt;these emerged and what factors have contributed to their spread and diversification? To&lt;br/&gt;find clues about virus history, the project team will recover and analyze genetic&lt;br/&gt;sequences of old viruses preserved within historical collections of dried plants around&lt;br/&gt;the world. Phylogenetic analysis of the viruses will reveal how these viruses have&lt;br/&gt;spread over time and permit estimates of dates of key events in their history. The&lt;br/&gt;research will also provide information on the influence of humans on the spread of plant&lt;br/&gt;viruses.&lt;br/&gt;Human development of agriculture and global trade are two factors that have likely&lt;br/&gt;influenced the emergence and spread of potent viruses. This research will provide&lt;br/&gt;missing information about virus dynamics in the past and produce new insight into the&lt;br/&gt;ways by which human activities influence the development of virus threats. The&lt;br/&gt;project's broader impact will include training of educators and students from&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups, contributions to microbial ecology outreach efforts through a&lt;br/&gt;science museum, and the addition of information about virus relationships to curated&lt;br/&gt;plant collections.&lt;br/&gt;NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:0843140 PI Name:Malmstrom, Carolyn&lt;br/&gt;Printed</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The yellow dwarf viruses (YDVs) of cereal crops (wheat, barley and oats) form a suite of similar viruses that were once all called barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV).  The YDVs collectively are the most economically important viruses of cereal crops and occur worldwide.  They also infect many wild grass species.  YDVs are transmitted only by aphids.  This project aimed to understand the evolution and adaptation of these viruses by determining the complete genome sequences of YDVs found in old herbarium samples of host species.  This would inform us on how the viruses have changed over the past 100 years or so.  In Miller's part of the project, we helped to obtain next generation (Illumina) sequences of many herbarium samples that are now being processed by the Malmstrom lab (the PI).   The Miller lab also determined the first complete genome sequence of a YDV called BYDV-RMV, to discover that it is not a BYDV at all, but instead it is only distantly related.  Thus, we renamed this virus maize yellow dwarf virus-RMV (MYDV-RMV), because it is known to infect maize and is transmitted by a maize aphid.  Recognition that this is a different virus has important implications for quarantine purposes, because areas in which BYDV is endemic may not contain MYDV and vice versa.  Methods used to control BYDV may not affect MYDV and vice versa.   We also examined the evolution of the BYDV coat protein which is important because it interacts with the aphid vector and likely determines which aphid species transmit the virus most efficiently, and it may also determine which plant species can be infected.  We compared the sequences of coat proteins of over 300 BYDV strains and species from around the world, and discovered that certain amino acids are under evolutionary selection to change rapidly.  This is important for the control of BYDV infections because it may allow us to predict how the virus changes to adapt to different aphid vectors and conditions.   It also points to key amino acids in the viral coat protein that we can investigate further to understand how they interact with the aphid vector at the molecular structural level.  This knowledge, in turn, may lead us to invent ways to disrupt the transmission cycle and prevent spread of the YDVs.    Finally, this information may allow us to understand how the virus adapts to different plant host species.  YDVs infect many wild grasses and may be responsible for changing ecosystems by limiting growth of certain native grasses while favoring growth of invasive grasses.   Understanding the evolution of the virus over time as it moves between grass species may help in the management of native ecosystems.  Our research has provided  viral genome sequence information on which viruses occurred in which plant species and when and where.  This should provide a starting point for our lab and others to gain an understanding of how this important family of viruses adapts to host plant, aphid vector, and environmental conditions, which is necessary for us to figure out how to control these viruses.
