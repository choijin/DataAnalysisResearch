<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;DRL-0822128&lt;br/&gt;PI: John Ristvey&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Mid-Continent Research for Education and Learning (McREL)&lt;br/&gt;Title: NanoTeach: Professional Development in Nanoscale Science&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is exploring the introduction of nanoscience curriculum into high schools. It is creating and studying a professional development model based on two products, the NanoTeach Teacher's Guide and the NanoTeach Facilitator's Guide. The NanoTeach Teacher's guide is being designed for self study by teachers (low treatment group) and for use in a facilitated development model (high treatment group). The NanoTeach Facilitator's Guide outlines the professional development experiences and provides guidance for facilitators. The professional development model combines (1) a design framework (Designing Effective Science Lessons based on the C-U-E model: content, understanding, and environment); (2) nanoscale science content from NSF-funded curriculum projects; and (3) multiple delivery methods. Twenty teachers are being recruited to carry out the pilot testing of the professional development materials. 75 teachers in the high treatment group are experiencing a 2-week summer workshop, asynchronous sessions while they implement their first lesson, Versatile Classroom (a synchronous, online video technology), implementation of a second lesson, and a final 2-week summer workshop. 75 teachers in the low treatment group experience a brief orientation to nanoscience resources, have access to the NT Teacher's Guide, implement two lessons, and debrief. The NanoTeach partnership includes Aspen Associates, the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility, and the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network. The research study is being carried out by Aspen Associates, and project evaluation is conducted by Dr. Doug Huffman of the University of Kansas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NanoTeach: Professional Development in Nanoscale Science McREL International with Stanford Nanofabrication Facility, Georgia Institute of Technology, ASPEN Associates and the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN) developed and tested NanoTeach, a professional development (PD) model for teachers that combines an instructional design framework with nanoscale science content using multiple delivery methods for high school science teachers. NS&amp;T deals with science phenomena at the nanoscale where materials exhibit different properties than bulk materials thereby providing applications that can benefit society. The nine big ideas in NS&amp;T that were the focus of the NanoTeach program are: (1) size and scale; (2) structure of matter; (3) size-dependent properties; (4) forces and interactions; (5) self-assembly; (6) tools and instrumentation; (7) models and simulations; (8) nano and society; and (9) quantum mechanics.  Research Question #1: Does the NanoTeach facilitated PD improve teachersÆ ability to integrate NS&amp;T content into their classes in a manner that promotes student understanding?   Research Question #2: To what extent is the approach utilized in NanoTeach a viable approach to the development of PD materials and experiences that support integration of NS&amp;T in high school science?  Methods:  The research design included a pilot test experience, revision process and a field test experience with cohorts in both facilitated and team-study models. The NanoTeach TeacherÆs Guide and accompanying Google sites were designed for team-study (self-paced teams) and for use in a facilitated (face-to-face) PD model. Both groups participated in 80 hours of summer experiences with school-year interactions prior to fall and spring lesson implementations.  The pilot test (2010-2011) was conducted with teachers from a national sample. The field test (2012-2013) was conducted with teachers from four locations (Colorado, Texas, Georgia, and Louisiana).  Intellectual Merit:   Outcome 1: Teachers will be able to integrate NS&amp;T content into their classes in a manner that promotes student understanding. Findings include:  Teachers      in the facilitated and team-study approaches were equally prepared to      teach the NS&amp;T topics they had selected for their NanoTeach lesson. Teachers in both study groups reported emphasizing learning basic      science concepts, science investigation skills, and preparing students for      further study in science as their key learning goals. Students and      teachers in both study groups reported implementing a variety of effective      teaching strategies during the implementation of their NanoTeach lessons.   Outcome 2: Students in classrooms where teachers implement effective NS&amp;T lessons will report high levels of interest and engagement.  Teachers and students in both      the facilitated and team-study approaches reported high levels of      engagement and interest in learning science and NS&amp;T.   Outcome 3: Teacher knowledge of NS&amp;T will increase over the course of the project.  Teachers in both the facilitated      and team-study approaches demonstrated statistically significant moderate to large gains in their      knowledge of NS&amp;T from pretest to posttest.   Outcome 4:  Teacher knowledge of effective instructional strategies will increase over the course of the project. Findings include:  Data from practice guides showed that teachers from both study      groups were able to effectively implement lessons using the DESI      instructional strategies. Case study teachers from both study groups indicated that they      struggled with:    Clearly connecting NS&amp;T learning goals to their curricular       science concepts. Formatively assessing student understanding throughout the lesson. Guiding sense-making and discourse during inquiry-based lessons       leading to conceptual understanding.     Outcome 5:  Feedback from the NanoTeach team, partners...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
