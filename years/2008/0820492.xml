<AbstractNarration>The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at Brandeis University supports innovative research and education in an exciting subject at the interface between materials science and biology. The major research theme of the Center is to develop fundamental understanding of emergent properties of materials due to constraints similar to those occurring in biological systems, and in understanding the role of constraints in the structure and function of cells and cellular components. This is an interdisciplinary Center with twelve senior investigators from four departments at Brandeis University, and one each from Brown University and Olin College of Engineering. The MRSEC provides a multidisciplinary education for students in physics, chemistry and biology, that will contribute to the workforce at the research frontiers and to the needs of emerging biomaterials industries. Other educational programs include research experiences for undergraduates, and pre-college outreach through teacher training. The MRSEC offers a program targeted to inner-city minority science undergraduates at Brandeis. Scientists at the Center work with the Discovery Museums in Acton, MA, to develop interactive exhibits in the area of biological physics and materials science. The Center provides novel facilities for research in the emerging area of microfluidics and is collaborating with industry to develop microfluidics technologies. &lt;br/&gt;Research at the Center is organized as a single Interdisciplinary Research Group with three main thrusts that explore how the addition of constraints typically found in biology - confinement, crowding, and local forces that compete with and sometimes frustrate long range order - leads to emergent properties, in the realms of both structure and dynamics.   The research thrusts are structure and dynamics of long polymer molecules, such as DNA, in tightly confined volumes; self-assembly of "chiral" or twisted molecules that lead to unusual structures; and "active matter" composed of organized assemblies of self-powered particles that move in space or oscillate in time. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The Brandeis MRSEC, Constraints and Frustration in Nano-Structured and Bio-Molecular Materials, consisted of three thrusts. The first thrust area, Chiral Self-Assembly, studied the effects of chirality in frustrating long range order in both crystals and membranes, resulting in complex new structures. Unexpectedly, it was discovered that chirality governed the surface tension of liquid crystalline membranes. By controllably varying chirality they were able to reversibly switch the stability of liquid crystals from one structure to another. The second thrust area, Bio-Active Matter, studied solutions of microtubules that were driven relative to one another by the forces applied by clusters of kinesin motors, with the addition of a non-binding polymer to induce the depletion interaction causing bundling of the fibers, and ATP to fuel the motors. The third thrust area, Chemo-Active Matter, studied a dynamical system of active matter based on interacting droplets containing the Belousov-Zhabotinsky oscillating chemical reaction. Gelation of these materials leads to chemo-mechanical transduction, a simple model system mimicking living tissue. These last two thrust areas share fundamental concepts in Active Matter physics, and the two experimental systems are capable of producing similar spatial and temporal patterns. These are among the first precisely controllable experimental model systems of active matter ever formulated and analyzed, an important innovation in this exciting new area of Soft Matter research. These model experimental systems have been adopted by a number of researchers world-wide and are serving to build a common framework with which to elucidate the engineering principles of Active Matter. In the long term this research will lead to the creation of materials that can consume energy and produce forces and motility, which are attributes that for now are only found in living organisms.  Integrating education and research was a central focus of the MRSEC. 15 PhDs were awarded during the grant and 27 graduate students and 30 postdocs were supported.
