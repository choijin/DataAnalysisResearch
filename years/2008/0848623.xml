    <AbstractNarration>Beliefs and attitudes favoring equality of opportunities for women have grown dramatically over the last decades in the United States and other industrialized, low-fertility nations. Although not to the same extent, gender egalitarian views have also grown in many low- and middle-income nations of South America, Asia, and Africa. What caused these changes? One theory attributes special importance to new education and work roles for women in advanced industrial economies. Another theory posits that values of people in all roles -- traditional as well as modern, male as well as female -- become more egalitarian with economic and social development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes a third, diffusion theory that combines components of the other two. It posits that economic and social development first increase gender egalitarianism among those in modern positions and roles, thus creating a gap between traditionalists and feminists. Later, however, diffusion of egalitarian values to those in traditional roles occurs, the gap between innovators and others diminishes, and goals of gender equality become widely accepted. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methodology for the project tests these theories using surveys of citizens in 84 nations across the world from 1983 to 2002. The surveys ask numerous questions on the proper work and family roles of women. The analysis can thus examine how education, work, family, and religion affect gender egalitarian views across nations at different levels of economic development, gender equality, and political rights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has important broader social impacts. Equal opportunity for women has become a widely accepted goal of most nations and inter-governmental organizations. Gender egalitarian views help empower women in daily life, improve health of women and children, increase access to rewarding work, lend more choice in family roles, and encourage political participation. Understanding how support for gender equality spreads within and across societies can contribute to improving worldwide equal opportunity.</AbstractNarration>
