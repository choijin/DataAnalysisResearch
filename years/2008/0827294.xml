<AbstractNarration>In a dissertation research project conducted under the supervision of Dr. Mary Stiner, Britt Starkovich will study changes in human hunting strategies from the Middle through Upper Paleolithic (about 80,000 to 15,000 years ago) at Klissoura Cave 1 in Peloponnese, Greece. Klissoura Cave 1 contains the longest, most complete Pleistocene archaeological sequence that has been excavated to date in Greece. The Greek Paleolithic has thus far been understood from a small handful of sites, with much variation in the quality of archaeological deposits and subsequent excavations and publications. Klissoura Cave 1 is well-excavated and contains many intact cultural features and strata. Starkovichs in-depth analysis of the animal remains from the site would greatly enhance our knowledge about Paleolithic subsistence strategies in this part of the Mediterranean. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on long-scale change in human diets is important in understanding adaptations that allowed our species to survive and flourish in a world of unpredictable climates and nutritional uncertainty. Much can be learned about the behaviors of past foragers based on their hunting decisions. Changes in subsistence over a long temporal sequence such as that at Klissoura can shed light on larger demographic, social or environmental changes. These shifts can be detected from trends in prey species representation and the body parts of large prey animals that were transported from a kill site to a home base, and the ages of the animals hunted. In considering changes in species representation, it is important to look at both small and large game. Shifts in small game use are often a more sensitive indicator of human dietary change, and possible related changes in human population densities. This project examines these indicators of changing human subsistence behavior, with special attention to small game, as well as potential non-human factors, such as carnivore damage or weathering, that may have degraded some of the archaeological materials and biased the assemblage.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond research questions of interest to social scientists, this project will have broader impacts in both the public and scientific realms. The Greek people have a long tradition of being interested in their past, but they have very little exposure to time periods before the temples and shrines of Classical Greece were built. The directors of the Klissoura project have reached an agreement with the Nafplio Museum, eastern Peloponnese, to create a public exhibition on the Paleolithic occupations of Peloponnese based on the findings from Klissoura Cave. Starkovich's results on the animal remains will be a significant part of in the display. The museum exhibition on Klissoura Cave will provide Greek people and the many international visitors to the museum with a deeper understanding about past. From a scientific standpoint, the Klissoura project is a large-scale collaborative effort, involving an international team from Greece, Poland, Belgium, Spain, and the United States, conducting interdisciplinary research on all aspects of the site. International collaborations are critical to scientific endeavors, because they allow researchers from different backgrounds and paradigms to interact and learn from one another and to have access to sites and technologies that would otherwise be unavailable without the larger group effort. NSF funding of this project will facilitate the training of a graduate student and forward the working relationships formed on the Klissoura project well into the future.</AbstractNarration>
