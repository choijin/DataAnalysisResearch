<AbstractNarration>The University of Memphis Chemistry REU site, Collaborative Research in Chemistry, will provide a ten-week intensive research experience for eight undergraduate students each summer.  The research projects focus on collaborative research in chemistry, involving the synthesis and characterization of materials.  The focus on collaborative research builds on existing collaborations between departmental faculty members, as well as with other institutions and industrial collaborators.  This focus will provide students with a realistic picture of the growing reality of scientific partnerships, rather than individual efforts.   Participant recruiting efforts will focus on the state of Tennessee and directly neighboring states due to a scarcity of chemistry REU sites in this area, as well as prior experience indicating that over 50% of our previous participants derive from this region.  An important addition to our current recruiting plan is a partnership with chemistry faculty at regional historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) who will nominate minority students who may not have previous exposure to research careers in an effort to provide valuable research experience opportunities to this underserved population.  The main focus of the program is a ten-week intensive research experience complemented with social activities, industrial site visits, and weekly one-hour sessions devoted to research support skills, such as literature searching, critical reading of the scientific literature, writing, scientific ethics, and presentation skills.&lt;br/&gt;   The intellectual merits of the program include contributions to diverse sub-disciplines of chemistry. REU participants will synthesize materials with various properties and potential applications. Results from the proposed projects will be disseminated through publications and presentations. Travel funds for REU participants will promote presentations at national and regional meetings during the year following their research experience. This REU site will broadly impact training in chemistry, participation of underrepresented minorities in chemical research, and will promote partnerships between the University of Memphis and regional HBCU institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The REU Site award to the University of Memphis Chemistry Department supported 30 undergraduate students in 11 different research laboratories.  Research outcomes are reported by general areas.  New Materials  Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a cheap, abundant, and renewable resource which can be used as a reagent in many reactions. For example, CO2 can be used in copolymerization reactions to make polycarbonates, which have major uses in medical applications (surgical sutures and body or dental implants) and various uses in electronics (capacitors and the materials used to make Compact Discs, DVDs, and Blu-ray Discs). However, CO2 is a difficult molecule to use in chemical reactions because it is inherently very stable. Therefore, metal-containing catalysts are required to "activate" and polymerize CO2. A fundamental understanding of how the current versions of these catalysts work will improve the rational design of better catalysts. The members of the Webster group have used first-principles physics to model the steps (structures and energetics) in these copolymerization reactions at the atomic level.  Photochromic systems are of interest as photoswitchable devices with potential applications in light-controlled catalysis, laser-induced drug delivery, and optical computer memory.  Research in the Fujiwara and Burkey groups aims at the development of different types of photochromic systems.  Several students focused on the synthesis of organometallic photochromic compounds, in which the mechanism of color change is based on the interchange of functional groups attached to a metal (a linkage isomerization).  Systematic investigation on the structure of the functional group and its impact on the the efficiency of color change and the properties of the isomers have been undertaken.

A second type of photochromic system under development is based on purely organic components that undergo substantial structural changes due to ring-chain interconversion.  From intensive training on organic synthesis through their REU research, two students were able to learn advanced synthetic skills and characterization techniques using NMR and IR.

The Co complex of DPA-Bpy ligand displays highly efficient H2 evolution activity in purely aqueous solution.  Students in the Pinkhassik research group worked on projects related to the synthesis and investigation of nanomaterials. Their goals were to understand how biologically-inspired methods can be applied to the creation of materials with previously unattainable properties.
