<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to attract and organize a revenue-generating, web-based, collaborative community of independent "creatives" - writers, photographers, animators, video producers, graphic artists, designers, musicians, etc. by providing web tools designed to increase their productivity and ability to interact with peers and with potential clients. Artbox plans to build the platform by integrating web-based tools into an efficient online application, creating a virtual community for people who usually work alone. These free-lance workers are a growing portion of the creative labor market. They need a network of creative people with different skillsets to carry out multifaceted multimedia projects they could not do on their own. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The net has changed the economic realities of almost every business, and the American economy is at a turning point. Old models based on manufacturing and information technology have been greatly affected by the availability of cheap labor overseas. Observers of these trends have identified that innovation and imagination and collective intelligence form the new basis for competitive advantage in the global marketplace. In an innovation economy, creators of original content, concepts and products are also the creators of value. By aggregating this "Creative Force", Artbox.com will build a powerful network and efficient talent-sourcing tool for businesses and individuals alike.  If successful, the commercial impact of this platform promises to be significant.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
