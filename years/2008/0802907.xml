<AbstractNarration>The Powering the Planet (PP) Chemical Bonding Center focuses on one of the "Grand Challenges" for the 21st Century: the efficient, and ultimately economical, conversion of solar energy into stored chemical fuels. PP efforts will focus on developing the components for a solar water splitting system. These components are: (i) a membrane-supported assembly that captures sunlight and then efficiently separates and transports charge, (ii) a two-electron catalyst that reduces water to hydrogen, and (iii) a four-electron catalyst that oxidizes water to oxygen. This interdisciplinary effort will involve semiconductor materials, polymeric and inorganic membranes, synthesis, theory, and mechanistic chemistry. The basic science pursued in PP will provide the foundation for future carbon-neutral energy technologies. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;PP will train a diverse and talented pool of students in the technical skills needed for the solution of this critical challenge. PP will incorporate underrepresented groups through partnering with specific undergraduate institutions and providing broad access to PP research scientists through both direct and virtual (videoconference) interactions. Outside of the laboratory, PP participants will help develop innovative curricula for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. PP researchers will raise the public's awareness of the challenges of the energy problem, how solar energy can contribute to its solution, the nature of the fundamental scientific challenges in developing a water-splitting device, and the impact of PP research through public lectures, national TV and radio programs. Further, PP PIs will work with several major business leaders and companies in the U.S. to help them develop a position that contributes positively to the energy and sustainability challenges confronting our planet.</AbstractNarration>
