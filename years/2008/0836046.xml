<AbstractNarration>PI name: John C. Crittenden&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Arizona State University&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0836046&lt;br/&gt;EFRI-RESIN: Sustainable Infrastructures for Energy and Water Supply (SINEWS)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the sustainability and resilience of the water and energy systems, and to offer solutions that span infrastructure design, management of the physical environment, and socio-economic policy.  SINEWS has four major research elements:  (1) THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT.  The project will model the growth of urban (built and natural) environment and the associated endogenous infrastructure risks.  The technological, engineering, and ecological options for mitigating these risks over the life of the infrastructures will be identified.  (2) THE INFRASTRUCTURES. The project will examine and model the resilience and sustainability of water and energy supply system options.  Benchmarks will be identified for power and water supply systems that are resilient to the expected range of shocks, that are flexible, modular, adaptive, and efficient, and that reflect the interdependency of infrastructures and their environment.  (3) THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.  The project will model the infrastructure risks associated with the socio-economic environment - the demographic, economic, institutional and social drivers of water and energy demand, and identify risk management options under different socio-economic conditions.  (4) LIFE CYCLE IMPLICATIONS of infrastructure options, e.g., decentralized versus centralized power and water systems.  Overall, the proposed research represents a new systems approach to engineering the resilience and sustainability of critical infrastructures in the context of their physical and socio-economic environments.  Simulations for integrated regional-scale models for Greater Phoenix will generate insights into the resilience and sustainability of water and energy infrastructures under a range of environmental scenarios.  These insights are expected to contribute to a national research agenda for integrated urban sustainability science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
