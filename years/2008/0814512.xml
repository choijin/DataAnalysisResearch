<AbstractNarration>This is a project to explore Game-based, Metaphor Enhanced (GaME) design. GaME is a method for applying cognitive science metaphor theory toward the design of computer-mediated learning environments. The process uses structure mapping theory to design videogame worlds aligned with science concepts. This is a rigorous specification procedure for mapping relational structure from targeted concept to game world. GaME design translates a targeted concept into a game system, game play, and game goal. Because the relational structure of the game world is designed as an analog of the targeted conceptual domain, players begin to construct mental models of the targeted concept during interactive gameplay. This makes learning concrete and embodied. Gameplay experiences are designed to guide the learner to discover the relational structure of the targeted concept. This gameplay is a readiness activity for preparing the learner for subsequent instruction. The primary objective of the Cyber-Enabled Teaching and Learning through Game-based, Metaphor Enhanced Learning Objects (CyGaMEs) project is to empirically test this application of cognitive science theory. Aptly designed videogame worlds will provide common experience that prepares educators and their learners to achieve success. CyGaMEs employs cognitive science, informatic sciences, and analysis methodologies to enhance control over what games do: Engage learning through doing, discovery, and inquiry. While each player takes an idiosyncratic route, applied structure mapping theory ensures that gameplay exploration proceeds toward the learning goal.  Selene: A Lunar Creation GaME is the core of CyGaMEs research. This project will: (a) complete, refine and test existing Selene prototype, (b) collect GaME data representing perceptions and learning, (c) develop and refine new methods and metrics for assessing motivation, engagement, and achievement within instructional videogames, and (d) integrate GaME data collection and assessment within a cyber-enabled informatics infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
