<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0804820&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  John B. Etnyre&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this proposal is to better understand the intriguing&lt;br/&gt;nature of contact structures in all (odd) dimensions, with&lt;br/&gt;special attention given to dimension three and to apply contact&lt;br/&gt;geometric techniques to questions in topology. The first main&lt;br/&gt;theme of the proposed research is open book decompositions. The&lt;br/&gt;connection of contact geometry and these specially fibered links&lt;br/&gt;have provided a fount of information concerning contact&lt;br/&gt;structures and low-dimensional topology. As part of this proposal&lt;br/&gt;this fundamental connection will be exploited to define and study&lt;br/&gt;new invariants of contact structures and special knots in them -&lt;br/&gt;specifically, Legendrian and transversal knots. From prior work&lt;br/&gt;it is clear these invariants have subtle connections to the famed&lt;br/&gt;tight vs. overtwisted dichotomy in dimension three and properties&lt;br/&gt;of symplectic fillings of contact structures, which in turn are&lt;br/&gt;crucial to applications to topology. Some of the major outcomes&lt;br/&gt;expected from this part of the project are various classification&lt;br/&gt;results for Legendrian and transversal knots in tight and&lt;br/&gt;overtwisted contact structures and a better understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental process of contact surgery. The project will also&lt;br/&gt;study the connection between contact structures and open books in&lt;br/&gt;high dimensions with the goal of illuminating existence questions&lt;br/&gt;in high dimensions and trying to generalize the notion of&lt;br/&gt;overtwistedness here as well. Similar to the connection with open&lt;br/&gt;books, contact structures are also related to foliations. This&lt;br/&gt;connection has been instrumental in applications of contact&lt;br/&gt;geometry to low-dimensional topology. Many of the outstanding&lt;br/&gt;questions concerning this connection will be explored. A second&lt;br/&gt;main theme of the proposal is the development and analysis of&lt;br/&gt;Legendrian contact homology in higher dimensions. There is a&lt;br/&gt;great deal of beautiful analytic and algebraic structure in this&lt;br/&gt;theory, much of which is yet to be discovered. Moreover, through&lt;br/&gt;the elegant conormal construction one can then use this to define&lt;br/&gt;invariants of manifolds and of their embeddings in Euclidean&lt;br/&gt;space.  These invariants appear to be extremely powerful and will&lt;br/&gt;be thoroughly investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contact structures on manifolds are very natural objects, born&lt;br/&gt;over two centuries ago, as a natural language for geometric&lt;br/&gt;optics, thermodynamics and classical mechanics. Everyday, one&lt;br/&gt;encounters contact structures when parallel parking a car,&lt;br/&gt;skating, or watching the prismatic play of light in a glass of&lt;br/&gt;water. Contact structures have been studied by many&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians and seem to touch on diverse areas of mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and physics, but only recently have they moved into the&lt;br/&gt;foreground of mathematics. This is due to the many remarkable&lt;br/&gt;breakthroughs in contact topology, resulting in a rich and&lt;br/&gt;beautiful theory with many far reaching applications to areas&lt;br/&gt;such as three and four dimensional topology (that is the&lt;br/&gt;structure of space and space- time), string theory and large N&lt;br/&gt;dualities in modern physics, and fluid dynamics. The Principal&lt;br/&gt;Investigator will study the relation between contact geometry and&lt;br/&gt;various topological objects (such as open book decompositions and&lt;br/&gt;foliations). In addition he will develop analytic and algebraic&lt;br/&gt;tools for studying contact structures in high dimensions. As a&lt;br/&gt;whole it is expected that at the conclusion of this project we&lt;br/&gt;will have a much better understanding of contact structures in&lt;br/&gt;all dimensions and see many more surprising implications for low-&lt;br/&gt;dimensional manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Contact structures on manifolds are very natural objects, born over two centuries ago, as a natural language for geometric optics, thermodynamics and classical mechanics. Everyday, one encounters contact structures when parallel parking a car, skating, or watching the prismatic play of light in a glass of water. Contact structures have been studied by many mathematicians and seem to touch on diverse areas of mathematics and physics, but only recently have they moved into the foreground of mathematics. This is due to the many remarkable breakthroughs in contact topology, resulting in a rich and beautiful theory with many far reaching applications to areas such as three and four dimensional topology (that is the structure of space and space- time), string theory and large N dualities in modern physics, and fluid dynamics.   Intellectual merit: Two basic questions about contact structures are (1) on what spaces do they exist? and (2) how many structures are there on a given space?  This grant help support the PI's answer to the first question in dimension 5: If a manifold has an almost contact structure (this is an obvious and easily checkable necessary condition to have a contact structure) then the manifold admits a contact structure (homotopic to the given almost contact structure).  This is the first complete existence result in dimensions above 3.   In relation to the second question the grant helped the PI prove several results. First in higher dimensions he showed how to take a given contact structure and create a new one (that can frequently be shown to be different).   In dimension 3 trying to understand contact structures frequently comes down to understanding various knots within them, in particular in studying Legendrian and transverse knots. The PI classified Legendrian and transverse knots in many knot types and also generalized much of the "standard machinery" from standard (that is null-homologous) knots to rationally null-homologous knots. The PI also studied various constructions of contact structures based on knots, that is Legendrian and transverse surgery. He showed that these two surgery operations are related but not the same and gave examples where and nice transverse surgery yields a manifold with an overtwisted contact structure.  Finally the PI had several results about the relation between open book decompositions and contact structures.   The PI also developed relations between Riemannian geometry (a generalization of standard geometry) and contact structures. He was able to show how to use curvature properties in Riemannian geometry to illuminate properties of a contact structure.   The PI also helped to further develop contact homology and knot contact homology. These are sophisticated analytic tools used to study contact structures, Legendrian knots and ordinary knots. Specifically he showed that knot contact homology has a combinatorial interpretation that is equivalent to Ng's knot invariants. He also augmented knot contact homology to create new and effective invariant of transverse knots.   The grant supported several other results but the above indicates the highlights of the work. Moreover must of the work mentioned above was collaborative (see list of publications).   Broader Impacts: The PI supervised the PhD thesis of 5 students while supported by this grant. He also advised 2 more students that should finish the PhD thesis within a year or two.   The PI became the graduate director for the School of Mathematics at Georgia Tech in the fourth year of this grant and in that capacity has helped mentor dozens of graduate students.  The PI also ran three seminars at Georgia Tech: a research seminar, a working graduate seminar, and a graduate student seminar (that was co-organized by the students themselves).  The PI has been a co-organizer for 15 conferences in the past 5 years (span of this grant), including regional, national and international conferences. He has also co-organized the year l...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
