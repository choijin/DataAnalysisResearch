<AbstractNarration>Proposal: CCF- 0845716&lt;br/&gt;Title: CAREER: Persistence Theories for Computational Topology&lt;br/&gt;PI: Zomorodian, Afra&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Dartmouth College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Data is often in the form of a set of points, sampled from some underlying original space.  For example, a computer representation of a three-dimensional object is usually constructed from a set of points sampled from its surface using a 3D laser scanner.  Another example is the set of snapshots from the simulated trajectory of a folding protein, a four-dimensional point set.  Given any set of points, topological analysis tries to recover how the original space was connected.  As such, topological analysis is a significant first step in understanding data, discovering its global structure.  Due to its fundamental nature, topological analysis has applications in diverse disciplines, such as shape description, terrain analysis, sensor networks, and dynamical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on the theoretical and algorithmic development of persistence theories.  Intuitively, persistence is the technique of identifying features by analyzing geometric histories of data.  The key notion is that features persist through history while noise is short-lived.  Currently, there exists a persistence theory only for one class of data: the theory of persistent homology for static point cloud data.  This aim of this research is to develop persistence theories for other major classes of data that arise in the practice of computational topology, such as parameterized data, dynamic data, and data in diagrams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Topological Persistence gives a rigorous way to define and compute shapes from samples.  It is best illustrated with an engineering example from computer aided design: Scanning a mechanical part gives isolated points that need to be connected to make the underlying shape of the part. One may want to think of the points as blobs of a given radius to see how they connect. Make the radius too large, however, and you see only one big blob; too small and not everything connects. Topological Persistence maps out at how the connections, holes, and cavities form and vanish as the radius grows, and reveals the right resolution to study the shape of the samples.     This project developed the mathematics and algorithms for multidimensional persistence: e.g., if you know where the scanner was, you could represent points as disks with two parameters -- the radius in two directions, and a smaller thickness in a third direction, toward the scanner.  The principle investigator (PI) with his students and collaborators designed and implemented a number of algorithms for computing simplicial complexes (an underlying framework for topological persistence) in arbitrary dimensions and abstract spaces. Since these complexes can become large, the project developed new techniques to work with only a relevant subset of the simplices.   The underlying mathematical techniques apply broadly, in what is increasingly called Topological Data Analysis, and are used in science (from molecular biology to geological exploration), healthcare, and finance. The PI in particular looked at protein structure and language transcription. Several students were trained in this new area of data analytics, and the PI spent part of his time at Sandia National Labs, collaborating with data scientists there. The PIÃ†s books on computational topology have also help disseminate these new techniques.       Last Modified: 02/22/2016       Submitted by: Afra Zomorodian]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
