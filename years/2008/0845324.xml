<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vast majority of filamentous fungi propagate clonally through the formation of asexual spores (conidia).  To produce conidia, fungi must undergo a defined program of morphological development, which presumably requires the coordinated efforts of many individual genes and signal transduction pathways.  Remarkably, the genetic underpinnings of asexual development are poorly understood in filamentous fungi.  The scientific objective of this project is to identify and characterize genes critical for asexual reproduction in Fusarium graminearum, a fungal plant pathogen with global significance due to its ability to cause devastating diseases of cereal crops followed by contamination with harmful mycotoxins.  The extensive genomic resources available for this organism coupled with its tractability have made experiments designed to investigate poorly understood mechanisms a realistic and compelling choice for integration into undergraduate education.  Advances in genomic tools have permitted analysis of gene expression at the whole-genome level.  Instituting a fungal genomics program at Coker College will strengthen existing collaborations and foster the continued development of new partnerships.  This project will provide students at Coker College the opportunity to (1) Develop innovative screens to identify developmental mutants of F. graminearum, (2) Characterize identified mutants at the molecular level, (3) Apply comparative genomics tools to identify potential orthologs of target genes in other organisms, and (4) Design experiments to validate the involvement of genes identified that impact asexual development in filamentous fungi.  To better understand the genes affected in the mutants identified, RNA will be isolated and used to interrogate the F. graminearum Affymetrix GeneChip. Students at Coker will compile a comprehensive data set for understanding gene expression during asexual development and compare gene expression patterns between developmental mutants identified to control strains.  Inference from gene expression data may lead to the discovery of specific genes involved in regulating developmental pathways controlling fungal development.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The long-term goal of this project is to develop a research program in fungal genomics built on undergraduate participation.  To reach this goal, extensive collaborations will be formed with faculty at research-intensive institutions that will serve to enhance educational experiences for Coker College students and to increase research output.  Independent laboratory research is essential for students aspiring to become scientists, medical doctors and science educators.  The research project developed at Coker College focuses on gene discovery in filamentous fungi, with particular emphasis on elucidating the genetic mechanisms controlling development of important plant pathogens.  The emergence of multiple fungal model systems combined with recent advances in fungal genomics has greatly enhanced the feasibility and benefits of incorporating these organisms into undergraduate research programs.  Participation in research stimulates enthusiasm for science in undergraduates, and provides them a foundation of knowledge and techniques for future careers in research and education.  This project will forge new roles for undergraduate involvement in research while tearing down barriers that inhibit collaborations between undergraduate institutions and major research universities.  Achievement of research goals will involve an innovative approach to mentor undergraduate students undertaking independent projects.  To this end, a multi-institutional mentorship program will be developed involving a team of faculty members formed to guide each student's research project.  A logical application of the technology and coordination required to facilitate the mentorship program involves implementing a guest lecture component to the curriculum at Coker College.  Collaborators from research institutions with specific expertise in various disciplines of molecular biology, biochemistry, genomics, and host-parasite interactions will be scheduled to speak on a relevant topic and transmitted to the Coker classroom through a video-conferencing platform.  The project will enhance the biology curriculum at Coker College, make research experiences available to students who would not otherwise have the opportunity, and provide expanded opportunities for undergraduate students to gain valuable experience working with graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and faculty members at collaborating institutions.</AbstractNarration>
