<AbstractNarration>Copper is an essential cofactor for plant growth due to its essential role in photosynthesis. When copper uptake is not sufficient, plants use a combination of three strategies to adjust: Plants modify their physiology to reduce their need for copper, they attempt to increase copper uptake, and they prioritize delivery of copper to the most essential proteins, especially those that function in photosynthesis. The team has already discovered key copper-transporter molecules and has found that a class of small RNA molecules called microRNAs function in the regulation of the use of copper. In this project the investigators aim to characterize how the components that were identified work together in order to adjust to impending copper deficiency. For this project a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches will be used in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The project will likely reveal important novel mechanisms by which organisms adjust to micro-nutrient deficiency. Copper deficiency affects crop yield and biomass production, which has an impact on the possibility to make biofuels. Deficiency also affects the nutritional value of edible plant parts. Therefore the project has relevance to the well being of humans. The project will train graduate students as well as undergraduates and post-doctoral researchers and will involve national and international collaborations. Many of the discoveries in biochemistry that have led to improvements in human health and well being have arisen from research in the area of plant science. In order to raise awareness of the importance of basic plant science, the research team will organize workshops aimed primarily at teachers and local farmers around the themes of nutrition and plants, photosynthesis and biofuels and plant research from genomics to ecophysiology.</AbstractNarration>

The results of these studies were disseminated by publication in leading scientific journals and by presentations at international meetings. Seeds of produced plant lines have been sent to the ABRC seed collection for use by the plant science community. In the context of this project the PI has developed a graduate course in Plant Metabolism (with emphasis on photosynthesis), which includes practical - in the lab - training in measuring photosynthesis parameters (given in 2008 and 2010 and again in 2012, total enrollment of 22 students).
