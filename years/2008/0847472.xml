<AbstractNarration>The study seeks to test the hypothesis that the land surface feedback is an important modulator of the heavy rains and convection climatology over the Indian monsoon region; and that the land use change has significantly contributed to the changes in the heavy rainfall climatology over the Indian monsoon region in recent decades. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will address the following outstanding questions: (i) What is the impact of land surface processes on convection and heavy rainfall over the Indian monsoon region? (ii) Is there a causal control of local land surface feedback on the Indian monsoon heavy rainfall climatology?, and,  What aspects of this land use feedback can be detected from current observations, models, and reanalysis products? These questions seek to investigate if the impact of land surface processes can be statistically detected from multidecadal analysis and observations; and what are the mechanisms by which land surface affects regional convection and heavy rains over the Indian monsoon region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using multidecadal in situ and remote sensed observations, and results from land data assimilation system and coupled land atmosphere models, this project will yield an improved definition, attribution and prediction of the Indian Monsoon rainfall changes. It will also improve the understanding of the mechanisms of monsoonal convective processes and its predictability, including the impacts of land use land cover change and land surface variability. This will enable knowledge that is transformative to weather and climate models and helps develop a more complete understanding of the climate change processes over the Indian monsoon region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a broader impact, using the research findings, educational material will be developed for general public, undergraduates, and advanced graduate students. The research will directly contribute towards the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Working with middle school teachers, project findings will be used to develop middle school classroom monsoon activities. These activities will be transformed to a media content website, as well as in 4H handbooks, state fair activities, and for visualization and student activities digital libraries. Results of this work will be actively disseminated through participation at professional annual meetings and conferences, and in peer-reviewed journals, and popular media. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Landuse landcover change is the other global change underway in an era of greenhouse gas driven climate change. The effects associated with&nbsp;land surface&nbsp;changes are manifested as a response to population growth and economic changes and noted through physical changes such as urbanization, and agricultural intensification. There are also natural changes associated with the&nbsp;land surface&nbsp;as a complex feedback of the hydrological cycles and associated water storage, soil moisture and soil temperature as well as vegetation phenology. Each of these changes has an impact on surface energy balance, and surface hydrology. These impacts are relatively well understood and documented for local scales but understanding the feedbacks on the regional climate and the detection of landcover feedbacks within climatic datasets has been a challenge. One of the notable and enduring contributions of this project has been establishing the role of land surface feedback as a detectable and important component of the monsoon system. Results have shown that the&nbsp;land use&nbsp;impact such as agriculture and urbanization can be detected in the monsoon rainfall climatology especially in terms of changes to the extreme rainfall patterns such as droughts and heavy rain events. Another important finding was related to the role of landfalling tropical cyclones and their rainfall&nbsp;potential and&nbsp;sustenance&nbsp;post-landfall. It was found that if the land is wetter before the tropical system makes landfall the systems sustains over land and persists for a longer period causing widespread rains. On the other hand, if the land is drier the tropical system stalls and dies shortly&nbsp;after landfall; however before it dies there is intense rain. These features were detected and analyzed in rainfall climatology. The associated processes by which these changes are occurring&nbsp;were diagnosed and the mechanism presented for inclusion in prediction models. Using these findings, the models that are typically used for simulating the regional meteorological patterns were modified to include detailed&nbsp;land surface representation. It was shown that including the land surface feedbacks such as detailed soil moisture/ temperature or agriculture and urbanization in the models significantly improves the ability to simulate the rainfall structure and pattern. This finding has notable implication for predicting future high impact weather and climate patterns and indeed are broadly transferable to other parts of the globe. These research findings have also been translated into education modules, training material and series of student research topics resulting in peer-reviewed&nbsp;publications in high impact journals, theses, and dissertations. The findings have also been widely communicated to the broader community via media releases, and interactions with different operational and policy groups. The improved models, datasets, techniques for assimilating different datasets to improve heavy rainfall predictions, publications, education material, training and education opportunities for researchers, a rich network of collaborations and improved scientific understanding is an enduring legacy and outcome of this project.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/16/2018<br>      Modified by: Dev&nbsp;Niyogi</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/0847472/0847472_10027109_1531757539837_scirep-fig-urbanmumbai--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/0847472/0847472_10027109_1531757539837_scirep-fig-urbanmumbai--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Change in rainfall characteristics due to urbanization"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/0847472/0847472_10027109_1531757539837_scirep-fig-urbanmumbai--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Change in rainfall characteristics due to urbanization"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematic of urban impacts on the spatial variability of precipitation over a city is presented in Fig (a).
