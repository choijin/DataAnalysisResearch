<AbstractNarration>The Purdue Center for Faculty Success (PCFS) will provide targeted research, programs and University-level coordination to increase the number of minority women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty positions; improve the success of all women STEM faculty; and engage all faculty in transforming the institution. The PCFS will combine NSF and institutional support to undertake research on the applicability of specific theoretical models in the Purdue environment, develop programs informed by these theoretical models and that focus on gaps in our current portfolio of initiatives, and provide formative assessment and comprehensive evaluation of programmatic impacts. University leaders and policymakers, including Purdue President and ADVANCE PI France CÃ³rdova, will use PCFS results as compelling evidence to sustain and advance institutional transformation and implement policy that will impact the Purdue STEM community and beyond. Our vision is to accelerate institutional transformation through a highly visible infrastructure that offers innovative campus-wide coordination and collaboration for initiatives such as: an innovative and prestigious Presidential ADVANCE Advocate position focused on increasing the diversity of the pool of STEM faculty candidates; enhancing the role of Purdue's ethnic cultural centers in faculty support; adapting ADVANCE best practice STRIDE and WISELI "train the trainer" workshops; mentoring cohorts of junior faculty for research and career development; providing leadership mentoring for associate and full professors; transforming the entire faculty, including majority faculty; developing Diversity Forum toolkits; and initiating Diversity Catalyst and Leader Workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits. Institutional ethnography is a critical method with which to approach understanding the experience of marginalized participants, and provides a new approach to enrich ADVANCE research on STEM women faculty, in particular underrepresented minority women. PCFS efforts will not only advance understanding of the applicability of pipeline and chilly climate models that ground so many "women in science" initiatives but will explore through institutional ethnography the applicability of proposed new models that integrate "boundary" metaphor approaches for exploring women's underrepresentation. Thus PCFS research will generate new knowledge and advance theoretical frameworks that will be of interest to theorists and ADVANCE programs across the nation. The Purdue ADVANCE Advocate and cultural center efforts aimed at enhancing minority women STEM faculty recruiting will be assessed for new insights into enhancing minority faculty recruitment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Improved understanding of the career pathways of women STEM faculty at Purdue, in combination with the assessments of the effectiveness of novel programs, will result in a rigorously tested, explicitly articulated suite of programs that other institutions can adapt to their own campuses. Innovative PCFS efforts to recruit minority women STEM faculty will help address a particularly persistent national STEM challenge, and other PCFS initiatives will increase participation of women in the STEM faculty ranks and in leadership positions. This will have an immediate positive impact on STEM undergraduate and graduate women at Purdue who may contemplate a potential career in academia and potentially on all individuals who are interested in science and engineering careers. PCFS includes Research Team students at the graduate and post-doctoral level and junior faculty in all programmatic initiatives and thus will support and encourage early-career advancement. Through novel partnerships with our ethnic cultural centers, PCFS will broaden participation across campus in the recruitment and support of faculty from underrepresented groups. The transformation of the entire faculty, including majority faculty, by PCFS will provide new approaches to sustain institutional support for faculty success. In addition to publications in leading journals and presentations at national and international research conferences, Purdue will disseminate a PCFS-developed toolkit for Diversity Forums and will host a national conference focused on ADVANCE theoretical frameworks as drivers for institutional change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2008 Purdue University received a $3.9 million Institutional Transformation Cooperative Agreement award from the National Science Foundation NSF ADVANCE Program for its project Purdue Center for Faculty Success.   The specific goals of the project were: 1) to increase the number of STEM tenure-track women of color on the faculty, 2) increase the numbers and success of all female STEM tenure-track faculty and 3) to engage the majority in the institutional transformation primarily through diversity education.  The overarching goal of the project was to transform Purdue University to create a more diverse science and engineering workforce.  The vehicle for change was the newly created ADVANCE-Purdue Center for Faculty Success.  With continued attention, accountability and enhancements to efforts started during NSF funding, the center will continue to build capacity and be a valuable resource toward faculty development and institutional awareness at Purdue.  The work of the center addresses the systematic institutional barriers that undermine the success of women STEM tenure track faculty.   Our work is yielding positive results in several areas.  The number of women of color STEM faculty has doubled and many are progressing through the ranks. More than 30% of the faculty participated in Faculty Search Committee Workshops offered by the ADVANCE/Office of Ethics and Compliance and, as a result, best practices are utilized in a majority of the faculty searches.  As of 2013, all faculty search committee chairs are required to participate in the training and as of 2015, all search committee members are required to attend. Majority faculty serve as advocates, allies and sponsors for female and under-represented faculty. The recognition of the value and benefits of diversifying the faculty are widely recognized. Enhanced faculty development programs are now in place for newly hired faculty, more senior faculty and department heads.   Workshops on faculty mentoring and best hiring practices developed by this project are now used across campus and have been disseminated to other universities and are key components of other recently funded NSF and foundation grants.  Infrastructure is now in place that will support the continuation of the most successful elements of the ADVANCE-Purdue project. The Center for Faculty Success will be sustained as a faculty-led center that will work on both the continued institutional changes needed to recruit, retain and advance women in both academic STEM disciplines and all academic disciplines.  In addition funding for women of color faculty and an additional position (separate from the Vice-Provost for Faculty) have been established thus ensuring the Provost?s attention to diversity and promotion of women.  Policies, procedures and best practices with an emphasis on gender are important outcomes of this NSF-funded project.  Three new provost policies ensure fair and unbiased evaluation of all faculty position candidates and ensure that individuals hired into university leadership positions understand and have experience with diversity issues.  In addition, Purdue University implemented processes and procedures for collection and analysis of university-wide faculty hiring and retention data. These data will now be uniform, complete and accessible for analysis.  Contribution to the scholarship of barriers to success for women scientists, especially women of color, is a major success of this project. Although over the past 30 years, U.S. women have earned PhDs in STEM fields at increasing rates and increasingly make up a larger portion of the STEM faculty, women of color make up less than 5% of the STEM PhDs and Native women less than 1%.  Insights into the reasons why are extremely limited.  Our NSF ADVANCE-funded research is making significant contributions to understanding the career paths of Native American women. These more complete, data-driven patterns of career trajectories of STEM women of color at Purdue will lead to greater success with recruitment and ultimately retention. Building community for women and women of color has proven beneficial and will be continued.  Work on this project has set in motion the deep and pervasive adjustments to institutional policies, procedures, processes and practices at Purdue University that will ensure that all STEM faculty, particularly women and women of color will be represented in numbers equal to or higher than parity with pools from which they are welcomed and will create supportive and inclusive climates/ departments.  In addition, resultant university, regional and national collaborations extend and will enhance the impact of the work.
