<AbstractNarration>The NSF Florida Advanced Technological Education (FLATE) Center is a state wide ATE Regional Center for Manufacturing Education. Goals for the 3 year renewal period are to (a) identify and secure state and/or other funds for operations; (b) implement a statewide unified education system that positions manufacturing education as a convergent curriculum to optimize technician preparation in manufacturing and its enabling technologies; (c) provide an effective outreach platform for Florida's high schools, community colleges, industry, and legislature to access information related to the requirements for and impact of manufacturing education; and, (d) present professional development opportunities for technical faculty to develop, refine, or certify their knowledge base within manufacturing and/or its related enabling technologies and educational pedagogies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Outreach projects are having a systemic impact on manufacturing and its enabling technology education by merging educational content into the "Made in Florida" awareness campaign and connecting classroom activities directly with instructional visits to actual manufacturing facilities. Curriculum projects have a systemic impact on manufacturing education by implementing an articulation pathway that allows high school students to transfer 15 credit hours toward the A.S. Degree. They provide clear statewide defined skill sets as a reference for prospective students of the expectations of prospective employers. The curriculum aligns manufacturing and engineering technology degrees to the changing needs of industry and provides a viable statewide mechanism for industry feedback on the impact of A.S. degrees. FLATE is also providing professional development opportunities for faculty responsible for manufacturing education in secondary, post secondary, and community college environments; integrating Manufacturing Skills Standards Council (MSSC) skills into high school and community college curriculum; and increasing the statewide impact of the Florida Technology Forum by providing industry focused short courses for technology faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: FLATE is poised to demonstrate transportable models that (1) help Florida's Department of Education filter its total set of technical course, certificate, and degree program frameworks; (2) encourage first time college and minority students to continue post secondary education by streamlining student access to manufacturing and related degrees; (3) institutionalize a platform for best practice curriculum dissemination; (4) increase the number of teachers and students that are MSSC nationally certified; (5) increase the awareness in all parts of the state that manufacturing careers represent a critical need in Florida; (6) establish a statewide collaborative "manufacturing community" that partners industry, government, and academic entities; (7) provide the public with easy access to technical education information to support new Florida mandated career exploration middle school curriculum component; (8) increase the number of faculty that can integrate the teaching of industry mandated soft skills into their current curriculum; (9) align Florida's manufacturing related technical degrees to industries' changing needs; (10) demonstrate an effective curriculum management plan for Florida's other AS/AAS degrees; (11) support projects that multiple industry partners can financially support because they are recognized as industry-focused mutually beneficial activities; (12) partner industry directly with educational institutions in their region; and (13) make manufacturers statewide aware of the benefits of interacting with students during "Made in Florida" supported factory tours.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Engineering Technology (ET) Degree Program   FLATE, the Florida Advanced Technological Education Center, www.fl-ate.org represents NSF-ATE as an ATE Regional Center of Excellence for advanced technological education that supports manufacturing and its related technology sectors.  FLATE worked in partnership with the Florida Department of Education, Workforce Florida, and FloridaÆs manufacturers statewide to reconstruct  the Engineering Technology (ET) A.S. degree program, integrating the national Manufacturing Skill Standards Council (MSSC) certification as an articulated component of the A.S. ET degree,  and providing 15 college credit hours for all holders of a current MSSC credential.

This comprehensive, full-service support system helps to ensure that the academic programs remain robust into the future.  Partnerships with Industry  FLATEÆs focus on partnership building between schools and industry partners helps to build the student pipeline for advanced technology college and careers. FLATE worked directly with the then fledgling Manufacturers Association of Florida to craft their education mission to include support of a strong integrated K-14 manufacturing focused education system including its support for the now well established CAPE (Career and Professional Education) academy structure in the Florida public school system, as well as support and affirmation of the MSSC credentialÆs value.

FLATEÆs "Made in Florida" Tours to advanced manufacturing facilities have grown to include "Industry Days" and a variety of tour models, providing over 100 tours to over 2,000 students over the last 5 years.   Educating Educators: Professional Development  FLATE professional development workshops provide STEM educators with technical training to develop, refine, and/or certify their knowledge base within manufacturing and/or its enabling technologies. FLATEÆs research has noted the lack of curriculum available in K-12 for technology and engineering curriculum (the "T &amp; E" side of sTEm), and has provided free, online curriculum to help educators fill this gap.
