    <AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multiuser program (CRIF:MU), the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer capable of measurements on solids and solutions. The spectrometer will improve the diverse research capabilities at Columbia which spans the range from applying synthetic chemistry methods to nano-science problems, to developing new solid-state NMR methods for studying proteins, to investigating binding and catalysis in aqueous solutions with enzyme mimics based on polymers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most broadly used tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances and to provide information on the arrangement and connectivity of atoms in molecules. Dynamical information is obtained providing insight on the motions of molecules. This cyber-enabled NMR will provide a remote access interface that will enhance many Columbia programs that promote teaching and learning of undergraduates and high school teachers and students as well as assist research activities of users from other neighboring campuses. This cyber enabled remote access is projected to comprise about one third of the total instrument usage.</AbstractNarration>
