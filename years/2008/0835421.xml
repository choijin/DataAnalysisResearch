<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  This research will advance understanding of the potential role of aerosol pollution in modifying wintertime orographic precipitation. A key issue to be addressed is how the influence of aerosol pollution upon clouds may be altered by various synoptic weather regimes, cloud types, and amounts of supercooled water within these clouds. Based on previous modeling results, it is anticipated that clouds with higher amounts of supercooled water (such as those typically found over the San Juan Mountains of Colorado) are more susceptible to impacts by aerosol pollution. The modulation of this potential response will be addressed both temporally via time-series measurements at the Storm Peak Laboratory (SPL) and spatially through more distributed measurements over the San Juan Mountains of Colorado and through model simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential for Transformative Research:  This investigation has the potential to revise traditional theories of aerosol-induced impacts on wintertime orographic precipitation. Prior work has suggested that increased pollution aerosol concentrations lead to a significant reduction in precipitation falling from orographic clouds. Further studies by the Principal Investigators conducted in the Park Range mountains of Colorado suggest that aerosol pollution may also redistribute orographic precipitation and subsequent runoff among adjacent river basins. In this view, some reduction of total precipitation may occur but aerosol-induced shifts in the location of precipitation predominate. The relative contributions of these two potential influences will be further explored in this new study. Consideration of longer time periods (i.e., a full winter season) should lead to more robust conclusions, as well as an improved regional climatology of pollution aerosol influences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  This work has significant demographic and economic implications. If pollution aerosols are indeed systematically reducing mountain snowfall, increased development across the western U.S. will in turn reduce available snowpack-derived water resources needed to sustain such population growth and require strategies to minimize such impacts. Education and outreach activities at SPL during the field component of this study will include a three-day graduate level mesoscale modeling class led by the Principal Investigator, a week-long graduate/undergraduate class in mountain meteorology led by a University of Wisconsin collaborator, and. a graduate field meteorology class offered through the Desert Research Institute focusing on SPL's unique observational capabilities. The location of the laboratory at the summit of the Steamboat Ski Resort also affords considerable public access to its full range of activities, and the Principal Investigators supported under this grant will conduct open houses for the public and create a more permanent outdoor display describing work being done under this project.</AbstractNarration>

In this project the potential impacts of aerosol pollution on wintertime orographic precipitation is investigated. The research focuses on the Colorado Rocky Mountain region where wintertime orographic precipitation is a major contributor to water resources in the Colorado River Basin(CRB).     Measurements were made at two specific surface sites, and with the NSF-supported University of Wyoming King Air aircraft, of aerosol that leads to cloud formation called cloud condensation nuclei(CCN).

This model includes both the variation of aerosol concentrations as well as their chemical activity in forming droplets. For the most part it was found that the aerosols in the region were characteristic of a rural continental environment with CCN number concentrations that varied slowly in time, and little in space along the Western Slope. However, localized episodes of high CCN concentrations were found.  The mass-weighted altitude of snow formation was inferred from Oxygen isotopic ratios in cloud water and snow.  It was found that the mass-weighted altitude of snow formation did not exceed 300 m above the Storm Peak Observatory(SPL). Whereas the mass-weighted altitude of snow growth by vapor deposition alone was no higher than 900 m above SPL.  Sixty-day long simulations of the impacts of pollution aerosol during the peak of wintertime precipitation over Colorado were performed for four different winter seasons. Overall the impacts of pollution aerosol on total precipitation over the Rocky Mountain region is quite small. However, it was found that an increase in aerosol results in lighter snow particles with slower fall speeds and longer horizontal trajectories. This effect results in a "spillover" of snowfall from the windward slope to the leeward slope of the mountains. The snowfall spillover effect is most evident in the southern and western regions of the San Juan Range of Colorado where high-moisture-laden storms are more prevalent.  A consequence of this spill-over effect is that the CRB is a big loser of  total precipitation because precipitation is moved downwind into water basins that feed river basins on the east side of the Rocky mountains.  This effect varies greatly from season to season depending on the amount of moisture flowing into the Colorado mountains.   Further modeling studies revealed that the reason aerosol pollution has a small impact on total precipitation is that suppression of riming growth of ice particles by pollution is countered by an enhancement of vapor growth of snow particles.  Vertically pointing Ka-band radar measurements made at both the Storm Peak Lab and a valley site near Steamboat Springs were analyzed in conjunction with a profiling radiometer and  situ measurements to provide observational context and information on storm structure variability that complements the associated modeling studies. Stable conditions predominated during snowfall events with the exception of 6 of the 22 snowfall events which had associated synoptic scale upper-level dry air intrusions (400 mb). Unstable conditions with convective precipitation structures and heavier snowfall occurred concurrent with and immediately after the dry air intrusions.
