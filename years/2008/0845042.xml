<AbstractNarration>Abstract of Proposal 0845042&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Malware Immunization and Forensics Based on Another Sense of Self&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Xinyuan Wang, George Mason University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite recent advances in malware defense, computer malwares&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., virus, worm, botnets, rootkit, spyware) continue to pose&lt;br/&gt;serious threats to all computers and networks. Besides being more&lt;br/&gt;damaging, modern malwares (e.g., blue pill, agobot) are becoming &lt;br/&gt;increasingly stealthy and evasive. This has made it increasingly &lt;br/&gt;difficult to protect our computer systems and networks from malwares &lt;br/&gt;and ensure the trustworthiness of our mission critical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our natural immune systems are very effective in protecting our &lt;br/&gt;body from intrusions by (almost endless) variations of pathogens. &lt;br/&gt;Our immunities depend on the ability to distinguish our own cells &lt;br/&gt;(i.e., "self") from all others (i.e., "non-self"). Inspired by the &lt;br/&gt;self-nonself discrimination in the natural immune systems, this &lt;br/&gt;research explores a new direction in building artificial malware &lt;br/&gt;immunization and malware forensics capabilities based on "another &lt;br/&gt;sense of self", which is essentially a unique mark to be assigned &lt;br/&gt;to the programs to be protected. Based on such an actively assigned &lt;br/&gt;"another sense of self", the "immunized" program is able to &lt;br/&gt;detect application level malwares effectively and efficiently. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, the actively assigned "another sense of self" enables&lt;br/&gt;new malware forensics capabilities that were not possible before.&lt;br/&gt;Since the artificial malware immunization technique does not require &lt;br/&gt;any specific knowledge of the malwares, it has the potential to be &lt;br/&gt;effective against new and previously unknown malwares. The new &lt;br/&gt;artificial malware immunization techniques and tools to be developed &lt;br/&gt;could automatically make many applications (e.g., Web server) immune &lt;br/&gt;to many malwares and thus greatly improve the trustworthiness of &lt;br/&gt;computer systems.</AbstractNarration>
