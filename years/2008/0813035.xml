<AbstractNarration>This research will investigate the ecology of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), an emerging disease on three continents and examine the effects of species diversity on disease transmission. HGA is caused by a rickettsial bacterium, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, that is transmitted from host to host through the bite of an infected ixodid tick. The research will include a characterization of reservoir competence of wildlife hosts and determine whether host reservoir competence is a function of coinfection with the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. The researchers will build and test models to predict how risk of human exposure to HGA will vary with changes in the diversity and species composition of host communities. They also will experimentally evaluate specific mechanisms underlying effects of variable diversity on risk by manipulating key hosts in natural communities. Finally, they will educate local health-care providers about this emerging disease and expand the HGA surveillance capabilities of the local (Dutchess County, NY) health department. The enhanced surveillance data will be used to test for spatial correlations between ecological risk and human incidence. The project will train more than 40 undergraduates and provide for them an opportunity to conduct independent research. Understanding disease transmission dynamics is crucial for the appropriate management of communities and landscapes to reduce the total burden of zoonotic disease.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ About 10-15 years after the emergence of Lyme disease in the United States, another disease transmitted by the same species of tick -- human granulocytic anaplasmosis -- emerged and spread.  Our research explored the prevalence of infection of ticks with the pathogen, Anaplasma phagocytophilum; the distribution of infected ticks in a focal site in southeastern New York State; the proportion of ticks that carry infections with more than one pathogen, and the vertebrate hosts responsible for infecting ticks.  We found that this pathogen is generally found in about 8% of ticks; that it is widespread and sometimes reaches very high prevalence; that it often co-occurs together with the Lyme disease bacterium; and that white-footed mice, chipmunks, and shrews are responsible for transmitting most infections to ticks.  We found that two forms (genetic strains) of Anaplasma can occur in ticks and vertebrate hosts, only one of which is known to cause disease in humans.  This strain is even more closely tied to small mammals and is more widespread and common.    Intellectual Merit: Key aspects of this important emerging pathogen, including its abundance, distribution, host-associations, and dynamics through time, are comparable to the much better-studied Lyme disease system.  Revelation that the same group of small mammals are the best reservoirs for both pathogens suggests commonalities in immunological determinants of "reservoir competence" that arise from a "live-fast-and-die-young" life history.  These same fast-lived species are the ones that thrive in human-disturbed landscapes.  As a result, human disturbance can inadvertantly increase threats to human health through tick borne diseases.  Broader Impacts: Because the same small mammals (especially mice and chipmunks) are the best natural "reservoirs" for the agents of both Lyme disease and anaplasmosis, actions taken to control Lyme disease are highly likely to also reduce risk of exposure to anaplasmosis.  These actions include preserving biodiversity (which reduces the numbers of ticks that feed on small rodents), preserving predator populations, and reducing fragmentation of forested landscapes.
