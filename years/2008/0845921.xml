<AbstractNarration>Pen-based computing has the potential to make a significant improvement in the education of our students in STEM disciplines so as to produce a more skilled technical workforce able to compete in the new global economy. Mathematical sketching, a pen-based interaction paradigm that is providing a new approach to STEM education, is the process of making and exploring dynamic illustrations by associating handwritten mathematics with free-form diagrams. The proposed research will develop new mathematical sketching tools to improve student learning in STEM. High level semantic recognition techniques for understanding mathematical sketches (the combination of handwritten problem description, mathematical expressions, and drawings) will be explored to ensure proper interactive feedback, facilitation of correct cognitive models, and the generation of the most appropriate dynamic visualizations for a given problem. In addition, these techniques will, in part, be used to develop strategies in inferential statics and dynamics, the process of finding appropriate animations when users do not directly specify motion equations in the problem solving process. Given the reliance on recognition-based interaction in mathematical sketching, usability studies will examine how users are affected by recognition feedback and accuracy levels. These studies will provide useful guidelines for ensuring that the mathematical sketching interface is usable by both teacher and student. Two educational studies will also explore how mathematical sketching affects teaching and learning.  This work will advance the state-of-the-art in pen-based UIs through the development of techniques and exploration of user interface design issues for enriching mathematical sketching.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This proposal links research in pen-based UIs with STEM education, a critical application area. Thus, the work has the potential to reach thousands of students each year.  The PI has the opportunity to work on this research in conjunction with the University of Central Florida?s EXCEL Program, an NSF STEP-funded project that helps students succeed in math and science during the first two years of college, where the mathematical sketching paradigm is directly applicable. The PI will give demonstrations and lectures through the Florida High Tech Corridor Council techCAMP program to bring mathematical sketching to teachers and students in African American and Hispanic high schools. The proposed research will be integrated into a graduate-level course on pen-based UIs, thus enhancing the education of tomorrow?s pen-based UI designers and researchers. Finally, undergraduate courses will be taught on human computer interaction (HCI) and design of interactive systems that, together with the graduate course, will be an educational foundation for HCI at UCF.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The system then animates the drawing to inform the user whether they got the problem correct or not.  We use natural language processing on the physics problem itself to help guide the animation. This information then helps to determine which one of a set of custom physics engines should be used to drive a simulation that provides the data necessary to animate the drawing.  We also investigated what scaffolding could be used to help guide the user when they solved the problem incorrectly.  Our second research thrust was to better understand how users perceive sketch recognition-based interfaces in the context of mathematical sketching. Our experiments required the ability to set recognition accuracies so they could be controlled during user studies.  However, existing recognizers do not provide this capability so we developed the Wizard of Oz (WOZ) recognizer.  The WOZ recognizer put a human in the recognition loop so accuracy could be controlled.  Users of the testing application have no knowledge that there is a person behind the scenes controlling the recognition results and this enabled us to run several experiments on how users perceive recognition feedback and accuracy tolerance under different application scenarios. The WOZ recognizer required several different automated components to assist the experimenter in choosing recognition results including an error generation component based on prior recognition results from existing recognizers and an accuracy analyzer to assist in ensuring accuracy targets were met.  A sophisticated UI was also developed to make it easy for the experimenter to monitor userÆs sketches and modify the recognition results.  We believe the WOZ Recognizer is a valuable tool that can be used by the sketch recognition community.  In addition to our main research thrusts, we were able to conduct research in a variety of different areas related to mathematical sketching.  For example, we developed VectorPad, a tool that let users visualize the results of vector computations such as vector addition and cross product.  We developed SetPad which assisted users in solving set proofs by showing accompanying Venn diagrams with handwritten set notation that could be easily manipulated with a touch interface to show the user possible next steps in a proof.  We developed CSTutor, which helped students better understand simple data structures such as linked-lists and binary trees by letting them sketch the data structures and then manipulate them with code.  The executed code manifests itself through dynamic visualization of the sketched drawings.  This work was tested over the course of a year in two semesters of a traditional introductory computer science course and showed positive impacts in learning.  ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
