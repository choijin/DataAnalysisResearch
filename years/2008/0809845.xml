<AbstractNarration>One of the principal goals of modern crystal engineering is the design, synthesis and optimization of new materials with specified function. This research program focuses on the technologically useful properties of ferroelastic and ferroelectric domain switching, in which the&lt;br/&gt;orientations of domains or regions within a crystal can be changed by application of anisotropic stress (ferroelasticity) or electric fields (ferroelectricity). The rational design of such materials (which can act as light gates or memory devices) requires a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of domain switching, a visible, macroscopic phenomenon that is controlled at the molecular, nanoscopic and mesoscopic scales. Building upon earlier work on the molecular determinants of ferroelasticity, this work will focus on mechanistic studies of domain switching in series of ferroelastic and&lt;br/&gt;ferroelectric crystals in which the cooperative, elastic barriers to domain switching and ferroelectric ordering can be optimized and tailored. Because such a large number of closely related structures can be generated and compared, it concentrates on the design, synthesis and mechanistic studies of&lt;br/&gt;series of inclusion compounds, co-crystals and organic salts that exhibit ferroelastic and/or ferroelectric domain switching.&lt;br/&gt;Because of the insights they can provide about the barriers to domain switching, this work will utilize a variety of techniques (e.g., X-ray diffraction, synchrotron white beam X-ray topography, solid state nuclear magnetic resonance, ultrafast videomicroscopy, birefringence mapping) to probe&lt;br/&gt;the phenomenon of "memory effects" or "rubber-like behavior," in which the daughter domain that is generated by stress (or electric field) spontaneously reverts back to the parent orientation. A more thorough understanding of such memory effects will facilitate a targeted and iterative approach to&lt;br/&gt;forming series of ferroelectric crystals with well-defined properties.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Because they will be required to integrate results from various methods and to utilize these results in the design of new materials, this research program will provide a broad-based training for undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students who will pursue careers in materials&lt;br/&gt;chemistry. By integrating numerous experimental results on a series of closely related structures,it should be possible to develop a more fundamental understanding of the factors controlling domain switching and memory effects in a variety of ferroelectric materials. This work will be disseminated&lt;br/&gt;widely in papers and presentations and utilized in graduate-level courses and undergraduate laboratories.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: This research project in crystal engineering and materials science has focused on series of organic crystals that undergo domain reorientation under applied anisotropic stress (ferroelasticity) and electric fields (ferroelectricity).  Most of the work centered on ferroelastic channel inclusion compounds of urea and ferroelastic and ferroelectric inclusion compounds of t-butylcalix[4]arene in which dipolar aromatic guest molecules occupy the molecular cavities afforded by the host molecules.  With the urea inclusion compounds, the host and guest repeats along the channel axis can be either commensurate (stoichiometric) or incommensurate (non-stoichiometric).  In this research project, systematic studies of series of crystals containing different classes of guest molecules (alkanes, alkanones, alkanediones, and diacetoxyalkanes) were used to understand the nature of the ferroelastic (symmetry lowering) phase transition in both classes of materials.  The diffraction patterns of incommensurate systems require superspace crystallography, and we have found that in certain cases, the ferroelastic phase transition generates an extra modulation that increases the dimensionality of the system from four to five.  Although the long-range modulation of these aperiodic systems and the six-fold non-merohedral twinning prohibit full crystal structure determination of the low temperature phases, we have been able to use synchrotron X-ray data to solve the crystal structures of certain commensurate structures, including that of 2,11-dodecanedione/urea, in which there are 12 guest molecules for every 19 repeats of the host helix structure, and eicosane/urea, a commensurate system in which there are two guest repeats for every five repeats of the host helix.  The work on eicosane/urea, in particular, sets the stage for complete structure determination of the low-temperature phases certain incommensurate inclusion compounds.               In an effort to understand the mechanism of crystal growth of supramolecular assemblies such as inclusion compounds, we have conducted extensive high-resolution synchrotron studies of inclusion compounds containing mixtures of monoketones and diketones with the same chain length.  This work has helped us elaborate the details of a crystal growth mechanism in which surface-roughening (and therefore crystal shape) is controlled by the ratio of commensurate to incommensurate regions in the crystal.  This mechanism was further confirmed with crystal structures exhibiting eight-fold screw-like disorder of the guest molecules along the channel axis and with crystals that undergo lock-in phase transitions below room temperature to commensurate phases; in these systems, the incommensurate crystals grown above the phase transitions form needles elongated along their channel axes, whereas crystals grown below the phase transition are flat plates.              Understanding the ferroelectric and ferroelastic behavior of inclusion compounds of t-butylcalix[4]arene has required detailed synchrotron X-ray studies of the host and guest disorder in crystals that can form either centrosymmetric or non-centrosymmetric structures.  In the case of inclusion compounds containing functionalized aromatic guests, the polar ordering and alignment of guest molecules with either anisotropic force or electric fields is controlled by cooperative, intercavity guest-host-guest interactions mediated by the tert-butyl groups of the host molecules.  For certain crystals that are potentially ferroelectric, such cooperative interactions can prevent the parallel alignment of guest molecules in adjacent cavities.  Instead, the t-butyl-mediated interaction gives rise to cavities containing guest molecules that are perpendicular to each other.  With regard to engineering new ferroelectrics, this phenomenon can limit the amount of off-axis dipolar groups that are incorporated into the host cavities and therefore places constraints o...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
