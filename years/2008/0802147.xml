    <AbstractNarration>Middlesex Community College's two-year ATE project focuses on Integrating Nanotechnology and Technician Education into the Curriculum (INTEC) to support workforce development and transfer of students to baccalaureate programs in the sciences and engineering. The project includes an in-depth workforce needs and job skills analysis to determine the regional technical workforce requirements related to nanotechnology and other relevant emerging technologies. In addition, the project includes professional development in nanotechnology for faculty and the development and the revision of curriculum to integrate nanotechnology into current courses in response to the workforce needs analysis. The project is building institutional capacity to provide education and training to support future workforce development related to nanotechnology and other emerging technologies. Other participants in the project include North Shore Community College and universities with extensive nanotechnology research: the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, Northeastern University, and University of Massachusetts, Amherst.</AbstractNarration>
