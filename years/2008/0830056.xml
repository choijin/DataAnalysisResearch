<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to Dr. Gregory Buck of Virginia Commonwealth University for a study of genomic diversity and evolution in the Euglenozoa, a diverse group of microscopic unicellular protists..  The group includes model organisms as well as important human parasites.  The evolutionary relationships of these poorly studied unicellular organisms are not well understood. Euglenozoa are micro-organisms of enormous significance to the environment, the economy, and to public health. One group, the trypanosomatids, which are responsible for human and agricultural diseases, have been extensively studied. However, other members of the phylum have only been loosely characterized, and their taxonomic relationships are very poorly defined.  In this project, the genomes of five exemplar species will be examined in detail, and a smaller set of genes from each of several hundred strategically selected species of Euglenozoa will be also examined and compared for a broad study of the group. The goal is to use state-of-the-art gene sequencing technologies to elucidate the taxonomic and evolutionary relationships of group. Novel strategies of computational biology will be applied to develop new insights into how the diverse feeding and life history traits of these organisms have evolved.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will provide training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate and postdoctoral trainees at Virginia Commonwealth University, the University of Georgia, and Michigan State University.  Students will be recruited for a summer program in bioinformatics and bioengineering to conduct independent research related to this project.  High school teachers and students from underrepresented groups will also participate in the program.  Three of the senior research personnel on the project are Hispanic.  The research on Euglenozoa will be incorporated into several summer workshop programs for high school students, as well as a graduate level course in evolutionary biology.</AbstractNarration>
