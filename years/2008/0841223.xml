<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT FOR THE NSF PROPOSAL GK-12: SUPER-M&lt;br/&gt;PI: MONIQUE CHYBA&lt;br/&gt;DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS, UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The School and University Partnership for Educational Renewal in Mathematics project (SUPER-M) will bring the knowledge and expertise of research mathematicians into K?12 classrooms, making an important contribution to improving school mathematics in Hawaii. The project will provide K?12 students with an enriching learning environment where mathematics is interesting and dynamic. The project will also contribute to the formation of a cadre of highly qualified teachers, bringing new mathematics expertise to schools throughout the State of Hawaii and helping to sustain the program.  Over five years, 38 Fellows will be selected to partner with K?12 schools on Oahu, the Big Island and Maui. Fellows will take a semester long course on ?Issues in K?12 Mathematics Education,? learning about best practices in the design of professional development courses for teachers.  Fellows will design and lead workshops for K?12 teachers arising from their areas of research.  Upon completion of the course, Fellows will partner with a cooperating teacher, creating and leading mathematics activities for K?12 students.  In this way, SUPER-M will provide K?12 students with a solid grounding in mathematics, increasing their opportunities to pursue careers in STEM disciplines.  SUPER-M will serve under-represented populations by placing a special emphasis on recruiting Native Hawaiian and women Fellows. SUPER-M expects to profoundly impact the community at large through special events such as summer camps, public outreach events, and family math days.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The SUPER-M program has a great impact on the Fellows, both as human beings and also as scientists. A significant gain in leadership among our Fellows has been clearly observed. Within a few months in the program, a high level of confidence is instilled in each of them regarding public speaking and mathematical presentations for a broad audience. We strongly believe that by having the Fellows expose their mathematical interests to a larger community outside the world of mathematicians, the program instills in them additional motivation and enthusiasm that translate into successful accomplishments in their studies. The SUPER-M program has helped us recruit high quality students to the math graduate program at the University, many who would probably not have considered coming to Hawai?i. It has been extremely beneficial for our graduate program; when the SUPER-M Fellows academically thrive, they stimulate other students. The retention rate among the SUPER-M Fellows is higher than for traditional graduate students, they also graduate more rapidly.  We found that most schools in Hawaii have a deep lack of mathematical expertise. It is not uncommon to have science teachers teaching mathematics even at a high school level. Our Fellows filled in a large hole at their partner schools by bringing this expertise and assisting the teachers. This has been especially visible at the Hawaiian immersion schools with which we have partnered.  SUPER-M has devoted significant time to developing lessons which incorporate Native Hawaiian culture which are very popular among K-12 teachers.  We have developed a K-12 seminar that proved to play a key role for our fellows. It prepared the Fellows to efficiently and positively impact the K-12 schools. We are now exploring avenues to expand the seminar to a broader audience, our plan is to have this seminar replace the mandatory orientation sessions offered by the University for the graduate students in Mathematics. We found that the K-12 seminar brings more answers and helps our students greater than the general orientation session.   Our main outcomes regarding the outreach is a large demand from the schools and various educational organizations. We started with a few events, and it has snowballed extremely fast. To respond to this demand, many undergraduate and graduate students in the Department of Mathematics, as well as other departments, have volunteered to partner which helped us create an outreach community at our University. We believe that a major outcome is the pleasure that UH students take in this outreach experience. SUPER-M has created very stimulating outreach environments within the University, K-12 institutions, and the general community.  Our success in the community is reflected by the number of groups who reach out to SUPER-M when planning their events to invite us to participate.  The benefits of SUPER-M to our entire state have been very visisble, valued and efforts are made to sustain some of its initiatives. In particular, three additional TAship have been granted to the department of Mathematics by the administration for a period of two years to be dedicated toward outrearch and K-12 teachers. MaTCH, the Hawaii teacher Math circle has been created initially as a leg of SUPER-M and is now in its fourth year of activity and funding.
