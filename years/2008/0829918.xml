<AbstractNarration>Quantum Control of Polar Molecules for Quantum Information and Quantum Computing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum computers promise to revolutionize our ability to perform computation and solve complicated problems. However, quantum computers are difficult to build. It remains unclear what quantum systems will eventually be used for implementation of a ?scalable? quantum computer, which needs to operate on a large number of quantum bits (qubits) in order to outperform classical computers.  This research develops a novel technology using quantum coherent control to produce and manipulate a large number of cold polar molecules. Such polar molecules have many appealing features to be used as qubits.  The investigators use all-optical methods to achieve parallel yet local and individual control of many polar molecules. This work can lead to new approaches toward scalable quantum computing. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in this research in an interdisciplinary team and learn at the forefront of optics and photonics, atomic and molecular physics, and quantum information science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops a novel technology using quantum coherent control in the production and manipulation of cold polar molecules, motivated by potential applications of such polar molecules in quantum information processing and computing.    The investigators combine two powerful techniques in modern molecular physics, photoassociation and phase coherent control, to explore novel methods of quantum control of polar molecules, using an optically-based approach to achieve local yet massively-parallel individual control of both the density and orientation of polar molecules. This work could lead to the development of new protocols and schemes of scalable quantum information processing and computing.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Quantum information processing and computing (QIPC) has become one of the most exciting and active fields of research in emerging information and computation technologies.  QIPC also has the potential to solve complex problems that are intractable with classical computers, for example factorizing large numbers (basis of current encryption schemes). Various different quantum systems have been proposed for physical implementation of quantum computation.  However, progress towards building a practical quantum computer operating on a large number of quantum bits (q-bits) has been very slow and it remains unclear what quantum systems will eventually be used for implementation of a practical quantum computer.  Cold polar molecules have been proposed for use as q-bits in a quantum computer, with many appealing features and potential advantages for enabling scalable and practical quantum computation.  Realizing these potentials requires the ability of creating, manipulating and controlling such molecules and their quantum states.   This research program focuses on a simple polar molecule, LiRb.  With its relatively large electric dipole moment LiRb is a promising candidate for use as a q-bit in potential quantum computing applications, where the dipolar interaction between such dipoles plays an essential role in quantum logic operations.   In this program we have performed systematic laser spectroscopy of LiRb and obtained some of the first experimental measurements of the relevant quantum states of this molecule, and optical transitions between these states. Such data will allow us to understand the structure of this molecule and identify pathways for effective creation of this molecule at ultracold temperature (by photoassociation) and manipulate its quantum states for eventual q-bit operations.  This simple bi-alkali polar molecule has been little explored experimentally previously, so our work is also of fundamental interest for molecular and chemical physics. We have also constructed an apparatus (dual species magneto-optical trap) that has allowed us to trap both Li and Rb atoms and cool them to low temperatures.  Starting from these laser-cooled Li and Rb atoms, we will use photoassociation to assemble them into cold LiRb molecules, and will study various schemes to prepare such cold LiRb polar molecules in the ground state with large dipole moment (most promising for quantum computing).  We have also set up various laser systems that will be used to initiate, manipulate and detect the qubit states based on LiRb.  One of the important ingredients of the technology required to achieve scalable quantum computing is the ability to locally control the q-bits and their interactions.  In our program we are experimentally exploring quantum coherent control in the formation and manipulation of polar molecules, whose dipole moments are used as q-bits. This could lay the physics foundation to develop new approaches for scalable quantum computing and information processing based on polar molecules.   The research results from this program have been disseminated through several papers published in major scientific journals (with more papers in preparation) and many oral or poster presentations in conferences given by the principle investigator as well as graduate students working in this program.  Through this program we have trained several graduate and undergraduate students (both physics and electrical engineering majors) working in frontier research in experimental quantum information science and AMO (atomic, molecular and optical) physics. They also learned various experimental skills such as optics, electronics, vacuum, machining, computational modeling etc. that will benefit them in a broad range of scientific and technological careers. The students have also acquired valuable scientific writing and presentation skills.           Last Modified: 12/12/2011       Submitted by: Yong P Chen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
