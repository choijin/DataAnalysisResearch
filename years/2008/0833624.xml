<AbstractNarration>A pathway to STEM careers and college for inner-city high school students is built around the use of cutting-edge geospatial and computer modeling to investigate pressing urban ecological problems in their neighborhood.  The work in a previous ITEST grant that demonstrated an increase in student self-efficacy and interest in science is expanded to integrate career discernment, college preparation, and engagement with innovative technologies.  With a project team that includes a counseling psychologist, an educational researcher, a science educator, an urban ecologist, an environmental lawyer and a cross-cultural educator, the project designs an innovative program and conducts research on both the design of the program and on student career discernment.  The students meet on selected Saturdays and after school during the school year. They receive a stipend to attend a three week summer program.  Students remain in the program for three years working on projects of increasing sophistication in urban ecology.  Parents and care givers are integrated into the program by having them engage in similar activities to understand the nature of STEM related careers.  Partnerships with the College Bound program and with two industries ensure sustainability and that students understand the workplace and have access to innovative technologies.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

We have also learned that many youth upon entering college often struggle during their first and second year (see next section).

Follow-up interviews revealed that the youth found that the way science was taught was not what they envisioned when they declared a STEM major (Zhang &amp; Barnett, 2014). In fact, they found their college-level STEM courses to be very competitive with an unwelcoming "weed-out" culture (Zhang &amp; Barnett, 2014).   In total over the life of the grant we had 60 participants per year with 20-25 new participants per year.  All the participants were students from low-income backgrounds and all students were youth of color.   Locally, this work resulted in a $25 million development through a partnership with the Madison Park Develompent Corporation as the youth in our program had developed the expertise to use geospatial computer modeling to evaluate the economic and ecological impacts of a proposed development that Madison Park Community Development Coporation was proposing.  The analysis by the youth was a key factor in the development being approved by the city.   This work also resulted in one of the more detailed food desert analyses for the city of Boston.  This work was presented to the director of urban agriculture of the city of Boston and has resulted in the expansion of a hydroponic education program for the city of Boston.    In terms of partnerships the funding through this ITEST award allowed our project team to develop close working relationships with the cities of Louisville, Boston, and Los Angeles as the work that the youth were engaged in the urban planning project portion of this work led directly to a new air quality work which has resulted in additional partnerships with the business community (Wicked Device, Perkin-Elmger, Persica).
