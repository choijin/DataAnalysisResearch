<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 0716389&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Rafail Ostrovsky&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of California, Los Angeles &lt;br/&gt;Lead&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0716199&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Brent Waters&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  SRI International&lt;br/&gt;Sub&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  0715739&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Dan Boneh&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;Sub&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number 0716230&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Dawn Song&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Carnegie Mellon University&lt;br/&gt;Sub&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Collaborative Research CT-T: Cryptographic Techniques for Searching and Processing Encrypted Data&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal we consider the question of what constitutes identities in cryptography. Typical examples of identities include your name and your social-security number, or your fingerprint/iris-scan, or your address, or your (non-revoked) Public-Key coming from some trusted public-key infrastructure. In many situations, however, where you are defines your identity. For example, we know the role of a bank-teller behind a bullet-proof bank window not because he or she shows us her&lt;br/&gt;credentials but by merely knowing her location. In this proposal, we ask the following question: is it possible to have the "geographical position" of a party take part in defining the set of credentials&lt;br/&gt;she has? What are the new possibilities in terms of what we can achieve in this setting?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, we propose to consider the central task in this setting, i.e.,&lt;br/&gt;securely verifying the position of a device. Despite much work in this area, we have preliminary results that show that in the "vanilla" (i.e., standard) model, the above task (i.e., of secure&lt;br/&gt;positioning) is impossible to achieve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We  propose to study the proof of position in the bounded storage model (i.e. where we assume some bound on the total memory of the adversary).&lt;br/&gt;In this setting, we wish to achieve   two tasks: secure positioning, and position-based key exchange. While the question of secure positioning has been asked in the past, no satisfactory answers exist. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second question (of position-based key exchange) has not been asked in the past. We also ask a broader question: whether position-based Secure Multi-Party Computation can be achieved in this setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
