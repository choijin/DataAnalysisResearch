<AbstractNarration>Hidden Universe is a multi-faceted project built around production of a 2D/3D giant screen film.  The goal is to inspire, engage, and excite viewers about the mysterious worlds hidden around us and the science and technology that reveal them. The film will illuminate natural wonders that are invisible to the naked eye, such as objects and processes that are too slow, too fast, and too small to be seen without advanced technologies. It will include nanoscience and microbiology research and developing wavelength technologies such as ultrafast lasers. The project will employ cutting-edge technology to bring arresting footage of micro- and nanobiology to the giant screen to offer audiences (1) deeper understanding of natural phenomena that comes through observation and (2) greater appreciation of modern technology that makes such observation possible.  The film story will focus on demonstrating science as inquiry and underscore the crucial link between scientific inquiry and technological advances. The film project will be enhanced with educational outreach materials, professional development opportunities for educators, and an interactive website.  Hidden Universe will be produced by the large format team at National Geographic's Cinema Ventures group and its production partner Blacklight Films.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project brings to the table the extensive resources of the National Geographic Society.  In addition, the project will partner with a select group of scientific research centers (Chester Carlson Center for Imaging Science at the Rochester Institute of Technology and the Nanobiotechnology Center at Cornell) and leaders in informal education (Boston Museum of Science and Girl Scouts) to extend the reach and impact of the project. The project will add to its list of partners by working with the D.C. Public Schools and Teach for America to find new ways to intersect with teachers and students in underserved areas. The project will employ Multimedia Research and Knight-Williams Research Communications to conduct the project's formative and summative evaluations, respectively.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mysteries of the Unseen World is a National Geographic project centered on a giant screen film that highlights the sciences used to illuminate the amazing worlds around us, invisible to the naked eye. As described on the National Geographic project website:      Mysteries   of the Unseen World reveals phenomena that canÆt be seen with the naked eye, taking audiences   into earthly worlds secreted away in different dimensions of time and scale.     Experience   events that unfold too slowly for human perception; "see" the beauty,   drama, and even humor of phenomena that occur in the flash of a microsecond;   enter a microscopic world once reserved for scientists, but now made   accessible to the rest of us; and begin to understand that what we actually   see is only a fraction of what there is to see on Earth.     High-speed   and time-lapse photography, electron microscopy, and nanotechnology are just   a few of the advancements in science that allow us to see a universe of   things, events, creatures, and processes we never even knew existed. These   technologies give us new "superpowers" to see beyond what's in front of us.     Visually   stunning and rooted in cutting-edge research, Mysteries of the Unseen   World will leave audiences in thrall as they begin to understand the   enormity of the world they canÆt see&mdash;a world that exists in the air they   breathe, on their bodies, and in all of the events that occur around them   minute by minute and nanosecond by nanosecond. And with this understanding   comes a new appreciation of the wonder and possibilities of science.  http://movies.nationalgeographic.com/movies/mysteries-of-the-unseen-world/about-the-film/  The Final Summative Evaluation results indicate that the Mysteries of the Unseen World film was a successful informal science learning initiative with the audience recruited for Study 1 of the summative evaluation, meeting the projectÆs goals in each of the five impact areas detailed in the introduction of this evaluation: 1) appeal and engagement, 2) clarity of presentation, 3) knowledge acquisition, 4) STEM interest and perceptions, and 5) motivational impact.     The findings in this report show that Mysteries of the Unseen World appealed to and engaged Viewers recruited for the evaluation. Overall, Viewers liked the film, found it visually exciting, thought the story was interesting, and expected to recommend the film to others. In general, they also found it well paced, clear, and visually easy to follow. Additionally, Viewers generally indicated that the film increased their curiosity about things they canÆt see with their own eyes and that it struck the right balance in terms of the amount of information, amount of science, and level of scientific explanations provided. Furthermore, Mysteries of the Unseen World had a significant impact on ViewersÆ knowledge of the content covered in the film, increased their interest in the filmÆs STEM content, and increased their interest in and awareness of the unseen world. Finally, the majority of Viewers who completed the follow-up questionnaire indicated that they had done one or more activities related to the film in the weeks since viewing.  To date, the film has been screened in 70+ museum theatrers worldwide and continues to be active in these theaters.  It is fully expected tatht the film will be seen by 5 million people before its run slows down in one-two years.
