<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt; The NetFPGA platform makes it easy for students and researchers to build and deploy high-performance networking systems using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware. FPGA logic is used to process packets at line-rate, while software running on an attached host computer implements control functions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators (PIs) began the beta program in January of 2008 and made the NetFPGA hardware available to any school by providing a copy of the source-source schematic and printed circuit board design to a low-cost 3rd party manufacturer. To keep the hardware cost low, they asked semiconductor companies to donate the components used on the NetFPGA. Today, every major component on the board is donated as a gift by Xilinx, Broadcom, Micron, and Cypress. The PIs also made the open-source software, gateware, courseware, and reference designs for the NetFPGA freely available on the NetFPGA.org website. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The community is growing and contributing back feedback, creating new courses, and creating new applications for the NetFPGA. Going forward, the PIs want to continue their outreach program to include deployment of NetFPGA hardware in backbone networks, other research laboratories, and classrooms in EPSCoR states. Where possible, they have raised industrial funds so they can donate NetFPGA systems to under-funded schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this award the PIs plan to do five things: (1) Pay for professional staff to continue the operation of the NetFPGA program, (2) Design and develop new reference designs and applications for the community, (3) Acquire and deploy the NetFPGA in many schools, particularly in EPSCoR states, and in national backbone networks, (4) Work with the community to create a self-supporting user-community within three years, and (5) Explore the design of a NetFPGA-10G ? a 10Gb/s version of the platform.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Most of us think of the Internet in terms of the applications we use everyday, such as Google, Facebook, Netflix, Twitter and so on. Our applications communicate over the Internet by sending short self-contained "packets" of information that travel through a series of links, switches and routers. Each packet contains an address to indicate where it is headed, just like a letter we place into the mail system.

These devices must run really fast: If packets arrive over 10Gb/s links, then a new packet can arrive every 50ns or so, which means the device must process 20 million packets per second. Achieving such high speed normally requires high-performance, fixed-function application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which cost tens of millions of dollars to fabricate. As a result, for over a decade now, it is inconceivable for networking teachers and researchers to build their own high performance network switches and routers. Which means students couldn't learn how these systems really work, and researchers were unable to tryout and demonstrate new approaches to switching and routing.  The NetFPGA is an open-platform, consisting of programmable hardware and open-source software, to allow teachers to give their students a hands-on classroom experience building and testing real networking equipment that operates at full speed; and allows networking researchers to demonstrate new ways to process packets at full line-rate. NetFPGA is the first and only such platform in the world designed specifically for students and researchers.  Over the past five years, researchers at Stanford University and Cambridge University designed and had built three different platforms:  NEtFPGA-1G (4 ports of 1Gb/s Ethernet) NetFPGA-10G (4 ports of 10Gb/s Ethernet), and NetFPGA-Sume (4 ports of 10Gb/s Ethernet and a faster FPGA, or 1 port of 100Gb/s Ethernet).   The NetFPGA boards are available from two different manufacturers, and through the generous donation of components from companies such as Xilinx, Broadcom, Cypress, and Micron, the boards are available at a fraction of their normal commercial prices (e.g., NetFPGA-1G is available for $500 instead of $3,000), making them accessible to teachers and researchers worldwide.  More than 3,000 NetFPGA boards have been used by over 150 research and teaching institutions in more than 40 countries around the world.   Introductory material and video tutorials are available online at: http://netfpga.org.   Dozens of classes around the world teach students how to build an Internet router or Ethernet switch, giving them hands-on experience building real networking equipment. As a result, thousands of students have taken classes using NetFPGA. Over 250 academic research papers have used NetFPGA to demonstrate new ideas operating at full-speed, leading to new algorithms, new architectures and approaches used by much of the commercial routing equipment that makes up the Internet today.
