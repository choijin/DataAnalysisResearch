<AbstractNarration>Exposure to stress leads to activation of multiple systems such as the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, both of which evolved as endogenous mechanisms to promote survival in the face of diverse threats.  However, considerably less attention has been devoted towards understanding brain mechanisms that promote functional recovery and adaptation after the threat subsides. As a result, we have argued that exposure to intense stressors requires a protracted period of recuperation, and that activation of inflammatory pathways in the brain as a result of stressor exposure promotes recuperative behavior.  The goal of this project, therefore, is to determine the mechanisms by which stressor exposure leads to activation of inflammatory pathways in the brain.  The researcher specifically hypothesizes that activation of central noradrenergic nuclei in response to stress are critical for activating these inflammatory pathways, while the release of corticosterone, the major effector molecule of the HPA axis in rat, constrains the development of neuroinflammation. In this regard, the project employs a systems biology approach that seeks to clarify the functional interplay among multiple stress responsive systems at the cellular, neurochemical, and neuroanatomical levels of analysis.  The investigator's laboratory is comprised of trainees at all levels of the scientific hierarchy (undergraduates, graduate students and post doctoral trainees) and includes strong representation by underrepresented populations in the sciences (50% female, 33% minorities). The laboratory environment is state-of-the-art and contains extensive resources devoted specifically to promote training and networking for careers in science.  The laboratory also has a strong history, and deliberate plans for, dissemination of findings to the scientific community (both domestic and abroad) as well as to the lay public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:    The overarching goal of this proposal was to identify neural mechanisms underlying the relationship between stress exposure and the expression of the key pro-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-1 in the brain.  These studies were critical because stress exposure powerfully impacts the behavior and ultimately the fitness of organisms in the wild.  As a pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1 responses to stress have been shown to play a key role in plasticity of the stress response as well as recovery of behavioral function that must occur in the post-stress recuperative period.  Studies funded by this grant examined the role of central noradrenergic systems as key drivers of IL-1 expression, indicating that (i) central IL-1 responses to stress were blocked by beta-adrenergic antagonists, but only partially attenuated via lesions of the ventral noradrenergic bundle (a key noradrenergic pathway innervating the PVN);  (ii) increased IL-1 gene expression is only one manifestation of a broader spectrum of inflammatory-related changes evoked by stress, which included tell-tale signs of microglial activation by stress;  and (iii) blockade of IL-1 receptors powerfully impacted behavioral changes evoked by stress, particularly with respect to reduced social interaction and the nature/ability of rodents to communicate via the release of natural odorant signals.  Further studies also explored the impact of corticosteroids released during stress, showing that coritcostesterone (but not progesterone) appears to exert potent anti-inflammtory effects which constrain the expression of IL-1.    Broader impacts:    This grant award provided amazing research opportunities for undergraduate students (25+ over 4 years) and graduate students (6+) by providing partial funding (predominantly over the summers) to support their research endeavors, as well as travel to attend national conferences to present their work.  More than half of these students were women seeking careers/experience in science and about a quarter of them overall were under-represented minorities.  Students were drawn from the population of undergraduates at Binghamton University, whereas 2 REU supplements drew in students from Ohio University, Elizabethtown College, and Syracuse University, indicating an impact well beyond the population at Binghamton University.  This award led to the publication of more than 20 peer-reviewed publications (with several others in preparation), including both primary empirical articles and review articles.  In addition, a new website was designed and launched during the project period to provide access and broad dissemination of research findings.
