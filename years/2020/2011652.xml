<AbstractNarration>The goals of this project are to use the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition, a global undergraduate research activity at the interface of biological sciences and synthetic biology, as a tool to recruit and retain diverse students in STEM and give them meaningful research experiences through participation in the University of Virginia iGEM team. Participation in the iGEM competition enables and broadens undergraduate participation in synthetic biology research at the University of Virginia, enhancing access for women and individuals under-represented in STEM.  The project develops an inter-disciplinary STEM workforce from a diverse cohort of science and engineering students by providing an opportunity for cross-discipline communication and problem solving. The project also supports the bio-economy by introducing students to and creating an opportunity for student-driven entrepreneurship within the field of synthetic biology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Virginia iGEM team has a long and successful of engaging students projects in the field of synthetic biology. The current project concerns the use of synthetic biology for the commercial production of various pharmaceuticals, reagents, and other organic compounds. A major impediment in such commercial productions is the lack of a versatile, reliable, and efficient method to increase the flow of molecules through specific biochemical pathways within a cell.  This problem is addressed in this project with the use of the biosynthesis of resveratrol as an experimental model. Specifically, mathematical modeling combined with existing knowledge of molecular structures is being used to design small artificial compartments within bacteria that serve as a foundry for resveratrol biosynthesis. Once designed, the compartments are assembled in cells, through the regulated expression of synthetic genes, and tested for efficiency, reliability, and versatility. The project builds basic research into a foundational technology to expand the applications of synthetic biology, especially in the area of bio-manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
