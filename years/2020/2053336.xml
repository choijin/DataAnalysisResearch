<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable a critical tool for fast, high-performance measurement for precision parts manufacturing. High-precision parts are typically checked during manufacturing using fixed gauges based on 20-to-30-year-old technology costing several million dollars a year in maintenance and can take 2-3 hours using contact methods, out of a total of 20-24 hours of machine time.  Improved measurements of parts in process will lead to better manufacturing practices and higher-quality parts. The proposed capability would reduce the time required for this step by a factor of 8 to 10, making in-process measurement more economically viable as well as improving machine utilization in a plant by as much as 20 percent, potentially driving savings of over $100 million per year industry-wide.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is the development of new techniques needed to create a long-range, high-precision laser triangulation gauge usable on a wide range of surfaces.  Traditional laser triangulation gauges have changed little in the past 40 years, providing a reliable but limited point or profile measurement used widely in manufacturing today. Current laser gauge range-to-resolution is around 2000 to 1, achieving perhaps 4000 to 1 in special circumstances.  A range-to-resolution capability of 50,000 to 1 would greatly expand the application potential of such gauges.  The proposed project reimagines the basic mechanisms in triangulation gauges to separate the measurement process from the noise inherent in laser-based systems.  Rather than imaging a laser spot from the part surface, the method will use a direct angular measurement of the light. This objective will be realized by adapting phase measurement methods not used in triangulation gauges today. The anticipated result will be a gauge with micron-level resolution over distance ranges of 300 millimeters and over variations in surface finish and texture.  This capability will fill a critical void in measurement tool capability for manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
