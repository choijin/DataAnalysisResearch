<AbstractNarration>The study of nonlocal models has attracted much attention in many science and engineering disciplines such as materials science, mechanics, biology, and social science, and they are therefore of interest to applied and computational mathematics.  Nonlocal models differ from the more common local models because they account for the factors active on a range rather than only at a point at which they are considered.  The project is aimed at advancing the mathematical and numerical analysis of robust and effective numerical methods for those nonlocal models with a finite range of interactions.  The research will complement the ongoing development of effective simulation platforms for nonlocal modeling in various application domains. It will also contribute to the integrated interdisciplinary education and research training of students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important class of robust numerical schemes for nonlocal models is provided by asymptotically compatible (AC) discretization schemes. The latter are designed to assure the convergence of approximate solutions, as numerical resolution gets refined, to correct physical solutions for problems with changing or even diminishing ranges of nonlocal interactions. The project will include a comprehensive study of AC schemes for nonlocal problems with heterogeneously distributed ranges of nonlocal interactions and/or having boundary/interfaces. Further investigations of AC schemes will be carried out for problems involving coupled local/nonlocal models and nonlinear problems motivated by important applications. The focus on robust discretization methods like the AC schemes is particularly relevant to reliable and efficient simulations of nonlocal models with application to complex physical systems involving multiscale, singular, and anomalous behaviors.  An integrated analytical and computational approach will be used to develop both fundamental ideas and practical insight so that the research findings will not only enrich the mathematical theory of AC schemes but also offer guidance to their practical applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
