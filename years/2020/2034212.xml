<AbstractNarration>The rapid pace of discovery in the relationships between microbes and plants has created the need and the opportunity for international gatherings to present recent results that are especially conducive to interaction and discussion, and that will support the professional development of young researchers. This conference will support graduate student and postdoctoral researcher participation in the in-person 12th US-Japan Seminar on Plant-Pathogen Interactions to be held at Cornell University February 27-March 3, 2022. It will also support livestreaming to broaden participation. Continuing a series of scientific workshops initiated in 1966 to foster collaboration between US and Japanese researchers, the conference will feature speakers from both countries, with the goal of merging conceptual and theoretical understanding with translational delivery of solutions for plant health. Participation is open to anyone. The theme is “Remodeling of the plant-microbe interface during disease, defense, and mutualism.” Keynote and short talks along with poster sessions and social activities will provide platforms for scientists at diverse career stages to interact. The conference will meet the following objectives: 1) Discussion of fundamental and translational science in the area of plant-pathogen and plant-microbe interactions; 2) Continued development and fostering of bilateral, international, collaboration through research, cultural, and professional activities; 3) Training of graduate students and postdocs in professional scientific experiences, including panel moderation, presentation, and strategic planning, and 4) Identification of knowledge and resource gaps and opportunities for future investment in translational, and transformative, plant-microbe interactions research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent research has shed light on how plants and microbes use molecular dialogue to physically and chemically reshape the plant-microbe interface, either to favor or prevent microbial colonization. This conference will highlight and explore aspects of pathogenesis and beneficial symbioses in this context and identify gaps in knowledge. Indeed, our understanding of plant-microbe interactions has evolved from that of an apparent, and overly simplified, bipartite interaction, to one that encompasses multiple environments (i.e., microbiomes), evolving genotypes, and a changing climate. The 12th US-Japan Seminar meeting will enable a convergence of conceptual and theoretical understanding with translational science, across diverse pathosystems and beneficial interactions, focused under the specific theme of “remodeling.” Now in its sixth decade, the series of US-Japan Seminars has successfully encouraged the exchange of ideas and scientific discussion, and the establishment and nurture of productive research collaborations. The 12th Seminar is designed specifically to emphasize career development, networking, and training for graduate and early career scientists, an aim that will be facilitated by holding the seminar on a university campus and by engaging these individuals for short talks and as session moderators. To broaden participation, discounted registration will be offered to graduate students and postdocs; broad advertising as well as targeted recruitment through existing connections with 1890s institutions and REU programs will be leveraged; interactive, online access to talks and posters will be provided; and the proceedings will be published as a special, open access issue of the journal Physiological and Molecular Plant Pathology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
