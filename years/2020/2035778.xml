<AbstractNarration>This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).  It will provide funds to upgrade a Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer (DA3-FTIR). The instrument covers a wide range of light wavelengths and has accessories for high and low temperatures as well as high pressure which makes the instrument useful in addressing an extensive range of problems. Examples of the breadth of supported research are collaborative studies in medicine (bone growth) and ongoing studies in astronomy (identifying dust ejected from old stars).  However, the primary focus of the instrument has been on problems important to the geological, planetary and materials science. The upgraded instrument will add to the infrastructure and will help advance fundamental issues while providing opportunities for education and training. The instrument has been used by students at all levels plus students of other faculty at Washington U. and at U. Missouri. The laboratory plans to continue probing the fundamental principles that govern the interaction of heat with matter, and to apply these findings to the Earth and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The existing Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer (DA3-FTIR) in this laboratory has been used in diverse and numerous research projects since its funding by NSF three decades ago. The DA3-FTIR is a high-end research instrument, with 5 pairs of detectors and beam-splitters that altogether cover the far-IR to the visible.  Accessories include a liquid helium cryostat, heaters, and diamond anvil cells to acquire spectra from ~10 to 700 K or at pressure to 50 GPa. Two IR-microscopes are used for very small samples. This instrument is no longer maintained by its manufacturer. The problems are largely electronic. Due to its popularity and robust mechanical components, a small company has filled the market need by offering an upgrade, electronics replacement, and support for this instrument. The upgraded instrument will add to the infrastructure and will help advance fundamental issues in the geological and planetary sciences. Ongoing and planned projects use this instrument and are important to geophysics, volcanology, petrology, and planetary science. Acquiring quantitative spectra vs frequency and T will permit extrapolating to unattainable conditions and will improve understanding of the thermal state and evolution of planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
