<AbstractNarration>This project will develop a new probe to measure the amount of heat coming out of the ground beneath lakes. The probe will overcome current limitations by (1) enabling visual site selection so that researchers know where and how the probe is placed in the lake floor environment and pin-point important lake floor features such as gas seeps and chemosynthetic communities, (2) providing real-time data to assess data quality and site evaluation, and (3) monitoring temperature changes over time that might arise from changes in lake temperature. The probe will be deployed and tested in Mono Lake, California. Mono Lake has hosted the youngest volcanic eruptions in the region.  There are, however, currently no heat flow measurements within the lake to constrain recent volcanic activity and volcanic hazards. The measurements may reveal the extent of magma bodies that connect the subsurface to the volcanic eruptions seen at Earthâ€™s surface. This project will be integrated into a summer field camp so that 20 students can participate in the measurement campaign and data interpretation. This project provides an opportunity to test new instrumentation that would be useful in a broad range of settings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prototype geophysical probe, called the LTMP (Lake Thermal Monitoring Probe) consists of a compact (1-3 m long), lightweight (&lt;20 kg), camera-mounted Lister-type heat flow probe designed for deployment by only two people on a small (~5 m) vessel in a lake bottom. The probe will be designed to provide both real-time lake floor video for site selection, and real-time subsurface temperature monitoring for up to one year,  with data continuously beamed back to researchers. If the new probe works, it will provide a new high-resolution tool for measuring heat flow and fluid flow changes in complex geologic settings like caldera lakes, revealing how heat flow below lakes is coupled to other geosystems and hazards (e.g., the atmosphere, groundwater, volcanoes, earthquakes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this study is to test a new sensor that allows for real-time heat flow measurements in shallow lake or marine environments, ideally in dynamic settings such as volcanic lakes, where heat flow can vary in both space and time. To measure heat flow accurately in shallow water environments, it is important to remove the seasonal temperature changes that occur in lakes. This requires long-term lake bottom temperature monitoring. To address this issue, we have developed two different types of sensors: the first consists of 5 thermistors that are deployed within the water column that allow us to monitor how temperature changes in space and time, and from this, back calculate the effects of lake water temperature on the subsurface of the lake. The second type of probe is inserted into the lake bottom and measures temperature with depth (this probe consists of 9 thermistors spaced 10 cm apart, as well as a 3-component accelerometer). By correcting for the lake temperature changes with time, we can then estimate the heat flow from the lake as well as the thermal conductivity of sediments in the lake. Both of these probes are designed to be low cost (Less than $500 to construct), and both provide real-time data. Additionally, we collected spot heat flow measurements at 30 sites across mono lake that revealed heat flow values in excess of 600 mW/m2 throughout the lake (these heat flow measurements were corrected for lake bottom temperature change using rudimentary monthly lake bottom temperature measurements collected by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power). The highest heat flow values were generally found near the central island of Paoha, where the youngest volcanic eruptions along the Mono-Inyo volcanic chain exist.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We deployed the long-term monitoring probes on floats in late March, 2021 in Mono Lake. Both are powered by solar panels with rechargeable batteries, and all data are uploaded real-time via cell. The lake temperature probe continues to operate today (8/9/2021) sampling temperature every 20 seconds, and the lake floor heat flow probe operated for over 3 months, before a power failure caused by a defective battery.&nbsp; Results clearly demonstrate how the lake temperature warmed during the spring and summer, forming a thermocline that terminates at a depth of 15 m. The heat flow probe in the lake floor responded directly to lake temperature warming and we used these data to estimate thermal diffusivity and heat flow in the lake. &nbsp;Interestingly, the thermal diffusivity in the lake changes with ime (reduces with lake temperature warming), and is consistent with gas formation occurring in the shallow lake bed. We also observe clear evidence of upward fluid advection. Anomalous temperatures associated with the July 8th, magnitude 8 Earthquake were recorded in the water temperature sensor that we associate with a seiche, and integration of these lake temperature data with USGS lake sparker data show thermocline/pycnocline structure in the lake. &nbsp;Results from this initial work is included in three AGU abstracts entitled,</p> <p>1. &ldquo;Initial Results from Campaign and Continuous Heat Flow Measurements in Mono Lake, California&rdquo;</p> <p>2. &ldquo;Seismic and thermal detection of internal waves, seiches, and methane release in Mono Lake, California&rdquo;</p> <p>3. &ldquo;Time Series Clustering using Granger Causality to Identify Time Series Applicable to Forecasting Internal Waves in Lake and Marine Environments&rdquo;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We anticipate each of these Abstracts will evolve into manuscripts submitted for peer review publication in the next 6-9 months.</p> <p>At the end of July, we recovered parts of the lake bottom sensor equipment that stopped recording after 3 months, and in September 2021, we will redeploy a new set of sensors either on or near this float system. &nbsp;The upgraded probe will also have a volatile organic carbon sensor attached that we will use to assess if/when methane or CO2 might be release from the lake bottom.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/09/2021<br>      Modified by: Matthew&nbsp;J&nbsp;Hornbach</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2041412/2041412_10692427_1628524699359_fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2041412/2041412_10692427_1628524699359_fig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="temperature in mono lake bottom"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2041412/2041412_10692427_1628524699359_fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="temperature in mono lake bottom"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">the temperature in the upper 1 m of mono lake with time.

"Time Series Clustering using Granger Causality to Identify Time Series Applicable to Forecasting Internal Waves in Lake and Marine Environments"     We anticipate each of these Abstracts will evolve into manuscripts submitted for peer review publication in the next 6-9 months.  At the end of July, we recovered parts of the lake bottom sensor equipment that stopped recording after 3 months, and in September 2021, we will redeploy a new set of sensors either on or near this float system.  The upgraded probe will also have a volatile organic carbon sensor attached that we will use to assess if/when methane or CO2 might be release from the lake bottom.
