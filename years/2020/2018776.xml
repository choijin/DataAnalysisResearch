<AbstractNarration>An integrated Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with multiple sensor capability and a carbon coater for sample preparation will be acquired at Sonoma State University (SSU). This SEM system will 1) increase the quality and diversity of data that will be collected and analyzed, 2) increase speed of data collection  facilitating the facultyâ€™s ability to establish collaborative relationships, 3) support existing curricular infrastructure and training of the next generation of scientists using modern technology and data acquisition techniques, 4) increase student diversity within the STEM disciplines, 5) facilitate and maintain industry partnerships and internship opportunities for students, and 6) foster an academically diverse user-base for electron microscopy at SSU. The proposed SEM and associated detectors have the potential to significantly impact 15 courses at SSU and approximately 500 student per year. In addition to the classroom environment, many of our science majors become involved in independent research as a capstone experience, and many of those students utilize the SEM facilities as part of their research. SSU is committed to educating persons of all backgrounds and is dedicated to increasing gender and ethnic diversity in the sciences. SSU is a federally recognized Hispanic-Serving Institution with an undergraduate population that is 33% Hispanic. This population is historically underrepresented in the STEM disciplines; however, having access to hands-on research opportunities with state-of-the-art equipment has proven to be an effective technique for recruiting underrepresented populations into STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of the proposed SEM microanalysis system will greatly increase the quality and scope of the research agendas of the five investigators from the Geology, Physics, and Chemistry Departments, as well as faculty members from other departments at SSU (e.g., Biology, Anthropology, Geography, and Engineering Sciences). Specific research questions facilitated by this instrument include: 1) the long-term history of fault systems, 2) mechanisms of mountain building, 3) plate tectonic reconstructions, 4) self-assembly of nano-materials, 5) nano-sensor development, and 6) investigation into the properties of magnetic systems exhibiting spin frustration, which can be used to create all-magnetic computer architectures. This instrument expands the type of scientific questions that we can address and facilitates cross-disciplinary research within the university and with our collaborating institutions. The current system at SSU cannot be upgraded and has become unreliable/non-functioning in the past few years; it is frequently out of commission during repairs and no longer produces the quality of data necessary for conducting research. In addition to standard secondary electron imaging capabilities, Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (EDS), Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), and Cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging capabilities are critical for SSU faculty research activities. Our research needs outstrip this SEM system because we need: 1) a faster, more sensitive SEM/EBSD system that can automate data acquisition schemes for large-area mapping, 2) an SEM/EDS system with increased resolution to resolve elemental distributions of nano-structures, 3) an integrated CL detector for imaging zoning in crystals associated with detrital zircon geochronology analyses, 4) a larger chamber for the analysis of geological materials, 5) integrated safety features to avoid sample-instrument collisions  when training novice users, 6) an upgradable system that integrates with the continually evolving hardware and software industry and 7) to increase reliability for more dependable integration into curricular and research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
