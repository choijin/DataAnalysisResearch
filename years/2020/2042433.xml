<AbstractNarration>This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People define themselves in terms of social categories that lead to seeing similarities and differences with others. These social identities can involve being part of specific groups (for example, female) and having specific social roles (for example, mother). Thinking about one's multiple identities simultaneously (for example, female, mother, scientist) has been shown to lead to increased creativity and flexible thinking. The current project examines: 1) the interpersonal benefits that may occur when individuals each consider their own multiple identities as they interact with others, and 2) the mindset and conditions that promote these interpersonal benefits. As the U.S. population becomes increasingly diverse, multiracial, and multi-ethnic, it becomes increasingly important to understand and maximize the benefits of perceiving oneself in terms of having multiple identities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project consists of a series of studies to examine pathways that produce interaction benefits. A primary pathway involves having experiences that lead to considering one's multiple identities rather than only a single identity. Another pathway involves having increased contact with others whose identities differ from one's own, which should encourage a multiple identity mindset. These studies examine people from different groups, different ages, in different contexts, and they utilize experimental, survey, and longitudinal methods. The predictions concern whether multiple identities can: coexist simultaneously across the lifespan, be invoked or changed, vary across contexts, and also yield benefits even when some of the identities evoke negative beliefs or stereotypes. This project also provides a variety of training opportunities for the next generation of scholars, including underrepresented students. Outcomes additionally include developing programming for local science museums and implementing university-level assessments that can inform campus diversity efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
