<AbstractNarration>The Automated Collaboration Assessment Using Behavioral Analytics project will&lt;br/&gt;measure and support collaboration as students engage in STEM learning activities.&lt;br/&gt;Collaboration promotes clarifications of misconceptions and deeper understanding of concepts&lt;br/&gt;in STEM which prepares students for future employment in STEM and beyond. This project&lt;br/&gt;aligns with the goal of the Cyberlearning for Work at the Human-Technology Frontier program to&lt;br/&gt;fund exploratory research that supports learners in working productively in technology-rich&lt;br/&gt;STEM environments. Collaboration is an important learning skill in K-12 STEM education, yet teachers have few&lt;br/&gt;consistent ways to measure and support students’ development in this area. This project will&lt;br/&gt;result in both an improved understanding of productive collaboration and a prototype&lt;br/&gt;instructional tool that can help teachers identify nonverbal behaviors and assess overall&lt;br/&gt;collaboration and engagement quality. Using nonverbal behaviors to assess engagement will&lt;br/&gt;decrease dependence on discourse and content-based dialogue and increase the transferability&lt;br/&gt;of this work into different domains. This project is particularly timely as the ability to collaborate&lt;br/&gt;and engage in group work are growing requirements in professional and learning settings; at the&lt;br/&gt;same time the very act of collaboration is being disrupted by the Coronavirus pandemic and&lt;br/&gt;there is a high likelihood that much of this “new normal” (social distancing; combining in-person&lt;br/&gt;and remote collaboration) will be with us for some time. This project will meet the urgent need&lt;br/&gt;currently felt by educators and educational institutions to support the development of&lt;br/&gt;collaboration skills among students, even as the very act of collaboration is shifting and nontraditional&lt;br/&gt;forms of education are taking hold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a collaboration between the Center for Education Research and&lt;br/&gt;Innovation (CERI) and Center for Vision Technology (CVT) at SRI International (SRI) and will&lt;br/&gt;capture multiple students’ actions as they work collaboratively face-to-face, both in-person and&lt;br/&gt;through a virtual platform. This project will use a collaboration conceptual&lt;br/&gt;model, multistage predictive and explainable machine learning models, and video analytics to&lt;br/&gt;assess and report on collaborative behaviors and interactions. The behavior analytics system&lt;br/&gt;will use facial expressions, body movements, and meta-information about the collaboration task&lt;br/&gt;to identify interactions that show how students contribute to the collaboration, individually and&lt;br/&gt;collectively. This 2-year project will use reliability and model prediction testing and sequential,&lt;br/&gt;correlation, and thematic analyses of video recordings, surveys, interviews, and student artifacts&lt;br/&gt;to answer the following research questions: Can machine learning models reliably assess&lt;br/&gt;collaboration when compared to human assessments? How do individual behaviors during&lt;br/&gt;collaboration lead and relate to group level interactions and collaboration quality? and Can we&lt;br/&gt;validate and relate the assessed collaboration behaviors to student outcomes as represented by&lt;br/&gt;group-generated artifacts? The intellectual merits include contributions to the advancement of&lt;br/&gt;two fields: (1) machine learning— by developing and exploring new algorithms that generate&lt;br/&gt;explainable collaboration skill assessments and teacher/student dashboards at different grain&lt;br/&gt;sizes of the interactions, and (2) learning sciences—by contributing a collaboration conceptual&lt;br/&gt;model that shows how specific skills, interactions, and behaviors correspond to collaboration&lt;br/&gt;quality at group and individual levels. Broader impacts of this work include increasing the&lt;br/&gt;availability and types of feedback presented to instructors and learners from diverse&lt;br/&gt;backgrounds. This will expand the settings and number of individuals who can be evaluated and&lt;br/&gt;supported on collaboration by making collaborative learning easier to monitor through tools that&lt;br/&gt;can be used by a wide audience of educators and professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
