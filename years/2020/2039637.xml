<AbstractNarration>The techniques and algorithms associated with artificial intelligence (AI) are simultaneously an outstanding benefit and a looming threat to cybersecurity. AI can aid in the detection of malicious attacks but can also contribute to the efficacy of such attacks. As AI-enabled systems become embedded in our most critical social institutions, the manipulation of their intended behavior is a serious threat to many fundamental rights. The challenge is not only technical, but also apparent in interactions across physical, social, and technological spheres. In order to respond to these challenges, it is critical to establish transdisciplinary approaches that bring together the fields of AI, cybersecurity, and social sciences to effectively understand and apply fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics (FATE) principles in AI. To support this goal, this project will develop a novel educational approach called TechHive: AI. The approach will focus on recruiting teens from marginalized communities and providing them with training in how to address AI cybersecurity threats in ways that adhere to the FATE principles. The project’s focus ensures that students will receive the necessary preparation to pursue career pathways in AI and cybersecurity. In addition, it will support the development of an informed public capable of understanding the privacy, confidentiality, ethics, safety, and security implications of AI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The transdisciplinary project team will develop a set of design principles and processes to support learning at the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and FATE. Specific deliverables will include: (1) a transdisciplinary curricular model for teaching cybersecurity and AI; (2) guidelines for the development of effective online and hybrid learning models that integrate STEM and social science curricula with FATE principles in cybersecurity and AI; and (3) a research report that will detail the effectiveness of this model to support high schoolers’ development of workforce skills. In addition, the project aims to address the following research questions: (1) Is there increased awareness and/or value of FATE principles among participating students? (2) Do students have increased awareness of the effects of technology on society and development of skills to design and deploy technology in ways that maximize societal benefit? (3) What design principles and processes best promote learning at the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and FATE principles, especially among high schoolers within a hybrid/online instructional context? The design principles and processes produced through this collaborative effort will support the development of a knowledge base of best practices in integrating technical education with ethical training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by a special initiative of the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program to foster new, previously unexplored, collaborations between the fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and education. The SaTC program aligns with the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan and the National Privacy Research Strategy to protect and preserve the growing social and economic benefits of cyber systems while ensuring security and privacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
