<AbstractNarration>This project supports continuation of the CyberCorps®: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB). The CSUSB program promotes cybersecurity excellence through a dynamic curriculum, unique applied learning requirements, and a diverse student population. Students work on a curriculum designed around the needs of government organizations seeking well-qualified cybersecurity personnel. The program provides training options for many in-demand skills within the federal government and encompasses four bachelor’s and five master’s degree programs. A typical CSUSB CyberCorps® student is well-versed in cybersecurity policy, tactics, threat analysis, counterintelligence, networking, database, offensive and defensive hacking, penetration testing, and forensics, including with applied professional experiences. CSUSB's service area is richly populated with residents from diverse ethnic backgrounds, including those groups that are currently underrepresented in the cybersecurity field. In addition, most students are first generation minority students, transferring from community colleges, often from low-income and disadvantaged backgrounds. From tutoring to etiquette to professional behavior, CSUSB places great emphasis on ensuring this diverse student cohort (50% Hispanic and 43% female) learns the skills necessary to successfully obtain and retain professional employment. The CSUSB SFS program also mentors other institutions regarding best practices in recruitment diversity, placement strategies, leveraging university resources, and program management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CSUSB’s CyberCorps® program will continue as a source of high-quality cybersecurity workforce personnel with three project objectives. First, the program will train four cohorts of graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. Second, the project team will provide ongoing academic support and mentoring to the scholars with the goal of a 100% annual retention rate (barring extenuating circumstances). Last, the program aims to place all scholarship recipients in federal, state, local, or tribal cyber service positions, with at least 80% in federal executive branch positions. The program’s components and its effectiveness will contribute to the body of knowledge and best practice strategies for successful recruitment, mentorship, retention, and placement of cybersecurity professionals. Under the mentorship of experienced faculty and professionals, CyberCorps® students are required to work in applied activities beyond the classroom including competitions, research, and community outreach. The CSUSB program is also pursuing unconventional approaches to showcase student talents from game development and outreach to challenging technical projects, creating a nationally recognized cybersecurity program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the CyberCorps® Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a federal, state, local, or tribal Government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
