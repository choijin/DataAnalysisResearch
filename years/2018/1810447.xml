<AbstractNarration>Many emerging autonomous systems, e.g., robots in unstructured environments, are too complex to be accurately modeled. There are unknown model parameters, partial state observations, or a drift in system characteristics. This makes the problem of system identification and control quite challenging. Real-time adaptation is needed for optimal and resilient operation. It is well-known that the classical adaptive con-trol approach of system identification and `certainty equivalent' control in the feedback-loop doesn't work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we introduce a new paradigm of 'Learning-to-Control' unknown Autonomous Systems based on the newly developing approach of Thompson/Posterior sampling-based online learning. We will focus on discrete state space models of Markov decision processes (MDPs). We will first develop a posterior sampling-inspired algorithms for online learning-based control with real-time adaptation for MDP models with partial observation of the system state. We note that such approaches may be inter-preted to provide just the right amount of randomization for optimally trading off exploration and exploi-tation that is needed for online learning of the optimal policy at the fastest rate. We will then extend this to the setting where the system parameter may be varying or drifting with time. We will then develop such algorithms for more relevant but also more complicated system models - stochastic hybrid systems, that have both discrete and continuous states. The developed algorithms will be extensively validated in sim-ulation experiments in the classical control and robotics environments in OpenAI Gym. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the research lies in its contribution to the 'Science of Autonomous Systems' by development of foundations of online learning-based real-time control and adaptation for autonomous systems by addressing fundamental questions about separation of parameter estimation, state estima-tion and control for various stochastic system models, particularly when model parameters must be learnt from data. The broader impacts will include impact on the smart grid, autonomous robotics, and medical CPS devices via dissemination of research results, training of a female PhD student and a K-12 STEM outreach effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
