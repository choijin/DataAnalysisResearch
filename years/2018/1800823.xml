<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Spring Mini Course in Analysis and Geometry" that will be held February 8-11, 2018 at the Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of harmonic analysis and geometric analysis.   A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.   The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.   More information will be made available at: www.math.lsu.edu/~MiniCoures</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Analysis and geometry are two important parts of modern mathematics.  Those are tools describing the world we live and act in and are extremely useful to analyze data in our modern digital world. The main goal of the workshop "Spring Mini Course in Analysis and Geometry" that took place at the Louisiana State University campus February 9 to February 1  2016 was to introduce to young researchers and students  three important problems/conjectures in geometry and analysis and at the same time allow more established researcher to learn about new directions and results.    The main talks were given by three leading researcher in analysis and geometry.   1)   Peter G. Casazza - University of Missouri: Feichtinger Conjecture.  2)   Alex Iosevich - University of Rochester: Falconer's Conjecture.  3)   Palle E.T. Jorgensen - University of Iowa: Fuglede's Conjecture.  Then there were several shorter presentation given by the participants. Plenty of time was reserved for discussion. The mini-course lectures were organized so that there was plenty of time for the participants to discuss and interact with the three main speakers and other participants. And in fact the discussion was very lively and constructive both during the talks as well as in the breaks. All the participants were very happy about the format of the workshop and the mini courses.  The funds were also used to partially support the workshop "Ordered Structures in Geometry and Analysis" which took place on the LSU campus during the days April 5 to April 7, 2018. The goal of this workshop was to introduce to the participants the newest results related to the application of semigroups and orderings in geometry and analysis.   Most of the talks were around fifty minutes with lots of time for discussion and interaction between the participants.  For both workshops, funds were only used for hotel for speakers and participants, as well as partial support for travel.
