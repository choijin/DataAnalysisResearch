<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2018 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Sophie T Spirkl is "Algorithms and structure for graphs with forbidden induced subgraphs". The host institution for the fellowship is Rutgers University and the sponsoring scientist is Jeff Kahn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Does it lead to more efficient algorithms?    The Erdos-Hajnal conjecture is a long-standing fundamental conjecture about this local-global phenomenon in graphs with forbidden induced subgraphs, stating that such graphs have large cliques or stable sets (subsets of the vertex sets in which either all or no edges are present).
