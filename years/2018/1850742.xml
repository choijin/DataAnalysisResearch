<AbstractNarration>Better prediction of natural hazards could save lives and mitigate destruction of property. This conference will address the question of uncertainty in coupled mathematical models of physical systems and the impact of this uncertainty on hazard prediction. It will provide a venue to introduce young geoscientists, computational mathematicians, and statisticians to each other and to senior researchers. It will identify specific problems of interest and new collaborations focused around the challenges of coupled hazard models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uncertainty analysis in mathematical models of physical systems is still in development. Only recently has the effect of uncertainty been incorporated into hazard predictions. However, most hazards are the consequences of a cascade of effects. For example, rain weakens soil on a fire-scorched hillside, which causes a landslide that can harm people and damage property. The goal of this conference is to better understand i) the physical processes causing the hazard, ii) the mathematical models of these processes and the range of uncertainty in the model equations, and iii) the coupling of events leading to hazards and the associated propagation of uncertainties from one model to the next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The meeting brought together geoscientists, engineers, computational mathematicians, and statisticians with the overarching goals of 1) describing their own role in the inherently interdisciplinary field of geophysical hazard modeling and forecasting, and 2) thinking about common challenges and objectives of hazard forecasting under uncertainty. Finally, we discussed and postulated how these challenges are further enhanced in the case of coupled hazards.  We present a list of findings/objectives/obstacles/goals. This list has been distilled from the talks/questions/responses, the keynote speaker and following discussion on communicating scientific understanding of uncertain hazards, the wrap-up panel discussion, and interviews students and postdocs conducted with speakers.  Uncertain Geohazards: objectives, obstacles, goals, and ideas on how to move forward  Systematic strategies to link physical and statistical modeling efforts with stakeholders and end-users.  There is a need for a link to deliver statistical uncertainty quantification to the stakeholders, end-users, communities, etc.  At the end, we have binary decision to make. To alert people, we need high confidence. How much can we trust the methodology we are using to make these binary decisions? How do we convey that level of trust to civil protection authorities? For some hazards, a scientific advisory committee is the mediator who thinks about uncertainty in hazard maps. Scientists usually are not comfortable with getting into the decision-making part of it, but it is still often their role. We are not effectively applying what we know to influence policy change. Often we have a lot of knowledge that it underutilized to help broader communities. Mitigation is quite different if we consider individuals affected by hazards (buying out flood prone properties, calling for evacuation, etc.) vs. critical facilities facing hazards (road/bridges, nuclear facilities, power plants, water infrastructure). Is there a common framework for hazard assessment under uncertainty to advance both objectives?   Sources of uncertainty.   Changing topography. Topography can change rapidly in an ongoing crisis (new volcanic deposits, sediment deposits, changes in bathymetry, etc.) Existing methods often rely on DEM and/or Bathymetry models of varying quality that are static. Yet, future unknown topography changes may be a dominate source of uncertainty. Understanding the primary sources of uncertainty for a given hazard. Sometimes much effort goes into improving/reducing epistemic uncertainties in physical models, but the uncertainty is swamped by aleatoric uncertainties that may be poorly characterized or sometimes ignored. How to balance reducing uncertainty (where possible) and propagating uncertainty to be reflected in forecasts. Statistical emulators can help in this process, but all relevant sources of uncertainty need to be considered to find those that are most influential. This is a difficult balance as one wants to keep the hazard modeling process tractable.   Transferability of research tools/findings among different communities studying geohazards.  Different communities have different/unfamiliar notation and language that can be a roadblock to relying on the literature to learn about other community’s advancements. Cross-fertilization is difficult and requires sustained effort by teams open to learning the other community’s assumptions, concerns, and language. In geohazards, there are not a lot of mechanisms to bring diverse teams of researchers together. Research meetings tend to be hazard and/or discipline specific.    Translating methodologies to be applicable on operational time scales.  Sparse sources of data, limited observation. Models can help to generate more data but how to share with people in operations? Crudely, how to conduct hazard assessment (and create hazard maps) but also deliver uncertainties? Physical models (and efforts to inform those with probabilistic descriptions of likely scenarios for hazard forecasting) are often computationally intensive.  Many researchers’ efforts are spent on devising efficient algorithms to produce such forecasts and quantify uncertainties. Yet, there is a further need to exploit high-performance computing resources and to develop professional-level software. Often domain scientists do not have the skills or resources to accomplish this last task limiting the impact of their research efforts. There is a need to compare/contrast computationally cheap and easy to exercise "crude" models and their attendant uncertainties with computationally expensive "good/accurate" models. During a crisis, is crude-but-fast good enough? In what circumstances do we really need to invest in strategies to speed-up the analysis of gleaned from better models?   Challenges for interdisciplinary scientists: funding, the academy, journals, time, communication, training.  Geohazard modeling lives at the boundary of basic research and applied research and funding calls from various agencies tend to binary in this scope. Interdisciplinary research often takes longer that discipline focused research resulting in fewer publications for early career scientist seeking jobs and securing promotion/tenure. There is no "marquee" journal for natural hazards. Associate editors and referees are often (not always) focused on methodologies within their own discipline. As such, they are often skeptical of new methodologies developed by interdisciplinary teams.        Last Modified: 12/27/2020       Submitted by: Elaine T Spiller]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
