<AbstractNarration>Global leadership in science and engineering is an important goal for the United States. To sustain such global leadership, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), through their Board on International Scientific Organizations works with the International Scientific Unions to oversee a network of US National Committees (USNCs) to facilitate US leadership, collaboration, and representation in international scientific organizations and institutions. The US National Commission on Mathematics Instruction (USNC/MI) is the US-based body of the International Commission on Mathematics Instruction (ICMI), a commission of the International Mathematical Union. This project will fund the continued operations of the USNC/MI to ensure the US remains engaged in important conversations about mathematics education across the lifespan across the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The USNC/MI will hold one face-to-face annual meeting and one virtual meeting of the USNC/MI and participate in the upcoming ICMI Studies. The USNC/MI chair also will attend the Conference Board of Mathematical Sciences meeting to keep US mathematics organizations abreast of international trends in mathematics education. USNC/MI staff will continue to facilitate international collaborations to support the improvement of mathematics education in the US and internationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
