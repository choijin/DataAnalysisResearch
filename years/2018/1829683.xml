<AbstractNarration>The goal of this workshop is to highlight scientific opportunities that can address the energy challenges in nanoelectronics in general, as symbolized by the coming end of Moore's law. This is an emerging frontier of research in Condensed Matter and Materials Physics. Some representative opportunities include the following: Spintronic materials, Valleytronics, Topological materials, Quantum information / computation, Multiferroic materials, Quantum materials, Topological excitations such as magnetic skyrmions, Ionics and neuromorphic computation.  The workshop highlights the latest progresses in these diverse directions, identify major hurdles, milestones, metrics, as well as opportunities, and facilitate interactions across traditional research boundaries. It will also address research infrastructure needs and workforce development. Workshop participants will identify emerging challenges, obstacles and bottlenecks as well as future directions of research in the topical areas. A report will be prepared, with draft report written during the workshop, and distributed to the community and made available to general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The coming end of Moore's law poses grand challenges as well as opportunities for transformative approaches to overcome the energy consumption bottleneck facing nanoelectronics and the high-tech industry. A paradigm shift moving away from conventional charge currents and field effect transistor is essential. It is encouraging to note that the thermodynamics of computation predicts vast potentials to redefine the energy landscape for future nanoelectronics.     Intellectual Merit  Currently, there are intense efforts in the Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) community in fundamental mechanisms and materials that have the potential to meet these challenges. This workshop brought together leading scientists from the CMP community to identify key challenges and to highlight scientific opportunities that can enable the quantum leap to the post-Moore's law era. The workshop featured the following promising areas.    Spintronics that allow energy-efficiently control      of spin by other degrees of freedom, such as charge, orbit, heat, light,      and strain, and vice versa, leading to a host of emerging opportunities in      spin-orbit torques, spin-to-charge conversion, topological spintronics,      voltage controlled magnetism, new magnetic tunnel junctions,      antiferromagnetic spintronics, and magnetic insulators, etc.    Topological quantum materials featuring topological      invariants could shed new insights into the workings of our universe by      providing model tabletop artifices of fundamentally interesting concepts      imagined in theory but still largely undiscovered in nature. Multiferroic materials with simultaneous      ferroelectricity and magnetism that provide a pathway to achieving strong      magnetoelectric coupling with efficient voltage control of magnetism,      leading to compact and power efficient electric-field tunable magnetic      devices. Quantum computing and information that have seen      tremendous progresses in many different approaches to quantum bits      (qubits), including superconductor qubits, semiconductor dots, and      topologically protected qubits. 2D materials for valleytronics, which exploits      the distinct, non-trivial valleys in momentum space of monolayer      materials, and twistronics, which exploits new phenomena arising from      stacking two atomic layers at non-zero twist angles away from registry.  Ionics that utilizes electric double layer or ionic      transport across interfaces to tailor the interfacial characteristics and      consequently the physical and chemical properties, leading to fascinating      opportunities in magneto-ionics and electrolyte-gated materials.    Quantum materials where qualitatively new      materials properties arise when the unfamiliar properties of the quantum realm      transcend the atomic scale. Novel spin textures such as magnetic skyrmions      that offer exciting new mechanisms for low dissipation information      storage, due to their topologically protected spin configurations in real      space. Neuromorphics that aims at dramatically increasing      the energy efficiency of cognitive computational tasks by adopting      approaches that are inspired by the functionality of the brain.   Broader Impacts  The workshop identified critical needs for facilities, infrastructures, and resources. A healthy balance between single and group investigator funding was regarded as necessary. There are critical needs for midscale instrumentation to advance materials research that can enable the quantum leap. Some of the instrumentations would take the form of smaller facilities that can be operated at universities, while others must be installed at major national facilities for access to high intensity neutron and x-ray beams. Future progresses will depend on the ability to strategically search the multidimensional materials space, which may be aided by the ever-increasing computational power and the advent of artificial intelligence and machine learning.  Essential for the envisioned quantum leap is the ability of scientists and engineers to communicate and collaborate effectively across scientific and technical disciplines, as well as national boundaries. The new "quantum workforce" must be composed of young professionals who not only already have strong foundations in the relevant scientific subject matters such as quantum mechanics, electronics, computer science, and materials science, but also can learn quickly and effectively, able to adapt promptly to new situations, making them capable of focusing on different aspects of discovery, development, and deployment.     The workshop identified an urgent need for a nationwide strategic approach to develop such a workforce in the US.  A coordinated effort was recommended on a large scale, involving industry, academia, and government agencies working in concert.  Such a nationwide approach will provide needed focus, dialog, and coordination among the major players, and can be modeled after some of the existing consortia.  The formation of a series of quantum research facilities across the US is recommended, under the auspices of a new focused Quantum consortium with financial support from government and industrial sources.
