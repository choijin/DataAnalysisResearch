<AbstractNarration>With funding from the Environmental Chemical Sciences program of the Division of Chemistry, Drs. Fernando Rosario-Ortiz and Garrett McKay, from the University of Colorado at Boulder, are studying the photochemistry of dissolved organic matter (DOM).  DOM is a mixture of organic molecules present in all aquatic environments. DOM impacts many environmental processes, including the degradation of organic contaminants in water. A fraction of the DOM absorbs sunlight, and this fraction is commonly referred to as chromophoric DOM (CDOM).  Once CDOM absorbs light, it can form a collection of reactive species, including the hydroxyl radical (OH) and other species that react in a similar manner through hydroxylation reactions. These species collectively impact how organic contaminants are degraded in the environment.  The results from this study help environmental chemists better understand the fate and transport of organic contaminants in surface waters. Data from the research are incorporated into a course and disseminated in seminars. &lt;br/&gt;The mechanism by which OH and other hydroxylating species are photochemically produced from CDOM remain unclear. Overall, the measured quantum yields for the production of OH from CDOM are very small. The low steady-state concentration and transient nature of OH require the use of probe compounds for its measurement. Over the past decade, a consensus has grown that OH formation from CDOM photolysis can be apportioned into both free OH as well as OH-like species, which are lower in energy and less reactive than free OH. The latter of these species reacts with OH probes to produce products identical to reaction with free OH. The contribution of OH-like species to overall OH reactivity is up to 50% in some instances, and thus OH-like oxidants produced from CDOM photolysis play an important role in environmental photochemical processes, and ultimately in the degradation of organic contaminants. This project focuses on characterizing the formation and reactivity of OH-like species produced in CDOM photohydroxylation reactions. To accomplish this, two aspects are evaluated. First, Drs. Rosario-Ortiz and McKay characterize the reactivity and identity of low-energy oxidants produced in CDOM photochemistry. Second, the relationship between CDOM composition and reactivity towards formation of low-energy oxidants in CDOM photohydroxylation reactions is being investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
