<AbstractNarration>This award will support travel and registration for a Doctoral Consortium and Early Career Workshop at the annual meeting of the International Society of the Learning Sciences, which in 2018 will be held in conjunction with the Artificial Intelligence in Education conference and the Association of Computing Machinery conference on Learning at Scale. The three conferences will come together as a Festival of Learning. These joint interdisciplinary conferences will offer a rare professional opportunity for doctoral students and early career professionals to converge and present cutting-edge research from the fields of artificial intelligence, learning science, computer science, cognitive and learning sciences, psychology, and educational technology. Results will contribute to the new generation of researchers in the forward-looking technical area of this interdisciplinary area, to include the learning sciences, data analytics, and artificial intelligence in education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide a travel stipend for 5 advanced graduate students to attend the Doctoral Consortium and 5 early career faculty members to attend the Early Career Workshop at the Festival of Learning. The project will also fund a shared young researchers event where 250 young researchers from the three conferences will have a poster session and panel discussion. The project will improve the dissertations of the graduate students and the research agendas of the early career, post-PhD scholars and advance the conference theme "Rethinking Learning in the Digital Age". This project will build on the expertise of the learning sciences community and the outcomes of previous workshops held with the International Conference of the Learning Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Through this project the National Science Foundation supported doctoral students and early career professionals to attend the Doctoral Consortium (DC) and Early Career Workshop (ECW) at the International Conference of the Learning Sciences (ICLS) to be held in London, UK in June 2018. 2018 was a special year for ICLS since it was the first time in its history when it was co-located with the Artificial Intelligence in Education conference and ACM?s Learning@Scale.  The three conferences came together as a Festival of Learning, hosted by University College London in the UK.  In addition to proposing for funds to run the ICLS ECW and DC, this proposal sought funds for a bridge building event that was held on the Festival Day, when all three co-located conferences overlaped.    The ICLS conference is one of two annual conferences that aims to showcase scholarship in the Learning Sciences. The intent of learning science research is to develop evidence based claims about how people learn that have theoretical, practical, and pedagogical implications. Capacity building is a central concern within the Learning Sciences community and motivated the ICLS 2018?s conference theme, Rethinking Learning in the Digital Age. ISLS has historically addressed this important issue, in part, through specialized workshops held in conjunction with the Society?s two major conferences. The DC hosts doctoral students who are working with their dissertation research, while the ECW is designed for early career scholars who have their doctorates (post-docs, faculty in early tenure track, and others) and are in the midst of shaping their career paths. Holding the workshops in conjunction with the ISLS conferences gives workshop participants access to new research, other researchers in the field and prospective employers, and revitalizes the community.    The National Science Foundation has provided funding for the DC and ECW since 2000, supporting the participation of a generation of young scholars.
