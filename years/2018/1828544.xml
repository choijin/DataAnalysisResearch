<AbstractNarration>This project will advance our understanding of the spread of fires, the design of drones, the treatment of aneurysms, the development of wind turbines and engines, designs for buildings in high winds, the dispersion of pollutants, and management of waterway ecosystems. A common feature of these disparate topics is their strong dependence on complex, three-dimensional fluid flows that change quickly in time. For example, the formation and rupture of aneurysms depends on stresses created by the unsteady swirling blood flow inside arteries. Similarly, the spread of atmospheric pollution is governed by how turbulence interacts with the pollutant particles. The next breakthroughs in these fields require measurements that can capture these 3D flows with high resolution in time and space, made possible with the acquired High-Speed 3D Velocimetry System. This equipment will be a shared resource for faculty and students, and will greatly improve the quality of research in a wide array of disciplines. Moreover, this exciting technology will be used to engage underrepresented students directly in hands-on research opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new instrumentation will provide the capability for data collection that will support a deeper understanding of the time-varying, often multi-phase flows in the situations described above by measuring the unsteady 3D velocity and particle dynamics. The system uses lasers to illuminate tracer particles placed in or already present in a flow, then the 3D velocity is determined from multiple high-speed cameras recording images of the particles from different viewpoints. These data will provide insights on swirling flows, turbulence-particle interactions, pressure fields, and fluid forces, revealing the underlying physics governing each problem. Acquiring data, such as the unsteady pressure, will allow the stresses to be connected to the flow behavior, yielding greatly-improved predictive models for a wide variety of problems, including developing the next generation of drone wings and wind turbine blades, and understanding how fish use schooling to navigate turbulent flow. The system will also substantially advance our knowledge of how sediment particles in rivers affect flow turbulence to better predict erosion and deposition. Further, the instrumentation will be used to capture 3D images of flames in turbulent combustion, measure combustion-gas emissions via an ultraviolet lens and filters, and infer temperature from flame color and intensity, enabling breakthroughs in efficiency and sustainability. In these ways, the new high-speed measurement system will engage researchers from a range of disciplines and have a transformative impact on a number of important fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>For this project, the University at Buffalo (UB) received funds to acquire a shared, high-speed 3D velocimetry system to study complex flows. The instrument will be employed in breakthrough research in the topics of energy/propulsion, health, and the environment. The principal investigators are from the Dept. of Mechanical &amp; Aerospace Engineering and Dept. of Civil, Structural, &amp; Environmental Engineering, in the School of Engineering &amp; Applied Sciences (SEAS), as well as the Dept. of Geography in the College of Arts &amp; Sciences (CAS). In addition to SEAS and CAS, the potential user base includes faculty and student researchers in the Jacobs School of Medicine &amp; Biological Sciences and the School of Dental Medicine, as well as colleagues outside UB. A multi-user management plan was developed to oversee the instrument sharing. Overall, this equipment will enable high-impact cutting-edge research over a wide range of projects for years to come.<br /><br />The instrument is capable of high-resolution, high-speed tomographic particle image velocimetry and 3D particle tracking; tomography uses 2D information to reconstruct 3D data. This system allows a new capability at UB for measuring time-varying flows which may be multi-phase, e.g. a liquid with solid particles suspended in it. The flow to be tested is seeded with non-intrusive tracer particles, or already contains particles, and a volume or "box" region containing these particles is illuminated by pulsed (strobed) lasers. Four high-speed (high-frame-rate) cameras record video of the moving, illuminated particles from unique angles. From these recordings and a calibration that maps the camera images to the real world, the time-varying 3D flow velocity is determined. Fig. 1 gives an image of the instrument setup for training with a jet flow in a water tank. These measurements will yield new knowledge of unsteady and swirling flows including turbulence-particle interactions, for a better understanding of the underlying physics for each problem.<br /><br />This system will greatly advance our knowledge of complex 3D-flows, including the spread of fires, autonomous drone aerodynamics and propulsion, aneurysm treatment and other cardiovascular phenomena, new engine designs for efficiency and sustainability, wind-turbine blade aerodynamics, pollutant dispersion, waterway-ecosystem management including sediment transport, and fish schooling. The flow data can be connected to the stresses and forces on bodies such as wings and blood-vessel walls, which is invaluable for developing new predictive models. These can be used in aerodynamic and flight-controller design, to aid with disease treatment, to develop new waterway fish-passage structures; a host of new technologies will be enabled by the scientific knowledge gained. Moreover, the 3D data are ideal for validating powerful new computer simulations. Further, it will foster new research collaborations for more interdisciplinary, high-impact projects. In this way, the instrument will lead to novel discoveries and have a transformative influence on these fields and beyond.<br /><br />To date, the equipment has been used primarily to provide a deeper knowledge of particle-turbulence interactions, which is key to understanding cloud and rain formation. Particle clustering and collisions in turbulent flow have now been studied with unprecedented resolution and at more relevant scales than was previously possible, thanks to the new capabilities of this system. Fig. 2 shows particle tracks measured by the instrument. This work has resulted in conference presentations, and publications submitted or to be submitted. The equipment has also been employed to study the combustion of slab burners as droplets are released and the fuel is depleted, with applications to hybrid rockets. Its wider use continues and it will help to address the large variety of topics given above.<br /><br />The grant has also provided training opportunities on this cutting-edge equipment. Several faculty and students, including both graduates and undergraduates and female students, have already benefited from hands-on experience with it, as well as learned the theory of its operation. Further, a workshop was held to introduce the instrument, the theory involved, and its potential applications to the wider community, and a publicly-available website was created to provide the instrument's capabilities, specifications, and facilitate sharing. As its usage continues, the instrument will be leveraged to engage more underrepresented students in hands-on research, and the results can be used in the classroom to enhance student learning.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/28/2020<br>      Modified by: Matthew&nbsp;Ringuette</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1828544/1828544_10560931_1609184617532_Training_setup_running_with_laser_crop--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1828544/1828544_10560931_1609184617532_Training_setup_running_with_laser_crop--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Training setup"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1828544/1828544_10560931_1609184617532_Training_setup_running_with_laser_crop--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Training setup"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Fig. 1  Instrument setup for training with a jet flow in a water tank.
