<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project on healthcare, quality of life, and the medical device industry is tremendous. The novel technology and advancement of biodegradable metals and biomimetic interfaces will lead to next-generation medical devices and implants that promote tissue healing and eliminate secondary surgeries for implant removal. This will improve quality of life for patients who need medical implants to support bones and tissue damaged by disease or trauma, and reduce overall healthcare costs. The project will build the foundation for commercializing biodegradable metallic implants and devices, which, in turn, will increase the competitiveness of U.S. companies in the medical device industry. The products resulting from this project will reduce pain and complications, eliminate secondary surgeries, and accelerate healing and recovery for patients who need medical implants due to trauma or disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will advance technology that eliminates the drawbacks of the non-degradable medical alloys on the market today. Magnesium (Mg) based alloys are a novel class of biodegradable metallic materials that have attractive mechanical and biological properties for a wide range of medical implant applications, such as orthopedic, spinal, dental, and craniofacial implants. The key challenge in commercializing Mg-based alloys for medical implant applications lies in controlling the degradation rate. NSF support has contributed to a novel class of biocompatible Mg alloys along with biomimetic surface treatment to provide tunable degradation rates, desirable bioactivity, and excellent mechanical strength for supporting faster healing and regeneration of damaged tissues. This novel solution contains non-toxic natural elements that induce healing and reduce inflammation, departed from traditional alloy design. The I-Corps project will transform this technology to commercially viable products that will benefit the customers in need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
