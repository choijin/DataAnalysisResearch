<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to disrupt the 1000 hours per child per year where American children have no school and no parents and deserve access to the best enrichment activities. The company plans to build a much-needed technical infrastructure for schools, enrichment providers, and parents. By automating and simplifying the process of providers supplying, parents consuming and schools hosting enrichment activities, the proposed system will remove significant friction and create an efficient market. A key invention is the company's Automatic Schedule Recommendation System which recommends a schedule of classes for a family of one or more children and satisfies constraints such as ages and driving distance, maximizes desirable attributes such as minimal driving and diversity in classes across time, and leverages historical data like classes taken in the past and social data such as classes enjoyed by friends and classmates, to make effective recommendations. The proposed technology removes the most significant friction during parents' purchases of enrichment classes, namely, piecing together a class schedule from classes across different providers. This project is the first interdisciplinary research that strategically combines algorithms from the fields of optimizations and recommender systems to solve the problem and achieve scalability and efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design, implement and evaluate an Automatic Schedule Recommendation System. Existing recommender systems are insufficient because they largely recommend a single item to a single user; this application requires that a sequence of items (namely, a sequence of classes that fit in a coherent schedule) be recommended and coordinated among a group of users (i.e. children in the same family or set of friends). Existing class scheduling algorithms are insufficient because they find optimal schedules using known preferences; in this problem there is a need to predict preferences. The company will design a fully-automatic schedule recommendation system that predicts the suitability of each session to each user using machine learning techniques and aggregates these predictions over time to propose full schedules that are most appropriate for a parent and satisfy multi-dimensional constraints. The resulting system will be deployed to the company's users along with extensive evaluation of its efficacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

In this Phase I proposal, we focused on the key technical innovation for the parents’ tool, namely,  an Automatic Schedule Recommendation system. This system enables parents to get an automatically generated class schedule for their children for a season (e.g., summer camp or after-school schedule for two children).  We meaningfully combine optimization and machine learning algorithms to create a desirable schedule that satisfies all the constraints (like ages and maximum driving distance),  maximizes the desirable properties (like minimal driving across children and diversity in classes over time), and leverages historical data (classes taken in the past) and social data (classes enjoyed by friends and classmates) to make meaningful recommendations.  Unlike traditional recommendation systems, we recommend a set of items that jointly satisfy a set of constraints. Unlike traditional scheduling systems, we are trying to come up with "learned" preferences over feasible solutions (using soft constraints). Solutions to this class of interdisciplinary problems are broadly valuable.    The key outcome from our Phase I work are as follows:    From our production usage analysis, parents can benefit from automatic schedule recommendation today with 47% of parents buying at least 2 summer camps and 32% of parents buying at least 2 after-school classes throughout the school year. We expect these numbers to go up as our business grows with more supply and demand.   We have built and shipped an automatic schedule recommendation system along with a comprehensive data platform architecture that consists of the session filter, the session ranker, the scheduler, and the schedule ranker.   We have designed a novel ILP formulation for our Scheduler that can optimize for program diversity and minimizing driving across children. Another key contribution is to enable such optimization across thousands of sessions and return an answer in seconds and reduce latency by more than an order of magnitude.   Even small businesses with small data sets in the range of 74K samples can significantly benefit from machine learning algorithms. We are able to create learning-based collaborative filtering and content-based neural network-based recommendation models that improved recommendation performance by up to 27%.   Usability is a challenge for such new user experiences; our user studies, although still ongoing, have already produced significant insights for improvements and designs in new directions.         Despite the tremendous progress we’ve made in Phase I, we have only scratched the surface in this research direction. There is significant work ahead of us. We outline the key directions below.   A unique characteristic of the 6crickets context is that a child’s interest evolves over time.  This is unlike the Netflix movie recommendation scenario where a user’s movie taste is relatively static. Designing recommendations with this characteristic is a novel direction and important for the 6crickets context.   Currently, our session ranker and schedule ranker are separate steps and done one child at a time. We want to explore tighter integration between session ranking and schedule ranking for multiple children and have a joint model to produce multi-children schedules.   We can use learning to rank schedules by learning preferences over constraints and joint scores over multiple sessions for the same child. For example, we can learn how tolerant a parent is to increasing driving time or cost to achieve a better match to the child‘s interests.  Scores over multiple sessions in a schedule for the same child can measure the distribution over program categories and capture the preference for diversity versus consistency of users.   Regional  optimization. Schedule  recommendation  optimizes  for  a  single  family.   It  is  interesting to explore how we could maximize supply consumption in a region while optimizing for individual families. For example, classes have As 6crickets grows rapidly, we will have tremendous data about the after-school enrichment industry. We want to perform data analysis to gain insights and understand the trend.    We appreciate NSF's funding for EdTech startups like 6crickets. Such research efforts would not be possible at such small businesses without NSF's support.           Last Modified: 03/08/2020       Submitted by: Helen J Wang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
