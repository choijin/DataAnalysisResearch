<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable a much wider adoption of various photomedical treatments.  Broadly speaking, photomedical treatments use light to cure diseases and promote healing.  Specifically, photodynamic therapy uses light to activate a photosensitizing chemical agent to kill cancer cells or bacterial with minimal side effects.  Moreover, photobiomodulation is the application of light to impaired or dysfunctional tissue to reduce pain and inflammation to speed healing and to promote or inhibit various cellular processes.  The light source is a critical part of any photomedical treatment system.  Existing sources such as lasers and LED arrays are bulky and expensive, generally require additional optics to deliver the light to the target treatment areas.  The current project aims to develop a photomedical treatment system based on a novel light source - quantum dot light emitting devices (QLEDs).  Flexible and large area QLEDs can be placed immediately adjacent to target treatment areas without additional optics.  Their simple driver requirements will result in much lower system costs and facilitate at-home use.  These QLED-based systems will enable the wider adoption of photomedical treatment methodologies, including in currently underserved areas and patient populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will leverage the recent invention of ultra-bright quantum dot light emitting devices (QLEDs) into a low-cost and convenient-to-use photomedical treatment system that will enable wider adoption of photomedical treatment methodologies for a variety of pathologies and use cases.  Project tasks include developing QLEDs with emitting spectra precisely tuned to match the absorption spectra of photosensitizers at 630 nanometers (nm), 635 nm and 660 nm; fabricating QLEDs on flexible substrates with device structures guided by microcavity simulations; developing a low DC voltage, current-controlled driver able to deliver a precise light dosage; and demonstrating the photomedical efficacy of thus developed QLEDs in a) ALA-PplX photodynamic therapy and associated dosimetry of oral malignancies using in-vitro 3D co-culture models of oral cancers; b) determining and optimizing parameters for photobiomodulation for wound healing applications including incisional and pressure ulcer wounds, in-vitro using multiple cell lines and models of cellular metabolism, cellular proliferation and scratch wound healing.  Successful completion of these tasks will result in a functional preliminary photomedical treatment system that lays the foundation for in-vivo animal studies of oral cancer or diabetic wound healing treatment paradigms in Phase II of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) are light-based noninvasive or minimally invasive strategies that can treat many medical conditions with substantially fewer side effects than traditional strategies such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, pharmaceuticals and wound care dressings, etc. Despite their demonstrated ability to successfully manage various diseases impacting hundreds of millions of patients, PBMT and PDT have not been widely adopted. One major reason for low adoption is that existing light sources (Lasers, LEDs or OLEDs) cannot simultaneously provide all the features necessary to deliver high-efficacy photomedicine at a low cost with easy-to-use, and safe devices. The quantum dot light emitting diode (QLED) technology developed by QLEDCures holds the promise to deliver effective, tunable, LED-like narrow band light with an OLED-like, flexible, easy-to-apply form factor and the QLED devices can be fabricated with a low-cost solution process, making them ideal light sources possessing all the desired features for PBMT and PDT use.</p> <p>&nbsp;The main objective of this Phase I project was to demonstrate the feasibility of developing flexible QLEDs as safe, easy-to-use light sources that could enable wider clinical adoption of photomedicine strategies for PBMT and PDT, at a 10-100 times lower cost than competing technologies. This project aims at major advances in two main fronts: 1) QLED engineering and 2) photomedical applications. In front 1, the goal was to establish QLED?s advantages in wavelength tunability, flexibility and low-cost solution processability. In front 2, the goals were to evaluate QLED?s PDT/PBMT treatment efficacy through <em>in vitro</em> studies and to build a prototype QLED-based photomedical device kit.</p> <p>&nbsp;Thanks to the NSF STTR grant, we achieved or exceeded these goals in both fronts. For QLED engineering, we have developed efficient QLED devices with peak positions precisely tuned to &nbsp;~630 or 650 nm and a narrow emission bandwidth (&lt;30 nm FWHM). Flexible red QLED devices were developed with a critical bending radius of 5 mm exceeding the device flexibility goal. (<strong>FIGURE 1</strong>). We also produced red-emitting QLEDs using a low-cost spin coating solution process, paving the way towards more reliable, scalable, low-cost solution processing.</p> <p>&nbsp;We evaluated capability of QLEDs as PDT and PBMT light sources by testing their efficacy compared to commercial lasers or LEDs. A prototype device driver board was developed for programmable QLED housed in a photomedical device kit (<strong>FIGURE 2</strong>). The QLED-based photomedical device kit was designed with the medical research scientist in mind and contains multiple identical QLED pixels which could be selected by the user to activate any sub-set of pixels for different experiments or evaluation. PBMT <em>in vitro</em> studies for cell metabolism and migration demonstrated the ability to increase cell metabolism and cell migration, &nbsp;and accelerate wound repair (<strong>FIGURE 3)</strong>. PDT <em>in vitro</em> studies demonstrated greater cancer cell destruction than with commercial LEDs (<strong>FIGURE 4</strong>).</p> <p>&nbsp;These results set the stage for further developments of more reliable, scalable flexible QLEDs and corresponding <em>in-vivo</em> photomedical studies in Phase II of the project.</p> <div> <hr size="1" /> </div> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/30/2021<br>      Modified by: Peter&nbsp;Palomaki</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1843101/1843101_10590640_1617128659547_Figure1flexible--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1843101/1843101_10590640_1617128659547_Figure1flexible--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Flexible QLED Photomedical Device"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1843101/1843101_10590640_1617128659547_Figure1flexible--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Flexible QLED Photomedical Device"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1.
