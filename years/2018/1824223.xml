<AbstractNarration>In October of 2017, a series of cracks were discovered on Rattlesnake Ridge south of Yakima, WA.  At that time, they were ~1 m deep.  As of late December 2017, just two months later, those same cracks had grown to over 80 m deep.  These cracks represent the lateral margin of the Rattlesnake Ridge landslide, which consists of an estimated 4 million cubic meters of material that is making its way downhill slowly.  The slowly moving rock mass sits atop a (weak) sedimentary rock layer between thicker layers of Columbia River flood basalt.  The best case (and most likely scenario) is that this material continues to move south slowly and fall into an asphalt quarry.  However, an alternative (unlikely) scenario involves catastrophic failure which could block Highway 82, and dam the Yakima River flooding the surrounding area.  The objective of this RAPID proposal is to deploy 40 nodal seismometers in the surrounding area to continuously monitor seismic signals coming from the slide. Nodal seismometers (or nodes) are small, lightweight, cable free, three-component seismometers.  This state-of-the-art technology was developed for oil and gas exploration, however, nodes can also be used to study a variety of other seismic processes, such as earthquakes and landslides.  The size and (relatively) low cost of individual sensors allows for easily deployable, dense observation networks that produce high-quality data.  The resulting dataset can be used to determine the location, timing and nature of seismic signals coming from the slide.  The spatial and temporal evolution of slide related seismicity can be used to better characterize the landslide and potentially to predict when failure may occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forty nodal seismometers will be deployed around the Rattlesnake Ridge landslide near Yakima, WA.  These instruments will be "hot swapped" every 30 days until the landslide fails or until the landslide reaches steady-state.  These deployments will result in three component seismic data from which travel times will be computed to form a 3D grid of potential sources. A network beamforming approach will be followed to detect, locate, and characterize seismic signals coming from the landslide.  This information will provide new insight into the size and nature of the slide of this rock block as well as the degree of internal deformation. This project has a potential broad societal impact and will help quantify and understand the landslide process in general.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Rattlesnake Ridge landslide is a large translational landslide in central Washington state that rapidly destabilized in late 2017.  Failure was originally signaled by a series of small (meter deep) N-S trending cracks located on the western edge of the Rattlesnake ridge anticline immediately north of an active gravel quarry.  By January of 2018, those cracks had grown to be as large as 80 m. deep and delineated the eastern edge of an approximately 3 million cubic meter landslide.  Increased concern over the stability of the ridge, and its proximity to a small community, Hwy 82, and the Yakima River, resulted in the closure of Thorp Rd. and the evacuation of homes immediately south of the active slide body.  Over 50 local, state, and federal agencies were involved in the emergency management effort which made national news headlines.  Since that time, the slide has continued to deform reaching peak deformation rates of ~0.5 meters/week in April of 2018.     Nodal seismometers or "nodes" are lightweight, wireless, three-component, short-period (5 Hz) seismometers. The technology was developed for oil and gas exploration; however, nodes can be used to record a variety of seismic processes and are ideal for studying small magnitude earthquakes due to their sensitivity to relatively high frequency (i.e. &gt;1 Hz) seismic waves. Each Node is approximately six inches tall, five inches in diameter, and has a spike at the base of the instrument that couples it to the ground.  Each instrument takes approximately 5 minutes to deploy and the batteries, recording system, and GPS are all internal hence the setup is entirely cable-free.  The (relatively) low cost of individual sensors allows for easily deployable, dense observation networks that produce high-quality data.  Once the 30-day battery life is depleted the instruments can be recharged and data harvested in approximately four hours.  This award supported the deployment of nodal seismometers near and on the slide body to record high frequency earthquakes associated with slide deformation.  Instruments were deployed, recorded for ~30 days, and were then hot-swapped (i.e. each instrument at the end of its battery life was replaced with another fresh instrument) to minimize lapses in recording.  The resulting dataset is a four-month long record of continuous seismic data from 40 instruments.     Analysis of this data reveals a dataset that is rich in high-frequency, small magnitude earthquakes.  These events manifest as coherent amplitude changes recorded on multiple stations that have clear moveout and, in some cases, clear P and S wave arrivals.  While many of the events in this time period are smaller and manifest only on a subset of stations other events are visible at most of the stations in the network.  Cross correlation of detected events reveals that many events that occur at different times have nearly identical waveforms (i.e. cross correlation coefficients above 0.95).  These repeating earthquakes likely represent persistent patches of fault that repeatedly radiate seismic energy.  In summary, this four-month dataset can be used to better understand the mechanics of faults and landslide deformation processes.
