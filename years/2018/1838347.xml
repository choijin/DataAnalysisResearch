<AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to organize the logistics portion of the annual Principal Investigators (PI) meeting for the National Robotics Initiative (NRI), which was launched in 2011. The PI meeting brings together the community of researchers, companies, and program officers who are actively engaged in the NRI to provide cross-project coordination in terms of common intellectual challenges, methods for education and training, best practices in education, technology transfer and general outreach, and a centralized and lasting repository illustrating the research ideas explored and milestones achieved by the NRI projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting of the Principal Investigators of the National Robotics Initiative will be two days in October 2018 in the vicinity of Washington DC. The format will include presentations by the attending PIs of projects in their final year, a poster session with all other projects, keynote speeches, and panel discussions. Invitations to the meeting will include all PIs with active NRI grants, program managers with robotics-related programs, and members of the press. This award will take care of the venue, travel, A/V, supplies, and many of the personnel involved in organizing the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

NRI PI meetings are designed to:  &middot;       advance knowledge by exposing the rich progress of basic research in the accelerated development and use of collaborative robots  &middot;       learn about the efficacy of new, emerging NRI research and applications  &middot;       discuss technology gaps and barriers  &middot;       allow PIs to showcase their research results  &middot;       provide an environment to network  The program of the meeting included invited keynotes, PI research project talks, PI research project poster sessions, and panel discussions about NRI research-related projects funded by NSF and other Federal agencies.   Keynote presentations were delivered by Professor Steven M. Lavalle (University of Oulu, Finland) and Professor John J. Leonard (MIT). Professor Lavalle spoke about The Path to (Human) Perception Engineering on day 1.
