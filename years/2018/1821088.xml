<AbstractNarration>Technology is transforming the scale and scope of environmental research.   Just as smartphones and social media have transformed the way people interact and acquire their news, breakthroughs in image processing, GPS satellite and wireless animal trackers as well as DNA and stable isotope analytical tools are emboldening scientist to solve old ecological and environmental problems in new ways and to design new studies that ask and answer questions that were inconceivable only a few years ago.  At the 22,000 ha Mpala Research Center in central Kenya, US scientists from over a dozen US universities and Institutes supported by 14 NSF and NIH grants, resulting in 197 publications in the last 5 years, study the ecology of a 20,000 Km2 semi-arid ecosystem that sustains the second most diverse array of wildlife in Kenya as well as supporting livelihoods of commercial ranchers, pastoral herders and farmers who share the landscape with this wildlife.   It is a model system that supports large scale experiments that are difficult to do within the continental US.  Moreover, the Mpala, Research Center, especially with the new modern lab envisioned, continues to serve as an educational laboratory that teaches US undergraduate and graduate students of all ethnicities and walks of life how do real, important, relevant and transformative science. In addition, their interactions with students, faculty and PIs from Kenya and around the world provide a diversity of perspectives that will make them broader scientists able to work within different cultures.  In this way, Mpala is training the next generation of environmental leaders, some of whom will practice science, but others of whom will shape science policy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At Mpala, research generally focuses on the biogeochemistry as well as the population, community and behavioral dynamics of the animals and plants inhabiting the ecosystem.   But as strong as the research has been to date, advances in DNA and genetical analytical techniques will transform science, allowing more in depth looks at the diets, the competitive and mutualistic relationships of animal species comprising food webs as well as the population genetics of species spread across expansive spatial and temporal scales.  Similar advances in stable isotope analytical tools will enable novel and more detailed investigations into the functioning of the ecosystem, closer examination of water use by plants that drive and limit photosynthesis as well as those of animals that shape their movements, habitat uses and overall decision-making, and the paleoecology of many extinct species, including our human ancestors.   These new tools will also provide important insights underlying interactions among wildlife and people, thus helping reduce conflict that accompanies human population growth and expansion.  In order to carry out this research, the new analytical tools must be purchased and a new 'clean' building that isolates the equipment form the harsh, dusty and hot tropical climatic elements of central Kenya must be constructed.  This new facility will propel the NSF and NIH supported scientists and their students to uncover new rules shaping environmental patterns and processes that were impossible to study before the emergence of these new technological advances.  What is learned in Kenya where biodiversity is high and the land is shared between people and wildlife easily applies to similar ecosystems, species and problems found in the western and southwestern states in the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ New Technologies for expanding the scale of research at the Mpala Research Center  Technology is transforming the scale and scope of environmental research. Breakthroughs in image processing, GPS satellite and wireless animal trackers as well as DNA and stable isotope analytical tools are emboldening scientist to solve old ecological and environmental problems in new ways.  To do this on site in Kenya and to empower students&mdash;US, Kenyan and worldwide--who will be the researchers of tomorrow, we built the only laboratory in Kenya, and perhaps all of East Africa, that can: 1) undertake DNA research to analyze the genomics of animal, plant and human populations; 2) use stable isotope analyses to investigate the biogeochemistry of soils, water and the overall dynamics of ecosystems; and 3) assess the health, well-being and disease status of wildlife and livestock by measuring immune and hormonal dynamics of individuals and populations.    The building with its three labs was completed at the end of 2019 and was outfitted with equipment in early 2020 just as the Covid-19 pandemic began.  Despite this major disruption to field research, much has been accomplished.  Here are some of the important milestones.  1)  DNA Lab.    This new research facility has been instrumental to a number of DNA related projects.  Professor Ayroles of Princeton recently started the Turkana Genome project which examines how the transition of many Turkana to urban settings has exposed them to new diets, pollutants and pathogens. Ayroles is asking: have these changes led to stress and if so, what about changed phenotypes are driven by underlying genomic change?  So far, a region containing a kidney-expressed gene involved in fluid balance--the response to dehydration, and the elimination of waste products produced during the breakdown of purine-rich foods such as red meat has been found and appears implicated with changes in overall health.  Projects like this one not only allows us to retrace how humans have evolutionarily adapted to a new environment--in this case, desert living--but also tell us how disruption of these systems may lead to disease  Professor Ayroles and Professor Dan Rubenstein of Princeton have begun extracting the DNA of all 2815 Grevy’s zebras in Laikipia and Samburu counties to sequence the genome to determine what genetic factors are playing in preventing the species from expanding its numbers and ranges.   This new facility has also been instrumental for courses we teach at Mpala.  One is called "Genomics in Wild". By partnering with members of the local community, students collect material from which they extract DNA, amplify target regions with PCR, and then use Oxford Nanopore and Illumina technologies to sequence the student-collected samples.  At the end of the course, they present their results to the entire Mpala community in a series of short talks.  2) Stable Isotope Lab.  After construction was completed, the Paleo and Ecohydrology Research at the Mpala Isotope Lab (PERMILab) was established and outfitted.  COVID-19, however, has significantly impacted the typical research schedule at Mpala in 2020.   Prior to the pandemic, one of the new lab co-directors, Professor Kevin Uno of Columbia University taught an undergraduate course at Mpala that utilized the PERMILab extensively.  Students extracted soil and plant waters and analyzed the waters for d18O and d2H values to investigate ecohydrology at Mpala.  Uno has developed a website for the lab,  kevinuno.com\permilab, that describes the lab, its services, and its mission. Next summer, Uno plans to teach a Paleoecology short course as part of his NSF-CAREER project and will emphasize recruiting URM and BIPOC participants, which will include 9-12 graduate students, postdocs, or early career faculty. This short course is also planned for 2023 and 2024.  3) Health Suite.  Health monitoring of free-ranging wildlife is of critical importance to diagnosing and treating disease in individual animals and studying how interactions with their environment can affect their survival. The "Health Suite" is designed to carry out research on ‘OneHealth’ by diagnosing disease of wildlife and livestock from across Central Kenya and how particular diseases are related to wildlife ecology, evolution and behavior.  Setup has was led by the Smithsonian Global Health program, working with partners at University of Manchester and Princeton and has already been used to train 25 East African veterinarians on advanced rhino medicine, and provided research facilities for two Kenyan students to complete their Masters degrees and fellowship-level research projects on rhino and elephant reproductive physiology   Rubenstein and Ayroles, along with a team of scientists from the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Manchester submitted a joint EEID collaborative proposal (Program call: NSF 20-585) to develop predictive models after identifying disease hot spots on how land use and climate change are affecting the emergence of zoonotic diseases that could harm people and livestock.
