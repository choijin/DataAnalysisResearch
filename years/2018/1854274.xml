<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation improvement project examines how Black and indigenous political identities intersect with respect to the creation and management of protected natural areas. While there have been many studies on political identity and conservation, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the intersection of complex identities and conservation. Some traditional groups in the Americas, for instance, claim both Black and indigenous political identities simultaneously. Such communities often predate the countries in which they now exist, many occupying areas historically assumed to be uninhabitable. Such groups also face land insecurity, while at the same time playing an important role in conservation. Understanding the political identities, territorial claims, and ecological knowledge of these distinct communities has important implications for the creation and management of protected natural areas. The research findings will be disseminated through conference presentations, academic publications, and stakeholder meetings. Results will be communicated through written policy statements and recommendations to government offices, development agencies, non-governmental organizations, and local stakeholders. As a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research uses a comparative case study approach, analyzing and comparing the experiences of two Maroon settlements, African-descended peoples who also claim indigenous status. Both communities are located in forested areas of Jamaica, with different levels of environmental protection and state governance. This research has three objectives: 1) identify how Maroons describe and interpret their identity to negotiate claims on territory and protected area management; 2) identify how state officials describe and interpret Maroon identity, claims on territory, and protected area management; and 3) identify ways tensions between diverse stakeholders are resolved. The doctoral student will employ a range of qualitative methods, including: semi-structured key informant interviews; participant observation; and collection and analysis of archival documents (survey reports, environmental management plans, policy papers, and maps). These methods will be complemented by collaboration and affiliation with local communities and environmental non-governmental organizations. Although this research project will focus on Maroons in Jamaica, the findings will provide insights into Afro-Indigeneity and protected area management elsewhere in the Americas, including in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The research project explored Jamaican Maroons and their history anew through Black Geographies, Political Ecology, and African Diaspora Studies. Drawing on the theoretical and methodological insights from these literatures, the project examined the spatial agency, spatial histories, and epistemologies of the Maroons, and considered what the development and continued existence of Maroon societies means for the social and racial politics of property, environmental history and natural resource governance, and geographies (real and imagined) of colonial Jamaica, postcolonial Jamaica, and the wider Atlantic World. Black spatial thought provides the main analytical scaffold for the project. The project highlights how in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the Maroons placed restrictions on the agrarian transformation of the hinterlands of Jamaica, imagined as a frontier. Limiting white occupation of these remote parts, the Maroons affected the trajectory of the plantation economy&rsquo;s development. The disruption of the white regime of property, and related social codes enforcing Black enslavement, has often been examined with a focus on the dramatic confrontations between the Maroons and the English government. The attention to Maroon resistance and the consequent English capitulation which was formalized in peace treaties between both parties has informed a bifurcated debate about Maroon heroism and racial betray. Black Geographies, Political Ecology, and African Diaspora Studies allowed for the expansion of the frame from the focus on the Maroons moral character and their remarkable success against the English. To be sure the Maroons&rsquo; fraught position as liberator and post-treaty government militia remains an important consideration. However, their roles and responsibilities enter a renewed discussion to highlight the effects they had on the contours of environmental governance, environmental experimentation, and scientific knowledge production. In this way, a wider frame of analysis allows the Maroons geographical impacts to come into view. The project shows Maroons shaped material and symbolic geographies in a number of ways. For example, the project shows how the development of the internal division of space into sub-national jurisdictions&mdash;the parish system&mdash;can be read as inextricably connected to the patterns of order and disorder which the Maroons shape. In other ways, such as the development of transportation infrastructure, the Maroons were center of consideration. Directly and indirectly, the Maroons, therefore, mediated the political economy of development and shaped the place of Jamaica in the political, social, and economic geographies of the British Empire. Reading the stories about the Maroons passed down via oral traditions that honor Maroon ancestors and Maroon territory, as part of a rich poetics of space and relations, the project positions contemporary Maroon struggles for recognition as an opening for understanding a Maroon fugitive epistemology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Examining these aspects of the social, cultural, and racial geographies as well as political ecologies of maroonage, the project argues, allows us to critically and creatively revise reductionist and racist colonial histories.
