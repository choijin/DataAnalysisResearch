<AbstractNarration>NSF support is requested for a symposium designed to serve as an inspiration to women studying, working, and teaching in STEM fields. The symposium will be held October 5 and 6, 2018, at the Babson Executive Conference Center in Wellesley, Massachusetts. This symposium will bring together women at all career stages in STEM, with the goal of connecting women and strengthening their connections in their fields. The award will help fund room rental costs as well as travel and hotel costs for the three keynote speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As is well documented, women continue to be underrepresented in the sciences. Although a higher percentage of women than men currently earn college degrees, fewer women go into STEM fields, and those who do are more likely to drop out. This symposium offers a venue for discussing issues of recruiting and retention, as well as broadening the participation of the STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Maria Mitchell Women in Science Symposium (MMWISS) was created to celebrate the 200th birthday of the first female, American woman astronomer, Maria Mitchell. As is well known, women continue to be under-represented in the sciences. &nbsp;According to the 2014 Science and Engineering Indicators report by the National Science Foundation, women comprised just 28% of workers in science and engineering occupations in 2010. This under-representation shortchanges the students, the field of science, and the public that benefits from scientific advancement. Maria Mitchell was a firm believer in women's education and more specifically, women in science, and the MMA has worked tirelessly to support and encourage women to pursue careers in the sciences since its founding in 1902.</p> <p>MMWISS was designed to serve as a source of inspiration and support and to be a hands-on experience in which all attendees were actively participating and problem-solving. The goals for the MMWISS attendees were to:</p> <ul> <li>Learn from prominent women scientific leaders </li> <li>Discuss issues and ideas to develop new initiatives </li> <li>Connect with mentors and other individuals </li> <li>Inspire attendees to continue to grow in their field and beyond </li> <li>Develop professional relationships, collaborations, support systems and tools to advance in the sciences/promote women and girls in the sciences </li> <li>Develop real-world solutions and plans to implement in their workplace/institution </li> </ul> <p>The first Maria Mitchell Women in Science Symposium (MMWISS) was held October 4 - 5, 2018 at the Babson Executive Conference Center in Wellesley, MA. It was sold out - with many requests and a waitlist - and received a wonderful and positive reception with many wanting to attend again in 2020. We welcomed approximately 150 attendees which included professors, teachers (K-12), students at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-doc levels, school/university administrators, professionals, and the general public.</p> <p>MMWISS consisted of four keynote speakers, a series of panel discussions, and small break-out group, 'salon-style,' discussions.&nbsp; The keynote speakers were:</p> <ul> <li>Kate Kirby, PhD, Executive Officer of the American Physical Society </li> <li>Jill Tarter, PhD, Chair Emeritus for SETI Research and former Director of SETI Institute</li> <li>Dava Sobel, award-winning author of books including <em>Longitude</em>, <em>Galileo's Daughter</em>, <em>The Glass Universe</em><em> </em></li> <li>Meg Urry, PhD, Israel Munson Professor of Physics and Astronomy and Director of the Yale Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics. President of the American Astronomical Society 2013-2017 </li> </ul> <p>While the panel discussion topics were:</p> <ul> <li>Recruitment:      How to Bring Women and Girls into STEM</li> <li>Retention:      Strategies for Stemming the Leaky Pipeline and Ending Unconscious Bias</li> <div> <li>The Future: Where Are We Going      and How Do We Get There? The Future of Women and Girls in STEM</li> </div> </ul> <p>We are happy to report that all of the goals were met with incredibly positive feedback from the attendees - assessed by both a paper and an electronic post-conference survey.&nbsp; The small-group, 'salon-style' discussions where attendees met in smaller assigned groups to discuss the panel topics in more detail received great feedback.&nbsp; Attendees were able to develop real world solutions and ideas that they could take back to their places of work/education and use to begin to make differences for women in the STEM fields.&nbsp; The salons were led by panelists and other attendees in the STEM fields and all of the note takers were undergraduate students who were MMWISS attendees and scholarship recipients.&nbsp; Some individuals were not sure what to expect and found that this aspect of the MMWISS was invaluable, enjoyable, and a great way to further connect with potential mentors and colleagues.&nbsp;</p> <p>Providing a supportive platform for women and girls in the STEM fields is critical to the future of the sciences and to making sure that all are represented, served, and given a voice in the STEM fields.

This Award ran for approximately ten years until it ended.
