<AbstractNarration>The project supports a workshop on 'Multiscale Modeling in Biology', to be held on May 20-22, 2019 at the University of Minnesota.  Biological systems often involve complex processes that span spatial and temporal scales, ranging from the molecular and cell levels to the tissue and organism levels.  The development of multiscale mathematical models, capable of resolving the interaction between phenomena at each scale, is instrumental in understanding these processes. The conference aims to foster an exchange of ideas between researchers working in diverse biological applications using common multiscale modeling frameworks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the conference will be on mathematical models spanning the molecular, cellular and tissue scales, with an emphasis on problems that involve signal transduction, shape changes, movement, and growth. A variety of biological application areas will be represented, including tissue organization, development, and cancer. A key theme will be the interplay of mechanics and biochemistry, which is central to many of these problems. To this end, 18 confirmed speakers will present work spanning the development of new multiscale techniques and their application in reaction dynamics, signaling networks, cell motility, development and tumor dynamics. In addition, the workshop will bring together a new generation of researchers with established topical experts to cultivate new collaborations and networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Biological systems often involve complex processes such as biochemical andmechanical signal transduction, growth, and movement that span spatial andtemporal scales ranging from the molecular and cell levels to the tissue andorganism levels. While there has been enormous progress toward understanding individual processes in recent decades, integration of these processes at different levels remains a major challenge.  The reproducibility of biological phenomena suggests the presence of universal principles that may be at play at the interface between the microscopic and macroscopicin biological systems.     This award funded a conference on `Multiscale modeling in biology,'  on May 20-22, 2019 at the University of Minnesota.  This conference brought together researchers and students working to understand these principles.  The workshop fostered the exchange of ideas between researchers working in diverse biological applications using multiscale modeling frameworks. Talks and discussion spanned the application topics of tissue organization, cancer, development, biomechanics and biochemistry -- using a diverse array of methods including continuum and cell-based modeling approaches.     Intellectual merit  This conference brought together researchers working on the molecular, cellular and tissue scale, with an emphasis on problems that involve signal transduction, shape changes, movement, and growth. The resulting discussions and talks examining the interplay of mechanics and biochemistry, which is central to such problems, are expected to advance the field.        Broader Impacts  Preference in distributing funding was given to junior researchers, e.g. graduate students and postdocs, and individuals from underrepresented groups.  Overall, 17 out of 50 participants were female (34%), of which one student was from an underrepresented minority group.  7 out of 24 speakers were female (30%).
