<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project proposes the creation of a unique, art-centric e-learning platform aimed at sparking the interest of young learners in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). This extensible software platform implements a new category of e-learning based on the ample body of research in educational psychology and technology that advocates the use of art and guided play to teach STEM. This project will test the hypothesis that an e-learning system based on scientific illustration sparks engagement and enhances learning in young students. With students disengaging from STEM at an increasing rate, it is critical to make more tools available to teachers that connect student with STEM. STEM-related fields will drive innovation in our economy for decades to come; opening new pathways to vastly broaden participation in STEM is critical to our economic future. This project also proposes the creation of an online community and marketplace supporting STEM education through this platform. This will connect teacher-to-teacher for sharing best practices in teaching science using art and can make a deep and broad impact on the way STEM is taught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built on scientific illustration and coupled with a set of tangible user interface (TUI) devices that mimic scientific instruments, this e-learning platform brings student hand-drawn art to life, creating interactive lessons that correlate to Next Generation Science Standards. As this system will be extensible and customizable, a major part of the R&amp;D effort will be to create an easy-to-use templating toolkit that any teacher can leverage to develop custom lessons in STEM. The Phase I goal will be to create a fully functioning product and assess this system in elementary school classrooms. This toolkit will be developed in collaboration with Curio Interactive?s educational partners, as well as the Pacific Science Center, where Curio Interactive is a startup in residence, to rapidly develop this system, continuously iterating the software with real testers, following agile development methods. One of this project?s objectives is to appeal to groups historically underrepresented in STEM. Because this platform will be visual and kinetic, highly affordable, and universally available via the web, the proposed platform will improve the equity and accessibility of learning science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Teachers and school administrators are eager to find tools supporting Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) while providing opportunities for inquiry, curiosity, questioning, and building self-confidence. To address these critical needs in schools, we created an innovative art-based STEM learning platform that could test our hypothesis that the integration of art and play into science learning would increase student engagement in STEM. Curio’s online platform, called the Curio Classroom,&#8203; incorporates both art and guided play into STEM education for young learners. &#8203;The Curio Classroom is the first e-learning system that truly implements user-created art as a core component of its e-learning tool.

Our early testing has shown this platform does have the potential to dramatically and uniquely improve STEM education, especially among young learners, where such a tool is urgently needed.  The Curio Classroom’s main innovation is that &#8203;drawing directly on paper with crayons and colored pencils &#8203;is&#8203; the "user interface."&#8203; The Curio Classroom magically &#8203;brings student hand-made drawings to life&#8203; in the form of interactive lessons in STEM. Students choose from a set of custom &#8203;tangible user interface devices &#8203;to explore their drawings. Curio’s tangible user interface devices resemble handheld x-ray machines, magnifying glasses, microscopes, miniature telescopes, and "magic looking glasses" that make the hidden world visible. Critically, the Curio Classroom is built as a toolkit. It is &#8203;customizable and extensible&#8203;, giving teachers the option of using the lessons in the platform "right out of the box," or customizing the platform to match their own custom content based on their own unique classrooms, experiences, and specialties.   A key component of the Curio Classroom is that it is based on helping young students learn scientific illustration techniques: careful observation, critical thinking, documenting, clear communication, and accuracy -- all critical STEM skills as well.  We worked with a team of educators to create a set of supplemental classroom activities for grade levels K - 5. By creating opportunities for kids to "see and draw like scientists," we created a new entry point for science learning -- one that approaches science through art. All of our activities were created to support the NGSS framework. We tested the Curio Classroom, which included both printed student workbooks as well as online, interactive elements, in formal classroom settings to look for signals of student engagement, acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness. We also conducted interviews with teachers to learn from their experiences using the Curio Classroom. Each science learning activity was co-developed with teachers to support NGSS, integrate cross-curricular connections, and provide opportunities for social emotional learning. We learned from teachers that each of these needs must be met in order to try a new supplemental activity in a classroom. Each activity developed included a Teacher Guide, Student Workbooks, reference images/illustrations, access to online interactives, and instructions for use. Our initial assessments have shown us that the integration of art and play into science learning does increase student engagement.
