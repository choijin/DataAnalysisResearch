<AbstractNarration>Precipitation is a vital element of the Earth system. Where and when it occurs, and in what amount, affects the planning of individuals, communities, regions, and nations. For these reasons, there is clear justification for measuring precipitation. From a scientific perspective, the measurement of precipitation is important for understanding Earth's atmospheric, hydrological, and energy cycles. Improved weather forecasts and improved weather notification are two societal benefits that stem from making, analyzing, and improving precipitation measurements. In this project, multiple versions of a relatively new precipitation measurement system, the hotplate gauge, are investigated.  Collocated deployment of multiple hotplates during precipitation events and analysis of data from these systems and events, is the basis of the research. The goal is to enhance scientific confidence in hotplate measurements of precipitation and wind speed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significant problem in hydrometeorology is quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE). The foundation of QPE is measurements of precipitation made with precipitation gauges. In the case of snowfall, measurements obtained from weighing gauges can be compromised by gauge capping, delay in registration of snowfall, and by wind-induced snow particle undercatch. For each of these, bias on the order of a factor of two is consistent with present understanding. This project extends a new paradigm in ground-based measurement of snowfall. The basis is the hotplate technology developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the Desert Research Institute. Because a hotplate's upward- and downward-facing surfaces are maintained at 70 degrees Celsius, this type of precipitation system is immune to capping and delay errors and its measurement of wind speed is not compromised by icing. Since 2005, a private company has been licensed to market the hotplate. Approximately 70 have been sold. Testing of a subset of these has revealed substantial error in the determination of wind speed, and thus, in determination of both snow particle catch efficiency and precipitation amount. In this project, a solution to the speed bias problem is investigated. This project aims to establish the applicability of a new speed bias correction for four collocated hotplate systems, the applicability of a new snow particle catch efficiency function based on the corrected wind speed, and that these modifications lead to consistency among the wind and precipitation measurements obtained from the four collocated systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
