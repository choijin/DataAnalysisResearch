<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "Workshop on Analysis, Approximation Theory, Operator Theory and their Interactions", a meeting that will take place during March 13-16, 2018, on the campus of Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. Additional information about the conference can be found on the website http://u.osu.edu/costin.10/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop on Analysis, Approximation Theory, Operator Theory and their Interactions will engage participants in an interesting blend of approximation theory, operator theory, and general analysis. It is intended to provide opportunities for interaction among workers in these areas, to set future research directions and provide an opportunity for young workers to learn important aspects of the field. The latter will be accomplished by a series of expository lectures by leading experts. The following subareas will be emphasized during the workshop: orthogonal polynomials and systems, wavelet theory (and its use in approximation of Besov and Sobolev spaces), special functions, interpolation of operators, s-numbers and entropy numbers for operators on Banach spaces and their approximations, nuclear operators, eigenvalues of operators (including non-selfadjoint) and applications of approximation and operator theory. This will be an important conference on approximation and operator theory that will significantly impact the future interaction of these fields.</AbstractNarration>

There was plenty of time for discussions and interactions, questions and ideas among different areas were exchanged, new collaborations have started.  The life and work of Paul Nevai and of Boris Mityagin were also celebrated.  After the workshop was concluded, many participants remained in Columbus for two more days to participate to the  regional AMS meeting. A special session, Recent Advances in Approximation Theory and Operator Theory I, II, III, was co-organized by  participants, covering areas related to the topics of the workshop; this helped disseminate the recent results to a more general audience.
