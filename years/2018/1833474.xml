<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this award is to support travel expenses for students to attend HARMONY 2018 to be hosted by University of Oxford in Oxford, UK from June 18th to 22nd. This workshop is instrumental in making progress in the development of standards in synthetic biology. Currently, most standardization efforts are either unfunded or only have very limited support. The success of these standards hinges on the donation of time from many individuals to participate in discussions, write specifications, serve as standards editors, and attend workshops. Many of these individuals working on the development of standards are students based in the US who would find it difficult to find the funds to attend this meeting. Therefore, this award helps support travel, lodging, and registration expenses for US based students working on systems and synthetic biology standards. Not only would this be a valuable experience for these participants, but it would also greatly enhance the COMBINE goal of bringing together researchers in synthetic biology with those working in systems biology leading to integrated standards and shared software and infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Standards for data exchange are critical to the development of any field since they enable researchers and practitioners to exchange information reliably, apply a variety of tools to their problems, and reproduce scientific results. The COmputational MOdeling in Biology NEtwork (COMBINE) was created in 2010 to organize standardization efforts for systems biology. The HARMONY workshop is organized by COMBINE and will be held at the University of Oxford in the UK, from June 18th to 22nd 2018. The major goals of this workshop will be: (a) Develop synergistic relationships between systems and synthetic biology researchers. (b) Produce a tighter integration of standard development for systems and synthetic biology. (c) Engage in outreach to modelers and experimentalists. (d) Develop a coordinated effort to advocate the use of standards in publications and archival databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ While this project was initially to support student travel expanes to attend HARMONY 2018 in Oxford, United Kingdom, due to the lateness of the award, we were only able to recruit three students to participate.  Therefore, the extra funds were coupled with another NSF travel award (#1835090) to support student travel to COMBINE Forum 2018 in Boston, Massachusetts.  In particularly, this project fully supported travel expenses for three students (two of which are female) to attend HARMONY 2018, and it provided partial travel support for 13 students (3 female and 3 more from other underrepresented groups) to attend COMBINE Forum 2018.  These events are organized annually by the Computational Modeling in Biology Network (COMBINE).  The goal of these events are to promote the development of the standards and supporting infrastructure for systems and synthetic biology, as well as, interoperability between these standards.  The primary COMBINE standards are the systems biology markup language (SBML), systems biology graphical notation (SBGN), simulation experiment description markup language (SED-ML), the biological pathway (BioPAX) description language, the cell markup language (CellML), the neurological modeling language (NeuroML), and the synthetic biology open language (SBOL).   At HARMONY, there are not many oral presentations; instead, the majority of the time is devoted to community discussions and software development.  The COMBINE Forum, on the other hand, has a combination of invited talks, contributed talks, and breakout sessions.  For the COMBINE Forum, all supported students gave either an oral or poster presentation.  During HARMONY and the breakout sessions at the COMBINE Forum, the students were able to participate in the discussions related to the next versions of the COMBINE standards and related efforts.  For example, the three students who joined HARMONY helped with the SBOL 2.2.1 specification that was released shortly after the meeting.  At the COMBINE Forum, the students contributed to discussions on, among other things, four specifications that were finalized: SBOL Version 2.3.0, SBGN PD L1V2, SBML L3V2R2, and SBOLv 2.1.
