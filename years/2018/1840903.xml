<AbstractNarration>Most organisms respond to environmental and social stressors by a stress response. However, knowledge of how the stress response is integrated across levels of organization from molecules, to cells, to the whole organism remains limited. This symposium will bring together biologists across levels of organization and at different career stages to gain a richer insight into how organisms respond to stress. During the symposium, speakers from different levels of organization will alternate with one another. Immediately following the symposium, a structured round table discussion will be hosted aimed at identifying key outstanding questions in stress biology and integrative approaches that can be used to study the stress responses of animals, including domesticated and rare species, across levels of organization. There will also be complimentary oral and poster sessions geared towards early career scientists from diverse backgrounds to increase the potential for idea exchange and collaborations between scientists at different career stages and that traditionally study the stress response at different levels of analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most organisms initiate a highly conserved stress response in the face of environmental and social stressors. Yet, information about how the stress response is integrated across levels of biological organization from genomes to phenomes is incomplete. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of the stress response will require integrative studies that span levels of analyses. This information will be critical for predicting how selection will influence the expression of this complex phenotype at the organismal level, as well as how the integration of the underlying mechanisms will influence the evolutionary response to selection. As diverse organisms are expected to experience rising stress exposure in the face of anthropogenic disturbance and rapidly changing environments, this knowledge is becoming increasingly urgent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Yet, we currently lack information about how the stress response is integrated across levels of biological organization from molecules to the whole organism. This information will be critical for predicting which organisms are likely to be more sensitive to stress exposure and how the ability to cope with stress is likely to change over time. As many organisms are expected to experience greater stress exposure in the face of anthropogenic disturbance and climate change, this information is becoming increasingly urgent.   Intellectual Merit: The symposium brought together researchers that study the stress response in diverse organisms across levels of organization from molecular (i.e., transcriptomic and epigenetic), to whole organism hormonal and behavioral responses to gain unique insight into how organisms respond to and cope with exposure to stressors. At the end of the symposium there was a focused round table discussion where participants identified gaps in knowledge and novel, integrative research approaches that could be used to move the field of stress biology forward.   Broader Impacts: In addition to enhancing our understanding of how organisms respond to and cope with stress exposure, this symposium fostered discussions and collaborations between early career and more senior scientists. There were 9 papers produced as a result of this symposium that were published in a special issue of Integrative and Comparative Biology.
