<AbstractNarration>With the increased availability, prominence, and applicability of data in all of our lives, the emerging&lt;br/&gt;field of Translational Data Science is critical to harnessing societal benefit from advances in data-related&lt;br/&gt;scientific disciplines. The unprecedented growth in the creation and use of data offers new opportunities&lt;br/&gt;for fostering more effective bridges between researchers, industry and government colleagues, and a&lt;br/&gt;diverse community to enable new scientific progress and tangible advances for societal benefit.  This workshop will focus on academic research and industry expertise to further cooperation and partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Translational data science is an emerging field that applies data science principles, techniques, and&lt;br/&gt;technologies to scientific challenges that hold the promise of having an important societal impact. It&lt;br/&gt;focuses on the interface and interactions between foundational aspects of data science and their use in&lt;br/&gt;advancing scientific frontiers. By convening a diverse community of stakeholders who can contribute to the strategic development of a Translational Data Science roadmap, this workshop will build and strengthen connections across sectors. The perspectives and insights shared from industry, government, nonprofits, and academia, coupled with discussions focused on actionable challenges and measurable outcomes, will serve to advance the field of data science as well as related fields and application areas. The workshop provides a mechanism for identifying high-priority topics and high-impact opportunities for future research, training, and collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As part of the NSF initiative ?Harnessing the Data Revolution? a two-day workshop was held as the second of three meetings on Translational Data Science (TDS) ? this one exploring the confluence of industrial and academic pursuits in this emerging area.  The assembled group of 46 participants from across the nation how translation applies to the field of data science, and what activities drive success in basic research and in diverse application. To develop a creative atmosphere, it opened with a panel ?looking back? on the success of the emerging field from the year 2025.  This was followed with ones mapping the TDS ecosystem and exploring the interactions and differences among academia and industry in regard to TDS, before breaking into nine small group discussions on Ethics, Process-driven data science , Importance of reproducibility           , Public data science, Machine learning and causal inference convergence, Translational data science education, Translational Data Science scientific software stack, Academic career incentives, and Land grant systems.  A final panel returned to the primary framing, ?What is Translational Data Science and what?s needed to make it happen??, informed by the entire discussion.   It was generally recognized that the use of the word ?translational? in medicine was to address a problem that might not exist in data science. Starting with this notion, as well as using the four definitions from the first workshop, the group sought consensus on a definition for TDS. The answer embraced two central concepts: (1) TDS is the multidirectional application of data science across different disciplines with the goal of achieving significant societal impact. TDS differs from applied research, which is unidirectional, whereas the knowledge gained in TDS can be applied back to data science. However, this definition gave rise to a more critical question. Can the translation process be abstracted? If so then the abstracted methods and techniques can be formalized, researched, and taught as principles of data science, which would then redefine TDS as (2) the science of data science.  The general sense was that all aspects of TDS are so fundamental and intrinsic to data science generally, that to try to separate these out as something distinct would be to suggest that data science could take place without the understanding of how fundamentals translate to application, without appreciation of context, without significant reflection.  While there is much to data science besides these aspects, it would be unwise to develop the emerging field in a manner that left these out or treated them as foreign.  As a possible definition: TDS is the science of data science that applies abstracted data science principles to challenging problems in various disciplines, especially those that hold the promise of having a substantial impact on human or societal welfare.   A follow-up workshop further explored translation of data science pedagogy to a wide spectrum of colleges and universities from across the nation, drawing 41 participants from 20 states, ranging from community colleges to research universities. A significant portion of the workshop focused on pedagogical methods and content in Berkeley's Foundations of Data Science (Data 8), its technical infrastructure, and extensions to curricula across the University.  In a series of lightning talks, participants shared about how they teach statistics and computer science at their own universities, including maintaining large groups of student volunteers, and how to run interactive anonymous group surveys in a large lecture.  The workshop was extremely well received and formed a community of practice that continued to collaborate after the event.
