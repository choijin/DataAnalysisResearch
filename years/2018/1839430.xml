<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar that will be held on October 5 and 6, 2018, on the campus of Seattle University. Additional information about this meeting can be found at the website: http://fac-staff.seattleu.edu/boersema/web/WCOAS/WCOAS2018.html.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is the twenty-fifth installment of the West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar (WCOAS), a series that annually brings together a diverse group of mathematicians whose primary research interests are in the theory of operator algebras. These meetings cover many current aspects of research in the theory of C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras. Some of the 2018 emphasis will be on the following topics: subfactors and their invariants, rigidity for ergodic actions and von Neumann algebras, free probability and its applications, classification of C*-algebras (the Elliot program), noncommutative geometry, operator spaces, quantum groups, graph C*-algebras. The conference program broadens participation in the theory of operator algebras and provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Two of the speakers and seven of the non-speaking participants were women. Five of the speakers and seven of the non-speaking participants identified as other than white.   For the seminar, about $13,851.16 was paid out of the NSF grant.

The NSF grant was used to support all twelve of the speakers and thirteen of the non-speaker participants. The West Coast Operator Algebra seminar also had support from PIMS (the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences) which was used for reimbursement of travel expenses for some of the participants who travelled from Canada.    The 2018 WCOAS supported research in the field of operator algebras by (1) providing an opportunity for researchers to disseminate their results; (2) providing an opportunity for researchers, including graduate students and postdocs, to learnabout the recent research of others and to stay abreast of current work; (3) providing space and time for researchers to socialize and discuss their work together to foster collaboration and to strengthen the interaction of operator algebraists in this region.  There is a tradition of a strong research group of operator algebras along the west coast of North America, and the WCOAS is an important part of fostering that tradition.
