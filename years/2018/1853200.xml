<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase II project intends to bring transparency and efficiency to the recruiting industry through a dynamic sourcing and analytics platform. Currently, it is exceedingly difficult to identify ideal candidates when recruiting for a position requiring exact criteria. The proposed platform will enable recruiters to rapidly identify optimal candidates and understand where these candidates are geographically concentrated, working, and being educated. This data-driven transparency will improve recruiter/hiring manager interactions and allow for positions to be filled more rapidly, with less productivity lost by employee turnover. The platform will highlight the most qualified candidates for a position, regardless of preconceived bias, to help uncover overlooked candidates. These efficiencies will benefit recruiters, hiring companies, individual candidates, universities, and society. Given the size of the industry ($160 billion) and the scale of inefficiencies, the project has vast commercial impact potential.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase II research and development will be primarily focused around machine learning techniques, leveraged alongside a powerful computing framework, and applied to a substantial dataset containing billions of data points. This technology will be used to drive real-time dynamic analysis resulting in powerful recruiting analytics and ideal job candidates via interactive dashboards. Phase II will build upon the progress achieved in Phase I in the areas of machine-learning classification systems, parallel computing environments to process large quantities of data in real-time, and user-friendly visualizations. The goals of Phase II include increasing the processing power of the data architecture, modeling imputed attributes, improving the accuracy of modeling algorithms, and increasing overall interface performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
