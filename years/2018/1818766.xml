<AbstractNarration>The conference "Combinatorics and Beyond" is to be held at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor on the dates November 8-11, 2018. The aim of the meeting is to gather both leading experts and younger researchers in some of the most rapidly developing parts of combinatorics, including in particular Schubert calculus, total positivity, and cluster algebras.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main aim of the conference is to strengthen interaction between researchers and introduce students to this field of study. The organizers place particular attention on attracting junior participants, as well as participants from underrepresented groups. It is expected that the conference to aid the dissemination of new results in these areas and lead to fruitful interactions and new directions. The website for the conference is https://math.berkeley.edu/~williams/FominFest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award partially funded the conference "Combinatorics and beyond" held at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor on November 8-11, 2018.  Combinatorics is the study of discrete structures, and the conference emphasized connections with algebra.    Two particular topics discussed at the conference were Schubert calculus and cluster algebras.  Schubert calculus is a branch of enumerative geometry aiming to rigorously answer questions of the form "how many lines in three-dimensional space intersect four particular lines L_1,L_2,L_3,L_4"? The subject of Schubert calculus is over a century old, and in recent years it is an active area at the crossroads of combinatorics, geometry, and representation theory.  Cluster algebras is a more recent development studying certain commutative rings with distinguished generators.  It initally grew from efforts to understand positivity phenomena in representation theory, but soon it was realized that cluster algebras can be found in numerous places in nature, ranging from mathematical physics to geometry.  The conference was very successful and participation was higher than initially anticipated.  This award was instrumental to support travel and accomodation for the students and postdocs who attended the conference.  The conference had roughly 20 speakers (some early career and some more senior) and roughly 130 participants.  The participants included graduate students, postdocs, and faculty in roughly equal numbers.          Last Modified: 05/08/2019       Submitted by: Thomas Lam]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
