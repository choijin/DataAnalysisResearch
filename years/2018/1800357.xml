<AbstractNarration>The generation of carbon dioxide is one undesirable outcome of the combustion of fossil fuels to fulfill the energy needs of modern society. Artificial photosynthesis offers means to limit the corresponding impact in the environment by reconverting the carbon dioxide to energy-rich chemicals, creating a closed cycle that is inspired by nature. The technological viability of this concept hinges on the development of catalysts that promote the conversion of carbon dioxide at fast rates and high energy efficiency. The investigators have recently discovered a way to make catalysts consisting of nanosized flakes of earth abundant metal compounds.  These "artificial leaves" have shown promise as replacements for expensive noble metals such as platinum, but optimization of the composition and detailed structure of these materials is hampered by a lack of fundamental understanding of the chemical principles by which they work. The research will employ a variety of experiments and analysis tools to better understand those principles and use the knowledge gained to identify catalysts that perform better and are more stable in the working environment of an electrochemical cell.   The work contributes to moving society toward an increasingly sustainable future based on a closed carbon cycle. The research activities are intertwined with broad efforts to expose future generations of scientists to cutting-edge methodologies, through research internships for undergraduate and high school students, field trips from K-12 schools to university facilities, and a summer workshop on electrochemistry. Recruitment is vigorous among the highly diverse community at the University of Illinois at Chicago, to reach populations underrepresented in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) in contact with ionic liquid electrolytes exceed the performance of state-of-the-art electrocatalysts toward the reduction of carbon dioxide to synthesis gas. However, the fundamental underpinnings of this outstanding performance have not yet been fully ascertained, especially synergies between the ionic liquid electrolyte and the catalyst. The project will employ a combination of spectroscopic techniques to build a library of critical states that underpin the mechanisms of carbon dioxide reduction in TMDC/ionic liquid systems. The evolution of the states is assessed by combining ex situ and operando experiments, and the effect of chemical permutations is evaluated. The outcomes increase the fundamental knowledge of a new and unexplored class of candidates for an important electrocatalytic reaction. The topics of this research also drive an educational plan that fosters excitement about the scientific enterprise in future generations of scientists and technologists. The researchers participate in outreach events at Chicago-area elementary and high schools, spanning from the support of science teachers in the classroom to field trips to laboratories at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). They actively mentor undergraduate students at UIC to enhance their ability to find career paths after graduation, for instance, through research opportunities relevant to the goals of this project, maximizing the exposure of the student to cutting-edge methodologies. These activities will have a special focus on members of Chicago's Hispanic communities, a large population that is severely underrepresented in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
