<AbstractNarration>With support from the NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, this Track 1 Scholarships and Stipends project aims to serve the national interest in high-quality STEM teaching.  This project specifically responds to a national and local shortage in qualified and certified secondary mathematics and science teachers.  This project has two main goals.  One is to increase the number of chemistry, life science, and mathematics secondary teachers by increasing the number of STEM majors who  successfully complete teacher licensure in these majors.  The second is to increase the effectiveness of Noyce Scholars as educators and teacher leaders in high-need classrooms.  In addition to their coursework, Noyce Scholars will participate in diverse field experiences, mentoring from STEM and education faculty, and professional development activities.  It is expected that these Noyce Scholars will distinguish themselves from other teachers through engagement in a curriculum focused on Universal Design for Learning and culturally sustaining pedagogy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to produce 30 secondary mathematics or science teachers who are equipped with pedagogies based in Universal Design for Learning principles and cultural competency.  Undergraduate students majoring in mathematics or science will earn both a teacher certification and a STEM degree (as warranted by the Ohio Dominican University's Vice-Provost for Academic Affairs).  These students will receive up to two years of Noyce financial support beginning in their junior year.  Students who have already achieved a baccalaureate degree in a STEM field and wish to pursue teacher certification will receive one year of support.  Scholars will be prepared to work with students across different cultures and ability levels through exposure to culturally sustaining pedagogy and the tenets of Universal Design for Learning.  The University has cultivated partnerships with local high-need school districts, South-Western City Schools and Whitehall City Schools, to ensure field experiences that allow Scholars to apply Universal Design for Learning principles and cultural sustaining pedagogy practices.  This project will investigate the impact of Universal Design for Learning and cultural competency instruction on Scholars' teacher self-efficacy.  It will also examine the impact of changes in methods courses on student teaching skills and at what stage these interventions have the most impact on teacher effectiveness.  An increase in highly qualified STEM educators in high-need schools has the potential to positively affect the entire greater Columbus area.  Publications and presentations about the project will provide insights about the potential benefits of equipping pre-service STEM teachers to use Universal Design for Learning and cultural sustaining pedagogy. The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
