<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description: Materials that are only a single or few atomic layers in thickness exhibit electronic properties that are profoundly altered with respect to those of bulk materials. These behaviors can be exploited for engineering new classes of optoelectronic devices with novel functionalities. The goal of this research project is to investigate a class of such extremely thin materials that are only one or few atomic layers thick, and seek to endow them with specific magnetic and electronic properties. The team envisions a material that, at the flip of a switch, can become electrically conducting or insulating, magnetic or non-magnetic. Such a material would be vital for the development of new technologies such as high-density memory storage devices and ultra-sensitive magnetic or optical sensors. These research efforts are integrated with plans to mentor and train the next generation of physicists and material scientists. In addition, both team members are active in recruiting and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students from under-represented groups, while also reaching out to high school teachers and students. The team collaborates with the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory  at Florida State University to develop hands-on instructional materials for schools in surrounding North Florida counties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: The ultimate goal of this research project is the achievement of gate-tunable ferromagnetism due to half-metallicity in monolayer and few-layer metal monochalcogenides, based on a recent theoretical proposal. These compounds, i.e. (In,Ga)(S, Se, Te), have been shown to exhibit high-room-temperature carrier mobility, thickness-dependent band gaps and high photoresponsivities. Although monochalcogenides are nonmagnetic, a recent first principles calculation predicts spin-split valence bands in their monolayers, with both the magnetic moment and the spin polarization energy depending strongly on density. Thus, a normal metal-ferromagnet-normal metal transition is expected as the hole density is tuned, with ferromagnetism and half-metallicity emerging when atomically thin monochalcogenides are hole-doped to ~10^13/cm^2. This research project strives to achieve this ambitious goal by overcoming a number of critical challenges, including synthesis of high quality material, device fabrication and optimization, and efficient gating techniques. Successful implementation of the research plan is expected to lead to new half-metallic systems that can be combined with other layered compounds in heterostructures to produce novel functionalities. In addition to training graduate students, both principal investigators continue their established efforts at mentoring undergraduate and high school students, while also recruiting and mentoring students from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Throughout the three years of duration of this award, we synthesized high-quality single crystals of metal monochalcogenides, particularly, &gamma;-InSe and &epsilon;-GaSe, and fabricated heterostructures based on these compounds. The high quality of the synthesized material was confirmed through the observation of high-quality quantum Hall effect data (including magneto-photoluminescent evidence for fractional quantum Hall states) collected from few layer &gamma;-InSe crystals, revealing a pronounced Rashba spin-orbit coupling that is tunable via an electric field. &nbsp;&nbsp;Electrical contacts to these materials, via the use of conventional metals, was found to be rather challenging with the best results obtained using graphene. &gamma;-InSe was found to always behave as an electron doped compound, regardless of the growth method or conditions, precluding our objective of stabilizing an electric field-induced half metallic state when displacing the Fermi level towards the flat valence bands of these compounds. &epsilon;-GaSe grown in Ga flux, was found to be of high crystallinity, and to display ambipolar behavior when contacted with graphene, with few layer samples displaying hole mobilities in the order of several tens of cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs at low temperatures (the comparatively low mobilities could be a manifestation of relatively large effective masses). Therefore, this is the ideal candidate to explore the possible stabilization of a half metallic state. Currently, we are studying this point, particularly through Hall effect measurements to detect an anomalous Hall response.</p> <p>Due In part to the technical difficulties associated with the electrical contacts, we also explored &nbsp;the optical response of heterostructures of both compounds observing a very pronounced interlayer exciton resulting from the relative type II band alignment between both compounds. However, this very pronounced interlayer exciton emission was found to be composed of several superimposed emissions that we attribute to the moir&eacute; lattice at their interface Moir&eacute; patterns are known to strongly modulate the band structure and electronic correlations in graphene, leading to new phases.&nbsp; But they also alter the optoelectronic response of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) or the magnetic response of two-dimensional magnetic layers. The the optical response of this new class of heterostructure, namely &gamma;-InSe on &epsilon;-GaSe, reveals strong evidence for a moir&eacute; potential including: i) a pronounced interlayer exciton (X<sub>i</sub>) characterized by several superimposed emissions that are nearly equally spaced in energy and whose spacing is twist angle (<em></em>&Phi;) dependent, ii) transfer of oscillator strength from the intralayer exciton of &gamma;-InSe towards the X<sub>i</sub> implying either their hybridization or hybridization of interlayer electronic states, and iii) multi-component intralayer exciton emission from GaSe (X<sub>0</sub><sup>Ga</sup>) in the junction area, also with a twist angle dependent energy level spacing. In contrast to excitons in TMDs, whose moir&eacute; potential modulates their photoluminescent response only in the vicinity of <em></em>&Phi; ~ 0<sup>o</sup> or 60<sup>o</sup>, in &gamma;-InSe/&epsilon;-GaSe heterostructures the multi-component X<sub>i</sub> is observable over the entire range of twist angles owing to the existence of a direct band gap at Brillouin zone center. Given the dependence of the direct band gaps of the constituent layers on their thicknesses, these heterostructures offer an unprecedented level of tunability of their type-II band alignments. Therefore, we conclude that these display a clear potential for quantum optoelectronics while offering the opportunity of studying electronic correlations over a broad range of moir&eacute; periodicities when doped with carriers, which is one of our current objectives.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This NSF support is leading to a PhD thesis in 2021, while also supporting the research activities of two other graduate students.
