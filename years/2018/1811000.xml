<AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation award supports the fourth and fifth in the previously funded, successful series of Central States Mathematics Undergraduate Research (CeSMUR) conferences that will take place on April 20-21, 2018 in Lincoln, Nebraska, and in spring 2019 in Manhattan, Kansas, respectively. Research experience is very helpful in both the graduate application process, and in placement in technically demanding jobs. The scientific activities and mentoring interactions at CeSMUR are designed to encourage undergraduate students who are already engaged in research, and to inspire others to begin. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is comprised of one and a half days. The format follows the one successfully tested in previous editions. Two main speakers each give a one-hour lecture, and there is ample time for undergraduate student speakers to present their research. During the evening and lunch meetings students interact with the featured speakers and guest graduate students in attendance, and get advice on the next steps in their career. In addition to a commitment to increasing the number of highly trained STEM professionals, the conferences focus on increasing diversity in the mathematical workforce, via participation of first generation college students, females, and underrepresented minority groups.  Further details regarding the 2018 CeSMUR conference can be found on the conference website: https://www.math.unl.edu/events/cesmur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ CeSMUR, which is an acronym for the Central States Mathematics Undergraduate Conference, is a celebration of research in mathematics performed by undergraduate students. The history of the CeSMUR conferences begins with three installments hosted by Kansas State (2015, 2017) and Truman State (2016), which were funded by the respective institutions separately from this project.    In 2018 the University of Nebraska-Lincoln joined the organizing team and the first  NSF-funded CeSMUR conference was held on April 20-21, 2018 on the campus of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Subsequently, the fifth installment of CeSMUR was hosted by Kansas State University in spring 2019.  The main objectives of the CeSMUR conference series are to provides student researchers with a venue where they can showcase their work in a professional setting, to contribute to the professional preparation and retention of talented workforce in STEM fields (particularly in mathematics), and to promote diversity, inclusion and collaboration at the regional level and beyond.   The 2018 CeSMUR conference achieved these goals by featuring:  two plenary talks given by eminent mathematicians selected for their scholarship and their interest in mentoring undergraduate students: Prof. Carina Curto from Pennsylvania State University and Prof. Michael Young from Iowa State University. 22 talks presented by 25 undergraduate students from 11 institutions. The talks were excellent and very well-received. Each undergraduate presenter was given written feedback after his talk by one of the participating faculty or graduate students. a panel on graduate and summer programs in mathematics featuring 7 graduate students from the following institutions: Iowa State University, Kansas State University, Purdue University, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Yale University.    Further details can be found on the conference web page http://www.math.unl.edu/events/CESMUR.   There were 45 participants registered for this conference, including 20 female (44.4%) as well as 5 Hispanic (11.1%) and one African-American participant. Travel funding was crucial for the participation of undergraduate students from different locations in the United States. Many participants came from the central states region, but some traveled from as far as the states of California, Maryland or Washington. We made every effort to fund members of minority groups which have been historically underrepresented in the STEM disciplines.  The key outcome of this conference series is in contributing towards the recruitment and retention of the undergraduates in STEM areas, and helping them become skilled professionals. In a 2020 follow up survey, among the undergraduate student participants of the 2018 CeSMUR conference 11 have declared continuing to graduate programs: 8 in Mathematics and 3 in other disciplines including computer science, public health/epidemiology and enterprise risk management.
