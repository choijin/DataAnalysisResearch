<AbstractNarration>This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry, or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two year of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctroal Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Posdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions tat advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Arlene Rosen and the University of Texas-Austin, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist conducting a geoarchaeological investigation of the multi-scalar impacts of farming systems on the landscapes of northern New Mexico upon the introduction of those systems as part of the Spanish colonial project of the 16th-19th centuries CE. The late pre-colonial and colonial Southwest was marked by a series of dramatic multi-decadal drought episodes that profoundly affected outcomes. The "Columbian Exchange" of technologies, plants, animals, and diseases from Spanish colonists to the North American Southwest has had profound impact on the history of the region. However, very little research has been conducted to produce empirical data documenting the geomorphological changes to the land. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project identifies and tests three models for landscape change in the Southwest under Spanish colonization. It will produce the first direct analysis of geoarchaeological and microbotanical data from sediments systematically sampled from geological sections adjacent to and downstream from known agricultural areas of two colonial settlements and one Pueblo settlement under colonial influence in the Rio Grande River Valley region of northern New Mexico: Dixon, Cuyumunge, and Picuris Pueblo, respectively. Sediment sections such as these preserve evidence for landscape processes over time, such as sediment transportation (erosional patterns), salinization of sediments (indicating irrigation regimes, land stability, and therefore human mobility patterns), water table levels (indicative of erosive land use practice or damming), and organic content (to assess what kinds of environments were present, including aridification episodes). Studying these sections will allow the researcher of this project to assess how land processes changed in relation to the other changes introduced over the course of colonization in northern New Mexico, and to assess how people responded to their changing landscape. It is particularly notable that this project is in cooperation with two projects in the region that are being hosted by local descendent communities for the first time - the participation of these descendent communities will enhance the accessibility to sampling areas, the contextual knowledge of the data and history, and the broader contribution to community heritage interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Geoarchaeological Evidence of Landscape Change, NSF Award 1810563, was a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship investigating the geoarchaeological and microbotanical evidence for Holocene landscape change in relation to human occupation in the northern Rio Grande Basin of northern New Mexico. Geological sections from the alluvial landscape between Taos and Santa Fe were identified, mapped, field recorded, sampled, and analyzed for sedimentological and microbotanical (primarily phytolith) data. This data from the sediment samples was generated and analyzed in the Environmental Archaeology Lab at the University of Texas at Austin.  While there has been extensive archaeological research on Pueblo agricultural systems in northern New Mexico, there has been relatively less attention given to preceding or succeeding land and plant use in the area, and how changes to land and plant use over time have produced long-term changes to the landscape and vegetation communities of the area. This project therefore asked:  1.1   What is the geoarchaeological and microbotanical evidence for landscape conditions before, during, and after, the Pueblo occupation of the northern Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico?  1.2    What are the specific dates that can be associated with changes in those conditions over time?  1.3   What is the evidence for short and long term stability and/or instability of the landscapes in different but closely associated settlement areas?  These questions are being addressed through assessments of sedimentological and microbotanical direct evidence for landscape change around known occupation areas.    Intellectual Merit  Anthropological archaeology has long been concerned with the questions of human impact on the environments and agricultural societies of pre-industrial New Mexico, yet the geoarchaeological evidence is a deeply understudied part of an otherwise widely studied research area and time period.  On one hand then, this project contributes to our understanding of environmental histories of northern New Mexico, with particular attention to the lesser-understood Archaic contexts. Beyond that, it sets a new research agenda for anthropological archaeologists approaching this region. By testing old models for landscape change against direct evidence in the sediments of land use areas, this project asks researchers to consider past plant and land use behavior as producing systems of accretions on and in the land that then act back upon human settlements and change the possibilities for action.  This project further contributes to larger anthropological questions concerning the changes in land use, especially through plant exploitation, during times of climatic upheaval. As climate change becomes an ever more critical problem to be addressed for the current era and immediate future of our global societies, understanding the multi-scalar imprints of past decisions made under similar circumstances is critical. This project presents the opportunity to create models for the consequences of land use decisions in arid and semi-arid environments across multi-decadal drought episodes that has relevance beyond the North American Southwest and beyond its historical context.  Broader Impacts  This study provides the first extensive geoarchaeological and microbotanical dataset for the northern Rio Grande Gorge region, offering better insight into the precise mechanisms and conditions of historical environmental change in a region that is one of the most intensively studied within the discipline. It is part of a collaboration with two of the first archaeological projects in the region to be sponsored by the Pueblo communities themselves, at Picuris and Pojoaque/Cuyamungu&eacute; (directed by Severin Fowles/Barnard College and Scott Ortman/UC-Boulder, respectively). It is also engaged with the diverse descendent communities of Dixon through collaboration with the Rio Grand Gorge Project (Fowles). This offers a unique opportunity to contribute to broad and diverse communities interested in reconstructing the environmental and social histories of the region.  In addition, the PI undertook field training of undergraduate students from UC-Boulder and high school students from Pojoaque Pueblo during the first field season of the project. She also trained and mentored multiple undergraduate and graduate students in lab techniques in the Environmental Archaeology Lab at UT-Austin. She and the Co-PI are also collaborating with Planet Texas 2050 through the Working Group "Societies of Ancient Resilience," a multi-disciplinary effort to use evidence from the study of past societies to engage with local communities and contribute to current environmental policy in Texas and the Southwest.   Initial Results: Two conference presentations have so far resulted from this research, one of which is co-organized by the PI with collaborators from the Environmental Archaeology Lab at UT-Austin and will bring together international research on Risk and Resilience in Arid Environments.
