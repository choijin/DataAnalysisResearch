<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2018, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Animals have a remarkable ability to maintain stability when faced with unexpected perturbations, which occurs through both passive (mechanical) and active (neural) mechanisms. In flight, passive stabilization relies on the animal's body and wing morphology, while active stabilization also relies on the nervous system to adjust flight. This research integrates museum collections with approaches from biology and physics to develop a better understanding of how different variables work to enhance flight stability using moths as a model system. This research has the potential to impact the future design of engineered devices based on biological design principles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Museum specimens belonging to the diverse group of moths, Bombycoidea, are used to quantify body and wing morphology, and phylogenetic analyses are used to study their evolutionary dynamics and impact on speciation. The fellow utilizes comparative models of dynamic flight stability (typically used in physics and aerospace engineering) as functions of morphology and kinematics to determine how stability evolves in relation to these traits. The fellow also quantifies the mechanical response to visual stimuli in different species to test whether the sensorimotor system is tuned to interspecific differences in stability. Through this research, the fellow receives training in integrating museum collections with interdisciplinary methods from physics, engineering, and biology. To advance discovery while promoting teaching, training, and learning, the fellow acts as a key advisor for a group of interdisciplinary undergraduates at the host institution as they conduct independent research on the relationship between maneuverability and wing morphology. Further, to broaden participation, the fellow and the undergraduate team conduct a lesson at the G.I.R.L.S summer camp at the host institution that uses the museum collections, a wind tunnel, and a 3-D printer to examine the relationship between wing morphology and aerodynamic performance. Finally, the collection of images generated by the fellow are being deposited in public databases, complementing existing efforts to digitally preserve museum specimens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

During flight, force is generated through the movement of wings, which come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and movement patterns. Successful flight also requires sensory feedback from the environment in order to adjust flight parameters (particularly wing movement) to maintain stability when faced with unexpected perturbations. In insects, vision plays a prominent sensory role in flight control.

Museum specimens were used to quantify body and wing morphology; analyses were used determine the evolutionary processes driving these patterns across these diverse species. Next, to determine how aerodynamics evolves across species, I developed a model to estimate aerodynamic force production as a functions of wing morphology and movement. Finally, I recorded from the moth ventral nerve cord (analog to the human spinal cord) to determine how aspects of self movement and other ecologically relevant visual stimuli are represented by the visual system.</p> <p>First, I learned that agile flight can be achieved in at least two different ways, using different combinations of wing morphology and movement. To determine this, I examined how wing shape has evolved across a phylogenetic split between hawkmoths (Sphingidae) and wild silkmoths (Saturniidae), which have divergent life histories, but agile flight behaviors. Each group has evolved distinct wing shapes and movements. The notoriously agile hawkmoths have not evolved wing shapes typical of maneuverability, but rather ones that reduce power. Instead their kinematics favor maneuverability, primarily through higher wingbeat frequency. In contrast, silkmoths evolved maneuverable wing shapes and use kinematics that reduce power. Therefore, multiple strategies have evolved to achieve similar aerodynamic performance. From these results, I suggest flapping wings provide flexible aerodynamics through kinematics and might release morphological constraints, enabling the diversity of wing shapes across extant flyers.</p> <p>Second, I learned that moths have evolved specialized neurons in their ventral nerve cord to relay information about different types of motion vision. The visual identification self movement allows animals to track their own movement while the identification of externally moving targets allows animals to locate and track predators, mates, and food sources. The moth flower tracking behavior, where a feeding moth tightly tracks the 3D motion of a swaying flower, relies on acquiring and acting upon both self-motion (wide field visual movement of the background) and the external motion of a flower. By recording the response of ventral nerve cord neurons to wide field motion (WFM), small targes, and flower stimuli using multielectrode arrays in tethered hawkmoths, <em>Manduca sexta</em>. I found that determined that different classes of VNC neurons are responsible for encoding information about different moving objects. While, most neurons have a large overlap in response to the three classes of stimuli presented, not all cells are universally responsive and some show selectivity to flower stimuli. These results show that descending neurons of the moth VNC can have overlapping and unique selectivity to self, target, and flower motion, suggesting that the visual system of insects can be evolutionary tuned to the life history and ecologically relevant stimuli of a given species.</p> <p>Throughout this project, I contributed to the undergraduate curriculum at Georgia Tech by providing students with an authentic research experience. I acted as a key advisor in the Living Dynamical Systems Vertically Integrated Project (LDS-VIP) program at the Georgia Institute of Technology. A VIP program allows for long-term and in-depth research experiences conducted by small vertically-integrated interdisciplinary groups of students to be integrated into the undergraduate curriculum. One VIP team and I developed a project to study comparative moth flight kinematics across different species. This work directly related to the goals of this project. The group of students and I collected wild moths and subsequently flew them in a large wind tunnel. We filmed the moths with multiple cameras.
