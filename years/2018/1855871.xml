<AbstractNarration>This workshop will promote participation of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the research programs of the 14 Institutes of the Manufacturing USA, which are sponsored by the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology.  The objective of the workshop is to formulate a strategy for promoting and sustaining robust research and educational collaborations between the faculty and students of the HBCUs and the faculty members and industry scientists and engineers participating in the Manufacturing USA Institutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2.5-day workshop will bring together senior personnel from the Institutes and the HBCUs to support NSF?s policy goal of broadening the participation of all populations and ethnicities in science and engineering research, innovation and education. The resulting faculty collaborations in advanced manufacturing are expected to lead to increased research and innovation projects and output, significantly increased research experiences for both undergraduate and graduate students at the HBCUs, and the matriculation of more minority students in graduate programs at top research universities in advanced manufacturing and other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields of study. The workshop will formulate a strategy for: (1) catalyzing increased fundamental research, innovation, technology development, and knowledge transfer in advanced manufacturing at HBCUs, (2) improving HBCU faculty development in advanced manufacturing, 3) increasing opportunities for HBCU researchers to submit collaborative proposals with Manufacturing USA collaborators, 4) providing access to the state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment and expertise available at the Institutes, and 5) facilitating information and personnel exchanges between the HBCUs and the Manufacturing USA Institutes, including seminars, conferences, and summer research experiences for the students and faculty of the HBCUs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Advanced Manufacturing R&amp;D Workshop  Overview   On November 6-8, 2019, Morgan State University hosted a Workshop "Promoting Participation of HBCUs/MSIs in Advanced Manufacturing R&amp;D" at the NSF Headquarters in Alexandria, VA. Manufacturing USA is a major joint federal and industry partnership initiative aimed at advancing manufacturing research and education. Thirty-One HBCUs/MSI’s were in attendance. Each participating university was asked to prepare a poster that gave an overview of the advanced manufacturing research that they were involved in. Faculty from 24 Institutions presented 33 posters.  The "Manufacturing USA Network" is enabling the translation of advanced manufacturing research and approaches into industry practice. This national network on manufacturing innovation is comprised of 14 institutes, each a public/private/university consortium with a $ 50M - $75M Federal investment over five years with at minimum a matching investment from the private sector. In practice, the private sector co-investment has been at least twice that of the Federal Government for each institute.  However, there are two issues of concern regarding the Manufacturing USA:  for the success of American domestic advanced manufacturing, industry needs a reliable, certified supply of skilled workers with the unique skills relevant to a range of advanced manufacturing technologies.  While each institute of the Manufacturing USA is developing training approaches during the period of the Federal investment, there is no single organization/institute, with a long-term commitment and singular focus on Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Education and Training. to succeed in drawing the best talent and capabilities, the lack of real and substantive involvement of the underrepresented minority community in the Manufacturing USA Network is a cause of concern. To date, there has been no substantive involvement of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the Manufacturing USA network of the 14 institutes that were initiated in 2012.    Based on feedback and survey results conducted by Professor Kaci Thompson (University of Maryland College Park), the workshop was an overwhelming success.  A Supplemental Grant to do a thorough assessment of the Workshop and develop a proposal for next steps has been submitted from consideration. Participants increased their familiarity with advanced manufacturing as per indicated below: before the workshop, 41% considered themselves very familiar or extremely familiar with the topic, while after the workshop 79% considered themselves very familiar or extremely familiar.  Engagement in Advanced Manufacturing - Research  Prior to the workshop, 55% of participants reported that they were currently engaged in research related to Advanced Manufacturing, while 17% were unsure. Several participants indicated they were already collaborating (or planning to collaborate) with an Advanced Manufacturing USA institute. Two participants specifically mentioned collaborations with America Makes, NextFlex, and IACMI. Four others mentioned plans for collaborating but did not mention specific institutes.     Engagement in Advanced Manufacturing - Teaching  Prior to the workshop, 59% of participants reported that they were engaged in teaching topics related to Advanced Manufacturing, while 14% were unsure. Following the workshop, 24 of 29 participants (83%) indicated that Advanced Manufacturing topics, problems, or projects would be integrated into their teaching. Representative responses are listed below.     Following the workshop, 90% of participants reported having plans for future collaborations with an Advanced Manufacturing USA institute.
