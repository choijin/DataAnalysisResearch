<AbstractNarration>This project is to support doctoral student travel and participation in the IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI 2018) in New York, New York from June 4-7, 2018. The ICHI2018 conference provides a supportive scientific forum for students focusing on computing, health- and bioinformatics.  ICHI2018 provides a forum for expert and peer critique of students' research with the goal of improving their science. Student participants will also have the opportunity to receive networking support and career advice from internationally-recognized experts. Overall, the travel support brings together students with experts who might not otherwise engage with one another and engage in multidisciplinary research targeting science the area of health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal supports doctoral students by providing a Student Doctoral Consortium focused on encouraging students to learn from peers and experts from multiple perspectives to understand how innovative computing and informatics combine to have the greatest impact in the area of health. In addition, student participation in rapid talks and roundtable discussions provided at the conference enables students to explore their science and evaluate different career paths for researchers in this area. The ICHI2018 conference exposes participants to different disciplinary approaches, supports networking with conference attendees and is designed to support the development of the next generation of scholars in health- and bioinformatics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
