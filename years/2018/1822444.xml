<AbstractNarration>This award support three annual "Effectively Communicating Science" Workshops on the topics of weather modification and hydraulic fracking to help scientists in communicating and teaching complex Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) concepts effectively and ethically. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The premise of the Workshops is that scientists must not be advocates for one side or the other, but must be able to convey the quality and accuracy of their work.  There is a significant societal impact in helping scientists better communicate and teach their expertise. There are thousands of scientists in geoscience-related fields who are teaching, researching, publishing, and communicating with colleagues in the STEM community and the public at large. These scientists, and their work, will become increasingly important in future scientific and public discussions on complex STEM concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team will build on the success of previously-funded Workshops; expand the number of participants who benefit from the Workshops; further refine the Workshop materials and methodology; and implement and evaluate new materials to reach more participants in other STEM disciplines.  Each Workshop includes a diverse group of approximately twenty-four science participants, an equal number of law students (law students are not supported with NSF funds), and an experienced cadre of practicing lawyers, judges, and legal educators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshops will include simulations where participants communicate and teach complex STEM concepts to non-scientists in a range of challenging settings. During the workshops, participants learn and practice the role of both scientists and non-scientists to: 1) develop and build upon skills necessary to effectively communicate their expertise; 2) understand the culture and perspectives of non-scientists; and 3) develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of the different challenges in communicating and teaching complex STEM concepts to non-scientists. Workshop faculty provide individualized feedback and coaching along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential Broader Impacts involve creating a diverse cadre of scientists who are better prepared to teach complex Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) concepts effectively and ethically.   All Workshop alumni become informal "Fellows" of the program which preserves, encourages, and continues to build a network of scientists who have, in turn, developed informal mentorships, collaborative relationships, and support of each other as they work to better communicate and teach STEM concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in Workshops in previous years have included academic geoscientists familiar to science programs across the wider NSF as well as participants from industry and with ties to various government agencies.  Weather modification and hydraulic fracking are issues of increasing interest in science and policy circles.  Some previous scientist participants in the Workshop are now actively engaged in research, application, and policy aspects in these fields and have benefited from exposure to the culture of the law and regulation.  It is the Paleoclimate Program's judgement that exposure to such trans-cultural experiences enhances the public discourse on knotty technical and policy issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview   The "Effectively Communicating Science" ("ECS") project is a series of annual one-week long workshops and ongoing support materials for scientists on communicating and teaching.  The primary goals of the ECS are to train and equip scientists and science educators (hereafter, the project "participants") to communicate and teach complex STEM concepts more effectively and ethically.  We conducted four ECS workshops with NSF funding in 2011-14 (Award numbers 1041512 and 1321562); three ECS workshops in 2015-17 (Award number 1540197); and under this grant (Award 1822444), we conducted three additional ECS workshops in 2018, 2019, and 2020 (as described below, the 2020 workshop was a pilot session due to COVID-19).  A total of 170 scientists have participated in this program.  Design/Intellectual Merit   The workshop methodology applies two core assumptions: 1) scientists learn best by doing rather than just listening and observing and 2) scientists better understand how to communicate STEM concepts by learning about, interacting with, and playing the role of policy-makers, lawyers, and others who are not scientifically trained.  Participants were carefully selected by their level of experience and standing in the scientific community.  The participants also represented a diverse group of scientists.  For example, the participants included equal numbers of male and female scientists that included all levels of professional experience from Ph.D. candidates to seasoned professors and professional scientists with a broad range of ages.  The participants hailed from many states and different educational and research institutions.  The week-long experiential learning program included briefings by professors and other professionals, including judges, lawyers, and communication consults, on topics such as: ethical considerations in communication, communicating scientific and STEM topics to non-scientists, and various legal and policy processes where scientific information is commonly communicated (such as direct and cross-examination, legislative hearing and townhall meetings, pretrial Daubert hearing, rules of evidence, and jury trial).  In addition, participants received training materials and other resources for ongoing support, including communication texts and articles  and website resources.  As with previous workshops, 20 law students were included each year (with no additional costs to the grant) to provide additional training and communication experiences for the participants, as well as provide the law students with intensive hands-on educational experience with scientists in legal settings, using the training materials developed in this program.  Broader Impacts of the Program   Participants in the ECS workshops bring their training back to their workplace and schools, where they share what they have learned and their new or improved skills with constituents, colleagues, students, and policy makers.  Then they recommend a new batch of participants, who are then able to participate in the program the next year.  Nearly all the 170 scientists who have participated in the program were recommended by previous participants.  The need for this type of training is clear.  Science and complex STEM concepts are key factors in the strategic plans of many major corporations, public policy discussions, legal disputes, and in the education of future scientists and science educators.  Communication and teaching of these concepts to non-scientists is critical, as non-scientists are often in the role of decision-maker on issues involving science and complex STEM concepts.  Outcomes   We measure the results of the ECS workshops in two ways.  The first measure is the number of scientists who participate in the program.  Each workshop serves a new group of scientists and educators.  All participants are considered "Fellows" after completion of the program and receive ongoing access to the ECS portal and its many resources.  Fellows are also encouraged to keep in touch with the program and share results of the workshop in their work and teaching, as many have already done.   The second measure is the level of satisfaction of participants along several important vectors.  We use a complex survey instrument that is administered shortly after completion of the workshop.  For every question in every workshop, the responses were nearly unanimously positive, matching the affirmative results from previous ECS workshops.   Lastly, due to COVID-19 pandemic closures we were unable to conduct the scheduled 2020 workshop onsite.  Instead, we revised, updated schedules and materials, and developed an innovative online pilot workshop with simulated interactive sessions.  The pilot was held entirely online July 26-31, 2020 to test the viability of conducting the workshop online (if necessary in the future) or in a combined online and onsite format.  It also was a trial run for workshop modules that could be used as standalone training sessions at conferences or other opportunities to reach scientists as compressed training that would not require travel expenses or lengthy time commitments. Participants of the 2020 pilot workshop included 20 law students and 16 experienced adjunct faculty, including judges, practicing lawyers, legislative process experts, and a neurosurgeon with frequent expert witness experience.
