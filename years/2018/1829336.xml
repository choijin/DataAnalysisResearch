<AbstractNarration>This award will support student participation at a conference focused on Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) at the University of Michigan, under the sponsorship of the Microanalysis Society.  EBSD is a core microanalytical technique used by both the materials and geological sciences communities.  It utilizes the diffraction of high-energy electrons to determine phase types and orientations of crystals in natural and engineered materials. EBSD plays an important role in material science and geology for the understanding everything from crystallization processes to deformation mechanisms, seismic and viscous anisotropy and material properties (such as strength, fracture toughness, and thermal conductivity). EBSD is also becoming part of the data science realm, with a significant computing component to not only process large amounts of data but also model the acquisition of the data and interface with material behavior models. The award will support participation of students from diverse backgrounds, and will serve to broaden participation in the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The format for EBSD 2018 will follow that of the overwhelmingly successful previous five EBSD meetings. The first day will offer all-day classroom and hands-on tutorials for beginners or more advanced tutorials for experienced users, with a focus on advanced data processing methods and data science, e.g. cross correlation EBSD, coupling crystal plasticity modeling, Matlab Texture Analysis and Dream3D platform.  Attendees will also have the opportunity to see live EBSD demonstrations by all the major EBSD vendors on UoM instruments.  The next two days of the workshop will proceed with invited talks addressing EBSD applications in geological deformation mechanisms, geochronology, and fossilization, metals manufacturing, transportation industry, and energy research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The latest Microanalysis Society topical conference on Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) took place this May 23-25 at the University of Michigan and brought together researchers from the geological, materials, and data and applied maths sciences, to foster deeper interactions across these scientific fields sharing the use of EBSD as a material characterizationt tool. The organizers, Steve Niezgoda (OSU), Marc DeGraef (CMU), Elena Miranda (CSUN), Andrew Cross (Wash U - St Louis), Andrew Kerns (UM) and Emmanuelle Marquis (UM) ensured a comprehensive program with speakers including Katharina Marquardt (University Bayreuth, Germany), John Wheeler (University of Liverpool, UK), Maurine Montagnat (Institut des Geosciences de l'Environnement, France), Angus Wilkinson (Oxford University, UK) and Ralf Hielscher (Chemnitz Technische Universitat, Germany) to cover the full range of new applications and analyses methods relevant to EBSD. The meeting brought together over 170 participants internationally from academia, national laboratories, and industry. Over 70 of the participants were graduate students thanks to this NSF award. The workshop allowed for ample time for discussion between participants, giving the chance to students to interacts with experts in the field. The conference featured three days of lectures and animated conversation on EBSD applications and developments within materials, geo-, and planetary sciences, engineering, and industry. The dynamic conference format combined poster and plenary sessions, and interactive hands-on demonstrations from different vendors using equipment at the Michigan Center for Materials Characterization ((MC)2).  Day 1 provided lacture style tutorials on smaple preparation and data analysis, and lab demonstrations on a flexible sign-up basis. Students and others seeking even more hands-on insights on EBSD methods were also treated to tutorials in geoscience and engineering materials within the (MC)2 laboratory space. The theme of Day 2 was EBSD for Characterization of Microstructure Evolution"and featured a poster session with over forty presenters. Winners of the best poster student awards were Penny Weiser (U Cambridge) for Geological Sciences and Tian Liu (U Alabama) for Materials Sciences. Day 3 emphasized advances in EBSD technology and data analysis, such as Bayesian approaches on how to most effectively use data mining approaches to assist in analyzing materials. The conference was very well received overall, and participants strongly suggested that another instance of this EBSD workshop be organized again in 2020.
