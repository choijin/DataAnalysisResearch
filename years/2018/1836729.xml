<AbstractNarration>All cells require energy.  This fact is somewhat taken for granted in biodiversity studies of plants and animals, but is at the forefront of discovering novel microbial biodiversity.  As an electrical charge flows through energy transfer molecules in a cell, it is coupled to the production of ATP molecules (akin to charging the battery that powers the cell) or the production of other compounds that are critical for life function.  Until recently, it was thought that all cells require electron energy transfer molecules that are soluble in water, so that they can be brought into the cell.  However, scientists discovered that some bacteria are able to use solid metals such as rust (iron oxides) located outside the cell as an energy source. They do so by shuttling electrons from the inside of the cell to the outside of the cell, via energy transfer molecules that deliver electrical charge to metal deposits in the environment. In other words, part of these microbes' energy production pathways have evolved to be outside of the cell. This process, termed extracellular electron transfer (EET), transformed how we think about cellular life and in particular how microbes may impact the global elemental cycles that sustain life on Earth. This research team will conduct the first wide-ranging assessment of the diversity of EET across all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya). The project will also broaden public understanding about microbial life through developing interactive museum exhibits that present microbial EET to the public. Project investigators will work with the Encyclopedia of Life to broaden the representation of microbes in their databases and in school curricula. The project is also uniquely poised to strengthen industry and academic pipelines through educational curriculum that engages middle school students in interdisciplinary EET research, and a pedagogical training and lab exchange program that affords students and postdoctoral scholars an opportunity to conduct interdisciplinary research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consistent with the objectives of the DIMENSIONS program, this proposal aims to establish the degree to which ribotypes and genotypes relate to function and activity. This is also a grand challenge in environmental microbiology, and our ability to use bioelectrochemical systems to selectively target electroactive communities affords a unique opportunity to selectively isolate and characterize microbes capable of extracellular electron transfer (EET). To these ends, the overarching goal of this proposal is to comprehensively assess and relate the phylogenetic diversity, genetic/genomic diversity, and functional diversity of microorganisms engaged in EET across all three domains of life. The work plan includes: 1) conducting the first broad, systematic assessment of the phylogenetic diversity of EET-enabled microbes in natural habitats; 2) using the results of these data to identify 20 "representative" communities for co-registered metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and biogeochemical characterization to target differentially expressed transcripts associated with EET and the biogeochemical processes that are mediated by these communities; 3) characterizing the genetic, biochemical and biophysical attributes of cultivated but uncharacterized microbes commonly found on electroactive surfaces; 4) integrating these results to develop a better capacity to predict the physiologies and biogeochemical impacts of electroactive communities in nature; and 5) archiving these data in robust databases to allow others to relate the project's findings to their data. These efforts will provide, for the first time, a comprehensive dataset linking phylogenetic data (16S, 18S) with functional potential (genomics), physiological poise (transcriptomics) and metabolic activity (geochemical measurements) that will have many applications to beyond biodiversity science. For example, the combined 'omics and rate measurements will allow the investigators to constrain the extent to which EET contributes to biogeochemical cycles in nature. The transposon mutagenesis and biophysical studies, in turn, will help researchers understand the means by which common but poorly characterized microbes carry out EET. While the value of each of the proposed efforts is significant, the coordination of these activities enables true integration of these findings to provide a comprehensive perspective on the relationships among phylogenetic, genomic and physiological diversity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Major Activities:  Efforts have been directed toward developing methods to understand extracellular electron transport (EET) in organisms across the three domains of life. The overarching idea is that extracellular electron transport underlies fundamental aspects of microbial biology, both in intimate contact with human and other hosts and natural environmental systems.  We have developed a bioelectrochemical system (BES), derived from our previous microbial fuel cell (MFC) system, in order to identify direct and indirect extracellular electron transport.  We have been studying samples from two sources:  human gut and marine sediments.  Human gut mircobiome samples came from two sources:  aggregated microbiomes collected by the OpenBiome consortium and samples obtained directly from volunteers.  We have now developed conditions where EET is observed from both sources of material.  Several modifications had to be made to optimize the system, including choice of carbon-paper electrode material and size, shape, and overall dimensions of anodes.  Previously unmanipulated sediment push cores, likely containing both bacteria and archaea, and containers of loose sediment were obtained from the Guirgis lab in October 2019. The whole push cores were collected by the Nautilus crew late spring of 2019 from a ridge southwest of the Catalina Basin in the Pacific Ocean. Previous attempts to enrich electroactive microbial consortia in situ were unsuccessful and difficult to work with.  After review it is clear that a new protocol is necessary and will include the following: current cores will be aliquoted into reactors. The top seven centimeters of each core will be divided into two, one for a cathodic enrichment and one for an anodic enrichment. The bottom seven centimeters will be treated similarly. Durable, high surface area carbon cloth will be used for the working electrode, titanium mesh for the counter, calomel reference electrode connected through a salt bridge will complete the electrochemical half-cell. The working electrode for anodic enrichments will be poised at 0.2 V vs SHE and sparged with 80% N2 and 20% CO2 and cathodic enhancements will be poised at -0.4 V vs SHE and will be daily pulsed with 20% CO2 air balance. Initial samples from the sediment were preserved for later 16S and elemental analyses. We hope the resultant communities will represent parallel metabolisms from the same sediment depth, i.e., electron output and electron input.     Specific Objectives:  We have developed a practicable bioelectrochemical system (BES) where we have directly observed EET from human gut microbiome samples...both metaconsortia and from individual human gut microbiome fecal samples.  We have now identified the conditions necessary to begin to address the requirements to identify EET in natural marine sediment samples.  Significant results:  We have observed EET from human microbiome samples.  The details of the extent of EET observed depend on how specific samples were obtained and/or cultured prior to analysis.  For example, samples from the consortia, which are first cultured in the laboratory from frozen samples, take longer to engage in electricity production compared to samples obtained from fresh fecal samples, where EET is almost instantaneous.  Key outcomes or Other achievements:  We have developed a practicable BioElectrochemical System that can monitor extracellular electron transport from a variety of microbial sample sources.  We have identified modifications to protocols necessary to effectively probe for the presence of EET in environmental samples, including marine sediments.
