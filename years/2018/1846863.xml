<AbstractNarration>Multiscale, multifunctional porous structures are found in nature and used in many engineering applications. However, it has proven extremely difficult to fabricate such structures using traditional manufacturing techniques, partially because their intricate structures need to be developed over many length scales. To address this challenge, this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program project will investigate a freeze nano printing (FNP) approach through selectively freezing and in situ ice-templating of nanomaterials to fabricate multiscale, multifunctional porous structures. A combined experimental and modeling methodology will be used to understand the fundamental mechanism in FNP and elucidate the parameter-process-structure-property relations. The research will contribute a 3D printing process that can fundamentally unlock structural and functional properties and lead to industrial applications in areas such as energy, health, environment, aerospace, automotive, and consumer products.  As such, the project positively impacts economic welfare, national health and security. The educational objective is to inspire high school students, attract freshman-level undergraduate students to the field, train graduate students, and provide outreach to the general public through hands-on education and manufacturing innovation based on 3D printing technologies. Activities include publishing an open-source 3D printing system; development of web-accessible lectures; and organization of a TINKER camp workshop, a Liberty Partnerships program, and a 3D printing symposium. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project will focus on freeze nano printing (FNP) technology to fabricate multiscale and multifunctional porous structures. The central premise is that the microscale structure can be manipulated by in situ ice-templating, while the macroscale structure can be controlled by inkjet printing. If successful, this project will significantly advance scientific understanding of the complex phenomena in FNP process, including 1) understanding how the high-aspect-ratio multidimensional nanomaterials interact with printing nozzle, and how the ink composition and process parameters affect the drop formation, and ultimately influence the property of the produced macrostructure, 2) elucidating the mechanism of how the multidimensional nanomaterials interact with ice-crystals during the droplet-wise ice-templating process, and how the complex behavior affects the microstructural property, and 3) studying the relation between the process parameters and the interfacial structures of the multiple materials, and how the interfacial structures influence the multifunctionality. Through hands-on-based educational activities, this project will provide exciting course materials and lab projects to students from K-12 to graduate-level. Outreach to pre-college institutes with curriculum relevant to students' daily lives will broaden participation of the minority and underrepresented groups. Curriculum tailored to the undergraduate and graduate students through teaching and research will inspire their lifelong interest in science and engineering. Community outreach will help promote awareness and adoption of 3D printing technologies and democratize advanced manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
