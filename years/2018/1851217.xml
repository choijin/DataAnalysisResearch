<AbstractNarration>Raman microscopy is a powerful tool for nondestructive, label-free chemical imaging that has found numerous applications in the pharmaceutical, forensic, semiconductor, materials science, and biological fields.  The PI has developed a faster and lower cost Raman micro-spectrometer, a tool that allows mapping of chemical composition and other material properties at microscopic scales.  Broader and easier access to Raman mapping could in turn prompt innovation in how the tool is used for a vast range of applications, from biomedical research, to food and pharma, to engineering materials.  This project provides an opportunity for market research that will result in a thorough and deep understanding of the customer needs when it comes to chemical mapping and how their technology could potentially alleviate the customer's pain points and capture new customers.  The scientist involved will learn fundamental entrepreneurial skills that will not only help in the commercialization efforts of this technology but could also be applied towards their future research endeavors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's technology is a novel confocal Raman microscope capable of imaging at speeds up to 100 times faster than conventional point-scan Raman microscopy. This project involves market research where a range of potential customers are involved in assessing the current chemical imaging market and the requirements for future products in this field.  The result will help guide a decision on whether this product (or a similar product) has market value, the most valuable product features that can be incorporated or developed, and the market(s) where these products should initially be marketed.  With this investigation, it is expected that a proper decision on the future of this technology can be made along with a decision on future developments that increase the likelihood of commercial success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The main goal of this project was to perform customer discovery and evaluate the commercialization potential of a Raman imaging technology that was developed in an academic/university setting using prior NSF funds. The customer discovery was performed over a one year time frame through in-person and televideo interviews of potential customers of the technology to learn how the technology could solve their current problems in material characterization. These potential customers came from a wide range of industries. The anticipated outcome of this effort was to validate whether or not there is a viable market for this Raman imaging technology. If a viable market for this technology could be identified, this information would have been used to create a business plan for a new startup company to begin commercializing the technology. The customer discovery and interviews were initially guided by mentors during the national ICORPS program that all team members participated in. The program consisted of 2 on-site sessions and 7 weeks of remote web sessions where the different participating teams exchanged what they learned about the customer discovery process and from their potential customers. Following this national ICORPS meeting program, the team continued to conduct customer discovery interviews by attending trade shows and meeting with industry leaders nationally at their company locations. The interviews were focused on understanding potential customers' problems and evaluating whether they could be addressed with this technology and how painful/important the problems were for the customer. Over 150 interviews were conducted.&nbsp;Given that Raman spectroscopy is an analytical technique that can be used in many industries for chemical analysis and characterization of materials, the customer base that was interviewed was diverse to cover as many industries as possible that demand chemical and materials analysis. The industries that were targeted included food, contract labs, pharmaceutical, polymers, chemicals, regulatory agencies, nuclear, forensics, and others. The main outcome of this customer discovery process was a final &lsquo;no-go&rsquo; decision at this point in time for commercializing the technology. Despite many interviews in which potential customers were interested and excited about the technology, we were not able to identify a specific &lsquo;pain point&rsquo; or &lsquo;problem&rsquo; that the customers expressed that would be solved by the technology. The unique features of the technology were &lsquo;nice to have&rsquo; but the final conclusion was that it was not a &lsquo;need&rsquo;. Despite this disappointing outcome, the customer discovery process has not ended. To date, the team continues to explore new applications of the technology and to reach out to prospective customers that may find a specific need for the features of the technology. For example, recent efforts have resulted in a new project exploring the use of this technology to detect and analyze microplastic particles in drinking water for environmental and human health applications.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/10/2020<br>      Modified by: James&nbsp;Chan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
