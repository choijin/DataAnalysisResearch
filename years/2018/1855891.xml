<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest in high quality STEM education by improving elementary preservice teachers' understanding of mathematics while preparing them to teach STEM concepts in context. This project is unique in that physics will be used to focus algebraic reasoning in a mathematics content course based on elementary and middle school curriculum, an area that has received little attention in previous research. Because elementary preservice teachers typically do not receive any instruction in physics, they often struggle with algebraic concepts and the applications of those concepts in meaningful real-world contexts. This project has the potential to address these weaknesses by providing integrated physics/mathematics training for mathematics education instructors who prepare elementary preservice teachers to teach in grades K-8. In addition, the project will prepare over 200 teachers per year using physics laboratory activities and technological tools in their undergraduate coursework. As a result, the project's impact could extend to thousands of elementary school students in classes taught by these teachers who learned how physics can be used to contextualize mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three primary goals: (i) develop and test curricular materials and instructional methods that connect experimental physics activities to elementary and middle school algebraic reasoning content; (ii) confer with, train, and support mathematics education instructors over a three-year period to develop their knowledge and expertise in the classroom use of the developed instructional materials and methods; and (iii) improve elementary preservice teachers' understanding of algebraic concepts and applications in real-world contexts by guiding them in mathematics-focused physics activities employing technological tools in courses that utilize the newly developed instructional materials. The project's evaluation will include qualitative and quantitative feedback to guide the iterative process of creating and designing activities and assessments to support both the mathematics education instructors and their elementary preservice teachers. Data will specifically focus on content knowledge, because the goal of the course is primarily to improve elementary preservice teachers' mathematical content knowledge. Data will be gathered through surveys, pre- and post-tests and panel discussions involving both the mathematics education instructors and the elementary preservice teachers. A mixed methods approach will be used to examine the link between the implementation activities and project outcomes.  This is an Engaged Student Learning project, supported by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program (IUSE): Education and Human Resources (EHR).  The IUSE Program supports projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all undergraduate students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the IUSE : EHR program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
