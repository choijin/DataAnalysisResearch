<AbstractNarration>This award supports the 44th Northeast Bioengineering Conference, a regional conference that provides an opportunity to undergraduate and graduate student researchers in the field of biomedical engineering to present their research to a broad audience. The conference has particular impact because it allows students who do not have the funding to attend a national scientific meeting to present their work to fellow students, regional faculty, and representatives from industry. The conference will be held on March 28-30, 2018, at Drexel University. The award primarily supports a reduction in student registration fees for all attendees, allowing the conference to be even more affordable. The ability to participate in conferences such as this encourages students to pursue graduate school and pursue an academic career. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference expects to attract about 400 attendees from around the Northeast region of the United States, with 60 - 75% expected to be students. Over 60% of the platform presentations will be given by trainees, in addition to 150 poster presentations. In addition to scientific presentations, sessions on career development in biomedical engineering will be included to specifically support professional development of the trainees. Key Note and Plenary speakers will be used to highlight cutting edge areas of research in both academia and industry. Themes of the presentations will include: Biomedical Engineering Entrepreneurship; Immunoengineering; Pediatric Bioengineering; Neuroengineering; and Mechanobiology.</AbstractNarration>
