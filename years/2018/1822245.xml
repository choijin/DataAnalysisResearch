<AbstractNarration>Science educators benefit from ongoing professional development to learn about and implement evidence-based practices in teaching, learning, and assessment in their classrooms.  To this end, the American Physiological Society convenes a biennial Institute on Teaching and Learning to provide postsecondary educators an opportunity to share education research and best practices relating to improving science teaching and learning.  This year's institute will be held June 18-22, 2018 in Madison, Wisconsin. This project will support twenty physiology educators to attend the Institute and to participate in a year-long immersion in the Physiology Educators Community of Practice, which engages in online professional development activities including discussion groups and online courses about the scholarship of teaching and learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fellowships will support the participation of trainees (graduate students and postdocs), early career educators, community college faculty, and faculty from underrepresented groups or minority-serving institutions in the 2018 Institute of Teaching and Learning.  The Institute will address topics such as best practices in teaching, scholarship of teaching and learning, integrating research into undergraduate classrooms, and assessment of activities.  More than half of the planned institute speakers are female, and more than 10% are members of underrepresented groups.  Candidates for the fellowship will be current members of the American Physiological Society (APA), who submit an abstract for the meeting and a fellowship application.  An organizing committee, comprised of faculty from different institutional types and representatives of the APA, will review applications and select fellowship recipients.  Fellows will be expected to attend the 2018 Institute of Teaching and Learning and to participate in professional development activities throughout the subsequent year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The American Physiological Society (APS) applied for funding from the NSF to provide Physiology Educators Community of Practice (PECOP) fellowships to trainees (graduate students and postdoctoral fellows), early career educators, community college faculty, and faculty from under-represented minority groups or minority-serving institutions to actively participate in the 2018 APS Institute on Teaching and Learning (ITL).  Nineteen fellows were able to complete the program including a pre-survey, a post-survey, and a six-month outcome survey about the impact of the institute on their teaching and their students learning.  The objectives of the ITL conference were to:  1)     Bring together a diverse group of postsecondary educators to share evidence-based best practices in teaching science at the undergraduate and graduate/professional level.  2)     Engage current and aspiring educators in collaborating to perform evidence-based teaching and education research.  The conference included seven plenary and two keynote lectures from leaders in the field of postsecondary science education. Three concurrent workshops were held each morning and afternoon from Tuesday through Thursday on the topics of assessment, professional development, teaching best practices, research design, and research collaboration. A daily poster and group discussion session provided opportunities for networking and discussion, especially for early career educators. In addition, all meals were provided to attendees to encourage additional networking and collaboration.  Meeting topics include:  Teaching best practices for majority and URM students Scholarship of teaching and learning (SOTL) Integrating research into undergraduate classrooms Assessment best practices Professional development Team and collaborative teaching and learning Curriculum design   Each PECOP Fellow will:  Attend the 2018 ITL meeting and receive reimbursement of registration, air and ground transportation, housing, and meal expenses up to $1,250.  Meet with PECOP Leaders to discuss critical issues in undergraduate education. Discussions will take place at the ITL and via web conferencing. Register as a LifeSciTRC user and learn to use online community tools for finding and saving resources and for creating and sharing resources and collections.  Share their expertise by rating and reviewing resources at the LifeSciTRC and participating in online discussions. Learn about the SOTL at the ITL and via online professional development activities. Work with PECOP Leaders and APS staff to develop an idea for a blog entry at the Undergraduate Faculty LifeSciTRC blog, post the blog entry and respond to comments.   Have an opportunity to become a LifeSciTRC Scholar and Fellow. Have an opportunity to present a workshop at a local, regional, or national professional development meeting. Complete required evaluation surveys (entry, exit, and follow-up).   Intellectual Merit  The 2018 ITL PECOP Fellowship significantly advanced postsecondary science educator knowledge and understanding of teaching best practices and educational research by bringing together a diverse group of postsecondary educators to share evidence-based best practices in teaching science at the undergraduate and graduate/professional levels; and helping these educators to engage in evidence-based education research.    Broader Impacts  Broader impacts of the 2018 ITL PECOP Fellowship included significant advancement of postsecondary STEM education and educator development, expansion of the knowledge base of effective educational practices, and increased participation of underrepresented groups in STEM education. All have the ultimate impact of building a more diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce that increases the nation?s economic competitiveness.
