<AbstractNarration>Title: Access to Civil Justice: Integrating and Advancing Theory and Practice&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every year, over 100 million Americans will confront a civil justice problem. These civil justice problems have broad impacts on those affected, including (among others) their livelihood, the security of their shelter, their ability to work, their access to health care, their chances to participate in the rearing of their children, and care for dependent adults in their lives. Many of these legal problems go unresolved, and others are resolved unfairly. Achieving meaningful access to justice for Americans requires an empirically-grounded and evidence-based understanding of what is currently happening with the public?s access to justice, as well as which concrete proposals for increasing access to justice are likely to be efficacious, scalable, and sustainable. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will consist of a census-style survey of academic disciplines engaged in access to justice scholarship and an intensive workshop. It is designed to build a research field and an evidence base by identifying emerging access to justice researchers, coordinating collaboration across academic disciplines, and producing a research agenda and original scholarship to give access to justice research the vigor and definition of a field. The approach advances access to justice scholarship by identifying new questions for the field and supporting the development of research projects by promising early-career scholars working in the interdisciplinary area of access to justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The workshop enabled early-career and emerging researchers from diverse backgrounds with novel perspectives to play a central role in defining the emerging access to justice field.  The principal activities of the project were:  1)      A horizon scan charting contemporary access to justice research and researchers across disciplines in social sciences and law. A survey was distributed through multiple outreach channels, including the professional networks of the PIs and the project advisory committee; and over two dozen sections of professional associations in law, the social sciences, and interdisciplinary social science. 287 scholars from a wide range of disciplines were surveyed about their understanding of the important questions and puzzles in access to justice research and about the specific individuals they saw as currently making or poised to make important contributions to this research area.  In addition to a rich description of current research, pressing questions, and data needed for work in the access to justice field, the horizon scan produced nearly 400 names of people nominated as established or emerging scholars producing research relevant to access to civil justice.  2)      A 1.5 day workshop bringing together earlier-career scholars from a wide range of disciplines to develop their ideas and strategies for scientific discovery by pushing their research forward, getting it published in core disciplinary outlets, and connecting its insights to practical application.

The small group sessions centered around the substantive and theoretical interests of participants, and connected groups of scholars across disciplinary lines for discussions about their research.  Scholars met in interdisciplinary groups to discuss the theoretical implications of their research in the areas of: policymaking and policy change, access to legal institutions, the design of legal institutions, and the consequences of legal system interactions.  They also met in discipline-focused groups to discuss how their projects on the topic of access to justice could inform key questions and theories in their home disciplines.
