<AbstractNarration>The 17th annual Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference is to be held at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from March 30-31, 2019. It is specifically aimed at graduate students, and many of the talks will be delivered by student participants. The conference will represent a large body of students in different stages of their Ph.D., and will provide a venue for students from a diverse collection of institutions and geographic regions to come together and interact. It aims to create a highly collaborative environment that will stimulate research and foster lasting connections between researchers at particularly crucial moments early in their careers. The structure of the conference (e.g. the lightning talk sessions and brown bag lunch) is designed to encourage future collaborations to strengthen the pool of researchers in this area. The conference will allow graduate students to hear about cutting edge research from established senior leaders and early career faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this conference is to provide a venue for young researchers to be exposed to new research areas, and present their own work in a productive and welcoming environment, while having the chance to engage with experts in the field. Particular attention will be paid to ensure that a broad collection of topics are represented, so that rising generations of mathematicians are aware of the current frontiers of geometry and topology. To this end, there will also be talks by distinguished plenary speakers. These presentations will cover a range of topics in topology and geometry including homotopy theory, low dimensional topology, geometric group theory, geometric analysis, geometric topology, and dynamics. The conference website is: go.math.illinois.edu/gstgc2019&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

There were approximately 200 participants in attendance, the majority of whom were graduate students along with several junior faculty and distinguished senior faculty as speakers.  Intellectual Merit: This conference introduced graduate students, particularly first and second year students, to a wide range of topics in geometry and topology, including: geometric group theory, homotopy theory, geometric anaylsis, the geometry of three manifolds, and ergodic theory. These are all active areas of research with many open questions.

In order to facilitate students forming collaborations, we scheduled 20 minute talks by graduate students as well as several "lightning talk" sessions, which were sessions where students were given 5 minutes to present their highlights of their research. These sessions were very popular and fostered many research discussions between graduate students throughout the weekend. In addition to the 5 and 20 minute graduate student talks, the conference featured 3 colloquium style plenary talks and 6 more technical young faculty talks introducing students to new research directions and open questions.  Broader Impact: This conference informed graduate students of current open avenues of research. A distinguishing characteristic of the Graduate Student Topology Geometry Conference is that graduate students themselves give the majority of the talks. At the 2019 GSTGC we increased the number of graduate student speakers from 28 (in 2018) to 47. This was achieved by introducing sessions of 5 minute "lightning talks". The conference featured graduate student speakers belonging to groups historically underrepresented in math, such as women, Hispanics and African-Americans (11 women out of the 28 speakers giving 30 minute talks, 4 women out of 19 speakers giving lightning talks). A statement of inclusiveness was adopted by the conference, posted to the web site, and communicated to the participants both via email and in person at the conference opening. By repeatedly affirming this statement and remaining responsive to the needs of the conference participants, the organizing committee was able to create a conference environment that was welcoming to all participants.
