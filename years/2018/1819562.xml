<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of a cost-effective, environmental and economically sound Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) production facility based on a finite number of horseshoe crabs (HSC) using minimally impactful and novel bleeding procedures.  The goal is to address the demands of an estimated $114 million LAL market and finished kit market in excess of $1 billion per annum. Success of this project also anticipates exceeding current standards by ensuring biomedical and pharmaceutical manufacturing compliance with fewer total horseshoe crabs than the number that die annually from current practices. New approaches to HSC bleeding developed in this project would also enable repeated, controlled bleeding while maintaining optimal conditions for animal vitality and for the adjacent communities. Assuming optimized, scalable HSC bleeding operations could eventually expand current supplies, innovative applications could be developed. For example, early detection of sepsis could help avert some $30 billion in direct care every year in the US, notwithstanding the potential to save countless lives with development of gram-negative screening tools for hospital acquired septicemia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an alternative method of bleeding horseshoe crabs (HSCs) for Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) harvest. The overarching objective to demonstrate the proof-of-concept of an implantable, and surgical-grade device engineered to facilitate routine bleeding, without compromising the integrity and well-being of the HSC. This will be achieved via a systematic study of HSC bleeding outcomes to investigate whether such a device can meet the sterility and quality standards of traditional approaches, while obviating the need for extraneous transport to expensive, inland bleeding facilities. Furthermore, the commercial opportunity and feasibility of the device paired with a habitat-based, enclosed system to systematically monitor HSC wellbeing will be investigated. This SBIR Phase I project would be the first to investigate an alternative approach to bleeding HSCs, a technique that has not changed significantly since the late 1800's. At scale, the proposed approach would also be expected to improve product quality and traceability, and ultimately the bottom line of companies producing LAL kits, given a surplus of LAL in the supply chain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

LAL is critical to bacterial endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide; (LPS)] testing for FDA compliance to ensure sterility in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The opportunity is comprised of both economic and ecologic benefits by refining a product with significant advantages to current horseshoe crab collection, bleeding and raw material isolation methods. In recent years, academic research, popular press and regulatory trends have highlighted that industrial operations and environmental declines have challenged the future sustainability of global horseshoe crab populations. The results derived from this Phase I research provide a rationale for transitioning from random, episodic wild-capture bleeding practices to establishing a relatively small cohort of horseshoe crabs that could be carefully monitored, with consistent feeding, habitat management and repetitive, low-impact bleeding that could ultimately match the LAL production now requiring some 600,000 wild-caught horseshoe crabs. These innovations specifically address risks and challenges posed by current horseshoe crab harvesting practices for wild capture, transport and bleeding.</p> <p><strong>Goals of Our Work:&nbsp;</strong>The primary research goal of this Phase I SBIR was to provide a sustainable, low-impact source of high-quality LAL raw material, as an alternative to LAL harvested in current practices that include protracted habitat extraction, transportation, and consequent morbidity and mortality. The method combines repetitive bleeding via an indwelling catheter, followed by reinfusing hemolymph (after separation from amebocytes) aquaculture, with feed and harvesting innovations for a defined cohort that has been shown to optimize horseshoe crab wellbeing. At scale, proprietary husbandry methods are expected to improve product quality and traceability, establish a sustainable horseshoe crab blood harvest process, significantly reduce bleeding-induced mortality rates, and provide this vital resource cost-effectively to industry customers.<strong></strong>This research approach has disruptive potential and long-term market viability, especially given the near collapse of Asian horseshoe crab populations.<strong></strong></p> <p><strong>Kepley BioSystems Key Phase I Accomplishments:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Designed, optimized and implemented two specialized horseshoe crab aquaculture systems (indoor and outdoor) for husbandry and bleeding operations research.</li> <li>Development of SOPs, troubleshooting guides, action plans, and remedial procedures for horseshoe crab aquaculture</li> <li>Identified, designed and engineered a customized indwelling catheter appliance that remained in situ following surgery, was capable of successful hemolymph collection, did not adversely affect horseshoe crab wellbeing and could tolerate the aquatic environment throughout the grant period.</li> <li>Produced distinctive feedstock formulations for optimum horseshoe crab nutritional parameters and established feeding rates for indoor aquaculture so as to achieve robust animal wellbeing and peak post-bleed cellular rebound.</li> <li>Demonstrated that reinfusion of autologous supernatant (after amebocyte extraction) had profound effects on horseshoe crab biochemical and cellular properties, allowing for frequent, sustainable harvesting.</li> <li>Produced LAL from horseshoe crabs nurtured in an indoor aquaculture system that demonstrated profound LPS reactivity compared to LAL reagents derived from wild-caught horseshoe crabs.</li> </ol> <p>To learn more about our work with horseshoe crabs visit&nbsp;<a href="https://kepleybiosystems.com/hsc/">Kepley BioSystems</a>.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/02/2019<br>      Modified by: Kristen&nbsp;Dellinger</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1819562/1819562_10580086_1567448288319_hsc-project-banner-2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1819562/1819562_10580086_1567448288319_hsc-project-banner-2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Horseshoe_Crab_Project_NSF_2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1819562/1819562_10580086_1567448288319_hsc-project-banner-2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Horseshoe_Crab_Project_NSF_2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">National Science Foundation sponsored research initiative for a novel horseshoe crab device and approach for sustainable endotoxin testing.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kepley BioSystems, Inc.</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kristen&nbsp;Dellinger</div> <div class="imageTitle">Horseshoe_Crab_Project_NSF_2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1819562/1819562_10580086_1567448092671_HSC-indoor-rachel--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1819562/1819562_10580086_1567448092671_HSC-indoor-rachel--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Horseshoe_Crab_Project_NSF"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1819562/1819562_10580086_1567448092671_HSC-indoor-rachel--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Horseshoe_Crab_Project_NSF"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dr. Rachel Tinker-Kulberg acclimates a horseshoe crab prior to insertion of an indwelling catheter device for routine bleeding.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kepley BioSystems, Inc.</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kristen&nbsp;Dellinger</div> <div class="imageTitle">Horseshoe_Crab_Project_NSF</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1819562/1819562_10580086_1567448488535_HSC-outdoor-ranch--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1819562/1819562_10580086_1567448488535_HSC-outdoor-ranch--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Horseshoe_Crab_Project_NSF_3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1819562/1819562_10580086_1567448488535_HSC-outdoor-ranch--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Horseshoe_Crab_Project_NSF_3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Horseshoe crab research site on Jekyll Island, Georgia at Tidelands Pond.

Kepley BioSystems Key Phase I Accomplishments:  Designed, optimized and implemented two specialized horseshoe crab aquaculture systems (indoor and outdoor) for husbandry and bleeding operations research. Development of SOPs, troubleshooting guides, action plans, and remedial procedures for horseshoe crab aquaculture Identified, designed and engineered a customized indwelling catheter appliance that remained in situ following surgery, was capable of successful hemolymph collection, did not adversely affect horseshoe crab wellbeing and could tolerate the aquatic environment throughout the grant period. Produced distinctive feedstock formulations for optimum horseshoe crab nutritional parameters and established feeding rates for indoor aquaculture so as to achieve robust animal wellbeing and peak post-bleed cellular rebound. Demonstrated that reinfusion of autologous supernatant (after amebocyte extraction) had profound effects on horseshoe crab biochemical and cellular properties, allowing for frequent, sustainable harvesting. Produced LAL from horseshoe crabs nurtured in an indoor aquaculture system that demonstrated profound LPS reactivity compared to LAL reagents derived from wild-caught horseshoe crabs.
