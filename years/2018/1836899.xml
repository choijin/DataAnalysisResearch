<AbstractNarration>The one-day workshop, "Preparing Graduate Students for Careers in Teaching Statistics and Data Science", will be held Saturday, July 28, 2018 in conjunction with the Joint Statistical Meetings in Vancouver, British Columbia.   The workshop will provide graduate students and post-doctoral researchers with the tools necessary to develop innovative and pedagogically-sound learning experiences for their students, both inside and outside the classroom, and to implement formative and summative assessment to guide instructional practice. The ultimate objective of this workshop is to increase the proportion of successful instructors who have the skills, capacity, and inclination to take on the challenges of complex data-oriented teaching. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existing guidelines provide research-based recommendations for the pedagogy and assessment in introductory statistics courses. Ongoing efforts focus attention on modernizing the content and extending these ideas throughout the undergraduate curriculum. There has also been tremendous activity in developing materials for bringing principles of data science into stand-alone courses for broad student audiences, as well as using data-centric approaches in many types of statistics courses. The goal of this workshop is to equip future educators with concrete information ranging from recommended practices in teaching statistics and data science, to providing repositories of teaching and data resources, and creating the infrastructure knowledge necessary to seamlessly incorporate computing into the curriculum.  Discussions will include decisions involved in developing curriculum, creating an assessment plan, and choosing technology tools.  Workshop attendees will work through several examples and gain first-hand experience with active learning, use of real data, and technology tools such as RStudio and RMarkdown.  More information can be found at the workshop website  https://sites.google.com/view/preparetoteach/home&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The Preparing Graduate Students for Careers in Teaching Statistics and Data Science workshop was held in conjunction with the Joint Statistical Meetings 2018.   The effective teaching of statistics and data science requires the development of content knowledge as well as pedagogical content knowledge.  Data science in particular requires both analytical and computational skills.    Many new PhDs have significant depth of knowledge of statistics, but may not have experience in relating that knowledge to undergraduates of diverse backgrounds  or bringing their research into valuable undergraduate research experiences. This workshop addressed the related issue that many graduate programs prepare students primarily for research careers in academia and provide only limited opportunities for developing teaching skills or gathering classroom experience   This workshop equipped future educators with concrete information ranging from recommended practices in teaching statistics, to repositories of teaching and data resources, to the infrastructure knowledge necessary to seamlessly incorporate computing into the curriculum. Topics included decisions involved in developing curriculum, creating an assessment plan, and choosing technology tools.
