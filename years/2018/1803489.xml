<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2018 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Andrew J. Zucker is "Interactions between abstract topological dynamics, Ramsey theory, and descriptive set theory". The host institution for the fellowship is Universite Paris Diderot and the sponsoring scientist is Todor Tsankov.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
