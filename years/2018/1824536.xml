<AbstractNarration>The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. This project will begin to build a testbed for research partnerships to design and test cyberlearning systems for smart and connected communities for learning.  Doing this type of research requires partnerships between educators, researchers, technologists, and youth, and enduring relationships between organizations within a city. The Digital Youth Network at DePaul designs learning systems aiming to ensure that all youth, especially the underserved, cultivate the critical skills, literacies and agency necessary to have the opportunity to create lives that are engaged, empowered and successful. Building on prior successes of testing its own learning technology initiatives across the city of Chicago, this project will help DYN serve as a testbed for other researchers working towards models of learning with technologies at the scale of a large city. This will allow many more researchers to more effectively build and study innovative ways to deploy technology to empower diverse learners at that scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will explore the creation of frameworks and protocols to reduce the friction in creating research partnerships to support the creation of ecosystems that support the fluid integration of the technologies, learning frameworks, activity structures, curriculum, and human capital, necessary to support learning across space, place, and time. To achieve this goal, the project will conduct four activities: (1) Playtest and pilot three existing NSF-funded projects with DYN formal and/or informal learning partners, and refine models for testbed partnerships based on these experiences; (2) Develop case studies that shed light on the problems of practice (from diverse stakeholder perspectives) around the creation and implementation of a city-scale testbed within a community learning hub; (3) Develop protocols for differential sharing of student learning data with hub partners and aggregate learning data with the larger cyberlearning community; and, (4) Host a two-part workshop that brings together a diverse group of stakeholders, including hub partners, to develop a testable model for the development and implementation of research-instrumented innovation hubs designed to support playtesting of still-in-development NSF interventions with under-resourced communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Through support from the National Science Foundation, the Digital Youth Network (DYN) at Northwestern University collaborated with learning scientists  from Stanford, Wisconsin, and Northwestern to explore computational strategies for reducing barriers limiting the research community in collaboratively integrating our learning infrastructures to support deeper, broader, and more equitable learning for all youth through the creation of a virtual implementation hub built upon the DYN?s L3 learning ecosystem platform.  Through this grant, DYN worked with partners to address the technical, social, and contractional barriers (i.e., data agreements, APIs, single sign-on, integrating content and language, professional development) that make integrating learning systems across research project difficult by working through the challenges of integrating our systems.  Specifically, the DYN team partnered with learning sciences faculty from Stanford, Wisconsin, and Northwestern School of Education and Social Policy, to work through the technical and data sharing challenges of integrating their NSF funded computational thinking and making tools into DYN?s L3 learning platform.  As of this reporting, the DYN team has worked with partners to expand the L3 platform through the integration of six STEM learning technologies: four NSF supported (FUSE, TunePad, SNAP, VENVI); two commercial learning systems (Khan Academy and Tynker). In addition, the DYN team has partnered with learning sciences faculty to begin the development of a shared framework for logging OST program participation data in order to facilitate communities and districts that use the L3 platform in being able to visualize learning data at the micro, meso, and macro levels in order to align resources to provide more equitable learning opportunities community-wide.  The resultant DYN portal refreshed with these new computational making integrations is the subject of a recently launched three-year study of the computational making activity across in and out-of-school learning contexts of 6th-8th students attending school in a 1:1 laptop district in a midsize Midwestern community.  By creating a ?portal of portals? the DYN team has greatly expanded the ability of learning science researchers, working in partnership with community and district educators and administrators, to understand how students use different systems to develop their computational thinking and making literacies.
