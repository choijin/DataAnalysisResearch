<AbstractNarration>This project supports travel for 27 students in robotics from traditionally underrepresented groups, including minorities and people with disabilities. The researchers will participate in the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) conference, along with its associated workshops, which runs June 26-30, 2018 in Pittsburgh, PA. The students will be mentored both through being paired with senior PhD students and postdocs and participation in a mentorship breakfast led by the RSS conference chair.  By exposing early career researchers from underrepresented groups to this type of intellectual environment, they will be better able to be situated in the robotics field and get better ideas for the type and quality of research needed to have impact in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

While the field is progressing forward, both in academia and industry, the percentage of roboticists from groups traditionally underrepresented in robotics and in STEM in general (racial minorities, women, people with disabilities, and LGBTQ individuals) continues to lag far behind their counterparts. While there are no specific data sets for representation in Robotics, the general  trend for computer science, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering apply to this field as well.  Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) is a single track, highly regarded conference that routinely showcases the state of the art in robotics. In 2018 we started the Inclusion@RSS initiative aimed at supporting students from underrepresented groups early in their career by exposing them to cutting edge research and creating a mentorship structure that will help advance their careers, increase their visibility and support them as future role models.  This grant supported the participation of of 24 students and two faculty members from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM in RSS 2018, held in Pittsburgh, PA, and three students in RSS 2019, held in Freiburg, Germany. The support included covering the costs of travel, lodging, and registration for the participants, and mentoring activities with both faculty and senior graduate students.  In post conference surveys, the students who participated in Inclusion@RSS indicated that they had a positive experience that increased their confidence in their ability to become experts in the field.
