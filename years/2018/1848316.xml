<AbstractNarration>Non-technical summary&lt;br/&gt;Understanding non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum systems has been a major focus in quantum physics and materials research. Applications range from manipulating thermal and electronic transport in solids to controlling information propagation in a quantum network that behaves like an interacting quantum system. Non-equilibrium dynamics is however not very well-understood in certain quantum materials, especially for those with strong interactions between constituents. To gain precise knowledge on the quantum dynamics of interest, a quantum material with precise local probes and control is highly desired. This CAREER award supports an experimental research and education program to assemble a designer quantum material for the exploration of elusive non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. The proposed material consists of an array of cold neutral atoms, each cooled to its quantum mechanical ground state, and controlled by novel potentials formed by optical, phononic and nanophotonic lattices to mimic various types of quantum materials. The project aims at inducing and probing a variety of quantum dynamical phenomena not previously realized. Success in this project will lead to advancement in controlling atomic quantum materials and in deeper understanding of quantum many-body and statistical physics. Due to broad experimental techniques involved in this research program, the project will provide solid research training for both graduate and undergraduate students. Furthermore, in collaboration with the Purdue Physics and Astronomy Outreach office, the project will initiate a secondary-grade outreach program aimed at improving the learning capital and STEM career orientation of underrepresented minority students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical summary&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports an experimental research and education program to explore non-equilibrium dynamics in an atomic quantum gas using a state-of-the-art cold atom toolbox for optical, phononic, and nanophotonic lattice engineering. One thrust of this CAREER project is probing quantum critical dynamics of an atomic quantum gas in an optical lattice. In particular, the PI will employ a new experimental scheme to access a superfluid-to-Mott insulator quantum critical point, enabling various ways to explore critical thermodynamics and transport problems that have remained elusive to date. Furthermore, the PI will explore quasiparticle control to engineer a phononic band gap crystal in a superfluid quantum gas that can inhibit phonon transport, just as electronic band gaps do to electrons in solid state crystals. It can be engineered to manipulate thermal and entropy transport in a superfluid sample. The PI will perform dynamical control of the phononic crystals, therefore allowing for the exploration of phononic analogues of electrodynamics phenomena. For a long-term goal of this CAREER project on probing novel quantum dynamics, the PI will aim at further integrating ultracold atoms with nanophotonic lattices to form a designer hybrid material, where the atom-surface Casimir-Polder interaction provides a deep subwavelength lattice potential for entering new regimes of quantum dynamics. Success in this project will advance our knowledge in understanding quantum critical dynamics, provide valuable insights to quantum transport in phononic bandgap materials, and potentially lead to the observation of unexpected new quantum phenomena with a designer hybrid quantum material. The broad experimental techniques involved in this research program will provide solid research training for both graduate and undergraduate students. Furthermore, in collaboration with the Purdue Physics and Astronomy Outreach office, the project will initiate a secondary-grade outreach program, aimed at improving the learning capital and STEM career orientation of underrepresented minority students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
