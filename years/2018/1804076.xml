<AbstractNarration>The conference in Biology and Medicine through Mathematics (BAMM!) will take place May 30 - June 1, 2018 at Virginia Commonwealth University. The aim of the conference is to highlight recent developments in the broad fields of mathematical biology and medicine.  The plenary speakers will cover a range of expertise and will provide highlights from advances in the field in recent years.  The goals of this conference are to: i) provide a regional biomathematics conference that promotes junior investigators (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty); ii) give visibility to a range of applications and methods in mathematical biology; iii) provide a good environment for networking between junior and senior researchers.  The conference will host approximately 100 attendees. The conference will be a mix of plenary talks, break-out sessions and a poster session.  Travel support will be used to increase the accessibility of the conference by junior researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Junior researchers (undergraduates and graduate students, postdoctoral scholars and early career faculty) will benefit from participating in this meeting. BAMM! will provide an intimate conference environment with opportunities to present a poster or give a talk for researchers at all levels. The travel award funds will promote junior presenters attendance at BAMM!. Given the diversity of the planned talks, student researchers new to the field will have the opportunity to attend talks from many subfields. This will be an excellent opportunity for undergraduate and master's students from VCU and other regional institutions. Participation of women and underrepresented minorities in mathematics and science will be encouraged and supported. More information can be found at http://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/bamm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

And finally, Trachette Jackson from the University of Michigan presented an overview of her work on using mathematical modeling to optimize cancer therapies for the most effective outcome. We had about 100 attendees with 50 contributed talks and 20 posters to round out  the  conference.  Topics  ranged  from  disease  spread  dynamics  to  models  of  human  physiology  to  cancer  dynamics  to  neurosciences to ecology. What we had initially envisioned as a local conference  has  continued  to  exceeded  our  expectations  with  a  vibrant  group  with  mathematicians  from  around the country (22 states represented), from undergraduate students on up. Everyone participated in a networking coffee break which allowed great opportunities for career conversations and idea sharing.

The goals of this conference were achieved: i) establish a regional  biomathematics conference that promotes junior investigators (graduate  students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty); ii) give visibility  to a range of applications and methods in mathematical biology; iii)  provide a stimulating environment for networking between junior and  senior researchers.
