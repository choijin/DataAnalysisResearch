<AbstractNarration>The proposal is a request to support participants from underrepresented groups to attend the 2018 Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference, scheduled from September 18 to 22, in Orlando, Florida.  The grant funds will provide student scholarships (undergraduate and graduate students from groups underrepresented in computing) and faculty from Minority Serving Institutions.  This is a continuing conference effort which the PI has led for a number of years.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference is the main conference for&lt;br/&gt;celebrating the diversity that exists in computing. The conference mission is to bring together&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate students, professionals, and faculty in computer science and computer engineering from all backgrounds and ethnicities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The given award provided support for the 2018 ACM Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference.  While the Tapia Conference is an annual event, the details below focus on the 2018 Tapia Conference, correspond to the award.  The Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference is the main conference for celebrating the diversity that exists in computing.  The conference mission is to bring together undergraduate and graduate students, professionals, and faculty in computer science and computer engineering from all backgrounds and ethnicities to:  Celebrate the diversity that currently exists in computer science and computer engineering. Connect with others with common backgrounds, ethnicities, disabilities, and gender so as to create communities that extend beyond the conference. Receive advice from and make useful contacts with computer science and computer engineering leaders in academia and industry. Be inspired by great presentations and conversations with successful people in computer science and computer engineering who have similar backgrounds, ethnicities, disabilities, and gender to the attendees.   The conference series was named in honor of Dr. Richard A. Tapia, a University Professor and holder of the Maxfield-Oshman professorship in the Department of Computational and Applied Mathematics at Rice University in Houston, Texas.  Dr. Tapia is internationally known for his research in the computational and mathematical sciences.  In addition, he is a national leader in education and outreach programs.   The Tapia Conference has grown from 164 attendees in 2001 (the first conference) to 1429 attendees in 2018.  The 2018 Tapia Conference was held in Orlando, FL with the following attendee demographics:  50% women 30% Black/African American 20% Hispanic/Latinx 20% White/Caucasian 15% Asian/Southeast Asian 1% Native American/Native Alaskan/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander 4% Multiracial 11% Persons with Disabilities or U.S. Military     In addition, 60% of the conference attendees were students, representing over 250 colleges and universities.   Based upon the Tapia 2018 conference survey,  83% of the students agreed or strongly agreed that attending Tapia 2018 increased their dedication to completing their degree in computing 94% of the students agreed or strongly agreed that attending Tapia 2018 provided an opportunity to make new connections 33% of the attendees met at least 20 new people at Tapia 2018, an indication of the significant opportunities for networking 93% of the students agreed or strongly agreed that Tapia 2018 was inspiring with respect to learning about various opportunities in computing 86% of the Doctoral Consortium attendees found the session good to outstanding   Tapia 2018 Plenary Speakers  Dr. Shirley Malcom, Head of Education and Human Resources Program, AAAS Dr. Shiri Azenkot, Associate Professor of Information Science, Cornell University Dr. Ronald Perez, Intel Fellow &amp; Technical Lead, Data Center Group at Intel Corp. Dr. Moshe Vardi, George Distinguished Service Professor in Computational Engineering at Rice University   In addition to plenary talks, the 2018 Tapia Conference included the following components:  Student-oriented panels focused on topics such as graduate school, resume writing, and career paths in computing.  Professional development workshops focused on topics such as navigating the tenure process, climbing the corporate ladder, and proposal writing. Birds of a feather sessions that facilitate the formation of communities focused on particular topics related to diversity in computing. Leadership panels that include top leaders that can provide strategies for effective leadership based upon experience. Industry Panels that focus on the latest areas of technological innovation and research. Student poster competition that allows students to present their latest research results and compete based upon presentation of their research and the ability to answer questions. Doctoral Consortium that takes place the day before the first day of the conference and allows senior doctoral students to present their research to experts in their area and receive very valuable and detailed feedback. Supporter information area that allows conference supporters to disseminate materials particular to their organization or university and talk one-on-one with conference attendees.   The NSF grant was used to support about 100 student scholarships and 10 Doctoral Consortium participants.  In addition, the funding was used to fund the meals and AV for the Doctoral Consortium.            Last Modified: 08/23/2020       Submitted by: Valerie E Taylor]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
