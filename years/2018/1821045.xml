<AbstractNarration>This project supports the development of a five-year strategic plan for a biological field station at a Tulane University facility in New Orleans, LA. The ByWater Biological Field Station lies in an eight-acre forest tract in the City of New Orleans, contiguous with a larger 5,000-acre bottomland hardwood forest on the city's southern margin. The site offers wide range of opportunities for experimental and applied research, education, public engagement and science communication, and interdisciplinary collaboration. The scientific importance of the site lies in its experimental value for the development and refining of urban ecosystem management techniques, and additionally in the site's proximity to and embeddedness in important regional deltaic processes and related policy development. Further, the ByWater Field Station is already utilized as an environmental education and arts integration facility for the region. Strategic planning will be undertaken to compliment these uses with a rigorous scientific program that aims to support partnerships with diverse stakeholders in the region. The ByWater Biological Field Station represents a key opportunity for scientific practice and community engagement in Louisiana and beyond. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning project for the ByWater Biological Field Station will produce a five-year strategic plan for a new peri-urban field station situated at the nexus of vulnerable ecosystems and communities. Research at the Station has the potential to significantly contribute to use-inspired urban, forest, coastal, and riverine science ongoing in the region and growing nationally. The human and biophysical factors shaping forest dynamics in and around the Station represent a locally important and globally relevant setting for scientific research and land management policy development. Strategic planning for the field station will enable an impactful, novel research program; increased education and training opportunities; prospects for groundbreaking cross-disciplinary and cross-sector collaborations; new possibilities for improving science literacy and engagement; and enhanced research and education infrastructure in Louisiana and on the Gulf Coast. The region is in need of improved education and STEM training and learning outcomes, and the planning process will fulfill a major need in an underserved region of the U.S. More details on the existing facility can be found at https://www.astudiointhewoods.org/index.html.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ByWater Institute (BWI) at Tulane University in New Orleans pursued a strategic planning initiative exploring the viability and potential programming of a large urban woodland that lies just south of New Orleans. Tulane currently owns two mostly forested parcels in this woodland, which the planning team refers to as the Lower Coast Forest. Though this woodland is an expansive, biodiverse, and increasingly rare ecosystem in the region, little is known about its ecological dynamics, connectivity across property parcels, and potential for scientific research. The project team at Tulane initiated several activities to assess these possibilities more fully.   First, we conducted surveys of the relevant forest parcels to better identify key potential collaborators and important or unique aspects of the forest's natural systems. Second, we convened dozens of relevant local partners and field station experts nationwide in New Orleans to provide feedback and offer insights on what establishing a field research station in this site would entail. Third, BWI faculty and staff collaborated to develop a 5-year strategic plan that lays out a pathway for the development of scientific research, science communication, and community engagement activities anchored in the Lower Coast Forest.   The Field Station site is anchored by the 7.66 acre Carmichael Forest that is part of Tulane's A Studio in the Woods.  This bottomland hardwood forest is managed by Tulane faculty and staff and has long hosted a variety of field research and interdisciplinary uses.  That history and growing demand for places conducive to the multidisciplinary study of urban ecosystems led the BWI to create the Lower Coast Field Station.  The Field Station now consists of Carmichael Forest and the 500-acre Hebert Forest owned by Tulane nearby in upper Plaquemines Parish.  The field station planning process has led to a renewed interest and awareness of the Lower Coast Forest, an often ignored but ecologically significant forest stand. Several thousand acres of bottomland hardwood forest that were largely unknown even to our regional partners gained an identity and a name that enables better communication of the forest's natural resources and value to the public. This advances Tulane's urban ecology research programming by tying our ongoing regional monitoring to a series of forest parcels that might be utilized for experimental work difficult in a randomized monitoring network. We engaged Tulane's ecologists and biologists and those of several local universities in thinking differently about urban forests not necessarily as 'degraded' or 'urbanized' but as viable spaces for biodiversity conservation and research.   The potential for increased research activity on Tulane's properties in the Lower Coast Forest presents opportunities for greater public-facing environmental education programming in the New Orleans region.
