<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on finding a practical and cost-effective protective cap for baseball pitchers susceptible to serious head injuries from impacts of batted baseballs. The new cap design satisfactorily addresses the shortcomings of previous commercialization efforts that were unable to meet the prescribed protective requirements; failed to pass both the players' fashion expectations and comfort evaluation; and carried a hefty purchase price. The acceptance and use of the new cap by professional baseball players will create widespread demand from collegiate, high school and Little League players, a market that is estimated to generate annual revenues of more than $18M. These market projections exclude consideration of the technology's Broader Impact potential in other sports or vocational and military applications, where there is a growing recognition of the need for improved head protection for athletes, soldiers, law enforcement officials and construction workers. Sports injuries are now highly scrutinized, especially those causing long-term medical issues from brain injury, blunt force trauma and repetitive concussive injury. The societal value of this innovation will be found in safer sports and work environments. Such equipment represents a rapidly growing segment of the apparel market and a unique commercial opportunity for the company. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is based on the company's patented design that provides head protection from the impact of a baseball. The novelty of the protective cap headliner is its flexible outer hard shell made with highly rigid interconnecting truncated icosahedron panels. This allows the headliner to conform to the shape of the head while maintaining the stiffness needed to diffuse impact loads.  Since the impact of a baseball represents a short duration point load, the energy-absorbing capacity of the layer beneath the outer shell can be minimized. The objective is to identify the material characteristics required to dissipate the impact load associated with a Severity Index of 1200 or greater when a head-form is struck by a baseball traveling at speeds up to 125 mph; and to identify the material combination(s) best suited to achieve this goal. Traditional foam materials as well as state-of-the-art material compositions will be used in unique configurations to produce solutions that are not too heavy, not too bulky nor too hot to wear. The outcomes of this study will determine the availability of materials that can be used within the ergonomic and mechanical constraints of the patented design to protect the head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Whatever the application, baseball caps are designed for uniform conformity and professional identity but typically are not designed for protection. For some uniformed personnel it is impractical to wear heavy body armor, helmets or riot gear when trying to perform daily duties that require mobility, agility, unobstructed visibility and casual public interaction. As a result, baseball caps are widely distributed in the millions and are worn routinely when danger is often not anticipated, though potentially very real whether you are a Police officer or baseball pitcher standing on the mound.  Professional pitchers in Major League Baseball have increasingly become susceptible to serious head injuries from line-drive batted baseballs. Professional players often clock the speed of a batted ball at more than 90mph. Despite the risks, pitchers still reject wearing baseball helmets as a solution; helmets are cumbersome, hot and mechanically impeding, all of which compromise their performance. Currently there is no solution available in the market that can balance head protection compliance with the wearable requirements demanded by these professional athletes.  Harvest Moon Inventions (HMI) set out to demonstrate the feasibility of an effective and unobtrusively wearable protective headgear with applicability in sports and law enforcement. Major League Baseball has expressed an immediate need for such a device which lends itself as the perfect launch pad for the product, providing high profile publicity and free marketing opportunities throughout the professional sport that can filter down to law enforcement and other public sectors.  Design Concept  HMI started Phase I with its own utility patent (US 9693594) for ?Protective Headgear,? awarded in 2017. The uniqueness of this patented technology is that it can provide head protection with a hard shell, yet flexible, while keeping the look and feel of a traditional baseball cap. This is achieved through a series of stiff, three-dimensional curved and truncated icosahedrons which are connected to form a half-spherical hard shell. The joints or seams between the icosahedron panels allow the spherical shape to fold and bend, conforming snugly onto the head without bulkiness.  This hard, stiff and yet malleable half-spherical structure is designed to distribute the impact load of a speeding baseball or other hard objects over a larger area. Lining the inner surface of the panels is a thin energy-absorbing molded polyurethane layer. The hard, outer shell panels and energy-absorbing liner combine to form the protective insert that is integrated into a traditional baseball cap.  Prototype Design  In Phase I, HMI set out to develop a computational model and a database of material characterizations from which a combination of materials could be selected to form a 3/8-inch thick laminate capable of achieving the following features when incorporated as an insert to a baseball cap:  reduces by 30% the impact pulse to the head by a baseball traveling at 90 plus miles per hour; feels and wears as close as possible to a traditional baseball cap.  Composed of the materials selected initially through simulation testing for their stiffness and energy-absorption properties, the insert design was developed through several prototype iterations between computer simulation and dynamic testing to validate both the computational model response and the material characteristics. The dynamic testing was performed by launching a baseball out of an air cannon and impacting an instrumented Hybrid III head form.  The protective panels were made out of carbon-fiber reinforced nylon, overlaying a thin, molded Polyurethane energy-absorbing elastomeric layer. Demonstrated through dynamic testing to provide protection, this prototype was then modified to improve comfort and wearability.  When this protective wearable prototype was presented to top officials of professional baseball they were impressed by its potential to be accepted by the community of baseball pitchers.  Broader Impacts  Aside from the technical innovation, it became evident as HMI developed this technology that the current head protection sports standard (NOCSAE) is limited in addressing specific protective headgear applications such as for a baseball strike to the head of a baseball pitcher.  This newfound understanding lead HMI to champion and form an ASTM task group, working with a community of recognized head protection experts to create a relevant protective headgear standard specific for pitchers. While some solutions for pitcher head protection are currently offered, manufacturers are unable to make claims to any standard. As a result, marketing language promoting the level of protection is inconsistent and vague, forcing users to make uneducated choices, and manufacturers to miss the opportunity to develop innovative protection gear with state-of-the-art materials.
