<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project capitalizes on the current growth in citizen science to explore the commercial potential of a technological platform that streamlines data capture, collection, integration, hosting, visualization, analysis, and sharing for citizen science projects. Although widely popular, the tasks necessary to do citizen science well are onerous, complex, and frustrating leading to inefficiencies, lost time, and added expense. Project managers need tools that help them and their volunteers execute research in a fast, easy, and cost effective method. They need to easily tailor the governance of members and data and be able to quickly recruit, communicate with, and oversee members. They need data collection tools flexible enough to support their specific and evolving needs; they need data to be high quality, secure, backed up, curated, and accessible all in a centralized place. They need to easily detect outliers, be able to fix errors, upload data, create reports, and efficiently automate the sharing and delivery of data to stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project explores the market need for an online platform to realize the full potential of citizen science. Citizen science engages the public in scientific research and is growing rapidly. Currently, thousands of citizen science projects engage millions of participants. However, there is a disconnect between software features and project needs. Current projects remain fraught with inefficiencies and software and data systems are ad hoc and disjointed.  This results in software and data silos. Current solutions limit observations to single points, lack support for rigorous scientific experimentation and analysis, and cannot deliver data to consumers in a readily usable format. This platform streamlines data collection and sharing through flexible, fully customizable, and synchronized real-time web and mobile applications.  It improves project data management, analysis, and visualization.  It amplifies the impacts of projects by increasing awareness, collaboration, and sharing across projects.</AbstractNarration>

The team conducted 148 customer discovery interviews, attending 4 trade shows and 1 conference and developed and iterated on a business model canvas. The team successfully met the requirements of the 6-week course and has set new goals for moving forward to continue the customer discovery process beyond the I-Corps award until a viable customer segment is found. During the customer discovery process, the team determined that there is not yet a &nbsp;a viable customer segment for the product such that it would lead to exponential growth, despite our initial evidence for a scalable business model. The team is exploring additional customer segments as well as additional business and not-for-profit models that may be more appropriate to the work the project team conducts and the product offered. The team gained a much more comprehensive understanding of how CitSci.org can provide value to its customers and that understanding customer's motivations and desires, in addition to their challenges, must come first before a business model can be developed. </span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: #303b53; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Broader Impacts</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.3800000000000001; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The I-Corps program served as a very impactful professional development course for two research associates who previously had very minimal business training.

CitSci.org is a citizen science support platform, designed with public engagement in mind. The CitSci.org platform itself advances access and exposure to science for practitioners, teachers, young people, and other members of the general public. It currently supports over 630 projects, from a variety of disciplines globally that engage thousands of volunteers that have collectively generated close to one million scientific measurements. The knowledge gained through the I-Corps process has the potential to impact people from many disciplines as the team further develops the business model and shares experiences with the managers the team works with. In this way, the team can provide examples to project managers of methods for developing sustainable business models for their projects and guidance about what the team has found that does/does not work. Thus, the team can be an I-Corps training program resource of sorts for the hundreds of projects supported by the platform that themselves in turn also seek viable business models to support their own growth as individual citizen science projects/organizations/corporations. Participation in the I-Corps program by this team helps further understanding of business growth and development strategies in a discipline less familiar with business practices outside of academia and not-for-profit organizations. By participating in the I-Corps process, the team is now better equipped to create and provide a product that the user base actually wants and needs. With a better suited product for the customer segment, CitSci.org will be facilitating better access to citizen science for thousands of people throughout the world.</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/14/2018<br>      Modified by: Gregory&nbsp;J&nbsp;Newman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1817612/1817612_10527247_1533853773786_citSci_logo_stroke--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1817612/1817612_10527247_1533853773786_citSci_logo_stroke--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CitSci.org Logo"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1817612/1817612_10527247_1533853773786_citSci_logo_stroke--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CitSci.org Logo"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">CitSci.org is a global citizen science support platform</div> <div class="imageCredit">CitSci.org</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Gregory&nbsp;J&nbsp;Newman</div> <div class="imageTitle">CitSci.org Logo</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
