<AbstractNarration>Cosmological observations over the last few decades have provided us with a standard model of cosmology, where the six parameters that describe the data are constrained with percent-level accuracy.  However, fundamental questions in our understanding of the universe remain unanswered.  This project will address the following major puzzles in fundamental physics: (1) What is the physics that seeded the first structures in the universe? (2) What is the nature of Dark Matter and how is it related to particle physics?  Dr. Dvorkin will continue to collaborate with the Boston Area Girls STEM Collaborative in an effort to improve gender imbalance in academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shape of temperature fluctuations across the sky in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) can potentially contain important information regarding the hypothetical earliest phase of the universe known as inflation.  This project will develop methods to analyze CMB data to help narrow down the shape of the inflation potential.  Possible dark matter particles lighter than hydrogen will also be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
