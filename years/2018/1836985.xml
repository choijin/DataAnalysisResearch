<AbstractNarration>The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) is a National Science Foundation funded facility that provides continuous scientific observations from the oceans at key locations from the coasts to the deep sea.  The OOI Observations come from over 500 deployed instruments aboard fixed (connected to the seafloor) and moving (underwater robotic gliders) platforms. Observations are made available to the community including constituencies such as scientists, fishermen, and interested science classes, in as near to real-time as possible, and without any additional costs.  The current award will provide support to enable a successful transition of the management of the OOI Facility from the Consortium for Ocean Leadership to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and their partners the University of Washington, Oregon State University, and Rutgers University.  The transition will take place over a four-month period, resulting in minimal impact on the delivery of data to the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deliverables to be completed under the award include an Annual Work Plan for the period October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2019, cost estimating plans, signed agreements and or contracts between the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the subawardees, re-assignment of leases, transfer of equipment custody, detailed plans for configuration control, document management, and reporting, and Environment, Health, and Safety Plan, procedures for environmental compliance, roles and responsibilities associated with data delivery to the community, a cybersecurity plan, and a community engagement plan.  All of the deliverables will contribute towards a successful and seamless transition, benefitting the broad oceanographic community and all users of OOI data. OOI measurements improve our understanding of processes impacting climate variability, ecosystems, fisheries, geohazards, and the subseafloor environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project accomplished Transition of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) from Construction &amp; Initial Operation, termed OOI 1.0 and performed from 1 September 2009 through 30 September 2018, to Operation &amp; Management, termed OOI 2.0 with inception on 1 October 2018.  Responsibility as Prime Awardee transitioned from the Consortium for Ocean Leadership (COL) under OOI 1.0 to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) under OOI 2.0.  The Transition was led by WHOI with subawards to the partner institutions:  the University of Washington (UW), Oregon State University (OSU), and Rutgers University.  The Transition accomplished establishment of the Project Manage Office for OOI 2.0 at WHOI and transferred data quality functions performed at Rutgers under OOI 1.0 to WHOI, UW, and OSU during OOI 2.0.   The Transition produced submission to the National Science Foundation of documentation for OOI 2.0 including the Annual Work Plan for Program Year I, the Cost Estimating Plan, the signed Cooperative Agreements with the partner institutions, confirmation of Re-assignment of Leases, confirmation of Assumption of Custody; the Plan for Configuration Control and Document Management, the Environmental Health &amp; Safety Plan, and the Plan for Compliance with Environmental Statutes.  Intellectual merit lies in the transformative science that continues to be enabled by the OOI measurements.  The Irminger Sea Array provides interdisciplinary measurements of the water column, mesoscale variability, and air-sea fluxes in a region of documented deep-water formation, which impacts the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, a key component of the climate system.  Together with ongoing NOAA measurements of air-sea fluxes, the OOI Array at Station Papa quantifies water column properties and mesoscale variability in a region of longstanding interdisciplinary interest.  The Pioneer Array, a relocatable system with approximately five years planned at a series of locations selected by NSF, currently occupies the New England shelf break, where it quantifies the interdisciplinary processes near the persistent shelf-slope front that drive some of the nation?s most productive ecosystems.  The Regional Cabled Array, which brings high-power and high-bandwidth, real-time, two-way communications into the oceans with adaptive sampling capabilities, will continue to provide new insights into interlinked seismic, volcanic, and hydrothermal processes operating off the Oregon coast, the flux of methane from the seafloor, and the seafloor biosphere. The cabled moorings and associated seafloor instrumentation provide high-resolution temporal measurements of blue water and coastal ocean dynamics and ecosystems (e.g. hypoxia, thin layers, plumes), biogeochemical interactions, and turbulent mixing.  The Endurance Array provides interdisciplinary observations within the coastal upwelling region of the Oregon and Washington coasts, providing synoptic, multi-scale observations of the greater eastern boundary current regime, and new insights into shelf/slope nutrient exchange, air-sea property exchange, carbon cycling, and ocean acidification.  All OOI data are backed up by documented procedures and metadata and distributed freely to users in real- to near real-time via a common Cyberinfrastructure.    Broader impacts are enabled through access to data from over 500 OOI instruments aboard fixed and moving platforms that are captured continuously and served universally in near real time.  The interdisciplinary OOI measurements provide comprehensive insight into the Earth, oceans and atmosphere, useful for scientists, educators, students, laypersons, industry and policymakers.  OOI measurements improve understanding of processes impacting climate variability, ecosystems, fisheries, geohazards, and the subseafloor environment, which advance the capabilities of decision-makers charged with the wise stewardship of ocean resources.  The OOI enhances partnerships between international academic and non-academic organizations.  The OOI capitalizes on existing educational programs at the participating institutions.  The breadth and depth of capabilities provided by the OOI measurements and operations provide transformative experiences to the students who participate.
