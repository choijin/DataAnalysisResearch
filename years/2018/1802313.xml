<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the meeting "Workshop in Operator Theory : Recent Trends and Applications " a workshop that will take place during May 3-5, 2018, on the campus of the University of Memphis in Memphis, Tennessee. Additional information about the conference can be found on the website http://www.memphis.edu/msci/rtota2018/index.php&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the meeting "Workshop in Operator Theory : Recent Trends and Applications" is on long-standing open problems in operator theory. It will also provide an update on recent important contributions to the field. A concerted effort will be made to include underrepresented graduate students, including women, and early career mathematicians in the workshop. In addition, it planned to create a future network of support and interaction among participants to enable further research and collaboration. This will be an significant conference in operator theory and funding that will offer early career mathematicians and members of underrepresented groups the opportunity to become involved in state-of-the-art research in operator theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This period of the  project  produced  the two following outcomes:  1.     Publication of a Contemporary Mathematics volume (CONM volume 737, 2019) , and   2.     A conference entitled "One Day in Operator Theory" (February  15, 2020) .   The Contemporary Mathematics volume is comprised of  thirteen mathematics papers based on presentations given at the Recent Trends in Operator Theory conference (May 2018).  This conference was reported at the first year of the project.  The papers published in the CONM 737 were peer reviewed, following the guidelines set by the American Mathematical Society. These papers were selected with strong  emphasis on current trends of research, covering a broad collection of mathematics  research topics. It should be noted that five  papers were co-authored by graduate students and well recognized researchers.  One  additional paper was co-authored by an undergraduate student and an experienced mathematician. It is anticipated that such papers will have  great impact on a large audience of students and early career mathematicians.  The conference had nine invited  talks, three of which by graduate students.  It also  included a large percentage of female participants.  The talks were geread to graduate students and ealy career mathematicians. Breaks between talks, and group meals allowed for substantial interaction among  speakers and attendees.  Several  discussions of future mathematical  venues may lead to several  collaborations.           Last Modified: 05/02/2020       Submitted by: Fernanda Botelho]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
