<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a novel process and platform for the aerosol synthesis of metal-oxide nanoparticles. When coupled with an existing aerosol deposition technology, this aerosol synthesis source will enable the production of the next generation of functional coatings. These include antireflective and self-cleaning coatings for solar modules, novel electrical contacts that reduce silver usage in solar cells, and thermal barrier coatings for windows that increase thermal efficiency. Each of these represents a large addressable market in need of coatings innovation: For example, the coated flat glass market is expected to reach $43.2B in 2025 and the metal-oxide nanoparticle coatings from this project are anticipated to capture at least 10% of that market. Beyond the commercial and related societal impacts of the project, this project will increase the scientific understanding of the nucleation of nanomaterials in the gas phase and the subsequent manipulation of nanoparticles in low-pressure flows. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in its development of a new method to synthesize metal-oxide materials in the gas phase, resulting in an aerosol that can be manipulated and deposited on a substrate with gas flows. Prior art for the synthesis of metal-oxide nanoparticles and the subsequent formation of films suffers from three challenges: (1) synthesis methods that utilize high-pressure gas-phase processes tend to create large light-scattering agglomerates that produce hazy films, (2) "wet" synthesis coating techniques can suffer from stability challenges, optical non-uniformities, and processes that are not easily scaled and (3) all methods have limited control of the optical properties of the film, specifically the refractive index. Synthesis of metal-oxide nanoparticles using the approach in this project is a promising, but under-examined and under-utilized, technique. It will generate unagglomerated nanoparticles of controllable size, overcoming the first challenge, and, with suitable aerosol deposition techniques, enable large-area uniform films with controllable refractive index, overcoming the second and third challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this SBIR Phase I project was to develop a platform for the synthesis of metal-oxide nanoparticles and the subsequent formation of those particles into optical quality coatings with tunable density. Our approach to particle synthesis was to use a non-thermal plasma with PECVD-like precursor chemistries to generate small (&lt;20 nm diameter) un-agglomerated particles. Our approach to deposition was to extract those particles in flight from the plasma reactor and feed them into an Aerosol Impact Driven Assembly (AIDA) system where they would be sprayed at a predetermined velocity at a substrate to form a coating. In particular, the project aimed to form films composed of SiO<sub>2</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, characterize the range of achievable film properties, and optimize the particles and films for applications like anti-glare coatings, self-cleaning coatings or insulating coatings.</p> <p>&nbsp;As shown in Figure 1, AIDA begins by aerosolizing nanomaterials, either by introducing previously synthesized nanomaterials (like nano-powders) into a carrier gas or synthesizing nanomaterials in the gas phase (as performed in this project), and forcing that aerosol through a linear, slit-shaped nozzle in fluidic communication with a vacuum chamber where the substrate resides. The low pressure in the vacuum chamber allows the nanomaterials to be accelerated to high speeds, resulting in a curtain of high-velocity nanoparticles that the substrate is translated through. The particles impact and stick to the substrate forming a thin film or coating. &nbsp;By accurately controlling the impact velocity, the porosity of the coating can be adjusted.</p> <p>Figure 2 contains images of a coating formed by feeding SiO<sub>2</sub> precursors into a plasma reactor coupled to the inlet of an AIDA system. By operating in the right RF power/pressure/gas flow regime, we were able to convert the precursors to particles with nearly 75% efficiency.&nbsp; Figure 2 (a)<strong> </strong>contains an SEM image of a dense coating formed by impacting particles at a very high velocity. Figure 2 (b) contains an SEM image of a porous coating formed by impacting particles at a very low velocity. Figure 2 (c) is a magnified image of the coating in (b) where individual particles and pores can be identified. We extended this capability to include films composed of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, also synthesized in a dusty plasma.</p> <p>After exploring the range of properties that could be produced using this technique, we began to optimize the process for specific applications. Figure 3 contains a series of reflectance plots for SiO<sub>2</sub> coatings with varying porosity. The plots show that by appropriately tuning thickness and porosity (and thus the refractive index of the film) a near ideal anti-reflective coating was produced.</p> <p>We investigated the durability of these films and found it to be highly correlated to the porosity. Figure 4 plots the percentage of film remaining after Taber abrasion testing. The figure indicates a sharp decrease in durability for films with porosities greater than 50%, but promising durability for denser films.</p> <p>The final task of this project was to investigate the scalability of the process. Figure 5 (a) contains an image of a small source, capable of coating substrates with widths less than 150 mm, and a large source capable of coating substrates with widths up to 400 mm. Figure 5(b) is a photograph of a 300 mm silicon wafer coated using the large source.
