<AbstractNarration>As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.  This project is a two-day conference, along with pre- and post-conference activities, with the goal of furthering the informal science learning field's review of the research and development that has been conducted on data visualizations that have been used to help the public better understand and become more engaged in science.  The project will address an urgent need in informal science education, providing a critical first step towards a synthesis of research and technology development in visualization and, thus, to inform and accelerate work in the field in this significant and rapidly changing domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will start with a Delphi study by the project evaluator prior to the conference to provide an Emerging Field Assessment on data visualization work to date. Then, a two-day conference at the Exploratorium in San Francisco and related activities will bring together AISL-funded PIs, computer scientists, cognitive scientists, designers, and technology developers to (a) synthesize work to date, (b) bring in relevant research from fields outside of informal learning, and (c) identify remaining knowledge gaps for further research and development. The project team will also develop a website with videos of all presentations, conference documentation, resources, and links to social media communities; and a post-conference publication mapping the state of the field, key findings, and promising technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initiative also has a goal to broaden participation, as the attendees will include a diverse cadre of professionals in the field who contribute to data visualization work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The public encounters data visualizations on a daily basis, from exploring the paths of hurricanes in the New York Times, to checking heart rate data on a Fitbit, to following epidemiologic data during the COVID-19 pandemic. The increasing number of visualizations the public encounters reflects the rapid rise in the amount of data collected. Visualizations are one of the most critical tools for analyzing and interpreting data, transforming huge sets of numbers into visual forms humans can interpret. In this era of large datasets, the public is increasingly dependent on visualizations to understand themselves and the world around them.  Recognizing the critical role of visualizations in both doing and learning science, museums and other public education venues have increasingly used visualizations in their exhibits, websites and other offerings. However, despite significant work and investment, there has still been little knowledge sharing across organizations or disciplines. The conference project, ADVISE: Advancing the Design of Visualizations in Informal Science Education, sought to address this need. Outcomes  The primary focus of ADVISE was the two-day VISUALISE conference, which convened 60 attendees, including museum educators, computer scientists, artists, journalists, psychologist, learning scientists, and technology developers, to:  Share lessons learned in the research and development of visualizations for informal science settings. Promote dialogue across disciplines working in data visualization. Identify common areas of success or failure to inform future visualization development. Converge on critical areas of research and development to guide future work for informal learning settings.   In addition to the conference, the project produced (1) a VISUALISE website with videos of seventeen talks; (2) the conference proceedings (available on the website and other venues); (3) a public evening program featuring VISUALISE professionals' work (with 2500 public attendees). Intellectual Merit  A critical goal of this project was to identify next steps for research and development in visualization. Through conference discussions and a follow-up survey, the conference participants determined the following needs:  Establishing and Growing a Cross-Disciplinary Field. Conference attendees across disciplines valued coming together to share their expertise, make new connections, and learn new approaches they could apply to their work. To create future networking opportunities to advance this burgeoning field, participants suggested:  more opportunities for cross-disciplinary, face-to-face meetings sharing best practices and lessons learned across disciplines and projects repositories of data visualization examples syntheses of what is known to date a common vocabulary and understanding (e.g. for "data literacy") to facilitate collaboration   Developing Tools and Guidance for Visualization Design. VISUALISE participants were eager for evidence-based guidance and tested tools to support visualization development and curation. In particular, they asked for:  guidance on effective composition and design principles, approaches for making complex data, interactive,  accessible and relatable, strategies to promote engagement with visualizations, and ways to include a wider diversity of voices in data visualizations   Promoting Data Visualization Literacy. To help public data visualization literacy, participants suggested:  identifying a developmental or a novice-to-expert trajectory for data literacy, training K-12 teachers to teach data literacy, and formulating effective strategies to help museum audiences make sense of data visualizations   Conducting Research in Informal Learning Settings. Relatively few visualization studies have been conducted in informal learning environments, with most research being conducted in controlled laboratories. VISUALISE participants proposed several lines of investigation for the museum setting:  assessing and supporting visitors' data visualization literacy, identifying the relationship between context and visualization interpretation, defining effective means of conveying uncertainty, complexity, and the nature of the underlying data, and determining the interplay between culture and visualization interpretation.  Broader Impact  The ADVISE project offered a cross-disciplinary group of visualization experts to convene and begin to share their expertise and identify and discuss themes and challenges encountered in their work, and then documented the work and recommendations. It set the stage to broaden and deepen the conversations that began at the conference with a larger group of researchers and practitioners eager to understand how to create, adapt and use visualizations for informal science learning.
