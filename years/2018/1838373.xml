<AbstractNarration>Seismic and geodetic observations of volcanic unrest and of erupting volcanoes not only lead to a better understanding of the fundamental processes of magma storage, magma reservoir failure, magma transport towards the Earth's surface, but also provide opportunities to identify precursory signals that could serve to better forecast eruptions. Sierra Negra volcano in the Galapagos islands, one of the world's largest and most active basaltic shield volcanoes is in a new episode of unrest. This project responds to this unrest by collecting critical observations to understand this and other systems better. The Broader Impacts of this work include better understanding of hazards associated with volcanoes and the earthquakes that happen near them. The project is a collaborative effort between a large geodetic facility, and researchers at the University of Miami and Pennsylvania State University. In addition, the work will be done in collaboration with Instituto Geofisico (IG), Quito, Ecuador.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID responds to the inflation activity at Sierra Negra. The project will work (1) to upgrade the existing geodetic network, (2) to conduct a photogrammetric survey of the trapdoor fault system using a drone, (3) to conduct time-lapse gravimetric observations inside the caldera (an initial survey was done in February 2018), and (4) to expand the network to better capture inflation activities. Questions that will be addressed include how intrusions initiate, how does the trapdoor faulting work and relate to the magma inflation, and what  is the volatile content of the magma. This project provides the geodetic observations complementing the temporary seismic network of collaborators at Edinburgh, IG and Tulane. The combination of multiple geophysical data sets will allow modeling the build-up to and the processes during an eruption in unprecedented detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This was a RAPID award project to investigate the accelerated rates of deformation and seismicity at Sierra Negra volcano, Galapagos Islands, Ecuador in 2018. Sierra Negra volcano is one of the largest basaltic calderas on earth and last erupted in 2005. A continuous Global Positioning System (cGPS) network has been measuring deformation (uplift) within the caldera since the end of the 2005 eruption. The uplift rate began to increase in 2014 and accelerated in 2017, suggesting a potential eruption was imminent. The initial goals of this award were to: 1) Repair the existing NSF funded cGPS network, including the data telemetry system, and add an additional station lower on the flanks of the volcano; 2) Collect pre-event, high-resolution topography of the volcano using drones and photogrammetric techniques; and 3) Conduct repeat micro-gravity observations. The volcano erupted on June 26, 2018, prior to our ability to do field work. Although we were not able to make the proposed pre-eruptive observations, we were able to conduct fieldwork following the eruption, including: 1) Collection of the cGPS data; 2) Addition of a new station in Puerto Villamil, Isabela Island; 3) Observations of the topography of the volcano and &nbsp;specifically the caldera, using photogrammetry from drones; and 4) Micro-gravity observations. The cGPS network has allowed us to: 1) Investigate pre-, co-, and post-eruptive deformation, including greater than 6 m of pre-eruptive uplift, 8.5 m of co-eruptive deflation and 1.5 m of post-eruptive re-inflation; 2) Investigate co-seismic displacements associated with earthquakes greater than M4.5, including the June 26 2018 M5.5 earthquake that preceded the eruption by 8 hrs and uplifted the intra-caldera fault system up to 1.8 m; 3) Correlate geodetic deformation with the rates of seismicity as observed by our collaborators IGUANA seismic network; and 4) Quantify volumes of pre-eruptive magma accumulation and co-eruptive magma withdrawal. The photogrammetry studies of the caldera are allowing us to investigate the uplifted intra-caldera fault system and the morphology of the caldera, including eruptive centers, lava flows and intra-caldera faults. The gravity observations are being used to estimate changes in mass related to the eruption, and re-inflation of the magmatic system.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/06/2020<br>      Modified by: Peter&nbsp;Lafemina</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
