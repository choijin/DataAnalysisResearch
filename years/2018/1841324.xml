<AbstractNarration>The conference 'Topological and Rigorous Computational Methods for High Dimensional Dynamics' is to be held on April 1 - April 30, 2019&lt;br/&gt;in Centre des Recherches Mathematiques (CRM), Canada. The revolution of computational and data driven science is well underway. However, mathematically rigorous frameworks for processing the output of this science is lagging.  This is of serious concern since these same computational and data driven techniques are having immediate impacts on the private and social sectors of society. It is essential that within the new generation of mathematicians there are researchers capable of addressing these issues.  Through the tutorials, junior researchers will be introduced to rapidly developing concepts, techniques, and computational tools designed to address these challenges. Through the workshop lectures they will be made aware of the latest developments in the field.&lt;br/&gt;Of equal importance is that their presence will allow them to interact with leaders in the field, to begin to develop connections with researchers from across the world, and ideally to begin research projects that lay the foundations of new techniques for rigorous understanding of the complex nonlinear systems of interest today and in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide support for junior researchers from the USA to participate in a month long special program at the Centre des Recherches Mathematiques (CRM) entitled Topological and Rigorous Computational Methods for High Dimensional Dynamics.  The activities will take place from  April 1 - April 30, 2019 and consist of tutorials, workshops, and time for collaboration.  The research activities of the CRM program focus on two topics.  The first theme is how to effectively and rigorously identify invariant structures in infinite dimensional dynamical systems, for example those generated by partial differential equations. The second theme is how to extract robust information from poorly resolved dynamical systems, for example when only partial or coarse data is available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference website: &lt;br/&gt;http://www.crm.math.ca/crm50/en/activities/2019-activities/topological-and-rigorous-computational-methods-for-high-dimensional-dynamics/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The two-day tutorial on Computer-Assisted Constructive Approaches to Nonlinear Dynamical Systems kicked off the monthly program. This activity was aimed at junior researchers starting in the field. It offered a rapid course on computer-assisted proofs in dynamics, starting from the foundations and reaching some of the current research developments. The final hours of each afternoon were used to introduce and work on open problems. Several groups were formed that started working on these problems. This not just prepared the participants for the research talks to come, but also got them actively involved in discussions, so that they started talking more freely to each other and made it easier to interact with senior participants.             The tutorial was followed by a workshop on Rigorous Computational Dynamics in Infinite Dimensions, which included both talks on recent advances and plenty of time for discussion.  Between talks the break-out rooms were used for ad-hoc meetings on research projects. About ten participants stayed for another week.      The third week started with a second tutorial A Topological-Combinatorial Framework for Dynamics, which followed a largely similar format to the first one. The content was more data-oriented, ranging from abstract lattice theory for dynamics to hands on use of the DSGRN database software. This was followed by the second workshop on Data Driven Dynamics: Algebraic Topology, Combinatorics and Analysis. There, all the ideas related to data, computation, topology and analysis in high and infinite dimensional dynamical systems came together. The program included talks on application areas such as neurons, biological clocks, gene regulatory networks, material science, fluid dynamics and granular media. There was again plenty of time for discussion.      The final week was characterized by more collaborative work between the month long visitors, which led to progress on a variety of projects.
