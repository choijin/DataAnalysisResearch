<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the 2018 Conference on Highly Frustrated Magnetism to be held at the University of California at Davis. The award is jointly funded by the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory and the Condensed Matter Physics programs of the Division of Materials Research. The conference will bring together around 250 leading scientists and students in the field of quantum magnetism from around the world, to assess the field and new directions. The new materials and experimental techniques developed in this field are relevant for future quantum technologies, including quantum computers. The conference will contribute to the training of a new generation of scientists in advanced instrumentation and computational methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit of the proposal  In July of 2018 (July 9 - July 14), we had a very successful conference on Highly FrustratedMagnetism at the University of California, Davis campus in Davis, CA.It was a week long meeting, covering experimental and theoretical aspects of frustrated magnetism, and uniquely united a world-wide community of about 230 scientists for close exchange of ideas and training of junior scientists.  The field of highly frustrated magnetism is remarkable for bringing cutting-edge theoretical ideas like quantum spin liquids, emergent fractional quasiparticles and gauge fields into close confrontation with a robust and rich set of experimental systems and measurements.    Broader impacts of the proposal        This conference dealt with two key subjects that may help define tomorrow's technologies. The first is magnetism and the second is emergent quantum phases of matter. The search for exotic phases drives research into new quantum materials needed to provide direction for high technology in the post Moore's-law world. Unusual forms of magnetism, not just ferromagnetism, may be important in applications of spintronics.   Finally, and very importantly, this conference helped in the training of students and postdocs in experimental techniques and theoretical and computational methods. The training is sufficiently broad that it can be useful in fields as far apart as business, industry, software and government. These well trained students will form the scientific and technological leaders of tomorrow.       Last Modified: 01/02/2019       Submitted by: Rajiv R Singh]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
