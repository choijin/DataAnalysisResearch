<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to transform the culture of photosynthetic aquatic microorganisms. Although microalgae and cyanobacteria have high volumetric productivities, the cultures cannot be too deep, due to restrictions of light penetration.  This proposed technology removes the light penetration limit inherent in current technologies. The results of this project will allow the production of medical and food grade biomass in controlled conditions, as the light source will not be connected to the exterior of the culture reactors. This approach will provide the advantages of a fermentation production using phototrophic species, without the need to supply organic carbon. The photosynthetic biomass production makes use of carbon dioxide and light for growth. This project will result in a microalgal/cyanobacterial biomass production in areas where it is not currently feasible and with higher productivity. The increase of the depth of the cultures two, five or more times of what is currently possible, practically reduces the area required for biomass production. A reduction of cost will improve the economic outlook for microalgal-based commodity products, including feed, food, fuels, nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals and lower the environmental impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses one of the most significant problems found in achieving the promise of microalgae and cyanobacteria as source of food, fuels and other products is the limitation of light penetration. Most outdoor cultures are limited to less than 60 cm depth. In reactors with artificial light, besides the light penetration high electrical costs limit their use to high value products.  This project will result in a light system that takes advantage of the water movement in cultures to generate electricity for LED lights in untethered units that move with the culture. The proposed generator uses methods more efficient and lighter that traditional electromagnetic and piezoelectric generators. The developed energy harvester can be used in other applications such as power for water quality monitoring and other sensing equipment. In this phase, a unit with a miniaturized energy harvester coupled with passive switching, charging, discharging and rectifying modules in the same substrate, in a waterproof casing will be developed. Data proof of the suitability of these units to support photosynthetic microorganisms? biomass production will be obtained. The results will inform further development of the units in a future phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The system reduces the energy requirements without the need of special electrical installations into the culture units.  We demonstrated two types of light balls: one with a power harvester that transforms mechanical energy on electrical power and the other with a rechargeable battery that is charged inductively.

We have obtained information about the feasibility of using LED unattached light balls for microalgal culture, as a stand-alone light system and as a complement to natural light, to increase algae productivity and reduce reactor footprint needs.  The main conclusions of the work done under this project are:  A small energy harvester can be used in a spherical package to harvest energy and power LED lights in a microalgal culture. The harvester developed can power several LEDs at the same time, but higher power will be needed.  A passive switching developed, allows the lights to operate without external input, discharging when the charge generated is enough to power the LEDs.

One graduate student and several undergraduate students participated in the development of this project from the electronics, to the case 3D printing and other fabrication and testing methods.  In addition to the students working locally, the company provided support and advising to two senior design teams during the 2019-2020 academic year and four more in the current year.  The students are part of the Mechanical Engineering Department at Boston University. This project was presented in a workshop in August of 2020, to high school students interested in STEM areas and particularly environmental engineering.  The project participants have done four presentations in technical conferences and one publication is in preparation.    Further development is needed in the following areas, to take to industrial application this work:   The energy harvester must be refined, and its capability increased either using micropatterning to increase the specific area per square centimeter of the sensors or by use of other materials. A cost-effective way to tune the buoyancy of the balls, that allows the adjustment in the field, depending on the culture conditions would make more user friendly the light balls.  The LEDs distribution in the light balls should be studied, to determine the maximum light output with the minimum LED units.  Numerical models will allow us to predict more accurately how many light balls should be used for a given reactor configuration and operation. Testing is real life conditions should be done, to ensure that the end users’ results will match those obtained by the company.  Although no problems with biofouling were observed with the materials we used in this project, testing the light balls in longer duration cultures, possible continuous cultures, using different species, will allow us to determine the best strategy to prevent biofouling, if this is observed.  Successful commercialization of the light system in development, will reduce the area needed to grow microalgal biomass for bioproducts, feed, food, and biofuels. The possibility of using deeper cultures and closed reactors, will decrease cost and increase profitability of the microalgal industry.  The power harvester and switching system can be adapted for other applications.         Last Modified: 12/02/2020       Submitted by: Maria T Gutierrez-Wing]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
