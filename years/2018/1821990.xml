<AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support for students to attend and present their work at the IEEE International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics, 2018 (BHI18). BHI18 is the premier flagship conference sponsored by IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) in the area of mHealth and health analytics. BHI18 will be held from March. 4-8, 2018 in Las Vegas and jointly organized with IEEE conference on Body Sensor Networks. The goal of the conference is to provide a unique platform to showcase novel sensors, systems, signal processing, analytics and data management services. BHI18 will offer the latest findings of researchers on efficient and innovative signal acquisition, transmission, processing, monitoring, storage, retrieval, analysis, visualization and interpretation of multi-modal signals including physiological, biomedical, biological, social, behavioral, environmental, and geographical data. It will also provide a forum for bioinformatics and computational biology researchers in especially EMBS and IEEE Signal Processing Society to interact and exchange research ideas among them and others in Biomedical and Health Informatics community and discuss future challenges in cutting edge areas including Precision Medicine. As integrated bioinformatics and medical informatics approaches become one of the focus areas in Precision Medicine, BHI18 is uniquely positioned to spark novel ideas and promote new collaborations between researchers in these communities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important mission of the Workshop is to promote participation of graduate students, especial woman and minority students, and foster student education on computational biology for precision medicine. This award will be used to provide travel grants to qualified graduate students, whose papers are deemed of high quality, to support their participation in the conference. The Workshop organization includes the student award committee, which will be responsible for evaluation and selection of student awardees. Particularly, 20-30% of the awards are allocated to women and minority students to participate and submit papers to the Workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

This grant from the National Science Foundation was used to support student participation at BHI 2018 and 2019. The award was advertised before the conference and an award committee was created, which carefully reviewed the applications and selected final awardees. A total of 20 students including 4 female students, were award travel awards to support their travel expenses to the conference. The awards were announced at the conferences and certificates were provided to the students. As a result, over 30% of the attendees in 2018 were students, which represented a significant increase over the past years. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Yufei&nbsp;Huang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
