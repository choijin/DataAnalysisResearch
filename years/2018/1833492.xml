<AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposal is to assist students, early-career researchers and instructors with travel fellowships to attend the FORCE11's Scholarly Communications Institute (FSCI) 2018 meeting being  held July 30 - August 3, 2018 at the University of California, San Diego. The intent of FSCI 2018 is to expose all participants to exceptional training opportunities and the latest research and trends in the ongoing transformation of scholarly communications and research practice and dissemination. In addition to special training sessions, participants will particularly benefit from increased access to principal role models within the field from prominent national and international research laboratories and centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The host organization, FORCE11, the Future of Research Communication and eScholarship, is a community of 2500+ scholars, librarians, archivists, publishers and research funders that help facilitate the change toward improved knowledge creation and sharing. Individually and collectively, the members bring about a change in modern scholarly communications through the effective use of information technology.  The FSCI 2018 meeting is designed as a week-long summer training meeting, incorporating intensive courses, seminars, workshops, group activities, lectures and hands-on training. Participants will attend courses taught by world-wide leading experts in scholarly communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The NSF funding provided travel support for 24 speakers, researchers and students from the US to attend a week-long training dedicated to new and emerging topics in research communication and data management.  Topics included research ethics, FAIR Data management, rigor and responsibility, and measuring impact on new publishing technologies and forms of participating in Open Research. The FSCI is an annual event launched by the FORCE11 community to present courses and workshops focussed on the latest trends, tools, and requirements for participating in Open Research.   The Future of Research and E-scholarship (FORCE11) community was formed in 2011 to address rapidly changing advancements in scientific practices. This cross-domain, cross-discipline community of global researchers, librarians, publishers, technologists, funders, and administrators has made significant strides in this area having produced some of the following leading-edge initiatives.

The following are a sampling of comments from scholarship recipients.   This was an intense but very worthwhile week. I learned a lot and felt privileged to be among so many people who are change-makers at their institutions. It was inspiring. I will return to take advantage of classes that I didn't have time for this first time around.   I am now able to share with authors how to link to their own DOI?s and the range of file formats and to explain the multiple uses of a pre-print server (including using this to secure public input).   After informal exchanges at FSCI, I'm organizing a workshop for our graduate students on the subject of academic online presence.   My technical and programming skills have increased. I could install packages in R, crawl ORCID ID, Clean data, etc. I can upload a dataset, assign access permission among others in Dataverse.    FSCI  was a wonderful learning-intensive experience.

Overall, my takeaway from FSCI18 was extremely valuable.   FSCI gave me an opportunity to network, develop practical skills, and perhaps, most importantly,  it shifted the way that I view library-faculty-student-researcher relationships because of FSCI's global and interdisciplinary nature.
