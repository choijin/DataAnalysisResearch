<AbstractNarration>This is a workshop to re-examine the Grand Challenges in the field of geodesy. The workshop will convene at least40 experts in the field to revisit the state of the field and its future directions. The previous Grand Challenges document included sections on public benefit and workforce development that will be revised and expanded in this workshop and new document. The public benefits from research in geodesy are continuing to grow, and now include many applications of real-time geodetic data that were nascent a decade ago. At the same time, awareness of the scientific and broader contributions of geodetic research is relatively low, both in the scientific community and beyond. With the open availability of newer and upcoming SAR satellites global terrestrial high-resolution geodesy is becoming a reality, allowing for yet unfathomed outreach opportunities and tools for hazard mitigation.The broader impacts of this workshop include support for early-career researchers to have input into the strategic direction of their field and impacts to resources monitoring and hazards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will highlight the state of the art and new opportunities in geodesy. The project will result in a revised grand challenges document for consideration by the upcoming National Academies study, Catalyzing Opportunities for Research in the Earth Sciences (CORES): A Decadal Survey for NSF's Division of Earth Sciences. White papers from the broader community will be solicited for consideration, further broadening the range of researchers who will impact the report.The goal of the workshop is to assess progress in geodesy over the last several years, considering both areas of significant recent progress and areas of substantial new opportunity. For example, the use of campaign and continuous GPS instruments for tectonic kinematics relies on well-established methods and has produced critical scientific contributions over the past three decades, such that these data are essentially fully incorporated into models of tectonic motions. In contrast, the use of repeat LiDAR and RADAR images for capturing mm-scale surface processes is only just emerging as a useful scientific technology. Many different geodetic approaches and methods fall between these examples, and a comprehensive assessment of gains made and opportunities arising will help to guide scientific investments in the coming decade. The resulting document will also serve as a general useful reference for the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The 8 thematic Grand Challenges addressed in the report are:  How are Ice, Oceans, and the Solid Earth Coupled in Space and Time?  What Does Geodesy Reveal About the Terrestrial Water Cycle?  How Do Fault Mechanics Influence Earthquakes and the Earthquake Cycle?  How Do Solid Earth’s Material Properties Vary with Location and Over Time?  What Can Observations of Surface Deformation Reveal About Magmatic Processes and Volcanic Hazard?  What is the Connection Between Solid Earth Processes and Surface and Landscape Evolution?  What Do New Approaches Promise for Hazard Forecasting, Warning, and Rapid Response?  How Can Geodesy Meet the Challenge of Big Data?    The opportunities for scientific study described in the report are based primarily on the present measurement capabilities and the advances that we can foresee for the next few years. Geodesy has been evolving and advancing over the last several decades, as dramatic improvements in the precision and accuracy of measurements has enabled new areas of science. New technologies and the clever new use of features of existing data have opened up completely new areas of research. The next fundamental new development or breakthrough is not so easy to predict, but the history of geodesy tells us that it will come. In this context, as representatives of a diverse and growing scientific community, the Grand Challenges writing team identified several overarching recommendations for future investment:   Maintain and enhance continuous observations of the dynamic Earth and its environment.  Undertake geodetic missions recommended by the Decadal Survey, and develop future missions that will further enhance the time resolution and spatial coverage of critical geodetic observations.  Improve the accuracy and robustness of the global geodetic reference frame (International Terrestrial Reference Frame, or ITRF), continuing its evolution away from a description of a presumed linearly changing Earth, to fully and self-consistently incorporate the time variations associated with earthquakes, postseismic deformation, sea level monitoring, and mass transport.  Implement seafloor geodesy measurement systems and programs to enable study of the kinematics and dynamics of Earth in areas covered by water.  Implement real-time analysis systems to produce geodetic products for hazard early warning, situational awareness, and risk mitigation and rapid response.  Invest in our community’s capacity to handle big data, and integrate data across disciplinary fields.  Invest in workforce recruitment and training, education at all levels, and communication of advances in geodesy and their application.
