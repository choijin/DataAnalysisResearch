<AbstractNarration>This grant supports student travel for select students participating in the Doctoral Mentoring Consortium (DMC) at the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS 2018), to be held in Delft, The Netherlands, June 2018. This is the premier international conference for researchers in automated planning and scheduling research and applications across a fully international research community. This activity will bring together a broad community of researchers in the field of AI, and support junior researchers at this critical early-career stage. These events combine to provide educational opportunities for students and experienced researchers alike, and are extremely popular among conference participants. ICAPS is the major international conference that will figure prominently in the research careers of students who remain involved in planning and scheduling. Students will gain valuable research insights from the exchange of technical ideas in this broader venue. In the process, they are likely to make valuable connections with potential collaborators from around the world. As intelligent software and embodies systems become more prevalent, it is clear that advances in planning and scheduling will have significant impact in virtually any domain imaginable, including transportation, logistics, robotics, and remote sensing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant partially support the travel of 14 US doctoral students to the premier International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) and their participation in the Doctoral Consortium (DC) and/or summer school held in conjunction with it. 10 students were supported in 2018 and 4 students were supported in 2019. ICAPS 2018 was held in Delft, Netherlands on June 24-29, 2019, and ICAPS 2019 was held in Berkeley, CA, USA on July 11-15, 2019.  All students awarded travel funding participated either in the 2018 summer school, in which they attended lectures and participated in hands-on labs conducted by top planning researchers; or the 2018/2019 DC, in which they discussed their research with other student researchers and received feedback from a group of senior researchers. In both cases, students also attended the associated ICAPS conference, which had a rich technical program complemented with an array of workshops, tutorials, and other events.  The 2018 summer school included: 1) Lectures by top planning researchers -- Iadine Chades, Zico Kolter, Malte Helmert, Thomas Keller, Mausam, Gabriel Roger, Brian Williams, and Scott Sanner. 2) Hands-on labs that allow students to familiarize themselves with off-the-shelf planners and common planning benchmarks.  The 2018 DC included: 1) Technical sessions in which students presented their work. 2) Two invited talks by Neil Yorke-Smith (TU Delft) and Scott Sanner (University of Toronto). 3) A panel on careers in planning and scheduling. 4) Group lunch. 5) Discussions with mentors.  The 2019 DC included: 1) Technical sessions in which students presented their work. 2) Two invited talks by Anca Dragan (UC Berkeley) and Mykel Kochenderfer (Stanford) 3) A panel on careers in planning and scheduling. 4) Group lunch. 5) Discussions with mentors.    Out of the 14 students who received travel support, 7 of them are women.  Participation in the summer school and/or DC and the conference provided motivation for the students to continue in their research journey. It also helped them become members of the international community of scholars, by making personal connections with other researchers from around the world. Student scholarship funds also make it possible for groups to send multiple students to attend the same conference, rather than simply having all conference papers presented by senior researchers.  Scholarships were chosen on the basis of:  1) Match between their research topic and the topics covered in the DC; 2) Level of participation in the ICAPS conference; 3) Diversity of the participants; 4) Limited means to attend the summer school and/or DC and the ICAPS conference; and 5) Time to anticipated graduation          Last Modified: 04/05/2020       Submitted by: William Yeoh]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
