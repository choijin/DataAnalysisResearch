<AbstractNarration>The Afranaph Project aims to build an active research community around electronic resources for the study of African languages. For the past 15 years, native speaker consultants have been contributing data about particular areas of grammatical interest, with a view toward discovering grammatical structures in under-reported languages (some of them endangered) and uncovering patterns new to linguistic science. With data from almost 50 consultants and almost as many languages freely available online and in the Afranaph Database, Afranaph has become a valuable resource for a wide range of linguistic researchers, in addition to serving as a tool for linguistic pedagogy, a model for similar projects on other language areas, and a partner in language projects for non-scholarly communities (e.g., dictionaries for NGOs).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In the Fall of 2019, the Afranaph Project Development Workshop will bring linguists from Africa, Europe and North America to Georgetown University in order to present their research. This capstone event will include reports from the leaders of the Afranaph research projects, new work from linguists investigating the languages of Afranaph, and proposals for new research directions employing Afranaph resources. Work by the native speaker consultants will be highlighted, since many of them are early career researchers who have less access to resources in their local communities, and can benefit from collaboration and engagement with each other and the western academic community. Overall, this workshop will allow researchers to explore the discoveries and strengthen the research community and infrastructure that Afranaph has developed. Moreover, it is a rare opportunity for new theoretical research on understudied African languages to be presented to an expert audience, where new empirical patterns can be identified and their impact on the field can be recognized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant was intended to support the Afranaph Project Development Workshop,  and we are pleased to report that the workshop was successfully  convened in December 2019 at Georgetown University.  The Afranaph  Project recruits African native speaker linguist consultants to answer  questionnaires targeting particular areas of linguistic research, and it  has developed a successful research model that includes almost 50  languages over the last 15 years; however, its results deserve to be  more well-known and its valuable infrastructure more utilized.  We  addressed this by developing and hosting this workshop, bringing  together linguistic researchers on African languages and reporting on  the empirical and theoretical advances achieved by Afranaph.   The workshop was a rare opportunity for new research on understudied  African languages to be presented and discussed in front of a highly  knowledgeable audience, and for empirical patterns that have not been  open to consideration in the past to be explored by that same audience.  Twenty-four original research presentations were given, about half of  them involving Afranaph consultants reporting on their native  languages.  All the major language families in Africa were represented,  and most of the presentations were on understudied or undocumented  languages, thus directly enriching our knowledge of human language.  The  workshop was attended by a range of linguists from around the world, and the novel data, fresh analyses and lively discussion periods  highlighted the intellectual value of bringing together the African  linguistics community.  The workshop also encouraged research using the Afranaph Project, and  thus impacted in a positive way the vital infrastructure that Afranaph  creates. To provide further background, the Afranaph Project builds on  the expertise of native speaker African linguists in order to elicit  complex and specialized data aimed at discovering new answers to current  research questions in linguistics (all of the collected and vetted data  is freely available on the Afranaph website).  The resulting database provides a uniquely rich empirical foundation  for research that documents and analyzes African languages.  The  workshop supported Afranaph by featuring multiple talks on New Research  Topics using the Afranaph database as well as presentations on current  major Afranaph projects.  The workshop also encouraged current Afranaph  consultants to add more data and to suggest additional consultants, and  it raised the profile of Afranaph in the wider linguistics community  (e.g., through advertising on mailing lists). Overall, the intellectual  merit of the workshop was achieved through sharing and discussion of  novel data and ideas and by bolstering the infrastructure of Afranaph.  In terms of broader impacts, the workshop was a multi-day  professional development event for several different populations. First,  it provided an opportunity for young African scholars unfamiliar with  western academic communities to expand their experience, to expose  western audiences to their work, and to form or deepen collaborative  relationships. The workshop included thirteen such participants  originally from Africa, many of whom were at the beginning of their  careers or in graduate school.  Moreover, it was also intended as an  opportunity for career development for North American graduate and  undergraduate students.  It is important for North American students to  develop interests and relationships that seed the next generation of  Africa-oriented linguistic researchers.  Thus, almost all of the poster  presentations as well as about a third of the paper presentations were  (co-)authored by students from various North American institutions.  We  hope that this encouragement of student research, and the connections  and conversations the students had during the workshop, ensures that  African linguistics will continue to flourish in the decades to come.  In general, many Afranaph native speaker linguist consultants in  Africa use the Afranaph network to develop projects that go beyond  linguistics, such as the publication of public health pamphlets in  indigenous languages (in the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and  immersion schools for endangered languages (e.g., the Babanki school in  Cameroon). Also, we believe that the Afranaph model of research would  work well in other areas of the world, and so we hope that the more  people understand Afranaph, the more likely it will be that Afranaph  will find regional siblings (such an initiative is currently in the  planning stage for the Ryukyuan languages of Japan by Kunio Kinjo of  Rutgers). This would constitute another broader impact of the Afranaph  Project, and this workshop was intended as an event that contributes  meaningfully to that purpose.  Finally, in Western society, the words "scholarship," "expertise,"  and "advanced knowledge" are not the first words that come to mind when  most people think of the African continent.  Moreover, there are many  harmful and inaccurate stereotypes about African languages (e.g., that  they are all "tribal dialects").  We hope that the workshop helped to  change these attitudes, at least in a small way, by publicly celebrating  and amplifying the fine work and advanced expertise of African  linguists and raising the profile of African languages as complex  systems worthy of advanced study.
