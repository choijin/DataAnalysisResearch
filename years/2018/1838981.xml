<AbstractNarration>An approach to scientific data interoperability and reuse is through global, persistent, and uniquely identified data types that can be assembled to characterize research data sets.  This project proposes to identify data types using persistent identifiers (PIDs). The PIDs resolve to records that specify the way in which metadata, such as the provenance of the data, is structured and recorded.  The basic premise is that machine interpretable data is a critical goal to achieving FAIRness (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reuse) of data as data discovery at a global scale depends on automated processing of the information in digital form.  A type based approach to data interpretability that utilizes persistent IDs at the granularity of data types can overturn the Internet and stimulate an ecosystem of new tools for FAIR data. This pilot effort involves evaluating the approach through, in part, by constructing a critical mass of use cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the National Science Foundation Public Access Initiative which is managed by the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure on behalf of the Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this EAGER project, we were able to mitigate the risks and produce intellectual impact with broad applicability in the scientific data management field, as demonstrated through 1) the implementation of the "scientific workflows" as a sequence of operations on typed digital objects, 2) design of the novel pre-verified claims data model that enables users with limited resources to evaluate data quality attributes, and 3) the introduction of the concept of "data readiness" to enable discourse amongst researchers and policy makers as to when is data fit for use in data-driven science.  The basic project theme was to reimagine the concept of "data types" for scientific data in one specific way: inform consumers what operations can be performed on data via use of types.

CNRI has been developing software that implements the architecture called "Cordra", which we made available to the public. The project-specific work was designed as an extension to Cordra.
