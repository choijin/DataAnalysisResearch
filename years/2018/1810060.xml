<AbstractNarration>This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Alyssa Crittenden at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the impact of positive selection for increased copy number of the salivary amylase gene (AMY1) on the ability for humans to digest starch during the oral phase of food consumption. This project tackles unanswered questions regarding the significance of salivary alpha amylase (sAA) for starch consumption. Oral activity of sAA is the first step towards digestion of starchy foods. Yet humans have removed the need for oral digestion by externalizing food degradation through cooking, which breaks down large molecules such as starch. However it is unknown whether sAA activity during chewing is relevant for humans to digest starch. Importantly, no research exists that explores rate variation of sAA activity on raw versus cooked starch. Humans uniquely possess multiple copy numbers of AMY1, signaling a shift in dietary intake of starch. Such dietary shifts impact human health as it relates to tolerance of starch-rich diets. This project will contribute towards an understanding of human sAA genetic adaptations. Furthermore, understanding the impact of AMY1 variation on nutritional acquisition among ethnically and geographically diverse human populations helps inform dietary therapeutic strategies for metabolic disease prevention. This project uses a multidisciplinary approach to answer open questions about how dietary adaptation impacts health.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research has three phases - an in-vitro modeling phase, a human participant trial phase, and a field work phase. Phase I will investigate starch digestion from exposure to sAA as a function of AMY1 copy number by measuring the reducing sugar byproducts across varying short time intervals. Histological assays will show sAA activity via the morphological changes to starch. Phase II will investigate oral starch digestion in human participants over short time intervals via oral manipulation of a starch solution. The expelled solution will similarly be measured for reducing sugars. Enzyme quantity will be measured on stimulated saliva using an ELISA kit for Amylase Alpha 1, and gene copy number will be measured using digital PCR against a reference single copy gene using DNA extracted from buccal swabs. These data will be combined with medical and dietary history data to help discover factors that influence the production and activity of sAA. Phase III entails field work to quantify chewing time allocated for orally processing starchy foods. These are valuable data to contextualize chewing for humans that subsist from foods that have not undergone extensive mechanical or thermal processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>My project entitled ?Relevance of positive selection on  human salivary amylase gene? was conceived and designed in order to gain  insight about why the human lineage has uniquely, relative to archaic humans  including Neanderthals, Denisovans, and their ancestors and diaspora,  experienced positive selection for extra copy numbers of the gene for salivary  amylase enzymes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Salivary amylase is an enzyme produced most notably in the  glands in the mouth that make saliva, and it helps to break down dietary  starch, such as from root vegetables, legumes, nuts, and some fruits. Therefore,  an increase in the number of gene copies that code for this enzyme appears  unambiguously to be linked to diet.&nbsp;</p> <p>While these observations appear to be a smoking gun for the  dietary hypothesis, other observations contradict such a simplistic picture of  the behavioral impetus and selective pressures that encouraged gene copy  number proliferation. Specifically, the human AMY1 copy number increase arose  sometime <em>after</em> the control of fire,  which helps to break down starch before it is consumed, and yet came <em>before</em> the advent of agriculture, which  is when the human diet became more reliant on starchy staple food crops.  Therefore, my project sought to understand more nuanced biological or behavioral  reasons for what drove the increase in copy number among humans, and what  factors may be relevant in the conditions that stimulated adaptive changes. In  addition to asking specifically whether more amylase production on account of  high copy number is linked with improved starch digestion (the question of  genotype-phenotype correspondence), other factors were considered such as: 1) the  type of plant that the starch comes from; 2) the type of edible plant part; 3)  whether the species was wild or domesticated variety; 4) how long the starch  was exposed to amylase, or the kinetics of amylase activity in the mouth; 5) and  whether the starch was raw or cooked.</p> <p>&nbsp;My results thus far demonstrate some unanticipated and  curious features about the kinetics of salivary amylase, and also some  exciting preliminary data in support of nuanced ecological and behavioral  interactions that result in different efficacy of the physiology of starch  digestion in the mouth. First, though, to answer the simple overarching  questions: yes the absolute amount of amylase in the mouth at a given time  does correspond to a greater amount of digestion taking place and units of  maltose (a simple sugar that is the product of amylase activity) liberated,  which can be absorbed into the bloodstream; and yes cooking starch allows  amylase to act even faster and liberate more maltose in the same amount of  time. However, the effect of more amylase allowed for digestion over more time  resulted in greater differences in digestion for raw starches as opposed to  cooked starches. This means that the genetic adaptation would have a greater  impact if starches were consumed raw rather than if they were always cooked,  and this means that consuming foods raw would have imparted a greater  selective pressure. Therefore, these results so far suggest that cooking as a  widely adopted behavioral trait to consume starchy foods would not have  allowed for enough selective pressure to induce genetic adaptations, even if  populations eating cooked starchy foods were eating a lot of them. Instead, the  benefits conferred from a genetic adaptation would be more pronounced among a  population that ate a lot of raw starchy foods. This is also consistent with  the observed genetic adaptations of synanthropic mammals (dogs, mice, pigs,  rats), who are probably accessing a lot of uncooked starchy foods as a result  of living in proximity to humans and feeding off of human food refuse.</p> <p>&nbsp;Second, as to the additional factors that may be part of  the link between genetic adaptations and beneficial phenotypes, two factors  stand out: the botanical variety of plant and the type of edible plant part  that contains starch both coincide with the greatest variation in amylase  activity on the starch. In particular, starches coming from underground storage  organs (such as potato, cassava, and chickpeas), as well as from legumes are  significantly more resistant to amylase activity than are the grass seed  starches (such as wheat, oats, barley, and rice). This may indicate the  tantalizing possibility that grass seeds were exploited as a food source far  earlier than the advent of agriculture. Evidence of primate graminivory (eating  seeds) behavior is seen with the gelada monkeys who live on the highlands of  Ethiopia, so it is possible that a large-bodied primate may subsist, at least intermittently,  on grass seeds. Perhaps the ancestors of modern humans began eating these  low-quality but highly available foods in the early to middle Paleolithic  (~400-300kya), which allowed them to withstand a number of climatic changes  and disperse easily around the globe.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/30/2021<br>      Modified by: Stephanie&nbsp;L&nbsp;Schnorr</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1810060/1810060_10561859_1625066666898_IMG_20201107_141231096_1280x720--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1810060/1810060_10561859_1625066666898_IMG_20201107_141231096_1280x720--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Essence of the harvest"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1810060/1810060_10561859_1625066666898_IMG_20201107_141231096_1280x720--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Essence of the harvest"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Simple equipment and a little effort yields many interesting finds, undoubtedly possible for human ancestors to accomplish with ease</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephanie Schnorr</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Stephanie&nbsp;L&nbsp;Schnorr</div> <div class="imageTitle">Essence of the harvest</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1810060/1810060_10561859_1625066239902_IMG_20190106_191639326--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1810060/1810060_10561859_1625066239902_IMG_20190106_191639326--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Harvested Typha"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1810060/1810060_10561859_1625066239902_IMG_20190106_191639326--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Harvested Typha"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Part of the yield of harvested Typha</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephanie Schnorr</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Stephanie&nbsp;L&nbsp;Schnorr</div> <div class="imageTitle">Harvested Typha</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1810060/1810060_10561859_1625066424992_IMG_20190106_191821402--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1810060/1810060_10561859_1625066424992_IMG_20190106_191821402--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Typha interior"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1810060/1810060_10561859_1625066424992_IMG_20190106_191821402--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Typha interior"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The process of cleaning and preparing wild Typha begins, in order to extract the starch seen in the very center of the plant</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephanie Schnorr</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Stephanie&nbsp;L&nbsp;Schnorr</div> <div class="imageTitle">Typha interior</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1810060/1810060_10561859_1625066556075_IMG_20201107_133411676_1280x720--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1810060/1810060_10561859_1625066556075_IMG_20201107_133411676_1280x720--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Excursions to forage"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1810060/1810060_10561859_1625066556075_IMG_20201107_133411676_1280x720--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Excursions to forage"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Many wild but edible native plant species can be found within a bike ride of major cities</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephanie Schnorr</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Stephanie&nbsp;L&nbsp;Schnorr</div> <div class="imageTitle">Excursions to forage</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1810060/1810060_10561859_1625065995873_IMG_20190106_135440446_1280x720--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1810060/1810060_10561859_1625065995873_IMG_20190106_135440446_1280x720--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Harvesting wild Typha"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1810060/1810060_10561859_1625065995873_IMG_20190106_135440446_1280x720--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Harvesting wild Typha"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Typha roots are plentiful in the Northern latitude and contain a lot of starch, they are just difficult to pull out of the water without getting stuck in the mud!</div> <div class="imageCredit">Amanda G.
