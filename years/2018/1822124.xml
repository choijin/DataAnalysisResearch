<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this Site is to create a more comprehensive, quantitative understanding of causal pathways for the development of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in the occupational environment, which are known to be complex and multi-factorial.  Knowledge gained from research performed at this Site will lead to the identification of interventions that will more effectively mediate injury risk and injury severity.  This Site is needed because, not only are MSDs a major cause of lost work time and the leading cause of disability worldwide, but current treatments for many types of MSDs often are difficult or unsuccessful.  This Site will be an addition to the Center for Disruptive Musculoskeletal Innovations (CDMI), which was created to develop interventions that could develop more cost-effective treatments.  However, it has been well established that MSD prevention is far more cost effective than treatment.  Thus, the intervention concepts to be generated by this Site will have applications to occupational workplace designs, healthcare delivery, sports medicine, the military, and the service industry.  In addition, a better understanding of causal pathways to MSDs will improve the bases for innovative treatments and serve as a useful complement to the research currently being conducted by the CDMI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Site proposes to address the impact of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and the large burden they impose on injured employees, companies, and the U.S. healthcare industry.   It will be unique within the existing IUCRC framework, since it focuses primarily on MSD prevention efforts as opposed to post-injury treatments.  MSDs continue to burden our society because their causes are multi-factorial, complex, and often poorly understood.  Thus, this Site has three technical focuses, each of which is aimed to improve our understanding of how work-related MSDs develop, so that the application of this knowledge can help to prevent or reduce MSD rates.  First, our Site will apply engineering techniques to quantify and characterize MSD causal pathways and use this knowledge to intervene in the pathway, thereby preventing or decreasing MSD risks through workplace and equipment designs to which employees and product consumers are exposed.  Second, we will conduct needed research to improve existing tools, or create new tools, which improve the sensitivity and specificity of MSD risk assessments.  Third, we will use this approach to better understand when and how to return injured employees to the workplace so as to minimize their risk of an MSD recurrence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The mission of the Center for Disruptive Musculoskeletal Innovations (CDMI) is to address pressing societal needs associated with the growing burden of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs).  The main theme of this effort was to conduct research that characterizes MSD causal pathways and develop tools for more comprehensive and accurate MSD risk assessments.  The CDMI is led by the University of California-San Francisco and also includes the University of Toledo.  This one-year effort was awarded during the final year of CDMI's Phase I efforts.  Our Site includes Industry Advisory Board (IAB) representatives from both the manufacturing industry and from health monitoring agencies.  This Site focused on three major research thrusts:  Physical exposures for primary injury (i.e., the physical workplace factors that contribute to an initial MSD, with emphasis on back and shoulder injuries, conditions that impact musculoskeletal fatigue, methods to determine the impact of interventions aimed to reduce MSD development, and more-comprehensive MSD risk assessments); Exposures for secondary injury (i.e., the conditions under which employees with a musculoskeletal disease are able to either return to work successfully or relapse to a second or chronic MSD); and Organizational and individual factors related to MSD development (i.e., how work organization, the work environment, and employee attributes, such as aging, contribute to and interact with physical workloads to influence injury development).   University faculty and research staff proposed 15 studies; four were selected by IAB members and completed during the funding period.  Projects had industry mentors, and their progress was reviewed throughout the year.   Collectively, these four funded projects have added to our knowledge base for evaluating and preventing work-related musculoskeletal disorders.  This includes details regarding both general and specific work tasks, equipment used to reduce exposure to risky work activities, and technology to measure physical job demands.  For example:   Employees across many industries must push or pull loads as part of their jobs.  One of our studies confirmed that safety professionals can use a single-axis force gauge to accurately measure push-pull forces, but that doing so must occur at a fast pace, since these data will most closely match how individuals actually move loads in real-world situations. Another study addressed work in a specific facilities--distribution centers.  Guidelines were developed to aid this industry in determining where items should more ideally be placed on flow racks to reduce loads on the back and shoulders. Exoskeletons are wearable devices intended to augment, enable, or enhance motions or physical activities.  These have become extremely popular across many industries, in an attempt reduce employee injury.  One funded study found that wearing specific exoskeletons only slightly reduced spinal loads and that other workplace factors or lifting methods were more effective at reducing these loads.  In other words, appropriate use of exoskeletons to reduce injury risk needs to consider specific work parameters in order to be effective. Wearable motion sensor technology is revolutionizing the job safety assessment process.  However, there is much debate regarding what specific data gathered from this technology is useful and relevant in this effort.  One of our funded studies found that joint velocity and acceleration data taken from these sensors are sensitive to task difficulty and also not impacted by drift (a common motion sensor artifact) as are other sensor metrics.    This Site has attracted interest from a wide and diverse range industries, including automotive manufacturing, paper goods processing, distribution &amp; warehousing, transportation, and healthcare.  Companies within these and other industry sectors will be pursued during our five-year, Phase II funding, which was awarded in December 2019.
