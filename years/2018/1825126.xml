<AbstractNarration>Absent from most discussions of the future of the U.S. engineering technical workforce, has been the role of engineering technology education in supporting the nation's technical infrastructure and capacity for innovation. According to the Department of Education, in 2014 over half of engineering related credentials (53%) awarded are in certificate, two-year degrees, or engineering technology, yet there is little understanding of this field and role that these workers play. The purpose of this research project is to develop a greater understanding of the professional identity, institutional culture, and formation of engineering technicians and technologists prepared at two-year colleges. Understanding the role engineering technology education plays and can play in supporting the nation's technical infrastructure and capacity for innovation is essential as engineering scholars seek to enhance the careers of future engineers. This study represents a multi-institutional research partnership between Clemson University, the University of Arkansas, and Tri-County Technical College. This increased understanding will provide insights into shaping targeted educational programs, career counseling, professional development, new policies and strategies to support engineering technology students, promote career guidance, and increase professional satisfaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three primary objectives of this study: (1) Identify dimensions of career orientations at various stages of professional preparation and map to engineering technology career pathways by surveying engineering technology students, transfer students, and early career engineering technology professionals using Schein's Career Anchor Inventory; (2) Develop an empirical framework, incorporating individual career anchors and the effect of institutional culture, for understanding engineering technology professional formation informed by the Hughes Values Framework; and (3) Develop and pilot interventions aimed at transforming engineering formation systems in engineering technology contexts. This study will utilize a mixed methods research design focusing on both descriptive and correlational analyses of data. Three integrated theoretical frameworks, Social Cognitive Career Theory, Schein's Career Anchor Inventory (online surveys of engineering technology students and professionals), and the Hughes Value Creation Model for Organizational Competitive Advantage (open-ended interviews with students, professionals, and engineering technology institutions/organizations) will be integrated. The use of multiple theories provides an evidence-based framework building new interdisciplinary perspectives and understanding focused on describing and comparing engineering technology pathways and understandings of professional identity and culture. The outcomes of this research study are expected to address and bring awareness to an existing gap in engineering technology and two-year college engineering education research which will impact teaching and learning in both formal and informal settings, reveal new pathways and critical transition points, and impact career preparation and training in the engineering education and human resource development fields. Additional benefits of this study include catalyzing interaction of researchers and practitioners with policy-makers and the public on outcomes and challenges related to career development and institutional cultural impact in engineering technology curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
