<AbstractNarration>This award is to support and enable students to attend the International Sedimentological Congress (ISC), a global meeting devoted to sedimentary geology. The meeting convenes every four years and will be held this year in Quebec City, Canada. This is first time since 1982 that this international meeting is being held in North America. It is expected that more than 2000 professional sedimentary geologists from throughout the world will be in attendance. During the five-day meeting, participants will have the opportunity to interact with one another through both formal and informal oral and poster presentations. The program also features a series of workshops that include presentations and opportunities for dialog that will allow for synthesis and collaboration between researchers across disciplines and across broad geographic regions. There are a series of midweek, pre-meeting, and post-meeting field trips and short courses offered that are designed to provide training in cutting-edge approaches to data analyses and to foster communication. Students funded will include both undergraduate and graduate students from across the various sedimentary geology disciplines. Underrepresented minorities, women and persons with disabilities will be especially encouraged to submit applications to receive this travel support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studying aspects of the sedimentary crust of the earth is a vibrant discipline that includes such currently relevant topics as the tempo and mode of life on earth, the physical processes that control erosion and deposition of sediments; the stratigraphic record of environmental perturbations, and the preservation of the stratigraphic record. It is a completely interdisciplinary field of study that includes researchers from biology, physics, stratigraphy, geochronology, geochemistry, and modeling. The 20th ISC meeting will uniquely contribute to the geological sciences because it will bring together the global community of sedimentary geologists, of all career stages, to share their research methods, findings and experiences in the field. Unlike other meetings attended by sedimentary geologists (e.g. Geological Society of America, International Association of Sedimentologists, SEPM Society for Sedimentary Geology), ISC attracts a large, diverse, global cross section of sedimentary geologists (e.g. European, North American, Asia- Pacific, Eastern Europe, African, etc.), but is still a small enough venue for critical networking to occur across subfields. This will lead to new opportunities for collaboration and the creation of novel approaches to studying our world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcome Report  Eleven geoscience students received $1,500 travel grants to attend the 20th International Sedimentological Congress in Quebec City, Canada, August 13-17, 2018. The awards were made in conjunction with the Sedimentary Geology Division of GSA and covered the student's expenses to attend the meeting.  The students come from a wide cross-section of the geoscience community based on gender, ethnicity, age and degree program.  Eight come from underrepresented groups within the geosciences, two were undergraduate and nine were in graduate degree programs.  Five of the students made presentations of their research at the meeting.   Jamar Bynum,  Andrew Cummings,  Autum Downey,  Rebecca Englert,  Luke Fritz,  Maria Sider,  Alice Stagner,  Frank Tamakloe,  Allen Tevyaw,  Logan West, and  Spencer William.      The students were all US citizens and came from ten universities, including two Canadian schools.  The universities included:  Oklahoma State University; MIT; West Virginia University; University of Calgary; Florida International University; Queens University; University of Kentucky; University of Nebraska; University of Texas-Austin; and Jackson State University.  Two mentoring sessions were held during the meeting to help answer any questions about the meeting or about any of the geoscience that was presented.  Each student submitted a written report on their experience from both the scientific and cultural aspects.  A summary report of the student's impressions of the meeting was published in The Sedimentary Record (DOI 10.2110/s            Last Modified: 07/01/2019       Submitted by: Howard E Harper]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
