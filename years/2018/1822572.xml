<AbstractNarration>The PIs and Co-PIs of grants supported through the NSF-NIH-ANR-BMBF-BSF-NICT Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS) program meet annually to report on projects; to discuss scientific, educational, and program-related issues; and to develop a cohesive investigator community representing many different approaches to computational neuroscience. This fourteenth meeting of CRCNS investigators brings together a broad spectrum of computational neuroscience researchers supported by the program, and includes poster presentations, talks, plenary lectures, and workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting is scheduled for June 13-15, 2018 and is hosted by the University of California, Berkeley.  More information is available at https://www.regonline.com/crcns2018.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
