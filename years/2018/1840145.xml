<AbstractNarration>Vision is our most important and complex sense critical to daily living. Therefore, irreversible blinding diseases of the eye such as macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa that affect over 10 million people in the US alone have devastating consequences on the quality of life. Loss of vision in these diseases is due to progressive degeneration of cells called photoreceptors in the retina. The photoreceptors normally convert the incident light information into electrochemical signals that are relayed to the brain for the perception of sight through a complex neural network. Degeneration causes a break in the neural network and thereby the process of vision, even though the rest of the neural network is functionally intact. Retinal implants seeking to replace degenerated cells by stimulating surviving cells with electrical current are emerging as a promising option for treating such blindness. But, because current is an unnatural stimulus, they have difficulty restoring naturalistic vision and visual acuity below the legal blindness limit. Recent research from the PI's group has demonstrated that stimulating a live retinal tissue in a dish with the brain chemical glutamate mimics its natural activation following visual stimulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artificially stimulating the retina with brain chemicals delivered through a tiny device implanted in the back of the eye could potentially restore more naturalistic vision and better visual acuity than current retinal prostheses. A suitable technology for the delivery of chemicals through an implantable device in the eye, is currently lacking. The proposed project aims to fill this technological gap by exploring strategies that could enable light-controlled delivery of therapeutic amounts of brain chemicals using only natural light passing through the eye. If successful, this project could accelerate the development of an implantable device to deliver brain chemicals to the retina and help restore high-acuity naturalistic vision to millions of people who are blind by neurodegenerative retinal diseases. It could also potentially prove effective in treating other neurodegenerative eye diseases such as glaucoma and optic neuritis that preclude the use of retinal prosthetics and brain disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This grant supported bold and original research aimed at restoring sight to the blind. In many cases, people become blind because specialized cells in their eyes that detect light have died. These cells are called photoreceptors and they are usually the only cells affected by diseases that cause blindness. The other cells in the eye, the ones that carry information from the photoreceptors to the brain, are usually working just fine. This fact has inspired many efforts to replace the lost photoreceptors with machinery. Most of these machines are electrical, cameras of one type or another that image the scene and try to stimulate neurons in the eye in the right pattern to send a meaningful image to the brain. However, it is difficult to put a grid of electrodes on the back of the eye and use it to stimulate the neurons there to make a crisp image. One of the reasons for that is that these cells are not naturally stimulated with electricity. They are naturally stimulated with chemicals called neurotransmitters that are released by photoreceptor cells when light hits them. This project was innovative because it proposed to replace photoreceptor cells with a machine that worked like them, i.e. a machine that would release tiny squirts of neurotransmitter when light fell on it in a pattern corresponding to the pattern of light. The plan is to create a grid of tiny needles mounted on the back of the eye that releases tiny squirts of neurotransmitters when light hits them, creating a pattern of cell activation that carries a meaningful image to the brain. This approach is brand new and it presents formidable mechanical engineering challenges. We must build a thin layer device with thousands of tiny cavities in it that hold small quantities of neurotransmitter. A needle must be built on top of each cavity and the two have to be connected by a tiny pump that can turn on and off the flow of neurotransmitter rapidly and precisely depending on how much light is falling at that particular point. We are using photolithography, the same technique used to create tiny, intricate circuit boards in laptops and cell phones, to build these tiny devices accurately at a small scale. The central challenge is building all the tiny individual pumps that control the flow through each of these little needles. Most pumps have moving components, sliding pistons or spinning rotors, that propel fluid. Cramming thousands of tiny, functioning pumps of this type into the back of a human eyeball is almost impossible. However, it is possible to build a tiny pump with no moving parts that relies on a phenomenon called electroosmosis. Under the right circumstances, a solution of neurotransmitters will flow through a narrow channel in the presence of an electric field. We have focused on this vital building block in our system, building these tiny pumps into microchips and proving we can precisely control the flow of neurotransmitters through them. We have shown that we can expand from a single channel to a grid of 4 or 9. Now that we have this component in place, we are prepared to systematically build up the other components of the system. This completed project formed the foundation for follow up studies funded by the National Institutes of Health that are showing that chemical stimulation can activate the retina with enough speed and precision to create a meaningful image, even after the photoreceptor cells have been killed by disease. We are also collaborating with a start-up company in Texas that is trying to bring related retinal prosthetic devices to patients.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/08/2021<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;D&nbsp;Finan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
