<AbstractNarration>"A request is made to fund new instrumentation for the R/V Oceanus, a 177? research vessel operated by Oregon State University as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The R/V Oceanus is a general-purpose research vessel owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by Oregon State University. The mission of the ship is to support funded science research in the Pacific Northwest.  R/V Oceanus completed 215 days in 2017, 144 (67%) of which were for NSF. In 2018, the vessel is scheduled to sail 176 days with 75% (132 days) of the schedule for NSF.  With this proposal, OSU provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment:             &lt;br/&gt;1) Blocks with Load Monitoring      $56,750 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts        &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2018 Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment grant was for two Smith Berger hanging snatch blocks and a wireless load cell pin.  These blocks are necessary to meet the operational needs of Oceanus as well as UNOLS RVSS Appendix A requirements.  One hanging snatch block was initially purchased from Smith Berger in June of 2018.  This block has been in use supporting at-sea operations on the R/V Oceanus for the past year. The requirements for the proposed blocks changed from the original proposal after the first block was fabricated.  Specifically:    The dimensions of the hanging snatch blocks were changed by a cooperative effort between the OSU Marine Technician Group (hereafter referred to as "MTG") and Smith Berger engineers.  The changes resulted from the need to:    Pass mooring hardware thru the mouth of the block,  Meet UNOLS Appendix-A requirements, Pass large equipment through the ship?s A-frame, which is relatively small in height.    To meet these needs the size of the block was reduced as much as possible without jeopardizing compliance with UNOLS Appendix-A regulations, and custom swivel mount used to attach the block to the A-frame was designed and procured which also helped reduce to overall size of the block hanging under the A-frame.    While using the new block in operation it was discovered that the tension members rubbed against the side of the block when there was significant wire angle off the stern of the ship. To solve this problem the OSU MTG coordinated with Smith Berger engineers to develop a guide rail to allow the tension members to feed through without rubbing. The rails were installed in late April-early May for 2019.    The wireless load cell pin originally proposed to be equipped on the second Smith Berger hanging snatch block was not initially procured. The wireless tension readings could not sample tension fast enough to meet the UNOLS App A 20 HBz sampling rate requirements. With the approval of the NSF Program manager, the funds were reallocated to procure:     Two spare CTD slip rings from Focal Technologies, A spare load cell pin from MTNW/Rugged Controls,  Two guide rails (described above) for each Smith Berger hanging snatch block.    A "no-cost" extension to complete these actions was submitted and approved by the NSF Program manager. The slip rings, load pin, and guide rails were installed in mid-Spring of 2019.
