<AbstractNarration>Tropical forests are affected by severe windstorms that cause large trees to fall very suddenly. These storms are massive and unpredictable, so it has been difficult to understand their full impacts. This project will study a recent catastrophic storm event that caused considerable damage in the lowlands of Costa Rica. The extent of fallen trees, and the amount of carbon in those trees, will be measured by flying a detector over the forest while taking some basic measurements of forest structure on the ground. Later, the pictures taken from the air will be analyzed to produce a measurement of fallen trees and carbon. The project will directly support graduate and undergraduate students in the U.S. All of the data generated by this research will be made publicly available without restriction. The findings of this research will be published in open-access journals, or with an open access option, whenever possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research tests two predictions about how disturbance events influence carbon inputs and outputs. The approach will examine changes in above ground carbon stocks before and after a recent catastrophic storm at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. The measurement of fallen trees will be conducted by a very high resolution remote sensing aircraft using the LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technique. LIDAR is a surveying method that measures distance to a target by illuminating the target with pulsed laser light and measuring the reflected pulses with a sensor. These measurements will be accompanied by ground surveys of fallen trees to provide important additional information. The occurrence of this storm at a well-studied field station with the infrastructure and baseline measurements necessary to advance conceptual understanding of forest carbon cycling is an unprecedented research opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The objectives of this project were to collect airborne lidar, a type of remote sensing, in a tropical rain forest in Costa Rica, and to use remote sensing to quantify changes in aboveground carbon density due to a recent severe-weather event. The impact of severe-weather events is an important source of uncertainty in ground-based estimates of carbon stock change in forested landscapes, and this event over a well-studied research site in the Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica provided an opportunity to understand how severe weather impacts the ability of scientists to determine carbon balance using traditional methods. The study indicated that aboveground carbon density was reduced by at least 17.6%. Using a computer simulation, we found that the severe weather event will likely induce a transient carbon sink of 24 to 49 years in duration. This means that regions of the forested landscape impacted by this event will be net accumulators of carbon for 24 to 49 years. This finding is important, because it means that attribution of an apparent forest carbon sink to a given cause should consider the possibility that the forest is recovering from a previous disturbance. The project produced 1 peer-reviewed publication, 1 undergraduate thesis, 1 publication in development, and additional work ongoing. The project supported 1 undergraduate at Brown University, 3 graduate students at Brown University, and 1 post-doctoral research associate at Brown University.
