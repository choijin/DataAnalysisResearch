<AbstractNarration>The Research at High Pressure Gordon Conference (HP-GRC) is one of the oldest topical conferences held since the emergence of the field of high pressure and has been held uninterrupted for over 60 years. The HP-GRC is a multidisciplinary conference in the field of high pressure research, and this year?s HPGRC program consists of presentations on breakthrough and unpublished results obtained using high-pressure methods and new innovations for studying matter under extreme conditions. This conference brings together experts from the dynamic and static pressure communities across the world to present and discuss their new and unpublished results. Accompanied by an associated High Pressure Gordon Research Seminar (HP-GRS) this conference attracts many young researchers as well as pioneers of the&lt;br/&gt;field. The collegial atmosphere of this conference accommodates many fruitful discussions, motivates new directions in the field of high pressure and promotes mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
