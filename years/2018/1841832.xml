<AbstractNarration>This proposal is for support of student travel for the 2nd International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) Conference on Cyber-Physical and Human Systems being held in Miami, Florida.   The conference is sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers.  The focus on integration of Human and Cyber-Physical Systems is an area of great importance and direct applicability to NSF's Cyber-Physical Systems and Smart and Connected Communities Programs.   The award will provide travel support for approximately 10 graduate students to attend, present papers, and participate in conference activities.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This conference will provide the students with the opportunity to attend presentations of cutting-edge research results representing the state-of-the-art in cyber physical systems and their integration with humans.   The attendees are offered a diversity of interactive forums, technical sessions, targeted workshops, interesting poster sessions, and exciting demonstrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
