<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project relates to the development of cellular products with therapeutic value. Human cells extracted from a donor can be grown in a dish, reprogrammed to gain new functionalities, and injected into a patient to replace or repair damaged and diseased tissues. This therapeutic approach can be used in a variety of organ regeneration and wound healing procedures. For instance, cultured cells can be transplanted into patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy so as to replenish their bone marrow. Cells can also be injected into the heart of patients who have suffered a heart attack so as to repair scarred tissue. Moreover, patients who have suffered a spinal cord injury may regain mobility upon injection of cultured nerve cells at the site of damage. Additionally, this approach provides the means to generate large supplies of blood for transfusions, thereby diminishing reliance on donors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on a technology that can help generate human cells that are safer for clinical use than the cells currently available. In particular, many clinical applications currently require cells to be genetically modified. The core technology of this I-Corps project allows the manipulation of cells without the need for genetic modifications, thereby opening the full commercial potential of cellular products. This technology relies on a cell delivery approach that allows the introduction of molecules inside cells that, until now, could not enter cells. With this innovative technology, and by using new cell-reprogramming molecules, the conventional use of DNA-modifying approaches can be circumvented. Therefore, cells can now be manipulated in a novel manner to achieve improved therapeutic capabilities while avoiding genetic modifications and minimizing safety risks.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A number of therapies currently involve the use of externally administered human cells as biological drugs. Our initial idea was that scientist at biotech companies developing cell therapies need a more efficient methodology to generate cell products that are safe for human use. We therefore believed that reagents that can deliver protein into cells, as opposed to DNA, would be valuable in the cell-therapy market. This is because proteins can control what cells do without modifying cellular genomes. We therefore thought that cells that are reprogrammed with proteins would be safer to use than cells modified with genome-altering DNA. In practice, we also thought that this means that clinicians and patients would be interested in using cell products that are less likely to become cancerous overtime. By interviewing actors in this market, we found that scientists, doctors, technicians, nurses, and patients have many needs and pain points. None of them however involved safety. This is because, in many cases, the use of cell therapies, including CAR T-cells that can combat tumors, is reserved as a last chance treatment. What matters then, is speed: getting the treatment as ready as soon as possible as the patient may be near death. Safety is not currently an overarching concern as any unwanted consequences are secondary to the priority of helping the patient survive. Based on these findings, our business plan changed and pivoted towards the market represented by research &amp; development scientist who simply seek better tools to study what cells do. In this case, based on interviews, it became clear that researchers seek reagents that yield efficient and reproducible delivery protocols. We surveyed the market and found that it is dominated by distributors that are the gatekeepers between suppliers and end-users. These distributors are interested in expanding their portfolio of reagents but want to de-risk as much as possible any new product. This means that new reagents should have proven value in key applications while requiring minimal development. Based on these findings, we decided to focus on developing cell-delivery reagents targeted towards gene-editing applications. &nbsp;Gene editing is already revolutionizing the biotechnology field, leading to advances in medicine and agriculture. The current gene-editing protocols work but delivering the molecular machinery that is required to achieve gene editing is too often a problem. Delivery reagents that can solve this problem are therefore needed.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/12/2018<br>      Modified by: Jean-Philippe&nbsp;Pellois</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
