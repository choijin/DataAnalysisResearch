<AbstractNarration>The project proposes to create a benchmark suite using real-world scientific applications. The benchmark suite will be developed jointly with the High-Performance Group (HPG) of the Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC), a non-profit organization with the goal of creating and maintaining standardized benchmarks to evaluate performance and energy efficiency for the newest generation of computing systems. The project will leverage SPEC infrastructure to ensure continuous maintenance of the benchmark suite, as well as support for result submission, review, and publication on the SPEC website. Furthermore, the project will use the published results of the benchmark suite to create a public ranking of High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems deployed across the world. Partnership with SPEC will ensure that the results of the project will be disseminated to industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creation of a new real-world application benchmark suite jointly with SPEC/HPG, as well as the development of performance metrics suitable for application benchmarks, will lead to improved HPC system design and enable the better understanding of how next-generation computing systems must evolve. In addition to evaluating HPC systems, the proposed application benchmark suite will also enable the comparative performance evaluation of novel software and hardware ecosystems.  Moreover, the proposed work builds on NSF investment in domain science application development by including these applications in the suite. Importantly, the project will be an opportunity to bring the benchmark community together to develop and define performance and throughput metrics for real world scientific applications. Finally, the project will deliver a benchmark suite that will be freely available to non-profit organizations and sustained by SPEC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major two outcomes of the EAGER award "Measuring Real World Application Performance on Next-Generation Computing Systems" is the preparation of six parallel scientific applications for inclusion into the upcoming High Performance Computing (HPC) benchmark suite of the Standards Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC) and a new way to rank the results of this benchmark. In this award team members from Indiana University and the University of Delaware have worked jointly to prepare six parallel scientific applications from different domains for inclusion into a new HPC benchmark suite currently under development at the High Performance Group at SPEC. As part of the work, the source code of the applications was prepared for inclusion into the SPEC provided benchmarking harness and was reviewed to ensure future portability to different hardware and software ecosystems. Since the benchmark targets diverse processor and accelerator platforms, the applications that we worked on supported MPI, OpenMP and OpenACC parallel programming models. At the same time input datasets were created that will allow for the execution of the applications to scale from single servers to medium sized clusters and in the future to large scale HPC systems. Input for our work was provided via a workshop where leading benchmarking and HPC experts presented their view on the state of HPC benchmarking. Another deliverable of the award is a website that allows users to rank the benchmark results using different criteria. The website was developed using results of existing SPEC benchmarks and will be adapted once the new benchmark is released.
