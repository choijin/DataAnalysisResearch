<AbstractNarration>Synergetic Drone Delivery Network in Metropolis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rapid growth of e-commerce demands has put additional strain on dense urban communities resulting in increased traffic of delivery trucks while slowing down the pace of delivery operations. With recent quick-purchase innovations like the Amazon Dash button, e-commerce drastically modified the consumers behavior to buy smaller products separately and regularly, adding more load to delivery operations. Another growing trend is the offering of fast delivery services such as same-day and instant delivery. Instacart, Uber Eats and Amazon Now are examples of services that can fulfill a delivery order in just under 2 hours. These services rely heavily on the infrastructure of ride-sharing vehicles as Uber or Lyft drivers. This solution offers great flexibility to the consumer, but a single person can only deliver one purchase order to a customer at a time, and it is not scalable or cost-effective.  There is an unquestionable need to redesign the current method of distribution packages in urban environments. This project envisions a framework that synergizes manipulatable distribution networks, comprising autonomous flying robots (drones) with existing transport networks, towards enhanced autonomy and economics in logistics. Imagine that a ride-sharing vehicle outfitted with a docking device for packages on its roof is traveling through a distribution center towards downtown. A drone can place a package on the vehicle's roof while it drives by the distribution center, and another drone can recover the package once the vehicle is driving through another distribution center in proximity to its destination. An operator that owns several base stations, at each of which it employs a network of drones to pick packages from the respective base station and drop it on a ground vehicle assigned to the package, is a required assumption by the framework. The ground vehicles can be public transport vehicles (PTVs), ride-sharing vehicles (RSVs), or operator owned vehicles (OOVs), which carry the package for most of the distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach relies on three main thrusts: i) socially aware robotics, ii) safe and robust motion planning and execution, iii) cooperative network logistics. Motion planning for robots will be developed with account of peoples perception of safety, privacy, and comfort. Socially-aware motion planning methods to generate trajectories with guarantees of safety in the presence of obstacles and humans will be developed. Psychological experiments will be developed to study human's subtle behavior in response to the presence of multiple drones using virtual reality test environment. Local control algorithms will be developed for each drone to follow a feasible collision free path. Robust local communication protocols will be investigated so that flying robots can perform collaborative tasks over busy air/ground traffic conditions and unreliable communication networks. Another objective is to achieve robust and safe rendezvous with fast moving vehicles under communication, schedule, and other modeling uncertainties. Algorithms that generate (possibly multi-hop) routes for each package, consisting of vehicle route segments, with the objective of minimizing cumulative delivery time, will be developed. The series of vehicle segments on which each package travels, and the associated schedule, is required as input for drones.  This in turn necessitates solving the underlying network design problem for the centralized entity, to determine locations of distribution centers (bases) and number of OOVs required for feasible and reliable delivery of all packages, while explicitly estimating uncertainty from traffic trends and overall frequency of travel of RSVs between various points in the network. Game-theoretic mechanisms that incentivize cooperation among multiple independent operators of PSVs and RSVs will be developed. Mechanisms have to be specifically designed to ensure truthful bidding, because the objectives of the operator, the RSVs and the PSVs are not naturally aligned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
