<AbstractNarration>In many mammals, male characteristics and behaviors may limit female mate choice.  Discrepancies between observed mate choice and actual paternity suggest, however, that females may exert influence over offspring paternity through physiological preference. This doctoral dissertation project will explore how genetics and physiology influence primate mate choice, generating novel data on primate reproductive physiology. The project also will provide mentorship and training in field, laboratory, bioinformatics and statistical methods for students from groups under-represented in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will explore physiological mechanisms by which olive baboons may exert post-breeding mate choice. The co-PI will collect reproductive physiological data for both males and females. Social behaviors will also be recorded to investigate the concordance between pre- and post-breeding choice. This study will improve understanding of post-breeding mechanisms of choice in primates and inform the broader primate comparative context for understanding the unique suite of reproductive and morphological characteristics seen in humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many of the beautiful colors and courtship behaviors observed in species of birds and fish have been attributed to female mate choice, however comparatively little is known about the effects of female mate choice in mammals. In some species, large male body size and sexual coercion may limit the ability of females to mate with only preferred partners, and therefore females may engage in more cryptic mechanisms to influence paternity. Recent evidence of cryptic female mate choice has begun to accumulate in non-human primates, such as discrepancies between mating observations and paternity, however there is a dearth of information on how such cryptic mechanisms may operate. Genetic characteristics, both genome-wide and at a region of the genome specific to immune function, have proven to be informative in predicting paternity and behavioral mate choice in primates, however these studies often find it impossible to tease apart male- versus female-driven processes, as well as those occurring before, during, or after copulation.     The present study aimed to explore mechanisms of female-driven mate choice occurring both before and after copulation in a non-human primate, the olive baboon.  Our study had two specific aims:     1)      describe changes in the vaginal environment across the ovarian cycle in the absence of mating, and following copulation with males with different genetic characteristics  2)      characterize female sexual signaling and behavior in relation to the male genetic characteristics     To accomplish these aims, we first sequenced the DNA of 22 captive olive baboons living at le Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Primate Center in Rousset, France. We sequenced short segments of DNA interspersed throughout the genome, as well as an area specific to immune function, known to be relevant to mate choice through its effects on body odor. We then formulated 4 study groups, and from these groups collected a broad range of data types, including behavioral data, pictures of females’ sexual swellings (i.e. the swelling of the ano-genital skin which advertises fertility), vaginal pH measurements, and vaginal swabs used to determine the female’s ovarian cycle phase and their vaginal gene expression. Vaginal pH and gene expression were assessed because of their potential effects on sperm survival within the vagina. Low vaginal pH inhibits sperm survival, and vaginal gene expression has the potential to influence the immune response mounted by the female in response to the ejaculate, also influencing sperm survival.  Both of these parameters may influence which sperm are successful, and thereby which males father offspring, providing potential mechanisms of cryptic female mate choice.      Following data collection, we then compared the genetic profile of each individual, as well as the genetic complementarity (e.g. similarity) between mating dyads, to rates of sexual behavior, the timing of sexual swellings, and changes in vaginal pH and gene expression both before and following copulation.  Publications are forthcoming, and will include:  1)      Concordance between genetic variability and complementarity genome-wide and at areas specific to immune function in the olive baboon.  2)      How genetic variability and complementarity influence rates of social and sexual behavior in the olive baboon.  3)      The accuracy with which female sexual swellings predict ovulation in this population, specifically when females are housed with males possessing differing amounts of genetic variability and complementarity.  4)      Olive baboon vaginal pH and gene expression throughout the different phases of the ovarian cycle.  5)      Changes in olive baboon vaginal pH and gene expression in response to mating with males possessing different degrees of genetic variability and complementarity.     This research greatly improves to our understanding of female reproductive strategies in olive baboons, a species that is closely related to humans and an excellent model for understanding processes related to mate choice in humans. For example, approximately 30% of human infertility is due to unknown reasons, and improving our knowledge of the male/female interface early in reproduction in a closely related species has the potential to improve fertility treatments and clarify unexplained infertility issues in humans.
