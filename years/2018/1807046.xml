<AbstractNarration>After decades of research and development, the search for gravitational waves has finally succeeded, and their detection has forever changed the field of astronomy.  During the first two observing runs NSF's Advanced LIGO detectors have already detected at least five binary black hole mergers and one binary neutron star merger.  While these detections have already validated the theory of general relativity at new levels, enabled novel cosmological measurements, and greatly advanced our understanding of compact objects, they have only scratched the surface of what these detectors can achieve.  LIGO and Virgo's next observing campaigns will bring hundreds more observations of compact binary mergers. The goal of this work is to use those detections to answer the questions: 1) How are compact binaries formed? and 2) Are we missing unmodeled physics?  The group conducting this work will include a teacher from a local high school for two consecutive summers, enabling the integration of topics in gravitational wave astronomy into the curriculum.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the next 2-3 years, LIGO's improved sensitivity will increase detection rates from one per month to one per day. This award will support the development and employment of the next generation of source characterization tools to enable new science in the regime of high-event-rate observation, including rapid and automated event follow-up, binary population characterization, and constraints on deviations from predicted signal models. New Bayesian hierarchical modeling tools will be developed and deployed to assess compact binary formation environments.  Alternative signal models will also be developed, which will be sensitive to a range of unmodeled physics (e.g., tidal disruptions of neutron stars, excitation of neutron star resonances, deviations from relativity), that current characterization techniques could miss.  To enable this science an improved analysis infrastructure is necessary, capable of handling much higher event rates.  This award will support the development of a new open-source gravitational wave data analysis library that incorporates the models developed as part of this work, as well as other techniques necessary for characterizing compact binary mergers detected by LIGO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
