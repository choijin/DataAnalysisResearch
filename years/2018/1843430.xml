<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project pertains to the novel production of short-fiber reinforced thermoplastic material applicable to a range of processes, with the added benefit of utilizing  high quality, low cost recycled or recovered fibers. The beachhead application is in a powder-based additive manufacturing system capable of mid-scale manufacturing that can bridge between prototype-stage and capital-intensive injection molded economy-of-scale manufacturing. Such systems can be located in regional production hubs to accelerate new or highly-customizable products to market. The inclusion of the proposed additives in these systems will expand the range of end-product material properties available, and thereby expand the potential client pool for the same platform. Anticipated flow properties of the material will position it as an accessible additive option for other 3D printing technologies as well as the much larger-market of injection molding processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project adapts a processing technology that is yet untapped for this application, to produce a composite thermoplastic additive for polymeric powder feedstock 3D printing. This additive is expected to increase stiffness, strength, and thermal stability of the end product, while reducing weight and providing superior handling characteristics during production relative to existing alternatives. The project is focused on identifying process conditions required to produce a nominally conforming product, followed by testing that characterizes the material and handling properties. Results of these tests will be compared against acceptance standards published by the beachhead additive manufacturing system supplier in preparation for inclusion into 3D printed test components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

We are solving the world's toughest advanced materials recycling challenges to create circular supply chains and enable a sustainable future.  With NSF Phase 1 SBIR grant funding, Vartega completed customer discovery to identify needs for higher performing additive manufactured parts for aerospace, drones, and prosthetics. Feedback indicated that lightweight, low-cost, functional, and consistent 3D printed composites would enable accelerated innovation in these applications.  Consistent with that feedback, the overall goal of this project was to develop equipment and process technology to broaden the use of recycled carbon fiber in additive manufacturing applications. The specific innovation was to produce a milled carbon fiber fully encapsulated in thermoplastic for use in polymer powder additive manufacturing processes such as laser sintering and jetfusion. These techniques require specific powder properties to operate effectively. As such, carbon fiber has historically been a challenging material for these systems. The processes and apparatus applied in this project were designed to apply a coating to mask the fibersâ€™ surface in an optically compliant plastic, thereby enabling carbon fiber reinforcement.  Successful encapsulation was achieved in the project to mask the color of carbon fiber and produce a high aspect ratio powder that could be further developed for commercial application in additive manufacturing applications. Additional development will enable higher volume production, optimized properties, and consistent performance.           Last Modified: 12/14/2020       Submitted by: Andrew Maxey]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
