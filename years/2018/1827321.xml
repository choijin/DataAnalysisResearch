<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this PFI project is to accelerate the manufacture of a hearing assistive device, a cochlear implant. In contrast to hearing aids that simply make sounds louder, a cochlear implant is surgically placed into the human ear and activates the hearing (auditory) nerve in a way that the brain perceives as sound. Presently, cochlear implants are used less than they can be in the United States, and even more children could benefit from the device. The reasons for the limited utilization include awareness and costs of the device, surgery and follow up care. The pursuit of this PFI project will offer a new way to make cochlear implants with microcoils.  Furthermore, by creating the devices in a way similar to printed electronics, dramatic cost reduction may be realized, along with the natural integration with conventional cochlear implant technologies. This project will also improve the awareness of cochlear implants through outreach and engagement of undergraduate and graduate students, with a focus on underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project pursues a novel method to develop microcoils that can fit within the human ear as part of a cochlear implant, the cochlear array. To produce this device, we plan to overcome technology transfer barriers through a novel manufacturing approach relying upon recent advances in additive manufacturing and flexible electronics to rapidly write (print) conductive traces on a polymeric substrate in three-dimension. We then encapsulate the device fully in a biocompatible polymer to realize proof-of-concept microcoils for bench and in-vitro testing. These devices will enable us to overcome the existing knowledge gap in microcoil dimensions, proximity to target auditory neurons, and stimulus parameters through bench and neural cell culture testing. The scientific merit is the demonstration that microcoils can elicit focused neural activity, via magnetically induced electric fields, and enable selective activation of auditory neurons. We will have the baseline data upon which to build our technical case for commercialization. A strong multidisciplinary team consisting of engineers, clinicians, commercialization mentor and domain expert collaborators will partner to pursue translation with the goal of achieving a life-changing intervention for children and adults suffering from severe-to-profound hearing loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
