<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation research project will study the complex interactions among topography, forest cover, and sky conditions on solar insolation, thereby providing more accurate and higher-resolution estimates of solar radiation reaching the ground surface.  The project will enhance the capabilities of researchers and practitioners to incorporate the effects of atmospheric conditions and vegetation in solar radiation models that are needed to advance research about surface solar radiation, heat flux, and ground and surface water temperature dynamics.  In addition to evaluating a high-resolution, spatially explicit approach to estimating the amount of solar radiation penetrating forest canopies over extensive areas, this project will demonstrate methods for incorporating real-sky conditions in the modeling of stream temperatures.  The integrative model to be developed by the doctoral student will have the potential to be a powerful, spatially explicit tool for demonstrating linkages among stream processes, land-management, and ecosystem outcomes that can be adapted to a broad range of natural and human-modified environments.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.  The project also will provide valuable experience in collaborative interdisciplinary research for another graduate student serving as a technician on this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A recently developed subcanopy solar radiation modeling method that uses airborne LiDAR data and is integrated with an open-source, bare-earth solar radiation model demonstrated that light penetration through forest canopies could be estimated and used to produce high resolution estimates of subcanopy solar radiation for vegetated landscapes.  That solar radiation model allows parameterization of the effects of atmospheric conditions where the solar radiation reaching the canopy surface is affected by atmospheric aerosols, water vapor, and clouds. The information needed to parameterize atmospheric conditions is not widely available for most locations in the United States, however.  Although values representing uniformly clear or overcast sky conditions or published values of historic averages can be used, values more representative of real-sky conditions should improve the accuracy of the solar radiation estimates for specific locations and time periods.  The doctoral student will build on these recent advances in solar radiation modeling and the increased availability of remotely sensed data by incorporating the combined effects of atmospheric conditions, forest canopies, and topography to improve estimates of subcanopy solar radiation in a Southern Appalachian headwater basin.  The student will develop open-science workflows to compute the Linke Turbidity value and the clear sky index using existing methods and available satellite data for the parameterization of atmospheric conditions.  She will test the validity of the solar radiation models with general and computed atmospheric condition parameters, and she will evaluate model accuracy with field measurements of subcanopy solar radiation.  She also will determine whether the inclusion of real-sky and forest canopy conditions to estimate solar radiation improves the accuracy of steam temperature estimates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Small, but numerous, headwater streams are an important component of our freshwater resources, comprising the majority of stream miles in the United States and contributing to the biodiversity of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.   Temperature is considered a key aspect of water quality in stream ecosystems because it influences important physical, chemical, and biological processes ranging from evaporation rates, dissolved oxygen concentrations, and nutrient cycling to the abundance of culturally and economically important fish and wildlife resources.  In headwater systems the main source of heat to streams is solar radiation from the sun.  The amount of solar radiation that reaches an area of the stream surface depends on its location relative to the position of the sun in the sky (which changes throughout the day and year) and is moderated by shading, such as from terrain and vegetation, and atmospheric conditions, such as haze or clouds, and other factors, such as stream width and depth.  Process-based models of stream temperature focus on the heating and cooling processes that determine temperature and are useful for understanding stream temperatures and exploring how specific changes in environmental conditions, such as the amount of vegetative shading, change stream temperatures.  Obtaining measurements, or generating estimates, of solar radiation for use in stream temperature models is challenging because streams traverse miles across variable landscapes.  Accurately estimating the amount of solar radiation reaching montane, forested headwater streams is especially difficult because steep terrain, variations in the forest canopy, and dynamic clouds can lead to large differences in the amount of solar radiation received by streams over short distances and timeframes.     This doctoral dissertation research improvement award addressed some of these challenges by advancing the use of a method, called the Subcanopy Solar Radiation Model, that generates fine-scale estimates of solar radiation reaching the forest floor, or stream surface, over large areas of heavily vegetated landscapes from airborne LIDAR data (LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR)).  The Subcanopy Solar Radiation Model utilizes a free and open source Geographic Information System (GIS) solar radiation model that allows the incorporation of atmospheric condition (real-sky) effects.  Our research focused on improving the spatio-temporal representation of atmospheric conditions in the solar radiation models and evaluating the accuracy of the model estimates with field-collected measurements of solar radiation in a montane, forested, headwater basin under variable cloud conditions.  The research focused on the summer season, when solar radiation and stream temperatures reach their annual maximums and the deciduous forests of the study area were fully leaved and clouds frequent. A major outcome of this research included the extension of the GIS solar radiation model to incorporate the spatial variations in cloud conditions at higher temporal resolutions and the development of an automated open-source workflow for using publicly available, spatially continuous raster data from geostationary meteorological satellites to compute the model's parameter for cloud effects.  As part of the work we also evaluated the sensitivity of the GIS solar radiation model estimates to the atmospheric parameters.  Other major outcomes included evaluations of the accuracy of solar radiation estimates produced with the GIS solar radiation model and the Subcanopy Solar Radiation Model parameterized for real-sky conditions with climate station data and subcanopy solar radiation measurements collected across a range of forest canopy and cloud conditions in summer in a montane headwater basin.  We also developed lesson plans and exercises that allowed students to explore incorporating atmospheric conditions as well as vegetation and topography into solar radiation models; these lessons underscored the importance of considering variation in solar radiation across and time and locations along streams in stream temperature models.  Work continues to incorporate the variability of solar radiation along streams and over time at higher spatio-temporal resolutions in process-based stream temperature models.
