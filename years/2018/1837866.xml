<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation research improvement project will examine how the rise of volunteer tourism (a vacation with volunteering) alters the work of people connected to development nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Such diversity includes both the social position of the worker and type of work they do. The research will examine how diverse workers interact with volunteers in their efforts to reduce poverty. The research will examine the extent to which such interactions influence NGOs to change their project goals, and will examine the new kinds of work these interactions produce. Volunteer tourism is a rapidly expanding transnational phenomenon, and this study will provide insights into how it transforms volunteers who travel abroad, NGO operations, and development project outcomes. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will also provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will apply a geographic analysis of transnational voluntourism by shifting the scale of development research from the typical macro level analysis of policies or trade to the micro level, with a focus on people, homes, and offices. The study will use an ethnographic approach to examine how daily work by diverse workers at an NGO shape how such organizations function at multiple scales including institutional, interpersonal, and at the project scale. The research will seek answers to the following questions: (1) what is the relationship between labor dynamics, NGO practices, and funding?; (2) what are the experiences of volunteers, workers, and beneficiaries of NGOs?; and (3) how do the labor dynamics and experiences impact both livelihoods and development outcomes of poverty reduction projects?. The student will collect data through a multi-faceted approach including participant observation, semi-structured and informal interviews; content analysis of annual reports; and post-trip email surveys of volunteers. While this research focuses on development projects in Guatemala, it will provide new insights regarding the impacts of American volunteer tourism on people and development NGOs, with implications for improving volunteer tourism and development practices both in the US and elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This doctoral dissertation research improvement project examined how the rise of international development volunteerism alters the work and outcomes of development nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). While the research focused on development projects in Guatemala, the results provide new insights regarding how American volunteers and NGO workers collaborated with Guatemalans to increase economic opportunities for coffee farmers and their families. I call this combination of workers - paid, unpaid, and informal from both Guatemala and the United States - diverse laborers.</p> <p>The project hypothesized that an increase in diverse labors would result both in undervalued and unseen labor, and that this unseen labor, in turn, would alter an organization's goal of reducing poverty. I found that the most unseen work was the care work of the office workers, women tour guides, and coffee farmers, and consequently this undervalued work limited the institution's capacity to achieve the NGO's goal of fixing inequalities in the coffee market. There are three outcomes of this research: contribution to scholarship, nonprofit work, and a research career.</p> <p>This project contributed to, and extended feminist economic scholarship with a term to describe my findings - the care squeeze. Coffee consumers in America, international volunteers, NGO workers, and coffee farmers experience a care squeeze, which I define as the pressure by society and markets to increasingly perform extra care work with the hope that it will bring a better life. The marketplace encourages more care work: for consumers, care is enacted through the purchase of ethical products like direct-trade coffee and service-learning trips; for workers, care is enacted through finding a job that is your passion; and for farmers, care is enacted through the production of the best products. This care takes extra time and labor and is frequently not valued adequately which perpetuates economic inequalities. Unfortunately, there is no economic solution to the care squeeze.</p> <p>The broader impact of this research is that it provides data to NGOs to better understand the labor conditions for workers and to volunteers to understand the inequalities and tensions in their work. The student researcher disseminated findings to stakeholders in Guatemala and the United States.</p> <p>Another outcome of the project is that it provided a promising student with training to establish her career as a researcher. For this research, the doctoral student volunteered with a nongovernmental organization and collected data through a multi-faceted institutional ethnography that included 520 hours of participant observation, 55 semi-structured interviews, 38 informal interviews, 25 email surveys of service-learning students, textual analysis of 6 years of annual reports, and 3 focus groups with 35 people. In total, she interviewed 90 people: 45 men and 45 women. After collection and analysis of the data, the student researcher successfully defended her doctoral dissertation and established herself as an independent researcher with work at a development
