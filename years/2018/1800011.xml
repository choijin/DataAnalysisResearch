<AbstractNarration>This award from the Chemical Synthesis Program in the Division of Chemistry supports the work of Professor Donald A. Watson of the University of Delaware. Professor Watson is developing methods that allow for the synthesis of new organic molecules that contain silicon atoms. These types of molecules have broad application to both chemical synthesis and the development of consumer products such as plastics, non-stick coatings, and personal care products. The methodology being pursued by Professor Watson and his students is enabling the synthesis of these important products from simple, cheap, and readily available starting materials. Professor Watson is also developing an integrated undergraduate research program that provides students from underrepresented groups the opportunity to pursue cutting-edge chemical research. This program is allowing students to better connect with their field of study, offering them increased opportunities for mentorship, and developing their research skills so that they can excel in either graduate school or their future employment. In addition, Professor Watson and his research group are engaging in outreach activities that introduce preschool and early school age children to the chemical sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Donald A Watson and his research group are examining the use of electrophilic silicon reagents (silyl halides and triflates) with carbon nucleophiles using nickel and palladium catalysis. The Watson group is seeking improved methods for the synthesis of hindered alkyl-, allyl-, and vinyl-silanes using straightforward cross-coupling approaches. The goal of this effort is to increase the scope of these transformations compared to known processes, increase reactivity though the design of new catalytic systems, and to explore the mechanisms of the transformations we develop. Professor Watson and his group are also exploring stereocontrol in these reactions using asymmetric catalysts. In total, this program is leading to new, powerful, and useful methods for organosilane synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
