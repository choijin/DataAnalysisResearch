<AbstractNarration>This one-year project is intended to enable the participation of students and early-career scientists from the U.S. at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) sponsored Chapman Conference on Scientific Challenges Pertaining to Forecasting Space Weather Including Extremes, which will be held in the Spring of 2019.  This AGU Chapman Conference will bring together the solar and Geospace communities to review and advance scientific understanding of solar-terrestrial relationships as they relate to forecasting space weather, from moderate to extreme conditions.  Recent years have brought new developments in modeling, observations, and scientific understanding to research that pertains to space weather, as well as renewed interest in space weather extremes. Despite its being a long-sought goal of the Space Physics and Aeronomy (SPA) community, forecasting space weather remains a challenge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This AGU Chapman Conference is aimed at creating new community perspectives that will accelerate space weather forecasting as a scientific discipline and address the barriers that currently exist in its development.  At present, there is an urgent need to develop new approaches for predicting space weather extremes.  The outcome of this Conference is envisioned as guidance for the SPA community on new research directions to pursue that will yield major scientific benefits, as well as the potential for broader benefits to society.  The event organizers emphasize on the active participation and involvement of early-career scientists from the U.S. at the Conference, which is well aligned with the NSF's goal of developing the next generation of STEM scientists.  Furthermore, this AGU Chapman Conference directly addresses Goal 5 of the National Space Weather Action Plan: improve space-weather services through advancing understanding and forecasting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our nearest star, the Sun, is the source of energy that allows life on Earth to exist and thrive. The Sun is also a restless glowing sphere with an electrically charged atmosphere known as a plasma. Magnetic fields on the Sun’s surface are constantly moving and re-orienting, occasionally propelling tons of electrically charged solar atmosphere towards Earth, in what is known as a "coronal mass ejection". Coronal mass ejections reach Earth in approximately one to four days after traveling approximately 93 million miles. When this super-heated, energetic plasma reaches Earth’s protective magnetic shell, a type of weather called "space weather" occurs. Space weather affects Earth’s upper atmosphere and, in more severe cases, can damage satellites and cause electrical blackouts. Space weather creates impacts to technologies our society relies on, so it is of great practical interest to predict when and where significant space weather impacts will occur. Scientists are constantly trying to improve their understanding of space weather and their ability to predict its consequences. Unfortunately, our scientific understanding of space weather, aided in particular using measurements from Earth orbiting satellites, has advanced far more than our ability to predict it.     Scientists often address challenges by organizing conferences where the latest ideas can be presented and discussed. We organized the Chapman Conference on "Scientific Challenges Pertaining to Space Weather Forecasting Including Extremes" specifically to address what we can do to improve our ability to forecast or predict space weather and its impacts.
