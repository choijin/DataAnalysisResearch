<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to address the most common causes of blindness worldwide. Retinal diseases account for vision loss in over 25 million Americans. Worldwide, the prevalence of blindness in children is determined largely by socioeconomic development and availability preventative care. By 2020, the World Health Organization estimates that visual impairment among children age 14 and under will reach almost 19 million, and adults will reach almost 266 million.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes a SMART surgical tool to enable safe and precise delivery of stem cells and genes to help repair and restore the vision of patients with retinal degeneration. Studies have shown cell transplant technology and injectable therapeutics improve vision in afflicted patients. However, due to the delicate nature of retinal tissue, this procedure is challenging to perform successfully. The proposed tool addresses the unmet need for better visualization and targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. Precise delivery of treatment is expected to deliver benefits in preventing and correcting retinal diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Ever had a splinter that was so fine it blended into your skin and you can barely make it out even with a bright light? Holding a pair of fine tweezers, eyes squinting, hand shaking, you tried so hard to aim in the general direction of the splinter so as to yank it out. Multiple tries later, you finally succeed and the ordeal is over. If this is relatable, you&rsquo;ll surely appreciate the level of concentration and stability of the hand it takes for an eye surgeon to perform procedures on transparent tissues that are thinner than hair. Surgery within the eye is highly challenging as most of the eye structure is transparent and highly delicate. Should the procedure go awry, blindness may ensue. The research supported by this award was to design, develop and test a suite of optical sensor-guided sub-retinal injectors directed at enhancing vitreoretinal surgical ability to deliver novel therapeutic drugs safely and precisely into the retinal space. We designed and evaluated several micro-injectors designs, subsequently validated the ability to deliver agents into an animal eye model. This optical guided micro-injection system not only has the potential to overcome difficulties in delicate procedures, expanding access to such procedures for patients, it also enhances researcher&rsquo;s capability to target therapeutic treatments to specific areas of the eye. One day, this technique may help to slow vision degeneration and restore vision for millions of patients worldwide.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/01/2020<br>      Modified by: Lok&nbsp;M&nbsp;Chu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
