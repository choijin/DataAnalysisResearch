<AbstractNarration>The second annual joint Principal Investigators meeting for the Big Data program and the Big Data Hubs and Spokes program provides updates to progress on intellectual objectives and information sharing.  The meeting will promote interaction between the participants in these programs, facilitate collaborations, expose students to the latest research, and situate the programs within the larger big data ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will be a three-day meeting that includes one day dedicated to each program and a third day shared between the two. The agenda includes breakouts, panel discussions, lightning talks, and poster sessions to encourage intellectual engagement across the programs, thus setting conditions for new projects and multi-disciplinary activities. The meeting will produce a report that highlights outcomes for broader dissemination and sharing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Participants were Professor Katya Scheinberg of Lehigh University, Professor Helen Zhang of University of Arizona, and Professor Eli Upfal of Brown University. The session was moderated by Dr. Melissa Cragin of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the Midwest Big Data Hub.  Throughout the day, PIs from the BIGDATA Research Program exhibited posters about their projects and presented their work in lightning talks.  On June 21, which was a joint day for all programs, the keynote talk was given by Professor Michael Franklin of the University of Chicago, titled, "Data Science: A New Discipline or Just Another Venn Diagram?"

The afternoon session featured three breakout sessions. Topics were, "Using Big Data for Social Good", "Big Data and Smart Cities", and "Forming Interdisciplinary Partnerships."
