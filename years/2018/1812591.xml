<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Funds in the amount of $9,000 are requested to support the registration costs for US-based participants, including early career investigators, post docs and graduate students, in the 2018 Polymer Physics Gordon Conference (GRC) and associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) to be held on July 21-22 (GRS) and July 22-27(GRC) at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley MA. The GRC is an important venue for scientific exchange in this interdisciplinary field and will focus on new experimental, simulation and theoretical developments over a range of traditional and emerging topics including polymer phase behavior, polymer nanocomposites, biopolymers, ion and electron-conducting polymers and mechanochemistry in polymers. The associated GRS provides a complementary venue for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to report on their research, interact with senior members and with one another, and to cultivate scientific exchange and collaborations. Efforts at diversity participation are emphasized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
