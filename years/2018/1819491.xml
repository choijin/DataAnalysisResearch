<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research&lt;br/&gt;(SBIR) project is significant as it offers a disruptive new mechanical approach to stroke&lt;br/&gt;treatment. Each year, 795,000 strokes occur in the U.S., 1.7 million strokes in Europe, and&lt;br/&gt;nearly 20.5 million strokes worldwide. This public-private partnership is expected to have an&lt;br/&gt;important positive societal impact on the community by saving lives especially the elderly and&lt;br/&gt;decreasing the economic burden of stroke on the taxpayer. This life-saving device has a unique&lt;br/&gt;value proposition for health-systems with lower inventory costs from a single size device, and&lt;br/&gt;for patients with better vessel re-opening rates, thereby saving brain cells. This textile-based&lt;br/&gt;braided retrievable stent, also known as an embolus retriever or thrombectomy-assist device is&lt;br/&gt;an innovation that will enhance scientific and technological understanding of how personalized&lt;br/&gt;medicine can transform the care of stroke patients in the U.S. and worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to bring to market the industry?s longest blood clot&lt;br/&gt;or embolus retriever for removal of short and long clots that can be customized by the operator&lt;br/&gt;based on each patient?s clot burden. In addition, it is the first textile-based braided retrievable&lt;br/&gt;stent which works well in conjunction with standard catheter-based aspiration systems for stroke&lt;br/&gt;treatment developed in the U.S. that can be personalized to all clot lengths. Stroke is a major&lt;br/&gt;problem causing 5.5 million deaths worldwide and currently there is no cost-effective and&lt;br/&gt;efficacious treatments. The mean lifetime healthcare cost per stroke patient is $140,048. This&lt;br/&gt;textile-based clot retrieval device (aka thrombectomy-assist device) is a cost-effective medical&lt;br/&gt;device that can help save a stroke patient?s life. The methods and approaches of this project is&lt;br/&gt;to compare via pre-clinical tests the ability of a textile-based medical device to re-open vessels&lt;br/&gt;blocked with clots compared with existing approved treatments. The goals and scope of the&lt;br/&gt;research will focus on the ability to rapidly re-open vessels that are blocked by clots. This paves&lt;br/&gt;the way for personalized medicine with a customizable stroke treatment device that can be&lt;br/&gt;tailored to a patient?s clot burden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Around 85% of all strokes are ischemic strokes, that are typically caused by a blood clot causing a large vessel occlusion. An international study on the natural history of ischemic strokes due to large vessel occlusions (LVOs) showed that with medical therapy alone nearly 80% of patients with LVOs were dead or disabled by 90 days after a stroke.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The global stroke burden is enormous. Each year, 795,000 strokes (non-fatal and fatal) occur in the US and 1.7 million strokes in Europe, with a prevalence of 25.7 million strokes worldwide.&nbsp;A novel technology for retrieval of blood clots causing strokes has the potential to significantly improve the lives of these stroke victims.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Management strategies for large vessel occlusive (LVO) stroke have undergone a significant change in the past couple of years alone with a strong preference (Fig. 3) for use of vacuum aspiration systems (majority ~60% prefer vacuum aspiration in both U.S. and EU) for removal of blood clots over retrievable stents which are being used more in an adjunctive role in combination with vacuum aspiration in select patients (~30%). Insera Therapeutics has developed a stroke tool kit that addresses all of this with a cyclical aspiration system that can be used alone (Fig. 4) in majority of the patients (simple technique for ease of use and scaling up) and in the future, in a selected patient population, a braided thrombectomy assist device may be used adjunctively with the cyclical aspiration system (Fig. 5).&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The findings from this project are likely to make a significant impact on personalized medicine for stroke care. Inseras flagship technology, the CLEAR<sup>TM<strong>&nbsp;</strong></sup>Aspiration System, is the industry's first stroke device that leverages varying the vacuum suction pressures to remove stroke-causing blood clots. It is a unique combination of a cyclical vacuum aspiration system (hardware) with algorithms and proprietary data in an iPad app (software) that allows stroke surgeons (neuro-interventionalists) to tailor treatments to each stroke patient thereby improving outcomes both safely (reducing clot fragmentation during retrieval) and effectively (improving complete clot ingestion).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span>The same technology can also be leveraged for multiple clinical indications (Fig. 6).
