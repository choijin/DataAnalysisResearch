<AbstractNarration>Various universities, funding agencies including National Science Foundation, and companies have made extensive efforts to create opportunities for research experiences for undergraduates (REUs). However, at many top undergraduate institutions worldwide, far too few talented students ever attempt systems research, let alone pursue a research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result many of our best students fail to realize their full potential for a research career in computing.  Sadly, as many studies have shown, the fraction of students who choose a research career in Computer Science is even lower among women, underrepresented minorities, first-generation students, and those from low-income backgrounds.  Focusing on Computer Science and specifically in systems, we believe this unfortunate attrition out of a career in research arises largely from a basic misunderstanding and lack of exposure to what Computer Science (CS) research is. Motivated by this observation, and in an effort to address this problem, we propose a new series of annual summer research schools aimed at giving students a brief but intensive exposure to systems research.  The high-level idea is to provide an engaging environment in which students can interact with preeminent researchers from multiple areas of Computer Science, but to do so in a short enough amount of time (on the order of a week) so as to appeal to students who may be skeptical of what research has to offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for supporting the travel and accommodations for students from the United States to attend the summer school (we anticipate 100 participants worldwide).  We believe the program will only be successful if it is able to offer full financial support for travel and accommodation for all participating students, since this will remove a significant barrier for attending for many students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Since 2017, we have conducted a series of annual summer research schools aimed at giving students a brief but intensive exposure to research.  The school website is available at https://cmmrs.mpi-sws.org   The high-level idea is to provide an engaging environment in which students can interact with preeminent researchers from multiple areas of Computer Science, but to do so in a short enough amount of time (on the order of a week) so as to appeal to students who may be skeptical of what research has to offer.   This proposal funded supporting the travel and accommodations for students from the United States to attend the summer school.  In 2019, the NSF grant funded 22 students from the US, of which 7 were female.   The goal of this project was for these talented students to get a sense of what it is like to pursue a research career in computer science.  In addition to lectures, currently scheduled for approximately thirty hours over the week, the school hosts panels on research careers, applying to graduate school, etc.  Along with faculty, students also interact with industry representatives to get a balanced view of their future options.   As part of attendance, we surveyed students about their willingness to pursue research, define career goals, and overcome obstacles.  We conducted a survey before the school began, and followed up with a post-school survey, which had similar questions in order to understand how (or if) the school had changed students' outlook.  Along with the surveys, the students were also given a questionnaire where they could provide anonymous feedback.   By and large, the survey indicates that students very much enjoyed their experience.  We also tried to understand what factors contribute to a young researcher's decision to attend---or not attend---graduate school?  Our survey asked students this question upon entrance and exit from the summer school. 70 students responded (19 women, 51 men), using free text to describe factors in their decision. We then manually aggregated the free text responses into nine categories: ability to do research; improving the prospects for their future career; ability to find the right advisor or university; un- certainty (will I get in, uncertainty about interests), financial concerns (ability to get funding or to improve financial prospects); have a good work-life balance; personal (e.g., leaving family behind); help environment (desire to help the environment through computer science research); the desire to get industrial experience before graduate school; and the desire to gain teaching experience.   We summarize take-away points below, and then provide a more detailed analysis.   - There appears to be a strong correlation between students who wish   to attend graduate school and those who are excited about the   ability to do research.   - In our relatively small sample, female students emphasized research   quality and career op- portunity as the primaryfactors affecting   their decision to attend graduate school. The responses from male   students included a slightly higher emphasis on financial and work-   life-balance concerns.
