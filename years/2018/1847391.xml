<AbstractNarration>The project will synthesize, characterize, and evaluate materials capable of both capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) and catalyzing its conversion to more valuable chemicals. Specifically, capture and conversion at the exhaust of combustion sources (e.g., flue gas at power plants) is an attractive option for CO2 valorization due to its simultaneous economic and environmental benefits. To achieve more efficient CO2 conversion, the project will design novel materials that locate the sorbent and catalytic components in close proximity at the nanoscale. This dual-function approach can potentially replace existing multi-step processes that are more energy intensive and require corrosive CO2 capture and storage technologies. The project also links the research with educational and outreach efforts to raise awareness of environmental consequences of CO2 emissions while encouraging interest in STEM activities amongst young women and underrepresented groups in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will employ controlled synthesis and characterization methods to: (1) develop metal-metal oxide composite nanoparticles containing a high density of interfacial sites, (2) synthesize dual-function materials able to capture and convert CO2 to methanol and higher alcohols, (3) generate CO2 microenvironments around sorbent and catalytic sites for more efficient CO2 capture, and (4) mitigate catalyst deactivation by using a novel wet chemical method. Successful completion of this project will advance the understanding of mechanisms involved in one-pot concentration, capture, and catalytic conversion of CO2 to methanol and other value-added products, a strategic goal for sustainable reduction of CO2 release to the atmosphere. This research will be performed by a diverse team and will be integrated with educational activities. As a Hispanic woman, the investigator has a strong interest in increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in science, and to this goal, the project will provide hands-on experiences to migrant students in Ohio's rural communities and other underrepresented students through the WISDOM, Latino Youth Summit, and EXCEL programs that The University of Toledo offers to Toledo Public Schools. Students will be introduced to chemical reactions and catalysis, and will learn about connections between CO2 emissions and global warming. The investigator will also create a coloring book entitled "Women Scientists Near You," to be distributed at primary schools in Northwest Ohio with the aim to encourage the participation of girls in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
