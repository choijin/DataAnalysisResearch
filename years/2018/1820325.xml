<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop protein purification technology that will provide access to inexpensive, purified proteins for biological and life science applications by removing the purification bottleneck in biopharmaceutical production, and leveraging the innovative breakthroughs in protein engineering and gene editing.  Scale-up of this technology will transform the large-scale purification of biopharmaceuticals and lower prescription drug costs - the most important factor contributing to rising healthcare costs.  The major factor influencing the rising cost of healthcare is the skyrocketing costs of pharmaceuticals - up to 40% of the medical plan cost will be drugs by 2025.  Prescription drug costs are the fastest rising component of healthcare and are contributing to the dramatic increase in healthcare costs.  The worldwide focus of pharmacy and biotechnology is now on biopharmaceutical development and production to address this issue.  Direct benefits of this project include low-cost, use of green reagents, and the absence of heavy metal impurities in the purified protein.  In addition, the development of immobilized enzymes using this technology will open new frontiers in biocatalysis, biosensors, diagnostics and protein delivery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop protein purification kits for small-scale and research-scale research. Bringing these kits to market will enable researchers to further validate the technology on a broader range of proteins in preparation for scale-up for biopharmaceutical production.  Synthetic biology has quickly begun to revolutionize drug discovery and design by providing a better overall molecular understanding of disease.  However, this potential has yet to be fully realized due to the challenges associated with purifying the target recombinant protein from the thousands of naturally-occurring proteins produced by the expression system.  The three specific aims of the project are: 1) validation of protein tag performance for multiple protein classes and expression systems, 2) development of low-cost methods for protein tag removal from purified proteins, and 3) development of solutions for the purification of low-expressing proteins and the parallel purification of small amounts of proteins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Proteios is a leading protein technology company driven to empower life scientists with the ability to synthesize proteins - as reagents or biopharmaceuticals - of high purity and low cost by developing products and services based on proprietary advanced protein technologies.  Proteios is initially focused on providing life science researchers with affordable, easy-to-use and rapid kits to purify recombinant proteins.  When commercialized, the kits will deliver the high yield, purity and activity needed for downstream applications, while utilizing low-cost, green reagents.  The major factor influencing the rising cost of healthcare is the skyrocketing costs of pharmaceuticals - up to 40% of the medical plan cost will be drugs by 2025.  Prescription drug costs are the fastest rising component of healthcare and are contributing to the dramatic increase in healthcare costs.  The worldwide focus of pharmacy and biotechnology is now on biopharmaceutical development and production to address this issue.  Proteios purification technology shows great promise to be scaled up for the purification of biopharmaceuticals during manufacturing and leverage the same advantages of low cost and green reagents.  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has demonstrated the feasibility of applying Proteios' proprietary protein technology for the development of protein purification kits for small-scale and research-scale research through the accomplishment of three specific aims:  Validation of Proteios affinity tag performance for multiple protein classes and expression systems:  this project demonstrated the successful purification of an oligomeric protein and a functional flavin-containing enzyme and that our technology is suitable for the purification of difficult targets;  the project results demonstrate that Proteios protein technology is suitable for purifying proteins expressed in mammalian and yeast cells. Development of low-cost methods for Proteios affinity tag removal from purified proteins:  during this project we developed a low-cost strategy to purify the TEV protease and demonstrated that it is active in solution and in an immobilized form for the removal of N-terminal affinity tags from proteins of interest;  additionally, we demonstrated the OmpT protease can be used to cleave C-terminal affinity tags. Development of solutions for the purification of low-expressing proteins and the parallel purification of small amounts of proteins:  this project developed a low-cost kit for rapidly purifying 100 ug of protein at 90% or greater purity and a surfactant-free kit for purifying 100 ug of a low-expressing protein at greater than 80% purity.   Proteios protein technology has the potential to reduce healthcare costs by eliminating bottlenecks of protein purification in both research and biomanufacturing markets.  In this project, we have demonstrated that our technology is suitable for the purification of proteins from bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cell systems.  We have also built tag cleavage systems that show considerable promise for applications where tag cleavage is desired.  Available systems for affinity tag excision are often expensive and cumbersome, but our platform will reduce enzyme production costs and alleviate those constraints.  The work accomplished during this SBIR Phase I completed or demonstrated the potential for all of the proposed objectives.
