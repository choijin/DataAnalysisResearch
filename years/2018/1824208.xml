<AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of US-based researchers and students in the conference "From Permutation Groups to Model Theory" to be held at the International Centre for the Mathematical Sciences in Edinburgh, Scotland during the week of the 17th to the 21st of September, 2018.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together researchers in three different fields: model theory, group theory and combinatorics, with a touch of computer science as well. Expected topics include: the model theory of pseudofinite groups especially as it relates to approximate subgroups and model theoretic tameness, interactions between computational learning theory and model theory in the area of VC-dimension,  the subject of asymptotic classes and measurable structures, and the theory of Jordan permutation groups.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Details about the conference may be found at http://www.icms.org.uk/permutationgroups.php .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
