<AbstractNarration>The three-day conference will include researchers and other stakeholders working on issues around academic sexual misconduct. This conference is necessary since most work related to sexual misconduct has focused on student-student sexual harassment and there is limited research, knowledge-sharing, and expertise on faculty or staff sexual misconduct in institutions of higher education.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will be the first international forum to share resources, discuss barriers, and identify institutional practices on academic sexual misconduct. The outcomes of this conference include an open-access online repository of resources, conference proceedings, and recommendations for best practices for preventing and addressing faculty or staff sexual misconduct in institutions of higher education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
