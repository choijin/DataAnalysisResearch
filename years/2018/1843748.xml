<AbstractNarration>Abstract  &lt;br/&gt;The proposal supports an international workshop between researchers from the U.S. Japan, Norway, and India on the fundamental scientific issues related to power system resiliency and the integration of distributed energy resources like photovoltaic solar resources, wind energy resources and a variety of storage devices.  Unlike conventional fossil fuel, hydroelectric or nuclear fuel based electricity generation, distributed energy resources are inherently uncertain and could significantly affect power system resiliency. This workshop between researchers from four countries that have experienced significant penetration of renewable resources will examine the critical issues affecting power system resiliency due to the increased penetration of renewable resources and identify key areas of collaborative research to arrive at innovative solutions to enhance power system resiliency and reliability.  The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay, India, will host the two-day workshop.  The invitees to this workshop will be identified and invited by the workshop organizing committee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The increasing integration of spatially distributed renewable resources and storage devices and the modernization of computing and communication systems have contributed to increasing the complexity of interactions between constituent cyber and physical layers of the power system. Nevertheless, the systematic utilization of large data sets to inform distributed decision making-notable opportunities attributable to the generational changes highlighted previously-can improve resiliency, economy, operational efficiency, power quality, and availability. The proposed workshop, will be organized in India in January 2019, will outline the foundational science for power system resiliency and distributed energy management systems. A unique feature of the meeting is that it will bring together researchers from the US, Japan, India, and Norway; in this regard, it is anticipated that technical discussions will result in solutions that have global impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This U.S. NSF award supported the travel of 14 U.S. researchers to a joint U.S, Japan, Norway and India workshop to identify areas of research collaboration between researchers in these four countries.  The workshop was held at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay, India.  The workshop was hosted and locally supported as a part of IIT Bombay's Golden Jubilee celebrations. The major theme of the workshop was Distributed Energy Resources and Managment and Data Sciences for Smart Grids.  The workshop was held from Jan 13 -15, 2019 at IIT Bombay.  The workshop was attended by 14 researchers from the U.S., 20 researchers from Japan, 1 researcher from Norway and 80 researchers from India.  About 40 researchers made brief presentations on their areas of expertise and current research acitivities.  This helped indentify topics and research areas of mutual interest.  The 14 researchers from the U.S. all made presentations on their individual research interests.  Program officers of research funding agencies from the U.S., Japan, and India also made presentations regarding funding guidelines and opportunities for collaborative research funding.  Following the workshop, a team of researchers from Washington State University, Texas A&amp;M and IIT Kanpur collaborated and were succsessful in obtaining a $15M research award from the U.S. DOE and the Indian Department of Science and Technology.  Another team from Arizona State University and IIT Delhi and IIT Dharwad were also successful in winning an award under a new program started by the Indian Ministry of Human Resource Development called Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration.  A visting student from IIT Delhi has spent a semester collaborating with faculty and students at Arizona State University and two faculty members from Arizona State University are visiting IIIT Delhi  and IIT Dharwad to teach and interact with students at both institutions.
