<AbstractNarration>This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program and supported by SBE's Political Science program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Bruce Bimber at the University of California, Santa Barbara this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the role of implicit and explicit racial priming within American state legislative campaigns. Both conservative and liberal social movements have increasingly integrated race-based identity claims into their agendas. While existing literature has examined the impact of racial rhetoric within national politics, little work has been done to assess the impact on state politics. This project will explore how this growing racial divide has impacted policy conversation within the American States by developing an expansive data set that catalogues state legislative campaign content by issue arena and rhetorical frame. In doing so, this project aims to inform efforts to counteract racial rhetorical frames and improve democratic engagement for all citizens. This dataset will also provide a critical data source for developing projects for future research on state politics, public policy, political campaigns, and race. Finally, by processing campaign statements into issue coverage summaries for state legislative matchups, this project aims to provide accessible information to better inform voters in lower information elections of a candidate's willingness to engage with salient issues.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to fully investigate racial rhetoric, this project will employ web-scraping techniques to preserve state legislative candidate campaign websites from 2014-2018. Websites provide a holistic approach to the analysis of campaign rhetoric as candidates possess extensive control over the content of a website while space and costs issues are at a minimum. A random sample of candidate issue statements and self-reported legislative records will be catalogued and coded by trained coders according to issue arena and content. This will provide a critical training dataset that will be used to classify the remaining statements according to issue arena using machine learning classification algorithms. The final dataset will provide an unprecedented account of state legislative campaign rhetoric by providing: 1) Character-counts that measure dedicated issue space by topic and provide a critical metric for issue salience and priming; 2) A comprehensive list of issue statements relevant to a particular policy arena that will be used to examine statements for implicit and explicit racially driven framing; 3) A complete collection of website images that provide evidence for visual priming. This data will provide evidence for variation in issue selection as a product of candidate qualities and constituent demographics, specifically racial heterogeneity of district constituents and neighboring districts. In addition, specific policy arenas, including welfare/public assistance, criminal justice, and immigration, can be examined for variation in implicit and explicit racial rhetoric across states and districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The specific goal of this project was to investigate the impact of the shifting national rhetoric regarding race on state politicians. More broadly, the project aimed to contrast the rhetoric of national and state level politicians, particularly in light of shifts in partisan rhetoric associated with polarization. To accomplish this goal, we created a digital archive of state legislative campaign websites for 2018 and 2019 to build upon our existing archives for 2014 and 2016. The results of this data collection provided insights into the field of subnational campaign communication, that up until now, had largely been ignored by political scientists. First and foremost, the uneven distribution of candidate websites revealed serious discrepancies in citizen access to candidate information across states and districts. We found that candidates in lower population-density districts and in districts that lacked competitive elections were less likely to publish their policy stances on websites. The fact that these districts were also less likely to have local news coverage due to declines in print media coverage revealed a potentially gap in accountability for state politicians.</p> <p>In addition, by comparing candidate issue priming across the United States, we found that candidates in Western and Southern states were more likely to discuss healthcare, while candidates in Western states were more likely to discuss the environment and energy, independent of the candidate?s partisanship. Further, we found significant variation in rhetoric on these topics, with Western Democrats being willing to engage in the promotion of the Second Amendment, while Western Republicans were more willing to acknowledge and engage in climate change. We also found significant partisan variation across all regions relating to the issues of education, economics, and state infrastructure. This significant variation might present a serious challenge to negative partisanship amongst citizens. Variation provides opportunities to recognize common policy goals with opposition partisans and undermines the impression of homogeneity associated with polarization. However, sparsity of information undermines this, resulting in voters failing to recognize the presence of partisan defection by local public officials.</p> <p>The combination of these finding led to an expansion of the project into two new arenas. First, we began an exploration of the prevalence of national partisan rhetoric that explicitly aimed to regulate and police party messages amongst state-level partisans. Through a sentiment analysis of presidential press briefings, we found that presidential efforts to control media messages increased under the Trump Administration. To build on this, we are working to examine presidential and administrative tone when specifically referring to co-partisans and partisan opposition. In addition, we explored public perception of state-level variation through a survey instrument designed to invoke both regional and partisan biases. Preliminary findings indicate that, in the absence of political information, geographic biases help inform citizen perceptions of state policy. However, when political information is introduced it quickly supersedes and replaces these geographical biases. The combination of these three research trajectories helps to build a better picture of not only subnational variation in partisan agendas, but their constraints and their ability to influence the public.</p> <p>The broader impacts of these projects are clear in light of the growing partisan polarization and negative partisanship that increasingly divide our nation. First and foremost, our collection of state-level campaign websites from 2018 has been deposited in a public, easy to access, repository found at: <a href="https://partner.archive-it.org/1482/collections/11317">https://partner.archive-it.org/1482/collections/11317</a>. Making this publicly available allows citizens to revisit the promises made by their candidates. This can increase accountability and encourage citizens to reevaluate incumbents in light of historical performance. In addition, it preserves critical information about state campaigns that can be used by regional and local media outlets that lack the resources to engage in intensive investigation of candidates independently. As the project continues to develop, we aim to establish a clearer web presence with easier access to not only archived websites but meta-data designed to reveal differences and similarities across states that extend beyond partisan politics. In addition to broad community outreach, the archive of campaign texts has produced an abundant resource for undergraduates, graduate students, and early career academics to engage in research at the subnational level. These subnational governing bodies have a disproportionate impact on historically marginalized communities. This data presents a unique opportunity to address issues important to these communities, including policing and criminal justice, social welfare policies, and civil rights. It also provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the impacts of descriptive representation and community demographics at a finer scale than is available when evaluating candidate for national office. By making this data available to citizens and scholars alike, this project aims to renew focus on state-level variation in partisan policy goals and help to counteract growing negative partisanship and polarization around national partisan agendas.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/23/2020<br>      Modified by: Joshua&nbsp;L&nbsp;Meyer-Gutbrod</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1808962/1808962_10553592_1603465455231_FigCandidateProportions--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1808962/1808962_10553592_1603465455231_FigCandidateProportions--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Proportion of Partisans Mentioning Issues (2016)"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1808962/1808962_10553592_1603465455231_FigCandidateProportions--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Proportion of Partisans Mentioning Issues (2016)"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Bars show the percentage of candidates mentioning a particular issue nationally.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Joshua Meyer-Gutbrod</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Joshua&nbsp;L&nbsp;Meyer-Gutbrod</div> <div class="imageTitle">Proportion of Partisans Mentioning Issues (2016)</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1808962/1808962_10553592_1603465710677_FigHurdlePredRefs--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1808962/1808962_10553592_1603465710677_FigHurdlePredRefs--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Predicted Issue Counts by Party and Region (2016)"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1808962/1808962_10553592_1603465710677_FigHurdlePredRefs--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Predicted Issue Counts by Party and Region (2016)"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Bars show the predicted total of space dedicated to a particular issue for all region-party combinations from a hurdle regression.
