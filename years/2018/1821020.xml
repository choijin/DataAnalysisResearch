<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable a new portable power source with unprecedented energy density, which could have transformative effects on military and commercial portable/autonomous systems. For example, a portable power generator for soldiers using the proposed technology would result in a 50-75% weight reduction on a 72-hour mission, meaning soldiers could bring more water and ammo or reduce chance of injury due to weight. The proposed technology could also extend the operation of drones and other unmanned vehicles on land, air, and water. Currently these applications are almost exclusively powered by batteries, despite hydrocarbon fuel being 60 times more energy dense. The proposed technology could also be used in a number of commercial applications from emergency response and disaster relief, remote sensing, and energy access in emerging markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is a new approach to thermophotovoltaics, using a photonic crystal selective emitter, that enables practical fuel to electricity conversion in the 1-100 W range.  The technology works by converting fuel to electricity using heat and light as intermediaries. Specifically, hydrocarbon combustion heats a photonic crystal emitter to incandescence, leading to thermal radiation which drives specialized photovoltaic cells to generate electricity. Currently, there is no effective power source for applications requiring 1-100 Watts of electricity for extended duration, a space where demand is burgeoning. This technology would enable ultraportable, reliable, and silent energy generation, particularly for applications that do not have access to conventional power sources.</AbstractNarration>
