<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this PFI project is related to the development of a highly reliable, low maintenance, low noise magnetic gearbox (MG) for electromechanical energy conversion applications.   A MG can create speed change without any physical contact and therefore no gear lubrication is required.  A MG has inherent overload protection capabilities as well as no backlash. By eliminating most mechanical losses MGs offer the potential for increased efficiency whilst providing a longer service life than its mechanical counterpart.  This PFI will focus on translating the MG technology towards commercial application in the areas of renewable energy generation and robotic actuation.  There is a growing need for a new power conversion approach that are more efficient and more reliable than existing mechanical gearboxes and direct-drive generators. For instance, one barrier to increasing the use of wind power generation is the reliability of the drivetrain.  By developing a new type of MG, the reliability and efficiency of the drivetrain could be greatly improved, whilst still being compact in size.  This would thereby reduce the levelized cost of power generation.  In addition, robotic actuators are increasingly being sort that are more reliable and have compliant capabilities, a MG offers such capabilities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims to demonstrate that a multistage MG has the potential to attain a competitive torque-to-mass ratio and torque-to-volume ratio with traditional gearboxes whilst also being more reliable, efficient and quieter than existing mechanical gearboxes.  The proposed project will utilize 3-D printing to increase the rate at which design improvements can be made to a unique Halbach rotor MG typology.  A series of MGs will be tested in order to refine and develop a greater understanding of the MG capabilities relative to their mechanical counterparts.  Using prototype devices, a direct cost-performance analysis of the MG technology relative to equivalent mechanical gearbox counterparts will be completed for the first time. The demonstration that a MG can be performance competitive with a mechanical gearbox, whilst also have a significantly longer design life, could transform the way in which power conversion is accomplished.  A MG could therefore find uses in a myriad of applications throughout society. The graduate and undergraduate student involved with this project will receive technology translation and entrepreneurship experiences through the prototype development and commercialization activities associated with this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Mechanical gears are useful because they allow high-torque, low-speed inputs to be changed into low-torque and high-speed outputs which can thereby allow a motor or generator to be utilized that is smaller and operates at higher speed. This reduces the cost of providing torque and this is why mechanical gears are used in a wide range of consumer and industrial applications. Mechanical gearbox designs have reached a plateau and component design engineers are increasingly evaluating other technologies to improve power transfer performance, reduce maintenance cycles, eliminate lubricants, reduce acoustic emissions, and decrease the size compared to mechanical gearboxes or direct-drive alternatives. The increasing demand for highly reliable renewable energy generator drivetrains for wind turbines and new types of marine hydrokinetic (MHK) ocean generators has created a demand for new technology that is lightweight, robust, and ultrareliable.     Magnetically geared motors and generators offer a new way of improving the performance of existing generator and drive motor technology in a myriad of high-torque applications that require ultra-high reliability. A magnetically geared motor can create speed change without any physical contact and therefore no gear lubrication is required. The magnetic speed change results in a magnetic gear operating with an inherent overload protection capability. By eliminating most mechanical losses magnetic gears can operate at increased operational efficiency as well as providing a significantly longer service life compared to their mechanically geared alternatives.     This project focused on designing and refining magnetic gears so that they could be moved closer to end-use customer adoption.  A new type of coaxial magnetic gear configuration was tested that utilized a modulation laminated rotor structure and Halbach rotor magnets.  The design was shown to be relatively easy to assemble and achieved an experimental tested torque density of 279Nm/L.  The new design was published in a conference and final results will be published in a journal paper.     By developing this magnetic gear technology and utilizing it in wind and ocean generator applications the costs of renewable power generating should be lowered. This will thereby increase renewable power generation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The use of magnetic gears in other applications, such as robotics could increase their efficiency performance and provide a more compliant actuator technology. This could enable robotics to be used in more areas where human interaction is necessary.          Last Modified: 12/31/2020       Submitted by: Jonathan Bird]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
