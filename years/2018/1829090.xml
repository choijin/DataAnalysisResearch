<AbstractNarration>This award will support attendance by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers at the FASEB Conference on Dynamic DNA Structures in Biology to be held July 8-13, 2018 at St. Bonaventure University, Olean, NY.  This is an evolving field that continues to bring together researchers with complementary interests in nucleic acid chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, and genome architecture and function.  The meeting will include keynote lectures by two leaders in the field. Formal sessions will include a combination of plenary lectures, talks and poster sessions to encourage sharing of latest research results.  Informal opportunities will be provided for junior researchers to learn from established investigators at a 'meet the speakers' lunch and a career discussion with senior researchers from both academia and industry.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DNA molecules are highly dynamic and can adopt a variety of conformations that play important roles in the function and regulation of genes and genomes.  Recent advances in the field--including gene editing and the role played by chromatin and the DNA damage response in transcription-associated genome instability--will be highlighted in this meeting.  Other topics for discussion will be chromosome breaks and genomic rearrangements; structure-induced genome instability; replication through roadblocks; transcription-induced mutations; expandable DNA repeats and human disease; DNA repair and rearrangement, and G-quadruplexes.  The meeting will bring provide an excellent forum for junior investigators, including those from underrepresented groups, to hear about latest research in the U.S. and abroad, to meet and talk with leaders in the field, and to have an opportunity to present and receive feedback on their own research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
