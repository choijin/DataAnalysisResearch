<AbstractNarration>The 2018 "Progress in Clinical Motor Control I: Neurorehabilitation" (PCMC1) Conference will be held from July 23-25, 2018, on the Pennsylvania State University, University Park campus. This conference will provide a premier interdisciplinary platform for researchers, practitioners and educators to hear from top scholars on recent research and technological innovations, as well as practical challenges in integrating these advances into the field of neurorehabiliation. One focus of the conference - Human / Machine Interactions within the field of neurorehabilitation - is well-aligned with the objectives of the National Science Foundation's "Mind, Machine and Motor Nexus" (M3X) program. This project will support a workshop to be held on day 1 of the PCMC1 conference. This multidisciplinary workshop will provide educational/mentorship activities introducing graduate students in the field of Motor Control to scientific leaders spanning the engineering, basic science, and clinical domains. This workshop will enable student/faculty discussion on career development, grantsmanship, and scientific planning in a personalized format. By cultivating professional relationships between graduate students and senior scientists with whom they might not otherwise engage, this project will serve the national interest and advance the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health. As such, the intellectual merit and broader impacts of this workshop are well aligned with the mission of the NSF. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project plans to support eighteen graduate students and six faculty in a workshop designed to foster career development for the next generation of engineers and scientists advancing understanding of human/machine interactions within the field of Neurorehabilitation. Students will be selected from among those who submit abstracts. Selection will be based both on scientific merit and an attempt to obtain broad diversity of participation. Mentors will be selected from conference speakers to have diversity of representation in terms of content expertise, gender, and racial/ethnic background. Participation in conferences is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience; the proposed workshop will augment that experience by exposing students to senior researchers and leading-edge work in their fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The objectives of the Senior Scientist Meet and Greet were:  To facilitate small introductions and intellectual conversations between graduate students and scientists who are leaders in the field. To foster scientific conversations in an informal forum where students can more freely engage in creative and critical thinking, than often possible in larger and more formal events. To provide a high degree of attention and feedback from the scientists to the students than what is possible in busy and large scientific conferences.  To facilitate networking and professional relationship building between students and scientists, and to have this serve as a scientific spring board for the students? research trajectory. This event will spur future discussions between the student and scientist, and benefit the student as they embark on collaborative projects and post-doctoral fellowships.    The conference session enabled graduate students to meet with a cohort of senior researchers to discuss science, career planning, network for upcoming postdocs, grantsmanship, and other related topics. The objectives of the workshop strongly aligned with the objectives of NSF?s Mind, Machine and Motor Nexus (M3X) Program, by bringing together 34 scientists across engineering, clinical, and neuroscience domains in an informal session on the morning of July 23rd(day 1 of the conference).
