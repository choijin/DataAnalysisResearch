<AbstractNarration>The 2018 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC), currently celebrating its 34th year, is a top-tier academic security conference that averages about 250-300 highly skilled security professional and student attendees per year. ACSAC regularly brings together the foremost minds in academic, governmental and commercial computer security to address the most pressing problems in applied computer security, as well as discuss seminal works in information security. In addition to the technical papers, the conference program will include keynotes by distinguished speakers, tutorials, case studies, panels, a poster session, and works-in-progress talks. This year's Hard Topic Theme is Big Data for Security. Attendees also have the opportunity to participate in affiliated workshops on various topics in security. This project provides travel support for 10-15 students and thus helps build the next generation of cybersecurity professionals by facilitating interaction of students with experts in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
