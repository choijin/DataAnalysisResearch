<AbstractNarration>Deep-space images from the Hubble Space Telescope reveal the most distant galaxies in the Universe. These objects are groups of thousands to millions of stars like our sun. They are so distant that light from their stars has taken billions of years to reach us. Most galaxies this distant are visible in the deepest images from Hubble, but not all. Some galaxies contain a lot of dust, making them more difficult to see because the dust obscures starlight. Starlight heats the dust, which then re-radiates that energy at millimeter wavelengths. These dusty galaxies form stars very rapidly, and are important to our understanding of how stars form. Little is known about how common dusty galaxies were in the first few billion years after the Big Bang. This project will use all available data at millimeter wavelengths to estimate how common they were during those early times. This is important to our fundamental understanding of how the first galaxies formed. This project will also host students from under-represented minority backgrounds in astronomy research through the Texas Astronomy Undergraduate Research for Under- represented Students (TAURUS) program at UT Austin. The goal of the research program is to retain these excellent students in STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking census of the cosmic history of star-formation is a key goal of galaxy evolution surveys. However, measurements to date, particularly at the highest redshifts, are almost exclusively determined from unobscured star-formation tracers in the rest-frame UV/optical. However, galaxies are increasingly obscured by dust emission at higher stellar masses (&gt; 10^10 Msun) and star-formation rates (&gt; 50 Msun/year), such that UV/optical-inferred SFRs can be underestimated by factors of 10-100x. The goal of this proposal is to use all of the collective FIR through millimeter data in a newly developed backward evolution model to: (1) statistically constrain the total integrated IR galaxy luminosity function out to high-redshifts, (2) measure the AGN contribution to the total cosmic infrared background, (3) provide non-clustered predictions for submm source multiplicity, and (4) use simulations to motivate future large (sub)mm surveys for optimization at high-redshifts. This project will draw in undergraduate research scholars from under-represented backgrounds to UT Austin for the summer to conduct research on this topic through the TAURUS program. TAURUS focuses on the long-term retention of highly-motivated under-represented students in STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
