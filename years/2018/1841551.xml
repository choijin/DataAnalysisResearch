<AbstractNarration>Stable, well-functioning economies have the potential to allow nations to better serve the needs of their citizens. They also create an environment in which neighboring countries, such as the United States, can grow and prosper. One of the driving forces behind economic stability and performance is thought to be good governance, particularly significant fiscal decentralization. But cross-country analyses of the effects of decentralization on economic development and corruption reduction have produced contradictory findings. The result is that both theoretical and practical understanding of what promotes good governance and, thereby, economic stability and development, has lagged. The research supported by this award addresses this policy challenge through an in-depth, locally comparative, ethnographic investigation of the effects of a case of recent fiscal decentralization. The research is important because if the links between decentralization and good governance can be identified through an intensive study of a single case, findings can then be generalized to improve theoretical understanding and policy globally.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted by anthropologist Dr. Jean Ensminger (California Institute of Technology). The researcher has identified Kenya as an excellent site for this study because the country has recently implemented a strong version of decentralization. The new governmental structure divides the nation into 47 counties each with a governor who controls significant fiscal resources. Theory that links decentralization to better economic performance in democratic countries rests on two unproven assumptions: that citizens will have improved access to information so that they can monitor the performance of their leaders, and that citizens value performance above other factors such as ethnic favoritism and patronage. This research tests these assumptions and theoretical predictions. Because of the inconsistent findings of quantitative studies of this problem, the researcher will take a largely qualitative and inductive approach. The researcher will collect data with a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, including: interviews with governors, particularly those identified by civil society leaders as reformist; interviews with constituents and county-level government officials; analyses of longitudinal county-level records, voting records, and publicly available polling data; and analyses of reports of anti-corruption and audit bodies. Findings from the research should help policy makers understand whether a strong model of fiscal decentralization can offer a path forward for more effective policy. Results will also support better theoretical understanding of what promotes good governance and well-functioning economic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Eager grant was designed to explore the impact of decentralization upon the quality of governance in Kenya using both qualitative and quantitative methods.  Kenya passed a constitution in 2010 that created a new tier of county government with powerful executive governors controlling significant federally devolved resources.  A number of existing theories are consistent with the prediction that decentralization should have a positive impact upon corruption and governance.  Kenya is an ideal case study for this research because it is a systemically corrupt country, and because it implemented a particularly strong form of fiscal decentralization, which to date has seen no erosion.     Intellectual Merit   The existing literature on governance highlights three perspectives that we would expect to interact with decentralization:  access to information about the performance of politicians, ethnic preferences in voting and patronage hiring, and the potential for lower tiers of government to serve as competitive platforms that aspiring national leaders use to demonstrate their competence.   It seems intuitively likely that voters have better information about the performance of their local leaders than they do about national leaders.  However, this research suggests that the scarcity of honest media at the county level may result in less credible information about local political leaders than exists for national leaders.  Without good information, it is more difficult to discriminate between good and bad leadership performance, which is a precondition for holding poorly performing leaders accountable at the polls.   Ethnic voting is prevalent and well researched in Kenya.  One might expect that ethnic preferences for voting and patronage hiring would be less of an issue at the local level because many counties are relatively ethnically homogeneous.  What this research finds, however, is that pressures for patronage allocation extend to micro partitions by clan and regional allocation.  What people are seeking is proximate access to the revenue streams controlled by county employees.  As a consequence, pressure for allocation based upon narrow territorial parameters leads to a poor match between county job candidates and qualifications, often to an extreme degree.  This results in incompetent management and efficiency losses that penalize the poorest and least educated counties the most.  Further, it empowers county officers with virtual impunity because of the strength of the ethnic/regional base behind them.  As a consequence, embezzlement rates are exceptionally high.  Even the best-intentioned governors may not be able to control their staff.   This research does find evidence supporting the proposition that governors compete for national office based upon their performance at the county level.  However, the same informational problems noted above may make it difficult for people across the nation to evaluate the credibility of their actual performance.     Broader Impacts   The quality of governance is related to the level of economic performance.  It is well understood that corruption is a factor in the failure of successful governance.  Many structural and institutional solutions have been proposed and implemented to address corruption and poor governance.  Kenya?s decentralization is one such example.  Ongoing reforms in procurement processes are another.  There is evidence that institutional changes make a difference, but it is less obvious that they are solving the problem.  Kenya?s corruption scores in recent years have been worsening.   The Kenyan constitution anticipated the problem of corrupt governors by creating robust checks and balances at the county level.  The county assembly (elected from each of the geographic wards in the county) has the power to impeach the governor, and must approve both the county officers and the governor?s budget.  Coupled with the entrenched culture of corruption that prevails in Kenya, this structure has led to an impasse that blocks hiring and development expenditures for many governors up to two years.  Members of the assemblies are not the only ones with their hands out, but their powers make them particularly difficult to refuse.  One highly successful governor in Kenya chose not to give in to the assembly.  Instead, he went to the villages and spent months successfully lobbying the people against the assembly.  Many governors have attempted to resist the demands of the assembly, but given in when they found all progress stalled.  The results of this preliminary study suggest that winning the hearts and minds of the people may be the only way to defeat the culture of corruption, albeit a highly risky strategy from a political stand point.
