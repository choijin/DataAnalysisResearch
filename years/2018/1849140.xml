<AbstractNarration>The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Symposium on Cloud Computing 2018 (SoCC '18) brings together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners interested in cloud computing.   ACM SoCC is the premier conference on cloud computing and a dynamic and comprehensive program for publication, education, and interaction.  The program includes research and industrial papers, poster sessions, and keynote talks by leaders in academia and industry. The scope of SoCC is broad and encompasses diverse data management and systems topics such as software as a service, virtualization, scalable cloud data services, and data management and analytics at scale. The intellectual merit of the proposal is to share scientific information. This includes the opportunity for students to showcase their research results, learn about the cutting-edge research conducted by others, and interact with experts at a premier cloud computing conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SoCC provides a unique opportunity for students to share their knowledge and experience with internationally recognized researchers from both academia and industry. The keynotes and many paper/poster presentations provide students with invaluable learning opportunities, as well as exposure to the latest research results and the opportunity to discuss these results with the authors. It also offers an excellent environment for students to interact with industry leaders (from Microsoft, Google, IBM, Oracle, Salesforce, VMware, Facebook, and others) during regular program sessions. These opportunities will have a long-lasting impact on the future career of the participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF award provided student travel grants to attend the 2018 ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing (SoCC), the ninth in an established series of symposia that bring together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners interested in cloud computing.  The conference was held in Carlsbad, California on October 11-13, 2018.  After a careful selection process that evaluated each student's need/expenses, essay, CV, authorship in SoCC'18, and diversity, 24 students were awarded travel grants from NSF of between $200-$1000 to attend SoCC'18, including 9 women.    SoCC'18 featured a dynamic and comprehensive program for publication, education, and interaction. In particular, the program included research and industrial papers, poster sessions, and keynote talks by leaders in academia and industry. The scope of SoCC is broad and encompasses diverse data management and systems topics such as software as a service, virtualization, scalable cloud data services, and data management and analytics at scale.      All these activities provided a unique opportunity for students to share their knowledge, experience, and research works with internationally recognized researchers from both academia and industry. The conference offered an excellent environment for participants (especially students) to interact with industry leaders during regular program sessions. These opportunities will have a long-lasting impact on the future career of the participants.  The travel grants provided the opportunity for students to showcase their research results, learn about the cutting edge research conducted by others, and interact with experts at a premier cloud computing conference.     Moreover, the travel grants helped train and develop the future generation of leaders and workforce in the increasingly critical field of cloud computing and data services, as well as providing outreach to under-represented groups to increase their participation in the field.
