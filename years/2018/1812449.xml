<AbstractNarration>This grant provides financial support for the workshop entitled: Towards Rigorous Verification &amp; Validation of Predictive Computational Models in Mechanics of Materials to be held on July 27, 2018 in New York, New York. As the role of predictive computational modeling for reducing time and cost of new mechanical structures, materials systems, and manufacturing technologies continues to grow, the concomitant use of verification and validation (V&amp;V) as part of the modeling process has not kept pace. Verification ensures that the computational model accurately represents the underlying mathematical model and its solution, whereas validation determines the degree to which the computational model represents physical reality within the intended scope of the model. Therefore, V&amp;V is a crucial cog in maintaining the viability and advantages of predictive modeling, which in turn advances U.S. national security and economic competitiveness, and potentially improves the quality of life, health, and well-being of the society. In this workshop, pathways that facilitate more accurate and advanced predictive modeling and simulation through V&amp;V will be discussed. It is also expected that it will serve as the avenue to foster improved, meaningful collaborations among modelers and experimentalists from the stakeholder communities. Funding from this grant will support planning activities, production of a report, and travel of invited participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this one-day workshop, leading experts in the mechanics of materials, materials science and engineering, manufacturing, mathematics, and related disciplines will convene in an interactive setting to discuss ways to stimulate strong progress towards widespread experimental validation (and mathematical verification) of predictive models and to provide recommendations for specific actionable next steps. The intent is for these tactical recommendations to start galvanizing the community, and provide staging points for future efforts. Outcomes of the project will also include recommendations for knowledge and tool development that are expected to provide opportunities not only for practitioners, but also for students, postdoctoral researchers, and educators. All findings will be captured in a final report that will be disseminated across academia, government, and industry.</AbstractNarration>
