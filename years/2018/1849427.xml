<AbstractNarration>Poorer households in the U.S. are more likely to be eligible for means-tested federal welfare programming. Prior research has shown that many safety net programs have important positive effects on the health and well-being of those who receive them. Yet, take-up of such programs among the eligible population is incomplete and tends to be dampened by a variety of factors such as stigma, hassle costs, and lack of information. However, particularly among poor, program-eligible Hispanic households, the federal government also plays a major role in their lives through immigration enforcement. Indeed, numerous media accounts have reported that increased vigilance for non-citizens has led individuals who are eligible for enrollment in such programs (e.g. U.S.-born and naturalized citizens) to not sign up or to drop out of government programs. Such behaviors, purportedly driven by fear of "outing a relative," are highly policy relevant and could have important effects for Hispanic and non-Hispanic households alike.  Understanding whether the dual role of federal authority as both enforcer and benefactor influences the take-up of decisions of vulnerable households is critical to developing policies that fulfill the government's mandates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will examine the staggered roll-out of a relatively novel and far-reaching immigration enforcement program, Secure Communities, which led to a massive increase in detainers and deportations for both violent and non-violent immigrant offenders. Secure Communities provides ideal quasi-experimental variation since the Hispanic community was overwhelmingly affected and the timing of the rollout was based on technical factors, lending itself to a triple difference-in-differences empirical methodology. This approach allows the researchers to compare program take-up for Hispanic households within a given location to take-up for non-Hispanic whites and blacks, net of counties that had not yet activated, versus after Secure Communities activation.  To assess whether any isolated effects on the take-up of programs by Hispanic Americans are mediated by fear of revealing non-citizens in their networks, the researchers have assembled data on the spatial distribution of mixed-status families, survey data on deportation fear, and Google Trends data on searches for deportation-related terms. Lastly, the researchers assess whether the effects of enforcement on take-up are buffeted in areas that have declared sanctuary status.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
