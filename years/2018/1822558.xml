<AbstractNarration>This grant provides travel support for 15-20 US-based students to attend Crypto 2018 - the annual International Cryptology Conference - sponsored by IACR (International Association of Cryptologic Research) in cooperation with the Computer Science Department of the University of California, Santa Barbara. Since the first conference in 1981, Crypto has been held in Santa Barbara, California, and has become the flagship conference in cryptology, attracting researchers from all over the world. The scope of the work discussed and presented at the conference ranges from the theoretical foundation of cryptology to applications and the implementation of cryptographic schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funding will provide students who otherwise would not be able to attend the conference with the opportunity to discuss current research topics with world-class researchers in cryptography, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

CRYPTO is the Annual International Cryptology Conference, sponsored by IACR (International Association of Cryptologic Research), in cooperation with the Computer Science Department of the University of California, Santa Barbara. The first CRYPTO was held in 1981, and since then CRYPTO has been IACRs flagship conference, attracting researchers in the field of cryptology from all over the world.  Crypto 2018 was the 38th International Cryptology Conference. It was held at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) August 19-23 2018. In 2018, Crypto was preceded by three days of workshops on various topics.      Research papers presented at the CRYPTO conference cover, but are not limited to the following subjects: Symmetry Encryption, Public-key Encryption, Digital Signatures, Cryptographic Hash Functions, Authentication, Key Distribution, Security Protocols, Pseudo-randomness, Secret Sharing, Zero Knowledge, Multiparty Computation, Cryptanalysis, Applications of Cryptographic Schemes.         37 students (17 of which are females) affiliated with US universities have been given travel grants to attend Crypto 2018. An average stipend was $488 per student.     Students had the opportunity to interact with many of the luminaries in the field and peer students during conference presentations, as well as in more informal settings including a reception and banquet dinners.
