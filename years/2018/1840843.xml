<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is as diverse as the laser technology itself.  Lasers have become the true facilitator of the data-based society.  It is tool of choice for future smart factories and on-demand manufacturing.  It serves as the fundamental building block of optical sensing systems used to collect large volumes of critical data to be used for decision making in every facet of society.  The myriad of new applications for laser systems echoes the same demand ? higher power.  The bottleneck in the power generation is often the capability of optical components of the laser to withstand the power without degradation.  So the greater potential of lasers can be unleashed if there would be a way to break through the power handling capability of laser components starting with the nonlinear optical crystals indispensable in creating these powerful energy sources.  This research project is precisely designed to address this need and the successful completion of this project would enable the next generation of miniaturized electronic devices, expand our horizon of biological imagery and precision surgery, and explore our universe with instruments that are currently confined to our laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project targets the most common material used to generate high power visible and UV light ? Lithium Triborate (LBO) crystal.  Able to handle power density up to 45GW/cm2, LBO is currently the material of choice for high energy industrial lasers.  However, optical surfaces where the light enter and exit LBO often get damaged well before the actual bulk material.  Traditional dielectric anti-reflective (AR)  coatings on these surfaces are typically made using a limited selection of materials of lower damage threshold in a process highly susceptible to contamination, resulting in significantly lower damage threshold than the bulk LBO crystal.  In this proposal, state-of-the-art surface-texturing processes on LBO will be developed to eliminate the use of these dielectric films while still providing the necessary AR functionality.  A variety of processes and materials on LBO surfaces will be attempted and studied with resulting surfaces tested for absorption and damage threshold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ High power visible and UV lasers are now used ubiquitously in critical applications in the fields of industrial manufacturing, scientific research, medical procedures, defense and aerospace.  The requirement for the output power of these laser continue to increase while system footprint shrinks.  This general trend creates an urgent need for laser components to withstand increasing intensive of light without damage.  A general requirement for these components in the path of light is to enable the light to pass through with minimal loss.  Currently, anti-reflective (AR) dielectric coatings are applied to the optical surfaces (the surfaces through which light passes) to reduce the typical 4% reflected light loss per surface down to as low as 0.05%.  However, these AR coatings are prone to laser-induced damage as dielectric material used in the coating breaks down under the intensity of light often much faster than the bulk material.  Another approach to this problem is to create a physically diffusive nano-sized structures on the optical surfaces of these components to cut down the reflective loss without the addition of any dielectric material.  In this research project, this alternative approach is explored on a nonlinear optical material called Lithium Tri-borate (LBO).  As most solid-state lasers emit in near IR wavelength around 1064nm, LBO is used to convert near IR laser light down to the visible(380-750nm) and near UV (300-380nm) spectrum.  Visible and UV wavelengths are useful for microfabrication of a variety of important industrial materials used in the modern electronic devices.  Bulk LBO crystal can withstand laser density of 45GW/cm2, which is a magnitude higher than any AR coating currently available.  A randomly diffusing nano-sized AR structures created on optical surfaces of LBO crystal could allow light with much higher power density to pass through the crystal surfaces without damaging.  The successful development of this fabrication process could better sustain the rapidly increasing visible and UV laser power for decades to come.  In this Phase I project, a chemical process has been established for a controlled microfabrication of these nano-sized AR structures on the optical surfaces of LBO crystal.  The measured transmission of light passing through sample LBO crystal shows a corresponding increase in transmission after these nano-sized AR structures have been created.  Furthermore, the chemical composition of the surfaces after fabrication has been investigated, giving further understanding of the necessary steps to develop a production ready fabrication process.  We have also been able to characterize the Beilby layer underneath the polished surfaces that are not detectable using current optical metrology.  The removal of this layer alone can lead to a significant increase in LiDT and lifetime.  Having proven the concept that these light-modifying structures can be fabricated to increase the transmission of light between 300-1100nm, we look forward to further developing this technology in the Phase II of this project to enable next generation of high power visible and UV lasers.  These lasers will ensure the future fabrication of the ever smaller and more complex microelectronic components, medical devices, and batteries.  On board aircrafts and space satellites in the future, they will ensure the safe evasion of Clear Air Turbulence and enable the most accurate prediction of weather.
