<AbstractNarration>Supercomputers enable researchers to push the boundaries of science and find innovative approaches to complex problems. From improving advanced manufacturing with modeling and simulation to understanding earth systems and weather with greater precision, harnessing the data revolution and applying data to understand life processes, supercomputers are essential to human advancement.  HPC (High Performing Computer) systems of the future will likely be very different from those of today. Emerging architectures can have a tremendous impact on the development of software, methods and models that can take advantage of these new features resulting in speed up and improvement in the accuracy of calculations. Early adoption of these emerging technologies to take advantage of special features is key to remaining competitive in the global economy. The goal of this IRES site is to engage PhD. students in research learning experiences that increase their capacity to conduct research on supercomputing systems, (including those with classical and emerging architectures), and their exposure to international collaborative research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This IRES, called ASSURE, aims to enhance the capabilities of US graduate students to develop Algorithms and Software in key scientific disciplines that benefit from Supercomputers and emerging aRchitEctures (ASSURE). The program focuses on equipping students to conduct research on one of the fastest supercomputers in the world, Sunway Taihulight, housed in Wuxi China, which has a unique architecture. ASSURE achieves this goal by: (i) training students to utilize unique international large-scale systems; (ii) engaging students in high quality collaborative research in four key areas of computational and data science utilizing these systems; and (iii) exposing students to international large-scale research environments that prepare them with cultural and professional skills required to occupy international leadership roles. Specifically, IRES students at this site will conduct research at two locations in China: The National Supercomputing Center (NSCC) in Wuxi China and the University of Tsinghua and the East China Normal University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ASSURE site is open to US Ph.D. students with an interest in computational and data science in the areas of earth systems, drug design, advanced manufacturing, big data and machine learning. Specifically, US citizens or permanent residents, including women and students from underrepresented populations in international STEM research, are invited to participate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
