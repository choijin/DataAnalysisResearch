<AbstractNarration>This EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will contribute to the national security, prosperity and welfare by improving understanding of the states of laborers exploitation and trafficking that often occurs in the chaotic rebuild and recovery environment following a natural disaster. Construction workers are extremely vulnerable to exploitation and human trafficking, especially in the post-disaster settings. Through retrospective interviews among Houston-area laborers, this project will facilitate scientific understanding of the illicit supply networks in the construction industry in the post-Harvey rebuilding efforts and evaluate potential countermeasures for their disruption. The project will be a first step toward disrupting human trafficking in other industry sectors. It will involve early-career scholars, graduate students, women, minorities, and multiple institutions, and will more broadly facilitate future involvement of the operations research community in the disruption of illicit supply networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will address several novel and unique features encountered in the complex post-disaster labor trafficking ecosystem, including stochastic systems with partial information to capture the case where a laborer's state cannot be directly observed. In addition, the employment status of construction laborers generally changes relatively frequently.  These status or state changes and the associated decisions and actions by ecosystem participants will require researchers to explore the merit of multi-period dynamic stochastic games in capturing these dynamics.  The planned multi-agent stochastic decision-making framework will be developed based on real-world evidence from the retrospective field interviews wherein laborers will provide a recalled trajectory of employment and behaviors experienced since Hurricane Harvey or their arrival to the affected region.  The partial observability of victims and adaptive behavior of the traffickers will also be captured.  Stochastic model development will be supported and evaluated with multiagent simulation models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit.  As a collaboration between The University of Texas at Austin (PI Kammer-Kerwick) and Texas A&amp;M University (PI Iakovou), this project has conducted a series of artefactual data collection exercises and an extensive review of literature to inform the development a game theoretic analysis, an agent based simulation model (ABM), and enhanced reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to elucidate and explore policies to reduce the likelihood of labor exploitation and increase the agency of day laborers in reporting wage theft and achieving justice should exploitation occur.  These exploratory efforts directly inform the proposed project.  Data collection methods were modified to address constraints imposed by the COVID pandemic.  There is one manuscript under review that describes a perspective on how to integrate behavioral science and operations research methods and elucidates how methods from this project can inform policies that address the intersection of wildlife trafficking and emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19 (Aguirre et al, 2020).  There are also two manuscripts in preparation, one for the game-theoretic analysis and the other addressing the empirical research and a fusion of ABMs as a data generator for RI.  Both of these manuscripts address the interactions between day labors and employers in the context of disrupting wage theft, the most common form of exploitation experienced by day laborers, at the same time as they recognize the intellectual merit of the developed methods on other illicit systems where disruption is an appropriate societal response.  Broader Impact.  As an EAGER, this project elucidated the need for methodological research to produce decision support tools to, in turn, improve the design and deployment of interventions; initiated new collaborations between the research team and First Workers labor center, the Texas community collaborator, and Jobs with Justice, the Georgia community collaborator, in a newly funded DISN project (2039983) between PIs Kammer-Kerwick and Swartout on the adaptation of stochastic actor based models as an additional methodological element to improve understanding of the coevolution of behavior among social network participants concurrently with the diffusion of educational interventions across participant classes who both cooperate with and, at times, antagonize other classes.  The current project (1838039) has also produced two presentations and one panel presentation at INFORMS, one presentation at WSC, and an article published in The Bridge (Caulkins et al, 2019).
