<AbstractNarration>This award provides student subsistence for the 2018 Oregon Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS). The summer school provides an important and valuable educational opportunity for students to study foundational topics related to programming languages, formal methods, and verification. The focus of this year's school is "Concurrency and Parallelism". The significance and importance of the summer school include building international community and cooperation in foundational research areas, and enhancing education of US students, including women and underrepresented minorities, by exposure to and interaction with leading-edge research and researchers. By supporting US-based students, the school will thus train the next generation of programming languages, compilers and software engineering researchers in both industry and academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
