<AbstractNarration>The Workshop on Electronics, Photonics and Magnetics (EPM) - Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN) will be held on October 11-12 at the Holiday Inn, Alexandria, VA. It will allow to discuss issues related to development of computational tools to support the field of electronics, photonics and magnetics. The Workshop will host leading researchers in the field that will discuss the current state of the art, outline the pathways that allow efficient computation of nano/quantum devices, and propose, prioritize realistic research and development approaches that can lead to Computational Nanotechnology team efforts on Electronics, Photonics and Magnetics. There will be opportunities for information exchange and discussions on the development of computational tools to support the field as well as representing the community of users of these tools. Of major importance will be to determine possible ways a Node on Electronics, Photonics and Magnetics will allow efficient development of new tools and content dissemination worldwide via NSF's NCN Cyber Platform. Computation and simulation tools of this type will then be possible to be employed for turning nanoscale science and engineering into applications and impact future circuit and systems responding to grand challenges. There will be several plenary talks the will outline the state of the art in each area. Moreover, the plenary session will set the stage for the presentations and discussions in the breakout sessions that will be centered on the above mentioned four main themes. Each breakout session will feature several additional speakers that will focus on the details of specific topics related to the four different themes. A white paper will be prepared that outlines the current state of research, the opportunities and challenges, and the priority research and development directions. The Workshop is expected to play a key role in identifying new directions for research on novel electronic, photonic and magnetic devices for future systems. The white paper to be prepared will be made available to all interested parties and will allow better understanding of the modeling and computation field and its applications to a broader community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
