<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide an efficient yet environmentally-friendly and sustainable way to harvest energy from walking steps. Our energy-harvesting subfloor mat can convert normal human walking steps to electricity. The mat is expected to serve the function of 1) a renewable energy source, 2) a power supply for IoT sensors, 3) a self-powered sensor with wireless connectivity. The mat can benefit retail stores and manufacturing companies by helping them analyze the customer/worker locations and foot traffic patterns, and can meet the needs of energy storage and information transmission at heavy foot traffic area like school, airport, stadium. If developed successfully, this mat can be integrated with various floor products and applied across the smart building and IoT industry. This mat also has an environmental impact in which it reduces carbon footprint, promotes use of green natural materials and generation of renewable energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on a patent-pending cellulose triboelectric nanogenerator technology.  This technology lies at the intersection of materials science, electrical engineering, and chemistry and chemical engineering, and the research findings can potentially impact the rapidly growing smart building and IoT industry. This technology addresses the technical challenge of developing a thin yet highly effective triboelectric nanogenerator from cheap, abundant natural materials, by bulk tuning of the tribopolarity of natural materials and rational configuration design of the nanogenerator. The bulk tuning and configuration design methodologies developed in this R&amp;D effort can be applied to other relevant areas, including mechanical energy harvester design, and materials surface potential engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this I-Corps team was to explore the commercialization feasibility of a flexible, integratable ultra-thin subfloor mat that can be readily installed under various flooring products for harvesting, storing and using the energy from foot traffic.  The subfloor mat is a cellulose-based triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)--developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in Prof. Xudong Wang’s nanotechnology group--uses human interaction (footsteps) to convert mechanical energy into usable electricity and can operate low-power devices without the need of batteries or access to electricity.  Cellulose, the world’s most abundant natural polymer, can be sourced from plants, algae, wood pulp, recycled paper, etc. making it low cost, recyclable, and biodegradable and has the potential for replacing the conventional petroleum-polymers used in high performance TENGs.  This work resulted in the spin-off company EWPanel which now spearheads the commercialization effort of this product.  Over the course of the I-Corps program, the team carried out over 130 interviews spanning four potential customer segments: Green Building, Foot Traffic Analysis, Interactive Mat Apps, and Self-illuminating Floors. The Green Building segment was initially thought to be the most suitable wherein the subfloor mats to generate power to offset energy consumption.  Unfortunately, the technology in its current state cannot meet the return-on-investment requirements of this segment.  From interviews with the remaining customer segments, the team determined that pivoting to Foot Traffic Analysis was more ideal.  Further segmentation of Foot Traffic Analysis included museums, trade show organizers, and office space applications such as increasing push for so-called high performance workspaces wherein businesses maximize their space utilization efficiency. Various players in the office space segment--architects, interior designers, business owners, flooring manufacturers--showed significant interest in the team’s subfloor mat.  This is because, compared to existing occupancy sensor technologies, the EWPanel’s product is easy to integrate with existing floors, collects data anonymously, and is environmentally friendly.  Additional feedback from this industry also expressed a desire for wireless connectivity, which would make this product more agility and make it easier to install, maintain, and uninstall when needed.  Therefore, Foot Traffic Analysis was identified as the beachhead application with office space/high performance workspaces as the tentative market for entry.  Overall, the team’s work in the I-Corps program greatly accelerated the technology transfer of the cellulose TENG subfloor mat sensor.  Based on this market research and positive feedback, EWPanel submitted a strong NSF STTR Phase I proposal in July 2018, and was eventually rewarded the year-long Phase I grant in July 2019. If the commercialization of this product is successful, the mat will be a product that serves the function of 1) a renewable energy source, 2) a power supply for IoT sensors, 3) a self-powered sensor with wireless connectivity. This mat will be integrated with various floor products and applied across the smart building and IoT industry. This mat also has potential environmental impacts in reducing carbon footprint and promoting use of green natural materials and generation of renewable energy.
