The major challenge hindering their adoption in applications is the resource-intensive nature of the conventional experimentation procedures commonly used to understand the material?s behavior. At present, the only way forward is judicious testing coupled with advanced, but also well-substantiated computer modeling; hence, university groups and research institutes are strongly involved in developing virtual testing procedures encompassing micromechanical modeling schemes and finite element modeling methods to expedite the materials development.</p> <p>The goal of this one-week summer school, held in July 2018 at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, was to familiarize graduate students and post-doctoral researchers with the state of the art in advanced composite and multifunctional materials development and production. This was accomplished through theoretical and hands-on sessions that disseminated the fundamental knowledge regarding materials processing, characterization and testing, constitutive law modeling, micromechanics, failure mechanics, and homogenization methods in a high-level academic, as well as industrial environment. The newly gained knowledge will be used by participants in their future endeavors to efficiently develop new applications using advanced materials, such as composite, porous, and active (such as shape memory alloys, piezoelectric etc.) materials exhibiting targeted properties, by effectively using advanced characterization, modeling, and manufacturing procedures. The summer school successfully established a communication, knowledge-base, and computational-laboratory grid that:</p> <ul> <li>advanced research in testing, characterization, and production of advanced composites and multifunctional materials;</li> <li>provided students and faculty from the US and other participating countries with global research and international leadership experiences; and</li> <li>contributed to the transformation and advancement of education on materials science and engineering to all participants.</li> </ul> <p>The cadre of instructors were international experts from across universities and industry, including distinguished professors from the US and Europe. The graduate student participants experienced hands-on testing and modeling in close collaboration with industrial experts and cutting-edge instrumentation and products. Moreover, the international character of the body of participants and instructors played a crucial role in establishing a diverse professional network with an international character to motivate collaborations in an international academic environment.</p> <p>The <strong>broader impacts</strong> of this project focused on the training of twenty-two graduate students and post-doctoral researchers from three different countries (originating from seven countries) at a summer school held in Thessaloniki, Greece. By participating, they became part of a diverse and globally competitive Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) workforce, with the help and experience provided by internationally recognized instructors from the US, Greece, and France. During each day of the summer school, the participants were engaged in a combination of activities, covering a wide spectrum of education and knowledge, but also relaxation, socialization, and cultural experience in a city with a history of over 2,300 years that maintains a vibrant character and youthful energy with its over 150,000 students in a melting pot of cultures. A theoretical learning session in the morning, was followed by hands-on materials testing and computer modeling labs in the afternoon. The participants also visited and exchanged ideas with experts from two industrial sites that globally deliver products and services. The industrial visit to Alumil-CFT (composites manufacturer) and the full day training at BETA CAE Systems? on their software packages offered a unique experience to the participants regarding the operation and work environment of two well-established companies related to manufacturing and engineering software development processes. Furthermore, the participants had the opportunity to obtain insights regarding the skills required for a successful career in an industrial environment and to explore research collaborative efforts among industrial and academic partners. Interactions among participants was fundamental to achieving the full potential of the Summer School, with planned social activities providing opportunities to freely exchange experiences and ideas, as well as initiate collaborations to foster in the future.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/05/2019<br>      Modified by: Dimitris&nbsp;C&nbsp;Lagoudas</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1836912/1836912_10557684_1551827256278_GroupPhoto--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1836912/1836912_10557684_1551827256278_GroupPhoto--rgov-800width.jpg" title="4th International Summer School on Advanced Materials Systems"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1836912/1836912_10557684_1551827256278_GroupPhoto--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="4th International Summer School on Advanced Materials Systems"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Participants and instructors of the 4th International Summer School on Advanced Materials Systems (AMS18), held in July 2018 at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.</div> <div class="imageCredit">AMS18</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Dimitris&nbsp;C&nbsp;Lagoudas</div> <div class="imageTitle">4th International Summer School on Advanced Materials Systems</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1836912/1836912_10557684_1551827316236_Photo2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1836912/1836912_10557684_1551827316236_Photo2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="4th International Summer School on Advanced Materials Systems"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1836912/1836912_10557684_1551827316236_Photo2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="4th International Summer School on Advanced Materials Systems"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Participants presenting their final projects.</div> <div class="imageCredit">AMS18</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Dimitris&nbsp;C&nbsp;Lagoudas</div> <div class="imageTitle">4th International Summer School on Advanced Materials Systems</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1836912/1836912_10557684_1551827385926_Photo3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1836912/1836912_10557684_1551827385926_Photo3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="4th International Summer School on Advanced Materials Systems"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1836912/1836912_10557684_1551827385926_Photo3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="4th International Summer School on Advanced Materials Systems"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dr. Dimitris Lagoudas presenting at the summer school about his current research at Texas A&M University on shape memory alloys.</div> <div class="imageCredit">AMS18</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Dimitris&nbsp;C&nbsp;Lagoudas</div> <div class="imageTitle">4th International Summer School on Advanced Materials Systems</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
