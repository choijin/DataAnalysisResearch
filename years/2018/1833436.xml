<AbstractNarration>The scientists identify an important issue for a world of devices all communicating wirelessly: "How to identify malfunctioning devices or those not fairly sharing the spectrum with others?"  The scientists explore scenarios for leveraging local, crowd-sourced mobile devices to detect and identify unauthorized transmitters.   The goal of this technique is to reduce the cost of enforcement of network rules by adding the capability of some smart phones to sense the radio spectrum use and report back to a central database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to develop a Crowd-based Spectrum ENforcement System (CSENS), which takes a data-driven approach to spectrum enforcement. Specifically, the PIs propose to conduct 3 tasks: (i) real-time on-demand spectrum monitoring, which enables real-time responses to spectrum measurement tasks; (ii) utilizing physical layer features to embed cryptographic spectrum permits into transmissions, which enables reliably distinguish between authorized and unauthorized spectrum users; (iii) using a library of known signatures for network applications, unauthorized transmitters can be uniquely identified.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We build a scalable, spectrum monitoring system out of mobile commodity devices. This system monitors transmissions in real-time and generates alarm events when detecting anomalous transmitters, which can trigger further actions by a government or third party monitoring agency. Compared with today?s costly hardware solutions, our solution is analogous to widely deploying cheap commodity smoke detectors, which when triggered, can call firetrucks to assess and address the problem.    There are threefundamental technical bottlenecks that we address in this project: (1) In a distribute spectrum monitoring system, the measurement data inevitably contains noises, biases, and even human errors.   Given such variety of error sources,  can crowdsourced measurement be an effective approach to real-time spectrum monitoring?    (2) Whether measurements from crowdsourcing users will be sufficient to accurately identify the location of both authorized and unauthorized transmitters?    (3) How to identify abnormal spectrum usage behaviors, either from intentional misuse or due to transmitter misconfiguration or faults,  using large measurement data?      The outcomes of this project are techniques, demonstrated via analysis, simulations and field experiments, that address these challenges.  Our key results are as follows:   (1) We perform spectrum measurements using low-cost spectrum measurement devices, identify and quantify multiple sources of error, including receiver noise, dynamic context, radio interference, and route sampling bias.  We develop multiple techniques to limit and remove noise from measurement data. Our results show that when treated carefully, crowdsourced measurement can be an effective approach to real-time spectrum monitoring.    (2) We develop an advanced learning based methods to identify "high-fidelity" spectrum measurement data that can lead to accurate localization of transmitters.  Using large international public datasets (419M signal measurements and 1M cells) and corresponding ground truth values, we found that performing localization using raw received signal strength data produces poor results and very high variance. Instead, we propose feature clustering, a novel application of unsupervised learning to detect hidden correlation between measurement instances, their features, and localization accuracy. Our results identify RSS standard deviation and RSS weighted dispersion mean as key features that correlate with highly predictive measurement samples for both sparse and dense measurements respectively. We show how optimizing crowdsourcing measurements for these two features dramatically improves localization accuracy and reduces variance. (3) We develop a general anomaly detection system that builds deep neural network (DNN) models using signal measurements collected by our underlying crowdsourcing spectrum monitoring system, and applies them as baselines to detect spectrum usage anomalies. We develop a set of learning strategies that allow us to build a single, context- free DNN model for each LTE cell,  that accurately models the spectrum usage pattern for the task of anomaly detection. Across LTE cells, the DNN model trained for a given LTE cell is not directly reusable at the other cells, but can be used to quickly train their DNN models through transfer learning. Only a small amount of local spectrum measurements at the target cell are required to train the full DNN model. Overall, our efforts in this project have produced a general, scalable system for  monitoring spectrum usage in a wide area network, which can identify abnormal behaviors and locate specific transmitters with high accuracy, and achieve all of these using commodity mobile devices.     The project has also contributed to enhancing diversity via high-visibility research performed by women: one of the two investigators (at Chicago), and the investigator at Dartmouth college,  and two of the four graduate students involved in this project are women.
