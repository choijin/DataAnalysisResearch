<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to explore a new class of ultra-fast optical emitters. Those optical emitters will provide (i) for the significant advancement of direct modulation optical emitters, and (ii) creation of a wholly new optical emission pathway which is expected to exceed previous designs, while mitigating efficiency losses. Applications of such devices include fast clocks, and systems such as optical communication and LIDAR. &lt;br/&gt;Through a collaboration between the Ohio State University and the Wright State University, a significant exposure to research, particularly under-represented groups, will help to advance the field of RTD-based emitters while providing for a haven of educational nurturing. The team will also focus appropriate results of this the research output towards strategic commercialization. &lt;br/&gt;The collaborative team will explore this new class of resonant-tunneling-diode (RTD)-based emitters as a source of ultra-fast direct modulation emitters. It is believed that, since the slow holes are generated without highly resistive p-type doping and are created by Zener tunneling exactly at the point of carrier recombination and optical emission, these optical emitters will bypass many of the slow mechanisms that have prohibited fast direct optical emitters in the past. A key focus of this project is working on cavity design, balancing of hole and electron currents using the PIs own hybrid combined analytical-numerical physics models, design and modeling of thermal management and heat extraction, fabrication and testing of ultra-fast direct modulation light emitters. The aim is to achieve the first demonstration of ultra-fast direct modulation using quantum co-tunneling. The expected impact of the research includes: 1) Low-cost, ultra-fast optical sources, and (2) self-clocking optical emitters for compact clock signal generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on the light-emission mechanism in unipolar-doped, n-type In(0.53)Ga(0.47)As/AlAs double-barrier resonant tunneling diodes at room temperature.   The light emission was found to occur around the band-gap wavelength of In(0.53)Ga(0.47)As with a peak wavelength of 1631 nm in the near-infrared (NIR) portion of the spectrum.  The emission mechanism was modeled as electron-hole recombination on the emitter side of the double-barrier structure with the holes being generated on the collector side of the structure, primarily generated by interband (Zener) tunneling.  This baseline mechanism requires that the holes transfer from the collector side to the emitter side by reverse resonant tunneling through the double-barrier structure.  This transfer represents a bottleneck in in the hole transport and serves to limit the internal quantum efficiency of the device acting as a light emitting diode (LED).  And the transfer bottleneck also presents a limitation on the speed of the device, as the holes that don't transfer remain on the collector side of the structure as minority carriers.  The steady-state hole density on the collector side entails a "diffusion" capacitance which limits the speed of the device when modulated electrically.  Although we did not calculate the diffusion capacitance accurately, we proved that it must exist, and along with the natural lifetime of electron-hole recombination in In(0.53)Ga(0.47)As limits the speed of the device to the ~1 GHz range.  We also made the first experimental observation of "self oscillation" of the light emission caused by internal.  Although occurring at a relatively low frequency around 10 KHz, the electro-optic behavior of the self oscillation indicated that another light emission mechanism may be present.  We hypothesized that the other mechanism is tunneling-induced photon emission (TIPE) that is similar to the Franz-Keldysh effect but in reverse. The TIPE mechanism creates holes on the emitter side of the structure by interband tunneling through the double-barrier structure, and therefore does not introduce a bottleneck in the hole transport as does the baseline light-emission mechanism described above.  Furthermore, the TIPE mechanism may entail a correlation between the interband tunneling and the radiative recombination, which we have modeled quantum mechanically using 2nd order time-dependent perturbation theory.  Unfortunately, time did not allow us to compute the resulting transition rate for the TIPE mechanism, but all of the equations were derived and presented in the Final Report.  We then investigated the baseline mechanism in other semiconductor unipolar-doped (n-type) RTD structures made from materials that would extend the emission wavelength to the mid-wave infrared (MWIR: 3.0 to 5.0 micron) or long-wave infrared (LWIR: 8.0 to 12.0 micron) regions of the spectrum where light-emitters are more difficult to fabricated.  The RTD materials included InAs with AlSb barriers (MWIR), InSb with AlSb barriers (MWIR), and HgCdTe with CdTe barriers (LWIR).  In all cases, the generation of holes on the collector side, and the transfer of those holes to the emitter side, is much more likely than in In(0.53)Ga(0.47)As/AlAs RTD structures, promising significantly higher internal quantum efficiency.  This is because interband (Zener) tunneling is exponentially dependent on the band-gap energy, which decreases monotonically in going from InAs to InSb to HgCdTe.  But also some of these new materials, such as InAs/AlSb are type-II heterostructures, meaning that the thin "barriers" only act to block electrons, not holes.  And hence the bottleneck is eliminated for holes transferring from the collector side back to the emitter side where radiative recombination occurs.  This extension of our baseline light-emission mechanism to longer wavelength operation was submitted first as a provisional patent application, and then in Oct. 2020 as a USPTO utility application at the end of the project.  Finally, we investigated a resonant optical cavity (ROC) that would promote vertical emission from the RTD-LED (or RTD-laser diode) at room temperature.  The bottom-side reflector is a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) made from quarter-wavelength sections of In(0.52)Al(0.48)As, and a quaternary alloy of InGaAlAs.  Both materials of the DBR were chosen based on being transparent to the emission from the In(0.53)Ga(0.47)As/AlAs RTD LED, and being highly lattice-matched to the InP substrate at room temperature.  The top-side reflector was the In(0.52)Al(0.48)As-air interface.  Vertical radiative enhancement factors up to 9.5 at 1630-nm wavelength were calculated depending on the net reflectivity of the DBR.  This should be high enough to promote much stronger vertical emission from RTD-LEDs than can be observed without an ROC, and may enable a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) too.
