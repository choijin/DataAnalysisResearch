<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide high-performance light filtering at a level that potentially affects all people in the world. Inexpensive high-performance light filters allow for early detection of cancer and infection by bringing the highest-precision technologies such as fluorescence microscopy and sensing to portable, consumer diagnostic devices. They also make sensors in self-driving cars and other intelligent devices of the future to detect objects in the surroundings more accurately by eliminating the undesired light noise from the ambient and focusing on the target frequencies of light only. Batteries of future mobile devices may also last up to 20% longer due to more efficient light energy management in display units that become possible with low-cost, large-scale optical filters.?Finally,?the anticipated lower manufacturing cost at high volume will allow for more high-tech manufacturing jobs to remain in the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will establish the technical feasibility of using a novel multi-material, micro- and nano-layered film production process in order to produce visible and near-infrared thin-film optical filters. The time and cost requirements of conventional, deposition-based production techniques of such filters are a significant barrier to market growth and commercial acceptance of their broad range of uses. In order to address this market gap, this project will investigate the elements necessary for consistent production of filters made of hybrid organic/inorganic materials using the novel process of thermal drawing. This investigation will cover methods of integration and handling of hybrid organic-inorganic materials in the thermal drawing process as well as understanding and controlling fluidic instabilities at interfaces to obtain filter uniformity and integrity. The results of the proposed research will determine whether the novel thermal drawing process, in conjunction with developed materials and handling techniques, can reliably generate high-performance visible and near infrared filters at scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this SBIR Phase I project, we have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of eliminating vacuum coating process for production of high-performance thin-film optical filters. We have accomplished this by using the highly scalable process of thermal drawing of macroscopic layered preforms down to nano-layered optical filter films. We have demonstrated 88% correlation between designed and actual filter performances with a path to reduce the order of magnitude of the cost of high-performance optical filter manufacturing.  This significant improvement in the scalability of high-performance optical filter production at low cost enables wider-spread use of various filters such as narrow bandpass filters for emerging applications including sensors for consumer drones, robots, internet of things (IoT), and self-driving cars, as well as smart devices for continuous health monitoring.  In some cases, the cost of traditional optical filters is up to 50% of the cost of a device designed for infection detection with a mobile integrated sensor. Significant reduction of filter price along with an order of magnitude better scalability of production make such vital devices accessible to the general public both in developed and under-developed countries around the world.  In this Phase I SBIR project, we proved the feasibility of incorporating high-performance materials into the novel process of thermal filter drawing and further demonstrated the practical applicability of this approach by producing empirical results closely matching those of theoretical models.
