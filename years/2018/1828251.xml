<AbstractNarration>This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR)  provides Murray State University (MSU) with funds to purchase a rheometer to enhance undergraduate research and education in the Department of Chemistry and in the Institute of Engineering. The instrumentation will be used to study the rheological (stress-deformation) properties of polymers and plastics, polymer solutions, fluids, resins and other soft materials. Research teams in the Department of Chemistry conduct research to gain an understanding of the fundamental rheological properties of charge-containing plastics and materials critical to the advancement of applications in energy storage, electronic devices and 3D printing. The rheometer enhances significantly the instrumentation available for an expanding, multi-disciplinary program in polymer and materials science at MSU. The "hands-on" training that undergraduates will receive  will lead to the improvement of up to five lecture and/or laboratory courses across chemistry and engineering. Since many of these students are from the rural counties of far-western Kentucky, northwestern Tennessee and southern Illinois, this cutting-edge experience will not only deepen their understanding of polymer and materials science but also increase the likelihood that these students gain meaningful employment in STEM-related careers in the region and/or better prepare them for pre-professional school. Finally, the rheometer will enhance MSU's ability to partner with regional R&amp;D/manufacturing facilities thereby strengthening existing collaborations and enabling new ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of a new rheometer complete with environmental testing chamber, UV accessory and dielectric capabilities is supported jointly by the Major Research Instrumentation Program and the EPSCoR program. The rheometer will enhance a rapidly growing undergraduate research and educational program in polymer and materials science at Murray State University. It will enable real-time and post-cure rheological analysis of polymers, polymer solutions, fluids, resins and other soft materials.  Specific projects that would be enhanced  include the elucidation of in situ and post-cure rheological properties of poly(ionic liquid) networks (PILs) prepared by thiol-ene/yne "click" photochemistry, the determination of dielectric properties of these PIL networks (including insights into chain dynamics and ion mobility), exploration of dynamic polymeric systems, and the analysis of resins for 3D printing. For all of these projects, the acquisition of rheological data, in particular those obtained using the UV light guide and dielectric accessories, will provide structure-activity information critical to advancing several on-going and future application interests, including gas/ion separation/absorption membrane technologies, microfluidics, electrospinning and other electroactive devices.  The rheometer will also allow for the educational advancement of students in several courses between the Department of Chemistry and the Institute of Engineering: Polymer Chemistry, including the development of a brand new Polymer Chemistry Laboratory course, Instrumental Analysis, Mechanics of Materials and Mechanics of Materials Laboratory. Beyond teaching and research, addition of the rheometer will further facilitate an active collaboration with a regional chemical company in order to improve several current commercial product lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The instrumentation helps to support a rapidly growing undergraduate research and educational program in polymer and materials science at Murray State University. The rheometer has allowed for real-time and post-cure rheological analysis of polymers, polymer solutions, fluids, resins and other soft materials, resulting in over 250 experiments (research and instructional) completed to date. The rheometer has supported a number of undergraduate research projects, primarily across two groups in the Department of Chemistry. These projects include: (a) UV-curing kinetics and anhydrous conductivities of thiol-ene/yne poly(ionic liquid) network polymers, (b) conductivity of ionic-functionalized, cellulose-based materials, (c) analysis of the curing kinetics of various commercial and in-house developed 3D printing resins and (d) rheological analysis of ionic materials that exhibit re-healing properties. One publication has resulted from our research efforts so far with two other manuscripts under review, all three of which highlight our work with data from the rheometer. One undergraduate student has presented a poster on her work with re-healable materials at the National Meeting of the American Chemical Society. The rheometer has also been successfully integrated into two upper-level, laboratory-only courses in the Department of Chemistry: Organic Chemistry II Laboratory and our brand new Polymer and Materials Science Laboratory.

As described above, we currently have two upper-level courses where students gain hands-on experience working with this instrumentation. While students in the Polymer and Materials Science Laboratory course are chemistry majors, those taking Organic Chemistry II Laboratory are a mixture of chemistry, biology and pre-veterinary students. Thus, there is a reasonably wide range of STEM students being exposed to this high-level instrumentation. The PIs continue to believe that the students who utilize this instrumentation, whether it be through research or coursework, will be better prepared than their counterparts at similarly sized institutions in the region. The rheometer, in addition to the equipment already present in the Department of Chemistry (the MSU Polymer and Materials Science Laboratory), has been used to attract new students to MSU, in particular to the Polymer and Materials Science degree track.
