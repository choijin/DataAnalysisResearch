<AbstractNarration>The research supported by this award will investigate how ordinary speech interactions with peers and adults at school affect how young people learn to form social alignments, distinguish groups, express emotion, and organize action. The nature of linguistic interactions is known to vary in different institutions of education in ways that reflect the backgrounds of students, material resources, and ideologies of administrators. The researcher will examine this process through an intensive comparative study of everyday language practices in two contrasting institutions of education. The goal of the research is to elucidate how the micro-practices of daily linguistic practice prepare youth for diverse social roles in their post-high school trajectories. The research is important because the linguistic and social competencies that youth learn in school will carry them into adulthood. Findings will help theoreticians better  understand the mechanism behind the production of heterogeneous social identities. The research also will support educators and other stakeholders who are concerned to broaden young people's opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted by Tyanna Slobe, a linguistic anthropology doctoral student under the supervision of Dr. Norma Mendoza-Denton at the University of California Los Angeles. The researcher focus on adolescents in two high schools in Santiago, Chile. One is a free public school and the other an expensive private school. The researcher has chosen these research sites because Chile has one of the most segregated systems of education of all developed countries, which makes it feasible to isolate the effects of schooling in a way that would not be possible in a system with more institutional crossover. The researcher will use the intensive methods from linguistic anthropology to collect data on voice and embodied gesture in naturally occurring interactions during classroom and extracurricular activities. Data will be collected through participant observation, interviews, and audiovisual recordings, identifying students at different points in their school careers. She will construct visual representations of pitch tracks, to accompany transcriptions of speech and representations of embodied movement, using a method for visual and textual representation of multimodal semiotic channels in interaction.  By comparing interactions in public and private school contexts until graduation, the researcher will be able to explore relationships between small-scale language variation, linguistic practice, institutional organization, and sociopolitical structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Research conducted during this NSF DDRIG period followed 10<sup>th</sup> grade classes from one public school and one private school in Santiago, Chile during the 2019 academic year. The researcher carried out ethnographic investigation at each site through participant observation of everyday school activities and interviews with students, teachers, administrators, and parents. Additionally, she recorded naturally occurring classroom interactions, focusing particularly on student council meetings. The goal of this project is to understand differences in how adolescents are socialized into distinct forms of political participation vis-&agrave;-vis their everyday experiences in class-segregated high schools. In its attention to micro-linguistic classroom interactions, the project considers how youth take political stances, assume leadership roles, express (dis)alignments with peers, and police one another&rsquo;s behaviors. Linguistic analyses are informed by insights generated through ethnographic investigation and interviews with participants to study how different types of political engagement come to be evaluated as (il)legitimate forms of participation in each school.</p> <p>Chile&rsquo;s education system is among the most heavily privatized in the world and income inequality is the highest of OECD countries. Segregation is not unique to Chilean schools, but here it is overtly politicized with respect to policy implemented during the military dictatorship. On September 11th, 1973 a military coup overthrew the government of Salvador Allende, the world&rsquo;s first democratically elected socialist president. Under the authoritarian regime of Augusto Pinochet, the military government enacted what is widely considered to be the world&rsquo;s first experiment with neoliberal economics. Political dissenters were tortured, disappeared, and exiled in the interest of privatizing once-public institutions providing services like education, health, and social security. Pinochet was removed from power in 1990, but many dictatorship-era policies remain unchanged today, partially because Chile is still governed by the constitution introduced in 1980 under the military regime.</p> <p>This NSF-funded research involving high school students&rsquo; political participation became extremely relevant to national sociopolitical events in the final months of 2019 when teenagers in Santiago initiated a massive, ongoing, political uprising. In October 2019 public high school students organized &lsquo;evasiones masivas&rsquo;&mdash;mass payment evasions&mdash;in Santiago metro stations in response to a 30-peso ride fare increase (~$0.04 USD). Clashes between student protestors and police escalated for weeks until October 18<sup>th</sup> when riots erupted across the city in response to police brutality against the student protestors. On October 19<sup>th</sup> president Sebastian Pi&ntilde;era declared a state of emergency, implemented a curfew, and deployed 10,000 troops to the streets of Santiago for the first time since the end of Chile&rsquo;s military dictatorship. Riots continued until COVID-19 lockdowns in March 2020.</p> <p>In response to the uprising the government organized a referendum vote for a new constitution to replace the one implemented in 1981 under Pinochet&rsquo;s regime. In October 2020 Chileans voted overwhelmingly in support of replacing the constitution and in favor of a democratically elected constitutional assembly to draft the document.</p> <p>During this NSF-funded reserach period the co-PI documented public and private high school students&rsquo; involvement in political protests and conversations since the onset of the uprising, and she will continue with this line of inquiry through the remainder of her dissertation fieldwork as Chile completes the process of implementing the new constitution.</p> <p>Due to safety and transportation issues related to the riots, data collection pertaining to classroom interactions in the public school was cut short because the school was unable to reopen for the last three months of the academic year. Both schools were closed for in-person learning during the entire 2020 academic year. The public school was never able to fully transition to online learning due to lack of technological resources. The researcher continued participant observation in virtual classes at the private school in 2020 and conducted interviews via Zoom with students and teachers from both schools. Schools are expected to re-open in partial capacity in March 2021. Due to data collection setbacks in the public school, the co-PI has continued this project beyond the scope of this NSF funding period. This reserach will be completed when the focus cohorts from the public and private school research sites graduate from high school in December 2021.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/31/2020<br>      Modified by: Tyanna&nbsp;Slobe</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1824123/1824123_10560147_1609407404973_IMG_4644--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1824123/1824123_10560147_1609407404973_IMG_4644--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Estallido Social"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1824123/1824123_10560147_1609407404973_IMG_4644--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Estallido Social"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Tear gas combined with water from police cannons and a broken pipe in a nearby construction site spray down on protestors during November 2019 riots in Santiago Centro.
