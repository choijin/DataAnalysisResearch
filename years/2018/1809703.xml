<AbstractNarration>This award will support student and postdoctoral attendance at a workshop on computational complexity theory, organized by the Clay Mathematics Institute, and by the Computer Science Department at the University of Oxford.  Many leading figures in computational complexity have already made a commitment to attend the workshop, which will be held July 23-26 at the University of Oxford.  For these student attendees, the meeting serves as a valuable educational experience, both for the technical content of the talks and for the opportunities for networking that it provides. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will provide partial support to approximately seven students, partly defraying the cost of travel and lodging. Efforts will be made to support students from under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Clay Mathematical Institute of Oxford University hosted a workshop on Complexity Theory in the Andrew Wiles building at   Oxford, July 23-26, 2018.    The organizers were Eric Allender (Rutgers University) Rahul Santhanam   (Oxford, Computer Science) and Ben Green (Oxford, Mathematics).  There were   28 invited speakers, including many senior researchers who are acknowledged   leaders in the field, but also including three students and a number of   junior professors and postdoctoral associates who are responsible for several   recent breakthroughs.  The speakers came from six countries, spread across   three continents.    Rather than attempting to cover the entire landscape of computational   complexity theory, the workshop focused on a topic that has come to be known   as ``meta-complexity.''  Meta-complexity refers to the computational   complexity of problems whose instances themselves encode algorithms or   computations. Some of the fundamental questions in theoretical computer   science are questions about meta-complexity, including:  Is the   Satisfiability Problem solvable in less than exponential time?  Do   pseudo-random generators exist?  Is efficient learning of concepts feasible?    Are complexity lower bounds provable in standard proof systems?  Some of the   most intriguing progress in computational complexity has dealt with   meta-complexity issues.    These questions connect complexity theory to a wide range of other areas,   including algorithms, learning, cryptography, and logic.  This workshop built   on these connections by stimulating cross-disciplinary conversations between   researchers and students working in these areas, with the aim of achieving a   deeper and more integrated mathematical understanding of computation.    Support from the NSF was essential, in allowing the conference  organizers to provide travel assistance to 14 students from American  institutions, including five women and one African-American.
