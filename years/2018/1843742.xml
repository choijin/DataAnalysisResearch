<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will benefit manufacturers of residual gas analyzers, mass spectrometers, ion-mobility spectrometers, time-of-flight spectrometers and related instruments. Implementation of these sensors will increase the revenue, revenue streams and market share of commercial manufacturers of mass spectrometers by significantly lowering production cost, and by enabling penetration into new markets that require increased sensitivity, lowered size, weight, power consumption, and instrument complexity. The product, if successful, will lead to analytical tools that can substantially benefit the needs of education/research, space, bio/health, agricultural, defense and security markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop nanotechnology-based chip-scale ion sensors with ultra-high intrinsic charge-to-current amplification factors. This patent-pending technology allows semiconductor-processable miniaturization and scalability, sub-microwatt intrinsic power draw, and robust ambient-pressure-agnostic operation. With reduced size, weight, and power requirements, increased sensitivity and dynamic range, these sensors can potentially replace expensive, bulky, and/or high-power-consuming charged particle detectors such as microchannel plates, Daly detectors, electron-multiplier tubes and Faraday cups. The ability to operate under any ambient pressure and distinguish charge polarity can significantly enhance field-portability, turnkey operations, and enhance analytical reach of ion-sensing-based applications. Specifically, the proposed research will seek to overcome the challenges related to generation of high signal responses (by enhancing the electronic transport parameters), high ion-sensor interaction (by optimizing sensor design), and lower readout noise (by optimizing materials and design).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

After consideration of the development ease, time to market, and commercial interest expressed by market leaders of both mass spectrometry and vacuum sensing, Guardion decided to pivot its technical development to address vacuum sensing instead, with the intent to revisit mass spectrometry applications in the future once the core technology was more mature.    With that in mind, the work conducted during this Phase I demonstrated the operation of a vacuum gauge utilizing 2D nanomaterials sensors from atmospheric pressure to 1E-6 Torr. The nanomaterial sensors can be 100x100 &mu;m2 or smaller, and were characterized to exhibit higher sensitivity to charge than faraday cups, and the vapor phase gating of the incident ions exhibits an intrinsic gain comparable to external amplifiers like electron multipliers without any additional external mechanisms or equipment. The ion sensors were capable of measuring very small currents (fA), and demonstrated repeatable pressure dependent response over the atmosphere to high vacuum range. Extrapolation of the lowest vacuum tested compared with the intrinsic noise of the sensor suggests it should be able to operate even beyond ultra high vacuum conditions (1E-12 Torr). Due to the simple, two terminal architecture of these devices they are easy to manufacture, transport, and store without any special care or conditions.    Currently, there is no single point method for vacuum sensing from atmosphere to high vacuum or lower pressures. Commercial solutions to this problem involve combinations of different types of gauges operating over different ranges with an overlap at their respective limits. However, such solutions are bulky, costly, and experience loss of accuracy across the transition between gauge types because the vacuum sensing mechanism changes. The results of this work serve as the basis for a single point solution to vacuum sensing across this large range which would be smaller, cost less, and operate without the inefficiencies of several combined gauges.
