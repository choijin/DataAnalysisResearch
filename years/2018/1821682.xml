<AbstractNarration>Public cloud computing is rapidly becoming the foundation of our information-based economy. Users are&lt;br/&gt;adopting cloud platforms in lieu of maintaining dedicated computing infrastructure primarily due to the&lt;br/&gt;resulting savings in costs. Since cloud platforms earn revenue from utilizing their infrastructure by&lt;br/&gt;renting it out to customers, and earn no revenue if their infrastructure is idle, their goal is to maximize&lt;br/&gt;utilization. The increasing complexity of cloud markets raises new research&lt;br/&gt;challenges for both users and providers that are inherently economic. This award will support the&lt;br/&gt;organization of a workshop to bring together researchers from computer systems and networks and from&lt;br/&gt;the fields of economics, finance, and operations research to define important research challenges at the&lt;br/&gt;intersection of economics and cloud computing over the next 5-10 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research agenda of the workshop has the potential for broad and transformative impact on the US and&lt;br/&gt;beyond by fostering a new interdisciplinary community in this nascent area, identifying its key research&lt;br/&gt;challenges, and laying the foundation for future innovations that increase the efficiency of using cloud&lt;br/&gt;computing resources. Furthermore, the workshop will engage early career scholars and those from&lt;br/&gt;diverse backgrounds and underrepresented groups to connect them with a broad community of academic&lt;br/&gt;and industrial researchers interested in the intersection of economics and computer systems and&lt;br/&gt;networking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
