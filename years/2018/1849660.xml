<AbstractNarration>This travel award supports student participation at the 4th International Workshop on Software Analytics (SWAN 2018) happening in Florida, USA on November 5, 2018. The funds seek to encourage US-based students to attend, with priority given to underrepresented groups, US citizens/residents, and those otherwise unable to attend without financial support. The area of software analytics as the basis for empirical research in software engineering leads to a scientific understanding of phenomena surrounding software and its development. The area is emerging and will be boosted by increasing student participation in this start-up workshop series. The workshop is a forum for presentation of work in this field, and as such, it will help expand research and strengthen US participation in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical scope of the workshop covers data-driven approaches for data exploration and analysis; predictive analytics for software; web analytics, development analytics; business intelligence tools; large-scale data mining, analysis and analytics for software projects; software analytics for various stakeholders (e.g., managers vs. developers); empirical studies on how software analytics are used in practice and their  effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
