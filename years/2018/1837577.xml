<AbstractNarration>This project will initiate the formation of a researcher-practitioner partnership (RPP) to articulate preK-14 pathways that will expand opportunities for all students to develop spatial and computational (i.e., geo-computational) thinking skills. This pilot RPP is composed of geographers, computer science educators, and geospatial technology specialists experienced in serving underrepresented minority students and communities. Under the coordination of the American Association of Geographers, this RPP will collaborate on exploratory research to inform educational standards and tested approaches to help institutions understand the capacity they need to modernize geography education and to broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities in geo-computational curriculum. Building capacity for inclusive pathways in computational geography will increase the potential of all students to contribute to the national innovative ecosystem. This pilot will provide other regions or states the foundational knowledge to design, develop, and implement a strategy to modernize their pathways to computationally-intensive jobs and college majors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The value and intelligence gained from geospatial innovations such as mobile Global Positioning System (GPS) is such that the geospatial services industry creates approximately 4 million direct jobs and generates 400 billion U.S. dollars globally in revenue per year. The recent democratization of manufacturing geospatial hardware is a sign that this industry continues to innovate and grow. More importantly, it will generate enormous volumes of geospatial data, which will be generated at even higher rates than we are already facing. The value of these spatial data, however, hinges on a workforce that is equipped with both computational thinking and spatial thinking. In 2015 the Government Accountability Office raised concerns that "throughout the country, K-12 students may not be acquiring adequate skills in and exposure to geography, which are needed to meet workforce needs in geospatial and other geography-related industries". Graduates with a combination of training in geography and computational thinking is in even shorter supply, so employers across the public and private sectors are limited and forced to choose between hiring a geographer with limited or no computational skills, or a computer science graduate with limited or no expertise in geographic information. Main questions driving this research are: (1) What are barriers experienced by schools or departments to offer courses that involve geo-computational thinking? (2) What are barriers experienced by students at different levels to enroll or succeed in courses that involve geo-computational thinking? (3) What new skills are necessary to be productive in today's geospatial technology industry? (4) What needs to be done to expand access to high-quality geo-computational education in K-12 schools? This RPP will initiate the design of a long-term mixed-methods approach combining surveys with qualitative data collection to allow other regions or states to design, develop, and implement geo-computational curriculum at all educational levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This research resulted in a partnership of researchers and educators in the San Diego area (California, USA) that developed a collaborative research framework to create more opportunities, and more inclusive opportunities, to learn a combination of skills and knowledge in geography and computer science. Such "geocomputational" skills and knowledge are increasingly valued on the job market. A shortage of workers that can support the geospatial industry has developed due to the limited availability of educational opportunities to learn computer science, geography, or both. Added to this shortage is the challenge of persistent underrepresentation of women and minorities in both geography and computer science.</p> <p><br />The partnership of researchers and educators that resulted from this research project is prepared to take strategic steps to help address this shortage of professionals and their diversity. This researcher-practitioner partnership, or RPP for short, is composed of collaborators with expertise in research and/or education, and expertise from both geography and computer science disciplines. Together, this RPP gathered relevant cross-disciplinary knowledge and understanding of education in the San Diego area from middle school to graduate school. They then developed an agreed-upon collaborative research framework to guide them towards strengthening and building capacity for geocomputing education, starting with the educational institutions they are each affiliated with in the San Diego area, and with the intent to scale their approach across the state of California.</p> <p><br />To guide the development of this collaborative research framework, the collaborators followed a working process known as Collective Impact, which is a framework for successful, equitable, and enduring collaboration requiring five conditions, namely (1) the development of a Common Agenda, (2) the agreement on Shared Measurement, (3) the integration of Mutually Reinforcing Activities, (4) the upholding of Continuous Communications, and (4) the identification of a Backbone Organization to ensure that activities across stakeholder groups align with Common Agenda objectives. The Common Agenda for this RPP was collaboratively developed through a series of workshops (see a group photo from one workshop in Figure 1). The Common Agenda document contains their identification of three persistent problems of practice shared in both computer science and geography, and at different levels of education. First, both disciplines experience a lack of public awareness about careers because both have such broad possibilities. Second, both disciplines face difficulties with broadening participation. Third, there is a large (and growing) gap between knowledge and skills students graduate with out of high school, and the expectations of skills and knowledge in the first year of college.</p> <p><br />The collaborative research approach this RPP developed is designed to help address these persistent problems of practice. Among their objectives are the making and assessment of culturally relevant curriculum in geocomputation for secondary school and college students. The RPP will follow a bottom-up curriculum development approach known as "Powerful Geography", which will prepare participating educators to convey the relevance and applications of geocomputation along the curriculum pathway (see Figure 2). Preparing participating educators will involve professional development about gathering and reflecting on data about their student?s context (including students? life, college, and career aspirations) and about professionals whose backgrounds in geocomputation align with student aspirations. These will serve as the empirical inputs into local and culturally relevant curriculum making by teachers.</p> <p><br />The resulting RPP (see Figure 3) has representation from the Sweetwater Union High School District (SUHSD), the Geographic Information Systems Department and the Geography Department at San Diego Mesa College (SDMC), the Center for Geospatial Sciences at University of California-Riverside (UCR), the Department of Geography at San Diego State University (SDSU), and the California Geographic Alliance (CGA) hosted at SDSU. The RPP is guided by backbone organizations represented by the American Association of Geographers (AAG), and the National Center for Research in Geography Education (NCRGE) co-headquartered at Texas State University and AAG.</p> <p><br />The resulting RPP are a collaboration of educational institutions that are culturally diverse school districts and minority-serving institutions of higher education that can serve female, African American, and Hispanic students, all of whom are underrepresented in both geography and computer science.</p> <p>To enable replicability of this research and to support the scaling up of benefits from this research beyond the San Diego area, and beyond California, this partnership set out to develop guidelines to establish a similar partnership and approach. These guidelines will be referred to as guidelines for "Encoding Geography RPPs", which can be disseminated through networks of the AAG and NCRGE.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/15/2021<br>      Modified by: Coline&nbsp;C&nbsp;Dony</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1837577/1837577_10582037_1613426564527_EncodingGeogrpahyWorkshopJan2020--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1837577/1837577_10582037_1613426564527_EncodingGeogrpahyWorkshopJan2020--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1837577/1837577_10582037_1613426564527_EncodingGeogrpahyWorkshopJan2020--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Group photo of participants at the Encoding Geography Workshop held at San Diego State University, Jan 13-14 2020.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Coline Dony</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Coline&nbsp;C&nbsp;Dony</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1837577/1837577_10582037_1613426661410_PowerfulGeographycurriculumapproachandindicatorsofeffectiveness.--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1837577/1837577_10582037_1613426661410_PowerfulGeographycurriculumapproachandindicatorsofeffectiveness.--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1837577/1837577_10582037_1613426661410_PowerfulGeographycurriculumapproachandindicatorsofeffectiveness.--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Powerful Geography curriculum approach and indicators of effectiveness, applied to the San Diego Encoding Geography RPP</div> <div class="imageCredit">Michael Solem</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Coline&nbsp;C&nbsp;Dony</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1837577/1837577_10582037_1613426772793_SanDiegoEncodingGeographyRPPorganization--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1837577/1837577_10582037_1613426772793_SanDiegoEncodingGeographyRPPorganization--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1837577/1837577_10582037_1613426772793_SanDiegoEncodingGeographyRPPorganization--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Organizational Structure of the San Diego Encoding Geography RPP</div> <div class="imageCredit">Coline Dony</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Coline&nbsp;C&nbsp;Dony</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
