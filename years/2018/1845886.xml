<AbstractNarration>Active-learning instruction refers to teaching methods that engage students during a significant amount of class time in work designed to help them learn. When compared with traditional lecturing, studies have shown that active-learning instruction can enhance students' science learning. Active learning is also associated with increased retention of underrepresented minorities in science courses. However, studies also show that the learning gains achieved in active-learning classrooms vary substantially across different instructors. This variation may result because instructors who teach college science courses are highly-trained scientists but may not have formal training in teaching. How effectively instructors teach is likely to be influenced by both their knowledge of the course material and their knowledge about teaching and learning. Thus, we need to better understand what knowledge about teaching and learning is important for facilitating effective active-learning instruction in undergraduate science courses.  This need is especially important in challenging situations, such as biology classes with large numbers of students. In addition, understanding the knowledge about teaching and learning that instructors need to be highly effective would enhance our ability to help instructors to fully realize the potential of active learning for their students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To advance understanding of instructor knowledge that is essential for planning and facilitating active learning, this project will elucidate instructor knowledge that is positively associated with students' conceptual learning gains in large undergraduate biology courses. The studies will include 100 instructors who use active learning in undergraduate biology courses that have 50 or more students. The investigators will elicit instructor knowledge using pre- and post-instruction interviews, including a stimulated recall approach. They will analyze instructor knowledge exhibited in interviews using qualitative content analysis grounded in theoretical frameworks of instructor knowledge and student conceptual change, as well as prior empirical work. Investigators will use hierarchical linear modeling to examine the associations between instructor knowledge and student conceptual learning gains, as well as the extent to which this relationship is mediated by instructional practices. A second set of investigations will develop longitudinal case studies to characterize how novice active-learning instructors develop knowledge for teaching. These investigations will examine instructor knowledge and practices, the relationship between them, and the factors that influence knowledge development. By examining instructor knowledge, instructional practices, and student learning among active-learning instructors, this research is expected to identify:  instructor knowledge that is associated with effective active-learning instruction; novice instructors' knowledge that professional development can build upon; and the challenges novices encounter as they develop more expertise in active-learning instruction. The project's education plans will apply what is learned through the research to design evidence-based tools that will support current and future biology instructors in using active learning in their classrooms. The project team will implement and assess the effectiveness of a Video Club professional development program for biology graduate students at the University of Georgia. In addition, they will create resources that will be added to the curated, online video collection called the Repository for Envisioning Active-Learning Instruction in Science Education to support instructors in developing the knowledge needed to effectively use active learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-wide activity that supports early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education. This CAREER project is supported by NSF's Education &amp; Human Resources Directorate Core Research  Program and its Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
