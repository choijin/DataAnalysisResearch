<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation (NSF) Dear Colleague Letter NSF 17-092: Improving Undergraduate STEM Education in Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) calls for projects to support conferences that will identify the most critical challenges and opportunities regarding undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education at HSIs, and potential actionable solutions that fall within NSF's mission, policies, and practices. In keeping with this call, the principal investigators of this project will study issues in STEM education at urban HSIs, focusing on the needs and circumstances of urban Hispanic students, who may face a different set of issues compared to students at suburban or rural institutions. These challenges include: limited opportunities for experiential learning, particularly research experiences; and relatively weak academic preparation at the secondary school level. Moreover, these urban Hispanic students are disproportionately represented in groups with lower socioeconomic status. Such circumstances may require commuting long distances to school and holding jobs outside of campus, both of which can impact student success and prospects for degree attainment. The conference will address questions unique to urban institutions, with an emphasis on the use of technology and experiential learning approaches to assist retention and success in STEM education. A conference report, including recommendations for designing an HSI program at NSF, will be produced and shared widely with the higher education enterprise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City College of New York will convene students, faculty, and administrators from institutions in the greater New York/New Jersey area, along with representatives from industry and government for this two-day conference. In addition, there will be participants from leading urban-based HSIs drawn from other regions around the country. The conference will be organized around three key questions: What issues contribute to the Hispanic student STEM Gap that are particular to urban, as opposed to rural or suburban colleges? What are the aspects of technology and experiential learning that can be brought to bear on addressing this Gap? What types of interventions in these solution sets appear to address the Gap and the needs and challenges posed by industry, academia, and students in an urban college setting? Seeking answers to these questions will also open the door to exploring issues that are relevant to Hispanic students across the nation, and more broadly, to other groups of underrepresented students who face significant challenges in pursuing their higher education goals. The conference will emphasize opportunities for participants to engage with each other actively. Session themes include: 1) Academia: the Gap into Preparation, 2) Industry: the Gap into Employment, and 3) Students: the Gap into Performance. Additional themes include Using Social Media to Build Community and Experiential Learning in MakerSpaces. A poster session will also be conducted to maximize opportunities for networking among the conference attendees.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Synposis:  As the global economy continues to expand and gives way to highly competitive markets, the demand for development in United States science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields grow. Despite this growth, STEM degree holders and workforce lacks in diversity, particularly among Hispanic populations. Even as the fastest growing community in the United States, Hispanics still remain significantly underrepresented in STEM, only accounting for 9% of all STEM degrees earned annually.  Calling upon academic experts and distinguished industry leaders, HSI:Urbano (http://hsiurbano.ccny.cuny.edu/) was held at the City College of New York in May 23-25, 2018 aimed to identify the key factors responsible for limiting underrepresented students’ success within STEM and explored the challenges minority communities face.  Conference Day One exposed challenges which Hispanic and minority students face in their pursuit of STEM disciplines. Keynote speakers and panelist addressed the gap between performance, employment and preparation of Hispanic and other URM students within STEM.

Attendees were asked to participate in their choice of four concurrent breakout sessions, which generated ideas surrounding four focal areas:  Counseling and Non-Academic Supports: non-classroom issues that affect student performance in class and student persistence (e.g., financial aid, non-college work). Teaching Technology: challenges associated with student performance in the classroom setting, and the degree to which technology can be used to improve the performance without the use of devices. Internships and Entrepreneurial Experience: the issues associated with student work readiness, exclusive of classroom knowledge of theory, and the degree to which an experiential learning approach might address those issues. Remediation: the difficulties that arise when students come to college with a level of preparation insufficient to pursue their intended major.   Day Three debriefed these breakout sessions, where attendees shared expertise, refined observations and collaborated on strategies to promote underrepresented minority (URM) student success in STEM. One of HSI:Urbano’s main goals was a unified call-to-action, with a better understanding of the systemic issues that create barriers to Hispanic and URM students’ successes. After thorough investigation, conferees worked to develop insights which aim to inform the stakeholders, funding agencies and donor communities on the allocation of funding for Hispanics and other URM students within STEM. The resulting major topic areas were:  Lack of Comprehensive Supports  Integration of Technology in the Classroom  Career Engagement and Workforce Readiness  Engagement and Academic Readiness    Within each of these topic areas, solutions emerging from the conference discussions were fleshed out.  Notable among the recommendations:   Use of "sticky spaces" to engage students at HSI urban commuter campuses Cohort-based learning models to increase sense of community More training for both faculty and students in engaging with new technologies Integrating experiential learning into required coursework Continuing family engagement at the undergraduate level for both college financial planning purposes and bolster understanding of STEM careers   Developing resource hubs between collaborating institutions to leverage the limited funding with greater impacts and development of best practices.  Broader Impacts:  HSI: Urbano attracted more than 120 attendees from across US as an open forum for broader discussions of the importance of quality STEM education to educate a diverse workforce as a necessary step for advancing US economic agenda.  Dignitaries, policy makers, and industry leaders attending the meeting shared the importance of this work to the local and regional communities they serve.  City Councilmember Mark Levine noted that New York City is second only to Silicon Valley for tech jobs, but many of those jobs are going to people from outside of New York City.  "We have the job, but we are not ready to fill them. It is necessary to do so in the Latino community. The talent is here."  Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer stated.
