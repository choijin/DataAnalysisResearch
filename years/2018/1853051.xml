<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to ultimately develop a nose-on-a-chip to establish the first-ever digital database of smell. By interfacing the biology of the human nose with a read-out platform, it will be possible to decode the human sense of smell and open up new possibilities. Such a nose-on-a-chip and its associated smell database has multiple commercial applications in the fragrance and flavor industry including increasing the efficiency of developing aroma chemicals for food, personal hygiene or household use, and fine perfumes.  Also, it may be possible to identify specific malodor receptors and developing compounds that block repulsive odors or modulate olfaction (boost smell capacity and/or suppress odor cravings). In addition, the smell database can be employed to develop algorithms that predict how new aroma chemicals will smell before making them. There is an additional opportunity for the nose-on-a-chip in the healthcare industry when applied to sniff out disease-associated odors, such as Parkinson's disease. Odor-based disease detection may revolutionize biomarker discovery and may have a significant impact on R&amp;D spending in the pharmaceutical industry and ultimately decrease treatment cost for patients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is to produce an odor-specific nose-on-a-chip assay containing a subset of odorant receptors that can report the presence of a specific odor (odor MS1) and its derivatives. This minimal viable platform is based on a well-validated need in the fragrance and flavor industry and needs to demonstrate sensitivity, specificity, selectivity and intensity (S3I) of odor activation.  The goals are to identify a set of high-affinity odor MS1 receptors, generate engineered mice for each receptor through this validated platform technology and demonstrate S3I using an established ex vivo bio-assay. Engineered mice form the basis of the proposed commercial platform. They are the bioreactors producing the olfactory extracts that are used in the ex vivo bioassay and, ultimately, are integrated with a silicon chip.  As such, optimized generation of mice is key to cost-efficient scaling of the proposed commercial chips and is a primary objective of the project. The plan is to develop a high-throughput method of generating any receptor in mice. Then, the goal is to develop an optimized gene-targeted line that will serve as a standardized template for future knock-ins of any odorant receptor gene, providing a streamlined, standardized and scalable method to ultimately establish the complete library.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Our entire SBIR project was focused on creating commercial traction within our first target industry: the Fragrance &amp; Flavor industry. A key question of the industry was to produce as many human odorant receptors as possible in order to start profiling industry-relevant smells onto our platform. Therfeore,, we focused the SBIR objectives on 3 pillars:     1.     Automate our SBIR Phase I established ex vivo odor-screening assay to increase our screening throughput  2.     Optimize the production of human odorant receptors by standardizing the method of transgenic OR production.  3.     Expand the human OR library by generating transgenic mouse lines producing human odorant receptors in their native environment.     Over the course of this project we were able to show that:  we could successfully generate more than 70 transgenic mouse line expressing unique human, mouse or rat odorant receptors. We gained important insights in how to further streamline the generation of the animals and standardize the library and established an important partnership with a world-player in producing transgenic animals. Odorant receptors could be harvested and activated on a bio-assay in a reproducible and robust way while maintaining the sensitivity, specificity and selectivity of the human nose. Activation of odorant receptors could be quantified Different concentrations of odors resulted in different activation measurements, hence the intensity of the nose can be reproduced. Olfactory cilia were shown to be extremely stable at low temperatures, further improving the shelf-life and commercial potential of the assay. We implemented a method to further automate the assay to prepare the approach for implementing odor screening as a fee-for-service. Together with important players in the Fragrance &amp; Flavor industry we showed the proof-of-concept of the platform using real-world molecules carefully selected by professional perfumers. A first commercial fee-for-service contract was in its final stages.
