<AbstractNarration>The NSF IUCRC Center for Solid-State Green Electric Power Generation and Storage (CEPS) is based on long-term partnerships between universities, industry, national laboratories, and state and federal institutions. The IUCRC CEPS goal is focused on fundamental mechanisms of novel superfast solid-state glass-ceramic conductors and on correlation of these mechanisms with respect to corresponding solid-state energy storage. The IUCRC CEPS will advance the NSF mission by expanding fundamental scientific knowledge related to charge transfer in solid state applications.  IUCRC CEPS will provide solutions for safe, high efficiency, and eco-friendly sustainable energy storage leading to energy security, stronger national defense, and advancements in the interests of national health.  The role of the SDSMT center is to develop the next generation of solid-state energy storage architectures through a fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships.  The SDSMT center effort is focused on alternative solid-state deposition approaches that will provide a cutting edge strategy for manufacturing of solid-state energy storage devices. The faculty associated with SDSMT center will advance the NSF mission of diversity by mentoring young scientists and minority students, and providing broad multidisciplinary educational experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prospective Center focuses on advancing understanding of fundamental mechanisms that take place in novel superfast solid-state glass-ceramic conductors under electric transient conditions and correlation of these mechanisms with the corresponding transport mechanisms for high efficiency, safe, and environmentally friendly all-solid-state energy technology.  New knowledge and scientific contributions to the field of solid-state ionics will be generated through the following: 1) Mechanisms of micro- and nanostructural evolution of novel nano-architectures at atomic scale; 2) Understanding mass and charge transfer mechanisms by in-situ operando studies; 3) Self-charging mechanisms within intrinsically integrated solid-state energy storage multilayer structures involving perovskite solar cells; 4) New miniaturization technology leading to safe, human-friendly, and long-lasting solid-state energy storage systems for medical applications; and 5) Solid-state energy storage integration into green power generation systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The IUCRC Center for Solid-State Green Electric Power Generation and Storage (CEPS) brought together administration, faculty, students, and entrepreneurs from three major South Dakota (SD) universities, namely, SD School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT), University of South Dakota (USD), SD State University (SDSU), and Northeastern University (NEU) from Massachusetts.

(2) Within each sector, we identified the specific companies and their interests that are in line with CEPS short and long-term objectives, such as industry-academia engagement, growth, and sustainability. (3) We promoted engagement of industry, national labs, and federal agencies by broad participation in the Planning Grant Meeting that attracted over 100 attendees, and growth of the number of CEPS potential members. (4)We embraced broad dissemination methodology by using GreenCEPS website capabilities, use of social networks, and presentations at the conferences for strong long-term engagement and involvement of new faculty, students, and stuff from the four university sites. The major CEPS activities involved: (1) Weekly online Zoom meetings, (2) Creation and regular updates of the GreenCEPS website, (3) Preparation and execution of the Planning Grant Meeting, (4) Discovery interviews with potential CEPS members, (5) Broadcasting and involvement of social media, and (6) Follow-up Planning Grant meetings with representatives from industry, national labs, and federal agencies. As a result, a database of individual contacts including 200+ companies within the specific economy sectors was created. However, the targeting remains relatively broad since almost every economy sector rely on energy storage, and CEPS activities could be attractive for many companies in the U.S. and around the world. The Planning Grant Meeting was the major outcome of this project. The registration for the CEPS Planning Grant meeting was available on online at www.GreenCEPS.com. Among over 100 attendees participated in the Planning Grant Meeting, 47 of them represented industry, federal agencies and National labs. A few attendees obtained a permission to access the meeting remotely in real time using Zoom. Significant help in preparation for the Planning Grant Meeting was received from the SDSMT undergraduate students.

Furthermore, the SDSMT Office of Economic Development (OED) as the institutional unit assisting students, faculty and other academic personnel will be engaged in entrepreneurial activities and transition of scientific and technological innovations proposed by CEPS.
