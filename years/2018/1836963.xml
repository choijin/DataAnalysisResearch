<AbstractNarration>This workshop is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. The project will conduct an in-person participatory workshop designed to broaden participation in STEM.  The project is designed to build the capacity of informal science institutions (ISIs) and their partners to use evidence-based collaborative project management practices and culturally responsive approaches to manage complex partnership efforts. The workshop will develop structure and provide tools for effective collaborative project management between ISIs including science centers and museums, and their research and community partners. To guide the workshops, participants will explore some core dimensions of culture to understand audiences, communities traditionally underserved by informal STEM institutions, and institutional differences. Participants will leave with concrete, actionable plans that will enable them to more effectively bring their collaboration plans to fruition. The project will develop resources including a playbook of project management templates, video vignettes, and summaries of relevant research findings and lessons from the field. Proceedings and resources from the workshop will be shared online with the field and ultimately archived on informalscience.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference participants will build the human resource expertise, infrastructure, and capacity needed to develop and maintain lasting partnerships that will further their institutions' aspirations to broaden participation in STEM. The project brings together an experienced, multidisciplinary team from informal science education and private industry professionals to advance knowledge of the skills and tools needed for managing complex collaborations between researchers, practitioners, and community stakeholders that will increase their effectiveness when working with diverse audiences. During the workshop, participants will think through their current project work by using a defined collaborative project management process to build a foundation of understanding and trust. Upon completion of the Institute, participants will have: (1) a shared purpose and goals that represent the interests of all parties; (2) identified some cross cultural and organizational differences that need to be accommodated for successful collaboration; (3) fostered joint decision making based on objective steps vs priorities of one organization; and (4) clarified deliverables of their project and how to measure success; (5)identified individual roles and responsibilities within their collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Co-PM was designed as a small conference pilot to test if evidence-based practices from the business and industry sector about managing complex projects could be made accessible, relevant, and useful for STEM informal science education professionals and their university or community-based partners. Twenty-eight participants from ten partnerships (19 organizations in total) attended the workshop in Washington D.C. in February 2019.  The objectives of the Co-PM Institute were to: Build the capacity of ISI?s and their partners to use evidence-based collaborative project management practices to manage complex partnership efforts; strengthen communications between organizations with the common purpose of broadening participation in STEM; explore some core dimensions of culture to understand audience and institutional differences; and maximize strategic impact through a post Co-PM Institute virtual mentorship session and an online Collaborative Project Management Playbook.   Throughout the Co-PM Institute, partners worked to align their organizational priorities to best serve their mutual project goals.  This included clarifying project boundaries by delineating a thorough list of items to be delivered by the project, and those NOT to be delivered. Articulating Critical Success Factors - what matters the utmost to each individual, to their organizations, and to those in the program they serve, so that are all successful.  Participants engaged in Influencer Assessment and Communication Planning to identify everyone who is or will be affected by their project, and who could impact it, to ensure partners involve and inform everyone. Risk Assessment activity included proactively identifying potential challenges to their joint plan in order to avoid or handle them appropriately. These activities resulted in an Updated Team Plan reflected in a Project on a Page, a simple, high-level, integrated view that would be usable and useful throughout the project for communication and management purposes. Within and across teams, participants learned about each other through exercises that explored organizational and individual diversity, building an awareness of the importance of cultures-values, styles, priorities and motivations.  Broader Impacts  This initial cohort of trained practitioner/researcher teams have advanced the alignment of their own partnership project teams? goals, plans, and mutual understanding; enhanced their plans to ensure ongoing communication and continued alignment; and added to their knowledge and experience for managing partnership projects, by using the Team Alignment process developed for the ISI community and its partners.  A preliminary Collaborative Project Management Playbook for Multi-organizational Partnerships was developed and disseminated to participants that contains self-guided steps, templates and reference sheets for Team Alignment as well as other useful resources. A virtual mentoring model was successfully tested for follow up and support.  The post-institute survey revealed that the CoPM Institute participants reactions were overwhelmingly positive, with the institute experience and content rated highly by participants across varying levels of professional experience and position. Participants were able to clearly articulate new areas of learning for improving cross-organizational collaborations, especially with respect to communications processes and project roles and timelines. Areas of improvement were also identified including increasing the time allotment for the Institute, integrating cultural awareness content throughout the Institute content, and including case examples in the institute to reflect the ISE environment as well as those that were parallel to corporate environment.  The conference participants built the human resource expertise, infrastructure, and capacity needed to develop and maintain lasting partnerships that will further their institution?s aspirations to broaden participation in STEM.
