<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Project (SBIR) project is the development of a platform for pathogen identification and other genomic applications that achieves rapid, sensitive, multiplexed single-molecule detection.  The genomic diagnostics market is poised to grow to $40 billion by 2021.  The goal of this platform will be to offer multiplexed detection of more than 1,000 pathogens, allowing accurate point-of-care diagnosis of infectious diseases.  Other genomic applications that also are possible include assessment of the microbiome or monitoring opportunistic infections in pulmonary diseases.  In addition, the platform has the potential for use in genomic sequencing, a market that is expected to reach $9 billion by 2020.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a highly multiplexed, bioelectronic, label-free assay platform capable of real-time, label-free detection of thousands of nucleic acid targets without amplification. This will be accomplished  through the use of nanoscale single-molecule field-effect transistors (smFETs) on a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated-circuit platform, which fully leverages the economies of scale of modern semiconductor manufacturing. The initial target application for this technology is multiplexed pathogen identification at the point-of-need. This project will bring the technology to wafer-scale manufacturing, which will both improve device quality and lower the per device cost of manufacture, and demonstrate proof-of-concept for genomic detection (without amplification) on clinical samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project has established the technical foundation for the proposed multiplexed single-molecule diagnostics platform.  Multiple independent system design objectives have been advanced.  Solving associated design challenges has de-risked further development of the diagnostics platform.  Combining these technical elements will yield a functional system that can be utilized for proof-of-concept diagnostic testing.  The sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities of the platform will be enabled by combining custom-designed Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit measurement hardware with single-molecule biosensor transducers.  A prototype of the CMOS hardware has been designed and validated through extensive characterization with test loads.  As a result of this validation, the design is being scaled-up to enable large-scale manufacturing and biosensor integration on the surface of CMOS wafers.  To expedite biosensor integration, manufacturing processes have also been established as part of this SBIR.  A critical step in this process is the modification of the CMOS wafer surface to make it more suitable for attachment of the sensors.  This step has been pursued through contract manufacturing in coordination with a CMOS foundry.  Utilizing custom-designed test wafers, the CMOS foundry has worked towards developing a process required to achieve target surface specifications.  Steps to uniformly deposit the sensing devices onto the surface of separate test wafers have also been addressed in this SBIR.  The successful design of the prototype CMOS hardware, the development of wafer processing protocols, and the advancement of sensor integration techniques provide a clear path for further development and assembly of the envisioned diagnostics platform.
