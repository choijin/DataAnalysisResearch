<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this grant is to understand the fundamental process of aging of glassy materials from a statistical and microscopic point of view.  Aging of glassy materials is a long standing problem:  a glass is an out-of-equilibrium material, so its mechanical and electrical properties change over time, but the microscopic reasons for this are still unknown.  Understanding aging has implications for extending the lifetime of products made from glassy materials (both "regular" glass and plastics).  This project involves simulations of glassy systems and will employ novel statistical techniques to reconstruct local elastic properties of the material.  We will learn how these properties change during the aging process.  Complementary experiments will be conducted on colloidal glasses, a well-characterized model system which exhibits aging.  Due to the limited amount of data the experiments can obtain - and more fundamentally, the limited data one can obtain before a system ages into a new state - we will need to extend statistical techniques from bioinformatics and econometrics to be able to the relevant information from our data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developed statistical techniques will be useful in a variety of applications beyond aging or materials science.  Of equal importance is understanding the fundamental mechanisms of aging in glassy systems, which may have a long-term impact on how glassy materials are produced.  The students involved in this project will gain interdisciplinary experience, as the project merges physics and engineering, statistics and soft materials, statistical mechanics theory and microscopy experiments.  Outreach efforts will target Pittsburgh area high schools with under-represented populations and will target Atlanta area K-12 students via "Squishy Physics" field trips.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  The purpose of this project was to study the mechanical properties of solid-like colloidal suspensions via computer simulation and advanced statistical techniques.  Two types of colloidal suspensions were targeted.  i) Attractive rod-like particles which form a gel, and ii) Colloidal glasses.       Gelation of attractive rod-like particles: A range of attractive rod-like particles can form a gel when suspended in various solvents.  The rods may be made out of a broad array of materials: polymers, bio-polymers, viruses, or inorganics (ceramics or metals).  We showed that the details of the rod&ndash;rod surface interactions can dramatically affect the dynamics of gelation and the structure and mechanics of the networks that form. If the attraction between the rods is perfectly smooth along their length, they will collapse into compact bundles. If the attraction is sufficiently corrugated or patchy, over time, a rigid space-spanning network will form.  We also showed that the more homogeneous networks formed in systems with more corrugated interactions were mechanically tougher while the less homogeneous networks formed by featureless, smooth particles were more brittle and prone to catastrophic failure when subjected to strain.   Deformation of colloidal glasses:  Suspensions of spherical particles, if the particles are attractive or confined at sufficiently high densities, can form a solid-like glassy (amorphous, non-crystalline) state.  The behavior of this glass, when subjected to deformation, has been the subject of debate for several decades with a consensus only starting to emerge in the last decade that the deformation is accommodated by local clusters of particles which undergo strong local strains in the same sense as the globally applied strain but with much higher amplitude.  We constructed and studied a coarse-grained meso-scale model of this process.  The coarse-grained model allowed us to study properties like the particle diffusivity, the statistics of stress relaxation events during deformation, and how these stress relaxation events clustered in space and time.      Our main findings were that it was possible to recover the same spatial correlations in the locations of sites in the system which underwent yielding in the meso-scale model as in experiments and particle-based simulations.  The mesh-scale models are orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than the particle-based models, and they will offer a new window into complex processing protocols that are employed to harden or soften colloidal glasses.    Broader Impacts: The project has resulted in the training and mentoring of several PhD students and post-docs.  The PhD student who worked on the attractive rod simulations has moved on to co-found a startup company with a collaborator of the PI.  At the company, composites formed by gelation of rod-like particles (boehmite) have been considered for technological applications in the soft robotics field.
