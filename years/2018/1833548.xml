<AbstractNarration>The National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS) will host its tenth annual "Undergraduate Research Conference (URC) at the Interface of Mathematics and Biology" from 27 - 28 October 2018, in Knoxville, Tennessee. Since 2009, the conference has showcased undergraduate research in mathematical biology, has provided students a chance to practice their scientific presentation skills in front of a supportive audience of peers, and has given students a venue to network with others having similar interests. In addition, two invited lectures by leaders in research at the interface of mathematics and biology provide students with insights into current research in this area. About one hundred participants will attend the conference, many from traditionally underrepresented groups in mathematics and biology. All student participants have the opportunity to present their choice of a research talk or poster. The event strengthens exchanges between the mathematical sciences and life science disciplines, as many of the projects are presented by student teams of math and life science majors. It is not uncommon to hear from life science students attending the conference that their eyes have been further opened to the usefulness of mathematics for making exciting progress on biological questions, and for mathematics students to be inspired by encountering new applications for their mathematical tools of which they were previously unaware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NIMBioS URC's primary objective is to provide opportunities for undergraduates from across the country to share their research at the interface of biology and mathematics with peers and faculty mentors. Between fifty and seventy contributed student talks and posters are featured. Student abstracts will be gathered into a program book and published on the conference website. Students present their own work that uses mathematical, statistical and computational approaches to address challenging questions in molecular biology, biochemistry, epidemiology, immunology, ecology, and other areas. Their work comes from summer or academic year research experiences supported by a variety of agencies including NSF, the National Institutes of Health, the National Security Administration or through their home institutions, thus allowing for cross-pollination of ideas from different programs. As a side benefit, the research programs of the faculty mentors are enriched by the sharing of information about recent research and forming new connections. The conference's secondary goal is to provide students with information on careers and graduate school and opportunities to network. The conference will host a panel discussion on career opportunities, a graduate school showcase, and ample networking opportunities through shared meals, frequent breaks, and an organized networking activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

A panel of four scientists was assembled to provide an open forum to address students? questions on graduate school and careers in math and biology. The four panelists were Holly Gaff, Nina Fefferman, Olivia Prosper (Mathematics, University of Kentucky), and Karin Leiderman (Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Colorado School of Mines). All participants took part in an activity using the ?Set? game as a means to encourage meeting new people and networking. Participants were encouraged to form ?sets? with as many other participants as possible, each recording the name and interesting facts/information about the other participants. Another event at the Conference was the Graduate School Opportunities Showcase. This showcase consisted of informational booths on graduate school opportunities from several departments and programs from different institutions, including Biochemistry and Cellular and Molecular Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Mathematics, Genome Science and Technology, NIMBioS, and the Graduate School from University of Tennessee; Mathematics from Western Kentucky University; Mathematical and Theoretical Biology Institute from Arizona State University; Biological Sciences from Clemson University; Mathematics and Statistics from University of North Carolina, Greensboro; Mathematics from University of Nebraska; Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Colorado School of Mines; Biological Sciences from Old Dominion University; Mathematics from University of Kentucky; Society for Industrial and Applied Math.</p> <p>Several positive impacts resulted from this Conference. All presentations, except for the Keynote Address and Featured Talk, were presented by students. Students were provided ample time to present their talks and have discussions with audience members following each individual talk, and students presenting posters interacted with students as well as faculty during the allotted time for poster presentations. Additionally, students were given opportunities to gain information on academic and career development during the Career Panel and Graduate School Opportunities Showcase. Through attending talks and posters and interacting with faculty on the Career Panel and in the Graduate School Showcase, students learned about current techniques in mathematical biology. Additionally, a diverse group of participants (63% female, 9% Hispanic, 3% Black, and 1% American Indian) were funded by this grant. The development of this new group of researchers is important to the growth of mathematical biology, and the diversity of attendees enhances the breadth of perspectives of those working in this field.</p> <p>An evaluation of the Conference was conducted by NIMBioS staff in conjunction with the National Institute for STEM Evaluation and Research. The evaluation showed 95% of undergraduate respondents thought the Conference was successful in creating a forum through which they could present research and make new connections at the interface of math and biology, and 98% of respondents indicated they would recommend participating in this conference to their colleagues. Additionally, 75% of respondents indicated participating in the Conference helped them make connections with others in the interdisciplinary field of math and biology. Finally, a majority of undergraduate respondents indicated they had a better understanding of career opportunities (84%) and undergraduate research (95%) at the interface of mathematics and biology as a result of attending this Conference.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/19/2019<br>      Modified by: Greg&nbsp;J&nbsp;Wiggins</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1833548/1833548_10585663_1550596535092_URC18Networking--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1833548/1833548_10585663_1550596535092_URC18Networking--rgov-800width.jpg" title="URC18Networking"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1833548/1833548_10585663_1550596535092_URC18Networking--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="URC18Networking"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students participating in networking activity.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Greg Wiggins</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Greg&nbsp;J&nbsp;Wiggins</div> <div class="imageTitle">URC18Networking</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1833548/1833548_10585663_1550596589059_URC18Poster--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1833548/1833548_10585663_1550596589059_URC18Poster--rgov-800width.jpg" title="URC18Poster"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1833548/1833548_10585663_1550596589059_URC18Poster--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="URC18Poster"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student presenting research poster.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Greg Wiggins</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Greg&nbsp;J&nbsp;Wiggins</div> <div class="imageTitle">URC18Poster</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1833548/1833548_10585663_1550596644865_URC18Talk--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1833548/1833548_10585663_1550596644865_URC18Talk--rgov-800width.jpg" title="URC18Talk"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1833548/1833548_10585663_1550596644865_URC18Talk--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="URC18Talk"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student giving research talk.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Greg Wiggins</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Greg&nbsp;J&nbsp;Wiggins</div> <div class="imageTitle">URC18Talk</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
