<AbstractNarration>With the slowing down of Moore's Law, traditional 2D scaling is not expected to deliver the area, power, and performance benefits the semiconductor industry has been counting on.  Thus, the time has come to go vertical, accommodating processor cores, accelerators, cache, and main memory in the same package. There are two ways of doing this: use through-silicon vias (TSVs) or monolithic 3D integration. TSVs do not have memory-on-logic stacking success stories.  Monolithic 3D integration uses monolithic inter-tier vias that have a much smaller diameter than TSVs, and enable many different design styles: transistor-level monolithic, gate-level monolithic, and block-level monolithic.  While fabrication and test techniques for monolithic 3D integration are maturing, monolithic 3D system architectures have not been investigated in depth.  The work on this project fills this gap. The methodologies and tools developed under this grant will be made available on the web. They will also be made available to the industry.  The material will be included in course materials, and under-represented graduate students will be attracted to this research through Princeton Fellowships.  Results will be disseminated through research articles and seminars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are various "walls" confronting computer system architects these days.  The Power Wall constrains the portion of the chip that can be powered on.  This is also known as the dark silicon problem.  The Memory Wall prevents efficient access to off-chip memory. Monolithic 3D integration has the potential to significantly alleviate the problems associated with these walls, especially for abundant-data problems, such as machine learning and inference, which are becoming commonplace. This project seeks to improve the energy efficiency of monolithic 3D system architectures by a factor of 500 relative to traditional system architectures.  It will do so by exploiting synergies across the device, logic, memory, accelerator, micro-architecture, chip multiprocessor, and monolithic 3D IC levels of the design hierarchy, providing a common computation platform from high-performance mobile devices to data centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
