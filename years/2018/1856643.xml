<AbstractNarration>The conference "Geometric Representation Theory and Low Dimensional Topology" will take place at the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences in Edinburgh, Scotland, June 10-14, 2019. There will be a summer school June 3-7 with several lecture series to provide background material for early career participants in the conference. The overall goal of the conference is to study interactions between the two areas of mathematics in the title. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Topology" is the study of shapes that are allowed to stretch and bend. For example, a triangle and circle are considered to be topologically equivalent because one can be stretched into the other, and similarly a cube and sphere are considered topologically equivalent. "Low dimensional topology" studies shapes or objects in dimensions 2, 3, and 4, such as surfaces, or knotted loops in 3-dimensional space. This can be useful in other sciences; for example, DNA can be knotted, or the shape of the universe could have a nontrivial topology. "Representation theory" is the study of symmetries in mathematics, and at a concrete level, these symmetries often manifest themselves as solutions to systems of equations where the variables represent matrices instead of numbers. This mathematical area has also had applications in other sciences, such as symmetries of elementary particles in physics, or symmetries of molecules in&lt;br/&gt;chemistry. There are sophisticated mathematical techniques for taking certain spaces of solutions to polynomial equations and producing solutions to matrix equations, and recently low dimensional topology has been used to find solutions to the same equations, using completely different mathematical constructions. One of the goals of the conference is to understand this new phenomenon using ideas coming from mathematical physics. This award will fund participation of early career US scientists in this summer school and conference so they can learn about these exciting new ideas.More details about the conference are available at https://www.icms.org.uk/geometricrepresentation.php.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The summer school and conference brought together an array of world experts in geometric representation theory and low-dimensional topology. This grant partially funded the participation of early-career US based researchers in the summer school and conference.  Geometric representation theory involves the study of symmetries in mathematical and physicals systems, using diverse techniques in algebraic geometry, differential equations, and noncommutative algebra. It has experienced tremendous growth in recent years, as the mathematical community has come to understand the strength of its applications to representation theory &ndash; the study of symmetries of matrix algebras, associative algebras, Lie algebras, and their associated homogeneous spaces.  Low-dimensional topology studies the nature of space in dimensions 1, 2, 3 and 4 in which we understand our universe to exist. A basic paradigm in this field is that in order to get a handle on spatial structures &ndash; such as configurations of particles, elementary fields in the presence of gravity, tangles of molecules, the inner workings of physical mechanical systems &ndash; we need tools to translate these questions into algebra, where we can do computations.  The most important theme which emerged from the blending of these diverse and storied mathematical themes is that the rich algebraic structures observed in geometric representation theory directly reflect meaningful and important properties of low-dimensional spaces, and give us new ways to study them algebraically.
