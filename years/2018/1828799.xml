<AbstractNarration>Hawaii is a world-class setting for exploring changes associated with lava flows, ecological invasions, landscape disturbance, and sea level rise, but local researchers often lack access to data of sufficient resolution and positional accuracy to quantify changes of interest. This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award will make the acquisition of a laser scanning robotic system with differential GPS capability possible. This system can collect dense three-dimensional environmental datasets with survey-grade positional accuracy to measure environmental processes and changes that cannot presently be detected. The system will improve the accuracy and performance of existing instrumentation, including small unmanned aerial systems, and will also allow a rapid response to record changes produced by episodic events like earthquakes, landslides, and tsunamis. This system will advance current knowledge in Hawaiian terrestrial ecology, geomorphology, marine science, geology, and anthropology, with direct impacts on research, education, and interdisciplinary collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of this laser scanning robotic total station system with differential GPS capability and computational will allow repeat collection and processing of precise and accurately geo-located fine-scale spatial data This instrument can generate dense (10^6+), survey-grade, three-dimensional point cloud measurements and imagery of the landscape with sub-centimeter accuracy. This degree of accuracy is required for detecting fine-scale changes relating to geomorphology, vegetation dynamics, volcanology, archaeology, and sea-level rise, and is well beyond current institutional capacity. This instrument will boost the sensitivity and overall utility of existing instrumentation for spatial data collection, including the use of small unmanned aerial systems for high resolution mapping. The equipment and resulting datasets will be housed and maintained by the University of Hawaii at Hilo and will be made available to researchers at this institution as well as to the broader research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Due to their isolation, Hawaii and the broader Pacific suffer from a lack of high resolution geospatial data. These are also dynamic settings, constantly changing through processes including volcanic eruptions, erosion, ecological invasions, sea-level rise, and human activity. The funds from this grant were used to purchase equipment that now allow us to collect very high-resolution (sub-cm accuracy) three-dimensional geospatial data to measure and detect fine-scale changes in the landscape in a way that was previously impossible. This equipment is being used across the Hawaiian Islands and the Pacific (in the Republic of the Marshall Islands) for a diverse set of research projects and public outreach events.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intellectual Merit</span>: During the late stages of the 2018 Lower East Rift Zone eruption of Kilauea Volcano, differential GPS equipment purchased with this grant was used to geo-reference high-resolution drone imagery of the eruption area. This allowed us to produce data of higher quality and measure lava flow changes over time with lower errors. Some of these data have been published as part of a USGS Data Release (Zoeller et al. 2020) and will be used in other publications. The summit of Maunakea is an area of high cultural, anthropologic, and scientific importance, and also the site of ongoing challenges associated with erosion. The equipment purchased with this grant was used to continue a multi-year erosion study and to collect new terrestrial lidar data and ground control point measurements. Some of these data were used re-process older datasets to a higher degree of accuracy, to detect gully features and ground-creep processes that have been previously too subtle to measure. This equipment was also used by Kimo Melcher, a native Hawaiian graduate student in UH Hilo's TCBES MA program, in a similar study on the island of Molokai, to generate baseline topographic data and identify erosion ?hotspots? for Keawanui, a heavily eroded dryland watershed above an important fishpond restoration project. M&#257;healani Pai, a native Hawaiian graduate student in UH Hilo's Heritage Management MA program, used the equipment to construct a 3-dimensional dataset of a large temple site-- Hapaiali&#699;i Heiau-- in Keauhou, Hawaii.&nbsp; This heiau is part of a large chiefly cultural complex and centerpiece for cultural education throughout the state and the collected data are being used to study astronomical alignments, labor involved in construction, and effects of sea-level rise on the coastal architecture. The differential GPS equipment has been used to establish accurate ground control for a variety of vegetation monitoring research projects across Hawaii Island and on Arno atoll (Republic of the Marshall Islands) relating to Rapid Ohia Death, invasive species, sea-level rise, and ungulate impacts on native vegetation.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Broader Impacts:</span>&nbsp;The equipment purchased through this grant allowed us to provide improved lava monitoring information during the late stages of a volcanic eruption on Hawaii Island. This equipment also allowed &gt;12 UH Hilo students to gain unprecedented experience during a disaster as part of the UH Hilo DRONE 1 response team, working closely with the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency and USGS. This equipment has also been used to generate data for multiple Masters Thesis projects in the UH Hilo Heritage Management and TCBES MA programs. In support of those (and additional) research projects, five undergraduate UH Hilo students have worked closely with the equipment in the field, gaining valuable experience. The equipment has been used for multiple outreach events held at public schools on Moloka&#699;i (Moloka&#699;i High School) and Hawaii Island (Keaau Middle School), and on the UH Hilo campus (2020 Ellison Onizuka Day), collectively exposing &gt;100 Hawaiian middle and high schools students to this technology and scientific applications.
