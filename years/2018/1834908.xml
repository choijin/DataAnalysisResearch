<AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support for undergraduate student participation in the Laser Science XXXIV Conference.  This conference is the annual meeting of the APS Division of Laser Science (DLS), and will be held in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Optical Society of America.  The conference program includes many of the research topics central to Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics.  The support of students through this award makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists. Students who graduate with a background in laser science acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting is scheduled to be held Washington DC September 16-20, 2018.  It offers an opportunity for undergraduate students to present their research results and to interact with senior scientists primarily from the United States, but also the broader international community. Support is provided only for US students (students enrolled in US universities).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The eighteenth annual DLS Symposium on Undergraduate Research at LS-XXXIV was held in Washington, DC on Monday, 17 September, 2018.   Again the schedule was very different from previous years for two significant reasons.  First, the meeting was scheduled for mid-September, a month earlier than the traditional mid-October dates, and this caused considerable squeezing in the planning and preparation. Second, the sessions were scheduled differently since there was no preceding plenary session as there usually has been.  Needless to say, we were able to adapt to the new schedule just as we did last year with help from the OSA meetings people.  Monday morning was unscheduled and the students used the time to mount their posters and become further acquainted with one another.  Our Symposium events began at noon with the luncheon in the Ballroom East room of the Washington Hilton.  We had a sandwich lunch for our participants and several guests, who spoke extemporaneously to the assembled group on a variety of topics initiated by student questions.  The guests were primarily mentors, and the exchanges were lively and stimulating.  The 1:00 PM ending time came all too soon. The guests included Nobel Laureates Bill Phillips and David Wineland, Meggers Prize recipient Warren Warren, SPS director Brad Conrad, newly elected OSA Fellow Anne Kelley, and mentors Kristan Corwin, Samir Bali,  Hong Lin, and others. There was considerable description of the imminent changeover of the definition of the kg. The exchanges were lively and stimulating, and the 1:00 PM ending came all too soon. The students were especially fortunate this year to have so many highly visible optical scientists meet and talk with them during the lunch. We heard inspiring remarks and lively discussion from several of these distinguished guests.  It was gratifying that these very young scientists could give their first presentations at a professional meeting, and it was clearly a memorable event for them. Twenty-one of this year's presenters were female, an impressive representation of more than 40%.  Many of the students remained at the meeting one or more extra days to hear talks or visit exhibits. Some were thrilled to meet famous and/or highly visible scientists, including the authors of some of their textbooks.  Judging from the enthusiastic notes that accompanied their final expense reports, the student participants will surely remember this opportunity throughout their professional lives.     Some of the comments were:  My experience with the DLS symposium was great. I was able to network with different individuals. The poster session allowed me to explore other topics in this field.  I was also able to see similar experiments that would open up other aspects of my research.  &hellip;  I would like to thank you for letting me involved in such an amazing experience. One of the best parts of attending the conference was being able to meet other students and talk to them about their research interests and career goals. Overall, the conference was a wonderful experience. For me, the biggest advantage was being able to see the wide scope of the field of optics and to hear the visionary talks. I feel that many times, the applications and big picture view of what we're learning in class are forgone in favor of stressing the math and concepts. &hellip; I left the conference with a better appreciation of the work that we do and of optics&hellip;  In between the sessions and during the poster session, I was able to make some great connections and I learned a lot about potential paths my career might go down -- I was especially interested in learning how scientists and writers become involved in scientific journals.              In addition to the financial support, the Symposium benefited from several intangible support modes (priceless). Of course, the DLS provided the schedule space so that it could be held at all.  But very strong support also came from OSA.  The meetings department provided the poster boards and numbering system, and especially the use of the meeting room at the hotel.  OSA also allowed us to vary the schedule of sessions from the block scheduling of all its other sessions, and was kind enough to include these changes in its program.  In addition, they provided printed copies of the symposium program in every single registration package for all attendees at FiO/LS, not simply those of DLS members.  This was greatly appreciated. Finally, they registered all the students en masse to reduce the work for us. The key meetings dept. people are Marjorie Morgan and Marsha Semelfort..
