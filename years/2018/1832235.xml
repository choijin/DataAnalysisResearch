<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the 2018 Yamabe Memorial Symposium on "Moduli Spaces in Algebraic Geometry" held at the University of Minnesota on September 28-30, 2018. Spurred by developments in algebraic geometry, as well as in other areas of mathematics and physics, new and exciting aspects of the theory of moduli have emerged. The purpose of this symposium is to bring participants a deeper understanding of recent discoveries in these areas. At the same time, the meeting will provide a valuable opportunity for graduate students and junior researchers to interact with, and learn from, leading mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developments in birational geometry and the minimal model program have led to progress in the study of moduli of higher-dimensional varieties. Another source of inspiration has come from string theory in physics, in particular from its predictions about enumerative geometry of curves in algebraic varieties. Yet another newer strand resulting in part from the same influence is the study of moduli in logarithmic geometry and in tropical geometry. The goal of the symposium is to help participants gain a wider perspective of these new developments. It is anticipated that a long-lasting benefit of the conference will be the stimulation of innovative developments in mathematics research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information can be found at the symposium web site &lt;br/&gt;https://math.umn.edu/news-events/yamabe-2018&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

It was a top-level conference that benefited U. S. graduate students and junior researchers.  The eight Yamabe Memorial Symposium took place from Friday to Sunday, September 28 - September 30, 2018. The topic of the symposium was "Moduli Problems in Algebraic Geometry". Eight mathematicians gave one-hour talks in the Yamabe Symposium. The conference was well attended, with over 50 registered participants. A majority of the participants were graduate students and young researchers from the United States. In total, in addition to the speakers, about 25 out-of-town participants were partially supported for their expenses, thanks to the funds made available to us by the NSF.   One specific objective was to advance areas of mathematics related to the interests of Hidehiko Yamabe, which touched in a substantial and ground-breaking way on several quite different areas of mathematics, all of which may be roughly described as having significant geometric aspects.   The project has provided training and professional development for many graduate students and young researchers. It also provided them with an opportunity to meet with senior and top researchers in the field of algebraic geometry and share their research with them.
