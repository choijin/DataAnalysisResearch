<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Hannah Alpert was funded as a postdoctoral research fellow at Ohio State University during summer 2018 and academic year 2018-2019, and at University of British Columbia during summer 2019 and academic years 2019-2020 and 2020-2021.  During that time, she pursued research on the geometry and topology of configuration spaces of disks, as well as on other geometric and topological topics.  Two papers were published in research journals during that period, three became ready to appear, one was submitted, and one other was initially submitted but was then held for substantial revisions.  Research on several other topics was started during the grant period, including a new draft of the paper held for revision and three other collaborations with papers still being written.  The Fellow also gave 18 research talks during the grant period.  A configuration space of disks is the set of all ways to arrange a fixed number of disks, all of the same fixed radius, inside a fixed region in the plane without any overlaps.  One application of studying such spaces is in robotics, imagining each of the disks to represent a robotic car, and the planar region to represent an open room such as a warehouse floor.  How can the cars move around each other in a tight space, so that each car can get to its destination?  Another application is in physics, related to the hard spheres gas model.  In the hard spheres gas model, instead of configurations of disks in a region in the plane, we consider configurations of spheres in a region in three-dimensional space, imagining each of the spheres as a single molecule and the region as their container.  The model forgets the attracting and repelling forces between the molecules and uses only the configuration space to predict whether the substance is a solid, liquid, or gas.  In addition to the configuration space topic, much of the Fellow's research considered the global geometry of Riemannian manifolds.  A Riemannian manifold is a space that has different curvature at different points.  A two-dimensional example would be a leaf of lettuce.  The lettuce leaf is not allowed to stretch, but it is allowed to bend while remaining the same Riemannian manifold.  Gromov conjectured in the 1980s that if an n-dimensional Riemannian manifold has large positive scalar curvature at every point, then the manifold roughly follows the shape of an (n-2)-dimensional space.  The conjecture remains unsolved, but different groups of researchers have made progress on it from different points of view.  The Fellow, together with collaborators, proposed and partially solved a variant of this conjecture, in which positive scalar curvature is replaced by a hypothesis involving the volumes and topological characteristics of balls of radius 1 in the manifold.  During the grant period, the Fellow also engaged in a variety of professional activities other than preparing research for publication and presentation.  At the end of the first year of the fellowship, she co-organized a two-day research workshop, using separate grant funds from professors at the host institution.  The workshop brought together speakers and young attendees from many institutions across many states.  To prepare local graduate students for the workshop, the Fellow organized a preparatory reading seminar, in which the students read and presented papers on the topics the invited speakers were expected to talk about.  During the two summers funded by the grant, the Fellow taught in the MathILy summer program for high-school students, including developing a new two-week intensive course in topological data analysis.  During a third summer, between two academic years funded by the grant, she was funded by an NSF REU grant to lead a research project for six undergraduate students at the MathILy-EST REU.  The topic of the project was drawn directly from the configuration space research of the grant, and the work mentoring the students and finishing the research paper continued into the following academic year.  These teaching and mentoring activities incorporated the ongoing research of the fellow to help prepare younger students for the mathematics workforce.
