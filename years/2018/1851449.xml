<AbstractNarration>This award funds research in the economic theory of matching and signaling. Many economic and social interactions are well "described as two" sided markets. Examples include matching students to schools, residents to hospitals and workers to firms. Economists have studied all of these situations using the tools of economic theory. This research typically assumes that all parties know the consequences from any possible match, so that participating individuals can evaluate the benefits of any possible match. This assumption is not very realistic. For example, colleges do not directly know the ability of applicants. They do however have access to tests (such as the SAT) and other signals of ability. When applicants understand that tests and other signals will be used to assess underlying ability, they will prepare for the tests as well as attempt to manipulate the signals. This raises the possibility that such test preparation will make it more difficult for schools to accurately evaluate the ability of applicants, leading to schools using additional criteria to evaluate students (such as extracurricular activities). Applicants will of course respond to this by changing their extracurricular behavior. The result is an arms race with colleges looking at various school extracurricular activities, athletic participation, violin compositions, starting charities, etc. Students then engage in these activities because even though their signaling value is small when everyone is doing so, not engaging becomes a negative signal. A similar dynamic may exist in job markets. This award will fund research to understand  the underlying forces that govern this kind of strategic interaction between organizations who choose the criteria by which to evaluate applicants and the response of applicants to increasingly more demanding criteria. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic model will be a two-sided market of incomplete information. One side (applicants) have privately known abilities while the other side (schools or firms) use signals to infer the ability of students. In the absence of test preparation, standard positive assortative matching will match higher signaling students with higher quality schools. Test prep is a strategic choice by students that influences the inferences schools will make about ability, quite possibly decreasing the informativeness of the test. The decreased informativeness of test scores leads schools to add additional signaling variables related to ability, for example, taking advanced placement (AP) courses. While in the absence of manipulation, having taken AP courses might be informative about ability, once students learn that colleges pay attention to this, many students who have no interest in those courses may take them to "signal" their ability. This decreases the informativeness of this signal, just as test prep decreased the informativeness of tests. A central focus of the investigation is the endogeneity of potential signals chosen by the uninformed schools. Understanding the nature of this endogeneity will shed light on the vulnerability to manipulation of different activities and so the stability over time of equilibrium sets of signaling activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
