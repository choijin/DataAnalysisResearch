<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it provides structure and equipment for simulation and training of low-level to lethal radiation.  Simulated training for this type of infrequent, but high societal-cost disaster is critical to our national safety and homeland security.  This project's solution can be used for training the military, industry, fire and police departments, bomb squads, HAZMAT teams, paramedics, and emergency medicine physicians. The device may be ideal for training anyone who comes into contact, or who has the potential to come into contact with radiation. Training saves lives and money. This device allows safe training for events that might include loss of high intensity industrial radioactive sources (orphan sources) used in the oil drilling industry, radiological dispersal devices (RDD), radiological exposure devices (RED), nuclear accidents, or improvised nuclear devices (IND).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project uses RFID (radiofrequency identification) tags in combination with GPS (global positioning satellite) technology to mimic low-level to absolutely lethal level radiation without use of dangerous radioisotopes.  This is important because the vast majority of radiation training in the past has used low level actual radiation sources.  These sources pose both health and security risks.  A time-honored maxim in the radiation industry is ALARA ("as low as reasonably achievable").  Simply stated, radiation exposure should be a low as possible - ideally, it should be zero. This project's technology uses no ionizing radiation, and therefore is always as low as possible. This technology replicates high-intensity lethal radiation events that appear to be real on entry of first responders from a distance.  It also can mimic highly contaminated victims that require immediate medical treatment.  This allows simulation of events for the entire chain of first responders to physicians that treat the victims.  This is a disruptive change in the training for these incidents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This NSF I-Corps project investigated the potential commercialization of a simulated radiation detector using radio-frequency ID (RFID) and global positioning satellite (GPS) technology, capable of short-range and long-range simulation of radiation without the use of actual radioactive material.&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of prior training for radiation incidents has used actual low-level radioisotopes that pose a health and security risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;Training is important for first responders that may be involved in the initial period of an event such as industrial accident, nuclear reactor containment problem, orphan source, radiological dispersal devices (RDD, dirty bombs), radiological exposure devices (RED), or improvised nuclear devices (IND).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A frequently quoted maxim of radiation use is that of ALARA, As Low As Reasonably Achievable, which states that radiation exposure should be minimal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our device satisfies ALARA, as it requires no radioactive material.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Simulation of complex, high-risk, low-incidence events has become commonplace in medicine, and in the airline industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of simulation training has only recently been appreciated in the nuclear and radiation industries, despite the potential for costly, devastating accidents.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>During this project we interviewed 100 individuals involved in the radiation, nuclear, and first responder industries.&nbsp;&nbsp;Interviews were done in-person, by video, or by phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;Interviewees included representatives from government response agencies such as police, sheriff, fire, HAZMAT, EMS, and FBI; as well as public health officials, radiation safety officers, health physicists, a reactor operator, and scientists at the National Labs.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also interviewed ex-radiation workers involved in prior disasters, anti-radiation activists, physicians, ER nurses, toxicologists, medical simulation facility educators, and helicopter paramedics.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We asked interviewees about their radiation training, how that training was done, if actual radiation was used, the frequency of radiation training, if they have ever used simulation in their training program, and if so, was it valuable?&nbsp;&nbsp;For some first responders we posed various plausible scenarios involving human rescue, and asked if their previous training provided a solution to the dilemma.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also asked if they actively used radiation in their work, and if they could recall an actual event.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The results of the interviews were widely varied.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who frequently used radiation, or who worked at facilities with substantial radiation risk at their work site were most likely to have radiation training.&nbsp;Training at these sites was frequent, while radiation exercises were infrequent for other interviewees.&nbsp;&nbsp;Radiation training for first responders, except HAZMAT teams, occurred less than once per year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many first responders had never had any radiation training, and those with training often acquired it in the military, not in their current profession.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The majority of training used actual radiation, either low-level (unlicensed) or moderate level (requiring NRC license).&nbsp;&nbsp;Some individuals cited ALARA or the potential public ramifications of a lost (orphan) training source as a reason to not use actual radiation.&nbsp;&nbsp;One individual stated that he preferred to do train by simulation, since he had already survived cancer, and did not want to risk any exposure.&nbsp;Another very experienced interviewee stated that training should be done with actual high-level radiation due to the fear factor.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Personnel of fire and police departments currently use simulation in their training.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many police departments have a shoot house, where they can stage events such as arrests, robberies, and hostage situations.&nbsp;Simulated ammunition is used, consisting of a plastic bullet, that hurts and produces bruises, but is nonlethal with appropriate protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;This allows SWAT teams to practice and perfect techniques without serious injury.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Many fire departments have analogous burn houses, where a controlled fire is set to practice fire suppression techniques, with minimal risk to trainees.&nbsp;&nbsp;A fire chief noted that there is a movement towards using special effects and virtual reality for burn houses, so that no actual fire is present, further reducing the chance of harm.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our inquiries using specific scenarios that required human rescue were revealing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire responders told us that they have been instructed to do what they always do in a radiation incident, despite the unique problems associated with these events.&nbsp;&nbsp;There did not seem to be existing, solved scenarios similar to those routinely practiced by SWAT teams, or fire suppression teams.&nbsp;&nbsp;This appears to be an important training issue that could be addressed by simulation with our device.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Survey of prior accidents revealed stories that ranged from humorous to truly terrifying.&nbsp;&nbsp;At one end of the spectrum was a lost partially eaten burrito from a patient with 131-iodine therapy for thyroid disease, at the other end was a plutonium fire at a nuclear weapons facility.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It is difficult to draw firm conclusions from a sample of only 100 individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we believe that simulation is needed to train first responders for radiation events, and that our simulated radiation detector can play a major role this training.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have developed a business plan to do so.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/26/2019<br>      Modified by: Robert&nbsp;F&nbsp;Stump</p> </div> <div
