<AbstractNarration>The Advanced Accelerator Concepts (AAC) Workshop is a biannual topical meeting under the auspices of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The AAC series of workshops is a major forum for the U.S. accelerator physics, engineering and technology community for the exchange and promulgation of the most advanced new ideas and concepts over the widest areas of application. An important part of maintaining this long term mission is the strong participation of students in the Workshop, where they become a part of the larger community of experts working for the continued evolution of new and unique accelerator physics concepts and technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will enable student participation for approximately 25 US PhD students to attend and present the results of their work at the 18th Advanced Accelerator Concepts Workshop in Breckenridge, Colorado from August 12 thru August 17, 2018. This meeting is expected to attract more than 300 accelerator scientists and engineers.  The Workshop will also include an event to promote diversity. This will be a Career Development Social that will feature a special guest, Dr. Patricia Rankin, a Professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and the current Chair of the APS Committee on Women in Physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
