<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to translate quantum communication technological breakthroughs into real-life applications. This goal will bring significant social and economic impacts as quantum communication has the potential to revolutionize the global telecommunication industry. Commercially, this vision provides countless opportunities to interact with a broad spectrum of entities such as telecom companies, financial firms, defense agencies and banking corporations. It is predicted that advanced quantum technologies driven by quantum information processing will revolutionize traditional communication methods by enabling the ultimate security for the transmission of cryptography keys, based on the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics which facilitate detecting any eavesdropping attempt on the encoded key.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is devoted to developing portable modular hardware necessary to build a protected cryptographic network immune to known attacks.  This technology is designed to overcome the main challenge of operation over extended distances of thousands of kilometers, as required to establish secure communication networks between cities and countries. The team has successfully designed and built commercialization-friendly quantum devices including quantum light sources, characterization units, and quantum memories aimed to store and transform quantum information in a manner needed for secure communication. These devices are room temperature operational and do not require cumbersome and expensive infrastructure, thus being ready for outside of the laboratory operation. This quantum toolbox is currently being used in different international locations as a test-bed of important capabilities, such as entanglement distribution, ultrafast operations, and satellite communication compatibility.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The grant: "I-Corps: Quantum hardware package for fully-secure long-distance data transfer" allowed us to participate in the ICorps program and for a first time, implement the customer discovery proposition process to the field of quantum communication. As a result of our participation, we determined that it was feasible to stablish a start up, Qunnect Inc. focused on developing the necessary technology to build quantum repeater networks.  This story is definitely a success to be advertised. Through the ICorps program, we developed a business plan towards commercialization of quantum repater technology, that allowed us to establish the company and seek further funding. I list below the milestones achieved by the company during and slightly after the ICorps 1 year program.  2nd, 3rd Qtr 2018 - Filed 3 U.S. Provisional Patent Applications:      Country    Application No.    Filing Date      US    62/649,275    3/28/2018      US    62/696,219    7/10/2018      US    62/729,788    9/11/2018         4th Qtr 2018 ? Accepted into the Center of Excellence in Wireless and Information Technology to be an Entrepreneur in Residence (EIR).    1st Qtr 2019 - Received a non-dilutive SBIR Phase 1 grant of $122k from DOE   2nd Qtr 2019 - Signed LOI with Accelerate NY for a seed fund of $100k   2nd Qtr 2019 ? Accepted into the Clean Energy Business Incubator Program (CEBIP).  3rd Qtr 2019 Completed a preliminary seed-fund round of 1 M.    4th Qtr 2019 Received a non-dilutive SBIR Phase 2 grant of $1.5 M from DOE   2nd Qtr 2020 Received a non-dilutive STTR Phase 1 grant of $ 135 k from DOD.  2nd Qtr 2020 Received a non-dilutive STTR Phase 1 grant of $ 150 k from NSF.  As it can be seen, the sucessful establishment and evolution of Qunnect Inc. as a first mover in the private sector for quantum communication technology is strongly rooted in the ICorps program and should be consider a great example on how to achieve a succesful transfer of technology developed in a quantum technology laboratory sponsored by NSF towards the private sector.  The company is currently preparing a first Series A investment round, and the business plan is still fully based upon what was developed during the ICorps interview process. Overall, I think this was a great success, particularly as it happened in the developing field of quantum technology.
