<AbstractNarration>This project explores new mathematical techniques that provide a scientific basis to understand the fundamental properties of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) controlled by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and guide their design. From simple logical constructs to complex deep neural network models, AI agents are increasingly controlling physical/mechanical systems. Self-driving cars, drones, and smart cities are just examples of AI-controlled CPS. However, regardless of the explosion in the use of AI within a multitude of CPS domains, the safety and reliability of these AI-controlled CPS is still an under-studied problem. This project includes activities integrated with education, so as to explore how learning through counterexamples works for AI, and to help with critical thinking skills for young students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates a new generation of formal method tools that are capable of simultaneously analyzing the cyber components (including AI-agents) and the physical components of CPS. This new generation of formal methods will be used to analyze the safety and reliability of AI-controlled CPS, characterize the environments for which the system is guaranteed to operate correctly and predict their failure at real-time. In addition, this project will address the problem of how to assign the blame of system failures in AI-controlled CPS. The proposed methods will be evaluated over two flagship testbeds (i) autonomous drones and (ii) self-driving cars. The project engages graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students, and reaches out to the scientific community by providing open source implementations of algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
