<AbstractNarration>This proposal will work on identifying non-invasive markers for traumatic brain injury (TBI). The proposal lays out a plan to verify  quantitative biomarkers for mild (m)TBI that persist in the weeks following an injury. The proposed research will partner with faculty and postdocs at the New York Medical College, the University of Colorado, the University of Pennsylvania, and the FDA. The proposal includes a well-designed mentoring plan to be implemented by the PI. The plan includes tracking progress through Individual Development Plans; informal discussions to assess satisfaction with the mentoring program' and tracking progress toward career goals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will evaluate diffuse correlation spectroscopy as a noninvasive optical method for monitoring real-time changes in cerebral blood flow, in order to better inform medical interventions in the event of neurological injury or disease. This project will provide information on the types of changes that can be interrogated using the low-resolution diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) technique. Direct comparison to a high resolution technique will provide necessary information on sensitivity and specificity for DCS. The use of stimulated changes during monitoring will provide the types of necessary detail on the populations of blood vessels that can be assessed. Cerebral blood flow can be used to inform medical interventions in cases of neurological injury or disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
