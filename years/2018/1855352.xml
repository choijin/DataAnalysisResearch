<AbstractNarration>This proposal is submitted to request funding for the Research Vessel Rachel Carson operated by the University of Washington to conduct oceanographic research missions supported by the National Science Foundation.  The Marine Operations Department of the School of Oceanography of the University of Washington takes great pride in providing essential marine science research and educational facilities to NSF-funded investigators. The University of Washington remains committed to managing these facilities in a safe, cost-effective, and environmentally responsible manner.  The ship is the newest ship to join the U.S. Academic Research Fleet.  The R/V Rachel Carson will operate under the UNOLS RVSS safety standards as a UNOLS Operating institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic vessels, operated by the UNOLS academic institutions and funded by NSF, and other agencies, have been the traditional multi-use facilities required to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment. These ships working from the ocean's surface complemented by human-occupied, robotic and - more recently -- autonomous undersea vehicles and sensors, along with aircraft and satellites, continue to provide vital tools in our understanding of the role of the oceans in determining our climate and in studying and accessing the living and non-living resources of the world's seas and sea-beds.&lt;br/&gt;Proper stewardship over ocean resources and their wise use, and decision making for future ocean- and coastal- related issues are inconceivable without an interested and engaged citizenry.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to technology, our national ocean endeavor requires technical support in the form of expert human resources, with sound science, mathematics and technical education: a critical mass of individuals who will collect and analyze tomorrow's data, and design the tools, models and applications we will require. Provision of these sea-going research and educational facilities enables marine scientists and students from the University of Washington and other institutions nationwide to study natural phenomena - and to instruct the future scientists and stewards of our marine ecosystems - on board state-of-the-art oceanographic research vessels complete with laboratories, sensors, analytical equipment, communications to shore-side investigators and educators, and full life support for extended missions. Essential to UW's mission is the provision of educational opportunities-both to students of the marine sciences, and, through educational outreach programs such as REVEL, "Teacher at Sea," to K through 12th grade students, nationwide. Periodically, The University holds open houses and outreach events to provide a learning experience for local students including tours through the ship facilities and hands-on demonstrations of marine science research guided by faculty, students and ships' crewmembers. In 2011, the School of Oceanography hosted the International Research Ship Operators conference at UW. The School of Oceanography hosted the UNOLS Research Vessel Operators Committee annual meeting at UW. During the conference, participants enjoyed the opportunity to tour and ride onboard for a "lunch" cruise from the Seattle waterfront, through the Ballard Locks, to the Oceanography Dock. The University of Washington, with the support of the National Science Foundation and with coordination by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System, remains dedicated to, and focused upon, furthering mankind's understanding of the world ocean, the living and non-living resources therein, and their interactions with the approximately fifty percent of our citizens who live within fifty miles of the shoreline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
