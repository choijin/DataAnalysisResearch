<AbstractNarration>This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project presents a much-needed, general framework for 3D printing of extruded polymers and investigates the bounding conditions that determine a successful processing window for a given machine and material combination. Continued development of specialized and high-performance material systems are needed for the application space  for extrusion-based 3D printing techniques to grow;  these resin materials can be costly, and with deposition rates exceeding 50 kg/h for certain systems, the prospect of trial-and-error based process development is not feasible, and a fundamental scientific understanding of the process is needed.  Fundamental printing criteria may be generally applied across multiple printing platforms to guide future process and material development as well as influencing current design decisions for 3D printing approaches. Such research is essential for important industrial sectors such as aerospace, automotive, medical products and defense. Thus, this project directly impacts American economic welfare and national security. The popularity of 3D printing among today's youth (K-12 through college) also makes it the perfect platform to attract and inspire the next generation of engineers, including underrepresented minorities and women,  and introduce complex topics such as rheology and composite materials in a tangible, accessible manner with clear implications on resulting component quality and performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to identify the fundamental laws of nature that dominate the behavior of extrusion-based 3D printing of polymers. A generalized viscoelastic framework is planned for multiple modes of extrusion-based 3D printing across multiple platforms that incorporates specific pass/fail criteria.  For each printing mode, a fundamental bounding equation is planned that dominates the behavior of the system and predicts the success or failure of the printing process under given operating conditions. This project will focus on the first two modes of extrusion-based deposition; namely the pressure-driven extrusion of viscoelastic material through a circular orifice and the formation of a stable geometry. The bounding equations for each mode will be refined by exploring the processing parameter space of several relevant polymer systems in the processing region about the boundary condition.  The result of each research task will be a refined and validated boundary equation that may be applied across multiple platforms and material compositions. As the bounding equations for each of the printing modes are refined, they will be combined into a "processing space map" framework that will guide future innovations in material properties and successful 3D printing processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The development of new materials for 3D printing has traditionally been an Edisonian trial-and-error approach.  This research project developed and validated a series of viscoelastic constitutive equations to predict flow behaviors and appropriate printing conditions based on the fundamental thermo-physical and rheological properties of materials.  Thermoplastic polymers demonstrate a non-Newtonian behavior under the range of shear rates that are typically experienced in both large-scale and desktop 3D printing platforms.  During printing, shear-thinning polymers experience extremely high shear rates in the extrusion screw (&gt; 1000 s-1), and the viscosity can drop by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared to the near-zero shear viscosity experienced when a deposited bead is cooling.  This project developed analytical models to predict the evolution of pressure within the extrusion screw and nozzle in order to determine realistic processing bounds for the deposition of fiber-reinforced materials.  For instance, the deposition of ABS was studied using a desktop printer over a temperature range of 210-250C.  The viscoelastic models correctly predicted that the volumetric flowrate would fall short of the desired value at the lower temperatures.  However, since 3D printing of complex structures involves intricate geometries, the deposition system is constantly transitioning between start/stop conditions and the transient pressures differences can be significant.  As part of this work, a new nozzle was designed and instrumented with a high frequency pressure sensor for installation on the BAAM system. It was found that the pressure predicted for steady state operation underestimated the pressures experienced during transient conditions (start/stop) by 30% to 150%.  These high-pressure excursions can have a significant impact on the types of materials that can be successfully deposited under specific conditions.  In order to provide some practical guidance, processing space maps were generated to indicate safe processing zones inside of boundaries that were defined by the material viscoelastic properties.  These maps will inform future development efforts of high-performance composites materials for 3D printing.           Last Modified: 10/02/2020       Submitted by: Chad E Duty]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
