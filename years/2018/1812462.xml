<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in a workshop on the mathematical programming system Macaulay2 to be held April 14-17, 2018 at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Macaulay2 is a free, open-source technical programming language for computation in research mathematics. Macaulay2 is developed through an "app" model: individual researchers write packages with specialized capabilities that are then made available (for free) through Macaulay2's website, for use by other researchers. These workshops provide a setting where groups of less-experienced programmers learn to develop high quality packages with the support of Macaulay2's core developers. In addition, the workshop includes professional development activities for early career mathematicians, including opportunities to speak on their own research, and panel discussions on jobs and developing a research program. More details are available at the conference website: https://juliettebruce.github.io/M2-Wisconsin-2018/ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At last count, Macaulay2 had 119 built-in packages, many of which have been developed at workshops such as this. The capabilities of Macaulay2 grow in response to research interests of the community, and this allows Macaulay2 to quickly create and distribute resources for new and emerging fields. At this workshop, the packages to be developed will include: FI-modules, Schur functors of complexes, the simplex method, random monomial ideals, and more. In addition, this meeting will be unique among Macaulay2 workshops because it will engage researchers from number theory and applied algebra, which have not been traditional foci of Macaulay2's development. This presents a unique opportunity for Macaulay2 to develop capabilities that will be useful to those communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We held a workshop at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, April 14-17, 2018, focused on creating new packages for Macaulay2 -- an open source computer algebra system -- by bringing together developers and users of all skill levels and experience.  The workshop had 50 participants from 20 different institutions (primarily focused on Midwestern institutions) and included a wide range of Macaulay2 users.  It included numerous experts and numerous novices and everyone in between.  It included many (42/50) early career participants (student or postdoc).  The workshop lasted for 5 days and included ample time for package development, as well as several professional development activities. This event was organized by Juliette Bruce, Daniel Erman, Steven Sam, and Jay Yang. Computer algebra is an essential part of modern research in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, number theory, and applied algebra. There are many computer algebra systems, but Macaulay2 is one of only two developed and funded within the United States (Sage is the other), and Macaulay2 has been especially important for homological computations.  Macaulay2 is open source, with many of its functionalities developed by users in the form of packages. This packge-based model has proven incredibly successful, as it allows Macaulay2 to be driven by the needs of its users, and to continually adapt to changing research trends within these fields. These workshops are the foundation for this model: developing new packages is challenging and technical, and having easy access to expert coders has been essential in yielding the large number of high-quality, well documented packages that are now essential to Macaulay2's expanding functionality.  Intellectual Merit: Significant progress was made on at least 9 different packages for Macaulay2, covering a wide range of mathematical topics including: random monomial ideals; FI-modules; virtual resolutions for toric varieties; and Schur functors of complexes.  Many new users gained fluency in the Macaulay2 programming language.  The work also seeded collaborations between participants. Graduate students had the opportunity to give short presentations on their own research.  Learning Macaulay2 is a key research skill for many graduate students and postdocs, and thus workshop will likely thus have a positive impact on the research careers of the 42 early career mathematicians who attended.   Broader Impacts: Early career mathematicians had the opportunity to learn new computational skills through package development; learn new mathematical tools for research through hands-on collaboration with first-rate researchers; present short talks on their own research and receive feedback from fellow researchers; attend professional development events focused on combining research and computation and on getting a job at a teaching-focused institution.
