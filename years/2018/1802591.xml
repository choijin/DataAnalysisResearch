<AbstractNarration>Recent reforms in services for people with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (ID/DD) have been oriented toward increasing the individual's opportunity for autonomy and a normal life in the community. However, adults with ID/DD show poor outcomes on almost all indicators of successful adulthood. This project examines the influence of the tension between the need for care and encouragement of autonomy on the adult lives of people with ID/DD. More specifically, this study investigates disabled adulthood as a collection of care arrangements--created by significant others, programs, and government support--that shapes the opportunities for autonomy. This research has three goals: to assess the design of a novel independent living program for high functioning adults with ID/DD, to contribute to the literature on the ethics of care, and to situate the regulations governing state and federal funding for disability in the context of the daily life of adults with ID/DD.  Findings from this study have the potential for broader impacts through influence on government policy concerning care and directly on caregiving for adults with ID/DD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use ethnographic research, interviews, and qualitative analysis of government regulations and assessment tools to investigate disabled adulthood as a set of arrangements balancing care and autonomy. On the micro level, this study will describe the process of negotiating the relationship between care and autonomy for adults, family members, and staff at an independent living program. On the program level, this study will assess the program design and operation of a novel type of independent living program, one that provides as-needed care to individuals with ID/DD who live in their own apartments. On the institutional level, this study will investigate the influence of government regulations for entitlement programs like Medicaid, SSI/SSDI, and food stamps on the adult lives of people with ID/DD, including their ability to make autonomous decisions and to engage in adult behaviors like employment, marriage, and the activities of daily life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project, Doctoral Dissertation Research: The Autonomy of Adults with Developmental Disabilities, funded 18 months of ethnographic observation at an independent living program for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities which I call Moving Toward Independence in the Community (MTIC). This included 30 staff meetings, 20 Medicaid Individualized Service Plan meetings, and 109 meetings between adult participants and staff. The Co-PI, Adrianna Munson, also attended over 50 program activities from trivia night at a local bar, a knitting class which she taught, work internships, and a weekend trip to Williamsburg Virginia. In addition, Munson completed 38 interviews with participants? parents and siblings.</p> <p>These observations and interviews provide a fuller picture of community support for people high functioning developmental disabilities, an under researched population. A major finding is that autonomy is an ongoing, daily project to become more independent rather than a permanent accomplishment. By framing autonomy as an ongoing project, adult participants at MTIC are considered to be autonomous when they make measured progress toward independent living goals <em>even if they remain dependent</em> in other areas of their lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This research has resulted in three published papers and two working papers to date:</p> <ul> <li>Munson, Adrianna Bagnall. 2020. ?Framing Life as Work: Navigating Dependence and Autonomy in Independent Living.? <em>Qualitative Sociology</em> 43(1):89?109. doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11133-019-09438-8">10.1007/s11133-019-09438-8</a>.</li> <li>Altomonte, Guillermina, and Adrianna Bagnall Munson. 2021. ?Autonomy on the Horizon: Comparing Institutional Approaches to Disability and Elder Care.? <em>Theory and Society</em>. doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11186-021-09434-4">10.1007/s11186-021-09434-4</a>.</li> <li>Munson, Adrianna Bagnall. ?How to Become an Adult.? <em>Contexts</em>, Summer 2021.</li> <li>Munson, Adrianna.
