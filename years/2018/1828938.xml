<AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support for student participation in the 2018 Quantum Science Gordon Research Conference: Non-Equilibrium Quantum Matter and Scalable Quantum Computing.  The conference program includes many of the research topics central to Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics, and also Quantum Information Science. The support of students through this award makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists. Students who graduate with a background in quantum information science acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting is scheduled to be held at Stonehill College in Easton, MA from July 29th to August 3rd 2018.  It offers an opportunity for students to present their research results and to interact with senior scientists primarily from the United States, but also the broader international community. Support is provided only for US students (students enrolled in US universities).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
