<AbstractNarration>This conference support helps the organization of NERCCS 2018: The First Northeast Regional Conference on Complex Systems. This conference will provide a much-needed venue for interdisciplinary scholarly exchange for researchers in a variety of disciplines who share common interests in complex systems, that is, systems made of many interacting components. Complex systems arise in a wide variety of disciplines, such as social and organizational sciences, biology and medicine, computer science and mathematics, engineering and information technology, and so on. Making such an interdisciplinary venue available to researchers (especially those in early stages of their career) at a conference will be particularly important and helpful for the promotion of interdisciplinary, multi-institutional collaborations, leading to stronger scientific research programs and future discoveries. The conference schedule will also include a one-day educational session for students, postdocs and junior faculty who are new to complex systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NERCCS 2018: The First Northeast Regional Conference on Complex Systems aims to establish a venue of interdisciplinary scholarly exchange for complex systems researchers to share their research outcomes through presentations and post-conference online publications, network with their peers, and promote inter-campus collaboration and the growth of the research community. NERCCS 2018 will particularly focus on facilitating the professional growth of early career faculty, postdocs, and students who have only limited resources but will likely play a leading role in the field of complex systems science and engineering in the coming years. To achieve this objective, registration fees will be waived for all student/postdoc authors whose submissions are accepted for presentation, and they will also receive an opportunity to publish their work after the conference in a newly developed open-access online journal, free of charge. The new online journal, Northeast Journal of Complex Systems (NEJCS), will be created in collaboration with the Binghamton University Library. All of these features of the conference will contribute to the professional growth and retention of those young talents in system sciences, who will likely become the leaders of US academia and industries in the next decades.</AbstractNarration>
