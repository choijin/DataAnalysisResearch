<AbstractNarration>With this CAREER award, The Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division and the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering Program in the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport System Division are funding Professor Todd Hyster in the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University.  This research develops new catalysts based on the modification of enzymes, i.e. biocatalysts, for the synthesis of heterocycles. Aromatic heterocycles are and important component of agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. Strategies to prepare and modify aromatic heterocycles using environmentally-friendly biocatalysts are underdeveloped. Professor Hyster's laboratory uses light and enzymes to develop new biocatalytic reactions that produce heterocycles.  Consequently, the students who undertake the research acquire work skills that are essential for a variety of science and engineering careers. In concert with this research, the Hyster lab engages in a series of outreach activities to expand the public's awareness of the role of biocatalysis in daily lives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enzymes are attractive catalysts for chemical synthesis because they can be tuned to provide unparalleled levels of efficiency and selectivity for even the most challenging organic reactions. However, the use of biocatalysts has been relegated to reactions found in nature. The goal of this project is to develop novel biocatalysts for the selective synthesis of novel, nitrogen-containing heterocycles. This is achieved by developing enzymatic strategies that affect the redox properties of the heterocycle to facilitate single electron transfer reactions. Fundamental studies are conducted to elucidate how the enzymes activate the heterocycle for electron transfer and control the stereochemical outcome of subsequent transformations. The education plan focuses on outreach events that target a broad range of people, from K-12 students to college students and to the public at large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
