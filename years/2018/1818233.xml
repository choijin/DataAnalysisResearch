<AbstractNarration>This proposal is for support of a travel IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) PerCom 2014 to be held in Athens, Greece, March 19 - 23, 2018.  The purpose of this trip is to support approximately 15 - 20 students in the field of Pervasive Computing and Communications. PerCom 2018 will provide a leading edge scholarly forum for researchers, engineers, and students alike to share their state-of-the art research and developmental work in the broad areas of pervasive computing and communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will provide the students with the opportunity to attend presentations of cutting-edge research results representing the state-of-the-art in pervasive computing, systems and applications.  The attendees are offered a diversity of interactive forums, technical sessions, targeted workshops, interesting poster sessions, and exciting demonstrations. Students will have the opportunity to interact with the world's leading researchers in pervasive computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
