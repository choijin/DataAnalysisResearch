<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for three conferences in economic history: the 2015 and 2016 Cliometrics Conference and the 2017 World Congress of the Cliometric Society. The research topics bring together economics with statistics, demography, political science, sociology, anthropology, and archaeology. The goal is to use scientific methods to analyse historic data sources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Papers presented at the conference are chosen in response to an open call for submission. Particular attention in selection goes to graduate students and new scholars. The steady mixing of newly trained and experienced researchers creates a unique intellectual environment that has worked to increase participation in this field of economics. The result is that young scholars receive the stimulation and encouragement to build strong scientific records in this interdisciplinary field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of the project is to organize conferences of cliometricians of all ranks and from all over the world to present their research, interact, and form networks.  The project helped to fund the annual Cliometrics Conferences of 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019 as well as the World Congress of Cliometrics in 2017.  'Cliometrics' is the quantitative study of history.  It is an interdisciplinary field, drawing from economics, history, statistics, demography, political science, sociology, anthropology, archaeology, and other social sciences.  In recent years, the field has become even broader by incorporating research and findings from anatomy, climatology, and biology.  The focus of cliometrics has been on the application of economic theory and quantitative analysis to a wide range of historical issues. At the simplest level, this consists of making observations of economic behavior and measuring variables relevant to the articulation or testing of an economic theory or model. Human experience, however, is complex, and cliometricians also seek to examine the forces underlying the development of institutions and government, in order to understand the long-term patterns of economic development throughout the world. The complexities of interpreting the human experience are compounded by the fact that historical data seldom appear in a form that readily fits the needs of the contemporary researcher. A major task on the cliometric agenda, therefore, has been the development of more and better data with which to study the evolution and structural dynamics of national economies and the international economy.  An understanding of the historical record is crucial for the development of meaningful economic policy today and in the future.  Research in economic history sheds valuable light on policy options by combining the insights of economic theory with an historical perspective that allows one to interpret theory in the institutional context that is the product of past development.   The Cliometric conferences are unique in their design.  The focus is on discussion and providing feedback to scholars to advance their research agendas.  Conference participants are required to read the papers in advance.  Paper presenters are given only 5 minutes to summarize their research and then all the remaining time is devoted to questions and comments from the audience.  The 2015 Annual Cliometric Conference was hosted at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 15-17 May 2015, with 62 participants from universities and agencies in the USA, Canada, UK, Ireland, Denmark, France, Japan, and Taiwan.   The 2016 Annual Cliometric Conference took place at the University of Pittsburgh, 20-21 May 2016.  The Conference was jointly hosted by the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University.  There were 59 participants from universities and agencies in the USA, UK, Ireland, France, Sweden, Australia, South Africa, and Colombia.   The 8th World Congress of Cliometrics was held at the Strasbourg Convention Center in Strasbourg, France from 4-7 July 2017. The Congress was hosted by the University of Strasbourg.  The 118 participants came from universities and agencies in the USA, UK, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Norway, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates.  The 2018 Annual Cliometric Conference was hosted at Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida, 27-28 April 2018, with 56 participants from universities and agencies in the USA, UK, Canada, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands.   The 2019 Annual Cliometric Conference was hosted at The Ohio State University Columbus, Ohio, 31 May to 1 June 2019, with 44 attendees from universities and colleges in the USA, UK, Canada, France, India, and Ireland.
