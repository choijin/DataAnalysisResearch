<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2018, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. The proposed research seeks to better understand the symbiotic bacteria that live inside the cells of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). These fungi play a major role in the nutrient absorption for almost all plants on the globe. The pursuit of more productive, sustainably produced crops requires the manipulation of plants, from breeding practices to genetics to modifying the microbes associated with them. AMF provide dramatic benefits to plant growth, making them important organisms to understand for the benefit of agriculture. It was only recently discovered that almost all AMF have unusual bacteria living inside of their cells. These bacteria form a symbiotic relationship with the AMF,  but these bacteria are not well studied. This research will provide critical insight into the identity and function of these bacteria. The project will involve undergraduate researchers at Cornell University from programs that increase the participation of underrepresented groups in science. The fellow will also produce a course on fungal symbioses that will serve as a model for active team-based learning methods and shared online as an open educational resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To study the bacteria of a wide range of different AMF, the research relies on the extensive collections of the International Culture Collection of Arbuscular (Vesicular) Mycorrhizal Fungi (INVAM) at West Virginia University, the largest collection of living AMF strains in the world. The Fellow will receive training in the use and upkeep of such strains. Specifically, the study aims to: (1) use single-fungal-cell next-generation DNA sequencing to sample the diversity of bacteria present in members of all known lineages of AMF; (2) produce phylogenetic analyses of DNA from selected endosymbiotic bacteria and AMF and compare their ancestral relationships, in order to discover historical patterns of association; and (3) analyze genomes of selected endosymbiotic bacteria to find clues to their function. This research is potentially transformative because we do not yet understand these bacteria and how they might benefit or disadvantage the fungus-plant symbiosis.  This work will also benefit INVAM by providing additional information about its accessioned strains and by serving as a model study for the necessity of its collections. The Fellow will also develop necessary experience in genomics and continue their broader scientific narrative in the evolution of symbioses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
