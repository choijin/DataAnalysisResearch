<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this I-Corps project is to investigate the challenges that data scientists face in debugging big data analytics today and to investigate the commercial potential of research work on interactive and automated debugging of big data analytics. Big data analytics is increasingly important in the 21st century, where our daily lives leave behind a detailed digital record. Decision-makers of all kinds, from companies to government agencies, would like to base their actions on data. If successful, this project will offer a unique opportunity to discover software development tooling needs for big data systems and to identify innovative software tooling products that sit across the software stack from the user-facing API all the way down to the systems infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project builds on early research work on real-time debugging primitives and tool-assisted fault-localization services for big data processing applications written in modern data intensive scalable computing (DISC) systems like Apache Spark. Designing debugging primitives for DISC requires re-thinking the traditional step-through debugging primitives as provided by tools such as gdb. For example, a breakpoint feature that simply pauses the entire computation would waste large amounts of computational resources and prevent correct tasks from completing, reducing overall throughput. Further, requiring the user to inspect the millions of intermediate records produced during execution is clearly infeasible. When a failure or incorrect result is generated (e.g., outlier), pinpointing the root cause is extremely time-consuming and expensive due to massive scale of data. In short, the intellectual merit of this I-Corps project is to investigate how users can benefit from expressive debugging primitives and automated fault localization services when they must leverage for data science and big data analytics capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The team participated in NSF I-Corps 2018 Fall San Diego Cohort Led by: IN-LA (Innovation Node-Los Angeles) and investigated whether the team's fundamental research on interactive and automated debugging technologies has a commercial potential and what could be the pathways to bring scientific discoveries closer to the development of technologies and products for data scientists and data engineers in software industry.   The team conducted over one hundred customer discovery interviews and found that (a) even though productivity is one of the biggest pain point, debugging and testing are not the major bottlenecks and that (b) the envisioned automated debugging and testing products must provide significant productivity gains over 50% in order for companies to make their investment and purchase decisions worthwhile.   The customer discovery and refinement of business model canvas developed as an outcome of the ICorps project has the potential to impact technology transfer of interactive and automated debugging of big data analytics; this ICorps project investigated such technology transfer potential and the project found that, while technology development is worthwhile to pursue, finding business customers and revenue channels might be challenging.  This ICorps project investigation helped the team's Entrepreneurial Lead (EL) to instead strengthen his determination to pursue a tenure track faculty career in academia instead.  EL went on a faculty job search in the academic year of 2019-2020 and landed at a tenure track faculty position successfully.  The intense training on presentation skills and customer discovery interviews during the ICorps project helped the EL better prepare faculty interviews and understand industry-relevant high impact research problems.
