<AbstractNarration>This project addresses fundamental research of advanced battery systems for large-scale stationary energy storage applications in renewable energy production and utility grid stability management. Current state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries are not sufficient for large-scale stationary energy storage due to concerns of cycle stability, particularly at high cycling rate and cost. Solid oxide metal-air battery systems represent a new class of advanced batteries operated on high-temperature oxide-ion chemistry. It is capable of being charged and discharged at a much faster rate and lower cost and is well suited for large-scale stationary energy storage due to its scalable and modular nature. This project aims to advance the high-temperature solid oxide metal-air battery towards commercialization through fundamental studies on the dynamic interplays between the two key components of the new battery: reversible solid oxide fuel cell and metal-based energy storage bed. From a broader impacts perspective, the project will advance the science of materials chemistry, electrochemistry and heterogeneous catalysis. The progress and new findings of the project will be included in a new graduate course and disseminated to the community through journal publications. Long-term research collaborations will be strengthened with a neighboring small college Historically Black College and University (HBCU), Benedict College. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reduction kinetics of metal-oxide redox couples during charging is key to obtain stable long cycle life and high round trip efficiency for solid oxide metal-air battery systems. The project focuses on fundamental studies on the rate limiting steps and their associated rate constants during charging/discharging cycles, based on which dynamic interplays, between reversible solid oxide fuel cells and energy storage materials, can be revealed. Advanced in situ surface techniques such as synchrotron-based ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy will be used to identify the elementary steps and determine the kinetic rate constants for the redox couple energy storage bed. In parallel, materials development will be focused on energy storage materials including highly active, atomic layer deposition derived active metals, catalysts and proton-conducting oxide supports. Multiphysics modeling including elementary microscale kinetics will also be used to guide the fundamental understanding and development of the battery. By interpreting the results from synthesis, performance testing, and surface chemistry characterization, fundamental insights on the metal/metal-oxide based redox chemistry will be gained, hypotheses will be tested, and the model will be validated and further refined to facilitate the engineering design of the new solid oxide metal-air battery technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
