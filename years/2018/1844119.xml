<AbstractNarration>The core activity of a cell involves the high-fidelity replication of RNA and DNA. Protein synthesis is necessary to accomplish this objective. The variety of protein activities present leads to complex cell behavior. This variety is due in large part to external environmental forces. This project will attempt to create a precursor to a synthetic cell; a protocell. Think of this as a stepping stone between a vessel containing a mixture of chemicals and a fully-functional cell. The protocells will be micron-sized water droplets containing simple molecules. In such confined environments, spontaneous reactions have been observed to occur. This project, if successful, might help explain how life began, and facilitate the exploration of the catalytic functions of ribozymes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is an attempt to construct protocells from water microdroplets. The approach utilizes in situ synthesis of nucleotide, oligonucleotide, and phospholipids in aerosol microdroplets with geometric confinement and a heterogeneous air-water interface. The intellectual merits of the proposed research on synthesizing protocells and applications are: &lt;br/&gt;(1) How to form cellular membranes from simple phospholipid precursor molecules; &lt;br/&gt;(2) How to construct RNAs from ribose, nucleobase, metal and phosphoric acid; &lt;br/&gt;(3) How to build complex RNA molecules such as RNA oligomers, double-strand RNAs, ribozymes, and organometallic hybrid RNA enzymes; &lt;br/&gt;(4) How to utilize the protocell containing RNA ribozymes for catalysis, RNA editing, and switching biochemical reactions. &lt;br/&gt;The formation of oligomer products from the fluorescently tagged reactant nucleotides will be probed using fluorescence spectroscopy methods. Complete characterization of metabolic reactions and catalytic reactions using mass spectrometry will be achieved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Ribonucleic acid (RNA) plays a central role in carrying genetic information, translating protein, and regulating other functions. RNA is also hypothesized as one of the central molecules for prebiotic life as it is capable of self-replicating, self-cleaving, and catalyzing other biological reactions in the absence of macromolecular biological catalysts such as enzymes. However, the understanding of a plausible mechanism for the formation of RNA and ribozyme, an enzymatic form of RNAs, is still challenging. Previously, we have shown that RNA nucleosides, a purine or pyrimidine bases linked to a sugar, can be spontaneously formed from simple precursors, including D-ribose, nucleobase, and phosphoric acid in water microdroplets surround by the air at room temperature. This finding provides a new foundation for how RNA molecules can be formed without any biological energy source, biological enzymes, or natural catalyst such as minerals from precursor molecules that are not specially designed and synthesized. It also suggests that a protocell, a self-organized collection of biochemical compartments that can perform a minimal biological functions toward the origin of life, can be formed in microdroplets. However, a question may arise that this prebiotic RNA synthesis can be carried out only in water microdroplets surrounded by the air. This question is related to hypotheses suggesting that the early life form may have begun from bubbles in the hydrothermal vent or emulsions formed from oil-water mixtures. It is also questionable that the abiotic RNA synthesis can be done in lipid vesicles that have a different interface to water microdroplets or water-in-oil emulsions. In this project, we addressed whether RNA nucleosides can be spontaneously formed from simple precursors, including D-ribose, nucleobase, and phosphoric acid with magnesium ion (Mg2+), using three different prebiotic synthesis platforms, including (1) microemulsions, (2) liposomes, and (3) micro/nano-bubbles (Figure 1). Purine and pyrimidine ribonucleosides such as adenosine, cytidine, inosine, and uridine were successfully synthesized in those platforms that have different interfaces, including water-air, water-oil, and water-phospholipid. These findings suggest that the unique property of aqueous microdroplets, which enables thermodynamically unfavorable reactions to occur at room temperature, is universal as far as hydrophobic and hydrophilic interfaces are maintained. Our findings in this project suggest a plausible pathway for elucidating a possible missing link as to how the RNA world came about.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/03/2021<br>      Modified by: Richard&nbsp;N&nbsp;Zare</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1844119/1844119_10598452_1622751842063_figure1zareNSF--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1844119/1844119_10598452_1622751842063_figure1zareNSF--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1844119/1844119_10598452_1622751842063_figure1zareNSF--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1.
