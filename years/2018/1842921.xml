<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be realized first in household cleaning applications, a market valued in more than 26 billion/year, where currently only about 3% of the market is filled with eco-friendly alternatives. Cleancult new scrubbing system will allow the development of more efficient and potent cleaning products, capable of competing with traditional petroleum-based brands while helping to reduce the water pollution effects due to laundry/cleaning activities, reduce the appearance of skin conditions in customers due to the continuous exposure to harmful chemicals found in traditional cleaning products, and reduce the energetic cost related to the use of hot water in laundry applications. Cleancult objective is to open the door to novel green clean technologies, by first introducing our all-natural scrubbing system in our products and potentially license the technology to other green detergents manufacturers, and later introduce our own all-natural green surfactant molecule, with the solid intention of increasing the green cleaners? participation in the marker by at least 20% in the next 5 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide funding for the development of a micellar system(s) composed of a biopolymer particle and a naturally derived from sustainable sources surfactant compound. The conjugation and stabilization mechanism of these micellar systems are the main focus on the research objectives, together with the inclusion of different functionalization to improve oil removal, avoid re-deposition and also enhance the antibacterial properties of the scrubbing system. The complete characterization of the micellar system and its efficacy in removing soil/dirt stains will be achieved through the use of spectroscopic, rheological and hydrodynamic techniques, surface chemistry modifications, and applying the global standards for detergency determination. The research team will work to provide a commercially ready product at the end of this SBIR Phase I project, and due to already in place collaborations with manufacture facilities will avoid delays in the introduction of Cleancults' new line of green powerful cleaners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
