<AbstractNarration>This award supports the measurement of two key parameters that describe how a neutron decays.  Those parameters are called "little a" and "little b", and they are related to the momentum of the decay products and to the strength of the radioactive decay.  The experiment will be done with the Nab spectrometer that is presently being installed at the Fundamental Neutron Physics Beamline at the Spallation Neutron Source at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  This project also prepares the way for an extension of the program, in which two more parameters, A and B, can be determined. The precise measurement of these parameters furthers a better understanding of the fundamental interactions between elementary particles. The goal of this experimental program is to test the Standard Model of particles and interactions in regions that were inaccessible before, or not as precise. A discovery of physics beyond the Standard Model would have important implications for nuclear and particle physics, as well as cosmology.  The project will have a valuable impact on higher education:  most of the work will be done by students at undergraduate and graduate levels, and these students will learn valuable skills and experiences for their future careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the motivation for the experimental program for the Nab experiment is to (1) determine the ratio of the coupling constants in free neutron beta decay, lambda =g_V/g_A, with unprecedented precision, (2) to contribute to a test of the unitarity of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, and (3) to search for non-Standard Model (SM) forms of weak interaction that manifest themselves as scalar and/or tensor interactions, that is, which interact with fermions with the "wrong" helicity. The current Long Range Plan for Nuclear Science devotes a paragraph to this effort. The studies are performed by the Nab collaboration, of which the PI is the experiment manager and the DOE project manager. The award supports the specific contributions of the PI and his group, the most important of which are the characterization of the superconducting magnet, the assembly and characterization of the spectrometer vacuum system, high voltage and main electrodes, and the characterization of the efficiency of the proton detection in a dedicated proton source.   The PI is responsible for the development of the present main analysis method for Nab. In addition, the PI will work on the planning of the future program, which is the analysis of uncertainties for the "A" and "B" coefficients, and the preliminary design and prototype testing of a novel supermirror polarizer concept that would minimize the leading systematic uncertainty in those measurements. The project will have a valuable impact on higher education. Several undergraduate and graduate students will gain valuable research experience working on the proposed projects. The PI is strongly committed to attracting members of underrepresented groups, to help broaden the human resource base of the field. The physics department became a new site for the APS bridge program, and the PI is a prospective mentor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
