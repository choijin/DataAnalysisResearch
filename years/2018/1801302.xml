<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the consecutive meetings "Young Women in C*-algebras" and "Young Mathematicians in C*-algebras", conferences that will take place during August 11-12, 2018 and August 13-17, 2018, respectively, on the campus of the Katholieke Universiteit-Leuven in Leuven, Belgium. Additional information about the meetings can be found on the website http://wis.kuleuven.be/events/ymca2018&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Young Women in C*-algebras meeting will have a lecture series given by an established female researcher and contributed talks. The Young Mathematicians in C*-algebras meeting will have two mini-courses and contributed talks. Both meetings are distinguished from other operator algebra conferences in that the participants and the organizers are all graduate students or early career researchers. The meetings are not limited to a the area of C*-algebras but includes presentations of results on von Neumann algebras and related areas. Major themes of this year's meeting include the following: Operator systems, C*-simple Groups, and Prime factorization of von Neumann algebras. The award allows for the participation of 15 early career US based researchers in these meetings. It affords these individuals a great opportunity to interact with their European counterparts, establish new collaborations, present their work and, in a reciprocal manner, learn of latest operator algebra research taking place in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Young Mathematicians in C*-algebras and Young Women in C*-algebras conferences were held at KU Leuven, Belgium from August 11, 2018-August 17, 2018.  The major goal was to provide young American researchers in operator algebras the opportunity to interact scientifically and socially with their European counterparts.  In particular, YWC*A promoted networking and visibility of female operator algebraists, and is meant to prevent or alleviate isolation among women in operator algebras.   This project was also meant to furnish a venue for young researchers to present their results to their peers in a less stressful environment than many other conferences and for young researchers to learn about some of the cutting edge work in operator algebras.     The exit survey for these conferences provided significant evidence that these goals were met.  Participants consistently said that having a conference dedicated to young researchers made it easier for them to interact and ask questions.  Saying things like, ``Having basically all young mathematicians made personal actions much more easy and natural. I could jump between groups of people without worrying I would not have another chance to talk to them, and it was much less intimidating to ask questions after talks.?? and ``The fact that everyone was either in the middle of their PhD or had recently graduated made it much easier to ask questions and discuss my/their current work. In particular, I did not have to worry that I might appear ignorant in front of someone who might be involved in hiring me in the future.''    ``YMC*A and YWC*A are incredibly important conferences for the field of operator algebras: they create a lot of activity amongst young researchers and promote diversity at that level as well.''     YWC*A was particularly useful in promoting female operator algebraists as evidenced by some of the following comments.  ``I enjoyed intimate lunch discussions with other women in Operator algebras and created concrete strategies for how to build a more supportive environment for women'' and `` I really appreciated how she (Jacqui Ramagge)  continued to reach out to me throughout the conference, even though I wasn't very talkative.''  YWC*A provided several opportunities for women to promote their research and this exposure lead to the possibility of others adapting their ideas, for example one participant ``Considered adapting Lara Ismert's results on kernel stabilization for derivations to study single commutators in algebras other than B(H).''        The minicourses provided inspiration to many of the US based participants.  There were two mincourses during YMC*A and one during YWC*A.  The minicourses during YMC*A were ?Uniformly recurrent subgroups and the simplicity of reduced group C*-algebras'' given by Matthew Kennedy and ?Spectral gap in von Neumann algebras and applications'' given by Cyril Houdayer. The minicourse at YWC*A was given by Jacqui Ramagge on ?Equilibrium states: musings on mathematics and life''  Many participants where inspired to pursue new directions of research based on these talks, for example one participant noted the following, `` Matthew Kennedy showed us his proof that a discrete group is C*-simple if and only if it has no amenable uniformly recurrent subgroups.  Switching from topological to measurable dynamics, I would like to figure out what a lack of amenable invariant random subgroups says about the structure of the group von Neumann algebras.''   Moreover the minicourse speakers were extremely willing to engage in productive discussions with the participants.  Many of the participants noted productive discussions with Jacqui Rammage, Matthew Kennedy, and Cyril Houdayer.     We had 44 total funding applications. The NSF funded 13 US-based participants: 5 women and 8 men.   Of those that were declined NSF funding, 8 attended the conference anyway.  This was a significant increase of American participation from the year before when only 5 US-based researchers attended. In total, 139 people attended at least one of the two conferences; 80 people attended YWC*A.                 Last Modified: 04/03/2019       Submitted by: Jonathan H Brown]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
