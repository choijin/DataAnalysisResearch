<AbstractNarration>This award funds a visioning workshop with the goal of bringing together leading researchers and practitioners in computing systems (architecture, operating systems, languages/compilers) to reflect on the research progress in the overlapped areas of the three fields and to discuss the grand challenges for the fields so that they can rise to meet the demands of modern computing in synergy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will have focused discussions in the context of four important application domains: Internet of Things (IoT)/infrastructure, augmenting Human Abilities/Artificial Intelligence, security and privacy, and complexity management/environment. It will discuss how inter-disciplinary research in computing systems could help meet the grand challenges in these domains, such as the lack of principles and techniques that reliably and efficiently support large and heterogeneous ensembles of IoT devices and humans, the safety and efficiency barriers facing the deployment of Artificial Intelligence, and the vulnerabilities in both hardware and software that threaten to undermine security and privacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators, along with workshop participants, will produce a detailed workshop report that will outline the grand challenges and promising directions for the further development of inter-disciplinary research in computing systems. The report will be made be publicly available through the internet as well as professional journals and magazines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The workshop provided a forum for leading experts in all the three central fields of ASPLOS(architecture, language and compiler, and OS) to get together to reflect on the research progress in theoverlapped areas of the three fields, and to discuss their visions of the most important problems toaddress in the near future and how the three fields should tackle those problems in synergy. The 2-day workshop was held at Williamsburg, VA, co-located with ASPLOS'2018. Over 150 experts in various disciplines have atttended the workshop and participated the discussion.   The workshop procudes a 31-page final report, which outlines a few high-priority areas where inter-disciplinary research is likely to have a high payoff.  (1) Developing the components for a usable planet-scale Internet of Things (IoT), with provablyenergy-efficient devices. This report envisions a highly-available, geographically distributed,heterogeneous large-scale IoT system with the same efficiency, maintainability, and usabilityas today?s data centers. This planet-scale IoT will be populated by many computationallysophisticatedIoT devices that are ultra-low power and operate energy-independently.  (2) Rethinking the hardware-software security contract in the age of AI. In light of the recentsecurity vulnerabilities, this report argues for building hardware abstractions that communicatesecurity guarantees, and for allowing software to communicate its security and privacy requirementsto the hardware. Further, security and privacy mechanisms should be integrated into thedisruptive emerging technologies that support AI.  (3) Making AI a truly dependable technology that is usable by all the citizens in all settings. AsAI frameworks automate an increasing number of critical operations, this report argues for endto-end dependable AI, where both the hardware and the software are understood and verified.Further, AI needs to turn from a centralized tool into a capability easily usable by all the citizensin all settings to meet an ever expanding range of needs.  (4) Developing solutions to tackle extreme complexity, possibly based on formal methods. Thisreport argues for the need to tame the explosion of system complexity and heterogeneity by creatingnew abstractions and complexity-management solutions. Such solutions need to be accessibleto domain experts. An important step towards this goal is to scale out and extend formal methodsfor the real world.
