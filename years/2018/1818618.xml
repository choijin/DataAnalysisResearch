<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. Morehouse College will implement a Targeted Infusion Project entitled: Creation of a for Credit Online scientific Literacy Pre-freshmen Summer Bridge Program. This highly innovative project will create a new category of problem-based learning products designed to facilitate student understanding of the scientific research process by using a virtual laboratory to simulate a research experience. Anticipated outcomes from this virtual research experience include increasing students? critical thinking skills, intrinsic motivation, self-management skills, utilitarian scientific literacy and intent to persist in STEM careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new category of problem-based learning products that will be created to infuse into the online Scientific Literacy course will occur by modifying an interdisciplinary research simulation case study (RSCS) entitled Brain Eating Amoeba. The RSCS is a faculty mentored experience that requires a student to solve a research case study by assuming the role of a research scientist. The RSCS Brain Eating Amoeba will be facilitated by a virtual embodied conversational agent (ECA) instead of a live faculty mentor. This computer-generated character is created from the face of a real individual and demonstrates many of the same properties as human face-to-face conversation, including the ability to produce and respond to verbal and nonverbal communication. An embodied conversational agent-research simulation (ECA-RS) case study will be created by combining ECA technology with the comprehensive, interdisciplinary Brain Eating Amoeba RSCS. The addition of the Brain Eating Amoeba ECA-RS to the online course will enable its transition to a for-credit course that will be offered at no cost during the Pre-Freshmen Scientific Literacy Summer Bridge Program as an incentive for pre-freshmen to participate. The successful implementation of this program at Morehouse College will increase retention and ultimately graduation rates of African American students graduating with STEM degrees and entering into the national STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

In order for students to pursue a STEM major or STEM job, students need to feel like they can be a scientist and need to have opportunities to feel like a scientist while still a student.&nbsp;&nbsp;When students think, feel, and act like a scientist, the chances of them staying within the STEM pipeline increase. In addition, students working as scientists with other researchers strengthen their critical thinking skills and cognitive abilities which are important for all areas of study including science.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>It has been demonstrated that students who participate in real research have increased interest in science and begin to identify themselves as scientists.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is a lack of funding and securing qualified instructors to provide students with these critical authentic research experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;This scarcity of resources is particularly challenging in schools with high populations of African Americans and Hispanic students.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to address challenges of providing research experiences with limited resources, research simulation case study (RSCS) in STEM was developed by Dr. Muldrow and his colleagues at Morehouse College. RSCS is a unique, problem-based, active-learning experience that provides opportunities for students to develop critical thinking skills and cognitive abilities while working with others in teams and learning from mistakes as they operate within this case study as a professional would in their field.&nbsp;</p> <p>This project uses an online Automated-RSCS as part of a scientific literacy curriculum that provides students with an opportunity to participate in computer simulated, authentic research experiences that have been created from a real research project.

(ECA).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A focus of this project is to increase&nbsp;Utilitarian Scientific Literacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Utilitarian Scientific Literacy in this case means that the person&nbsp;knows what it takes to become a successful STEM major, and that they develop skills to be a successful STEM major.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a person with lots of&nbsp;Utilitarian Scientific Literacy&nbsp;has a growth mindset identity of a successful STEM major meaning that they believe they can grow in their abilities through hard work, good practices, and working together.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the course of the grant, 68 students completed the online Scientific Literacy summer bridge program course that contained the Brain Eating Amoeba Automated-RSCS. This exceeded the projection for 50 students to complete the course.&nbsp;&nbsp;The course included a one-hour weekly webinar to orient students, make sure they were not having problems, and answer logistics questions. Components of the full Scientific Literacy course other than Automated-RSCS included: learning strategies to help transition from high school to college; nature of scientific research and scientific method; discussions of STEM careers and pathways; growth-mindset lectures and activities; and information on how science is communicated. Course modules were divided into 12 chapters. Each chapter included video lectures, power-point slides, quizzes, and activities. Students reported positively about the simulated research project and their learning experience including reporting increases in their&nbsp;Graphical and Experimental Design Skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants improved in their Scientific Literacy&nbsp;and&nbsp;reported increases in understanding experimental procedures, interdisciplinary research, cell biology research methods, and&nbsp;how various scientific instruments are used in research.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This online experience has potential to revolutionize how students are exposed to authentic research experiences utilizing an approach that is much less likely to be interrupted by any future global or local disturbances whether they be weather, immunologic, or political in nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is predicted that the United States and global economy will need a larger STEM workforce to meet future demands.&nbsp;&nbsp;Researchers, educators, and policymakers will need to collaborate to ensure that there are innovative ways to deliver STEM content to all students on all educational levels. This cost-effective approach to providing a research experience to students could be implemented at other institutions. Automated-RSCSs can serve as a method for problem based, active learning. It also provides a pioneering approach to address the lack of authentic research experiences found in traditional classrooms and improves the trajectory of all STEM students. Online delivery of STEM education could be instrumental in helping change how diverse students view themselves within STEM settings worldwide. Diverse representation within STEM fields has always been a challenge but Automated-RSCS provides students with opportunities to interact with an experienced scientist and an upper-level student near-peer mentor that looked like them. This project developed a mechanism to provide role models for these students to progress in a variety of STEM careers.
