<AbstractNarration>This project analyzes the way in which spatial scale changes how local habitat, regional climate, and geographic separation affect plant community composition and diversity. According to basic theory in biogeography, the relative importance of the biological and environmental factors that affect species coexistence, and thus diversity, varies with spatial scale.  The research assesses the relative importance of the controlling factors as well as specific geographies of location within increasing spatial scales and among places that vary in isolation.  This change with scale and isolation is relevant to fundamental understanding of how diversity arises and is maintained, and this research helps guide interpretation of observations of current global change impacts.  For this project, the alpine tundra biome serves as a useful model system because its plant community composition varies across and within mountain ranges and regions.  Project results will be shared with other researchers working on such interpretation in global ecological monitoring programs, such as the Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments, as well as with the general public through outreach via the National Park Service's Crown of the Continent Learning Center.  The STEM workforce will be strengthened through the training of a postdoctoral researcher and undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research examines the role of spatial scale in plant community biogeography.  The investigator will assess the variation in plant community composition in alpine tundra in relation to three factors: local habitat (such as soils and topography), climate (biologically relevant seasonal variables), and geographic distance (a proxy for past dispersal).  Which of the three factors, with multiple variables for each, is most important to the patterns of diversity among plots within distances ranging from 100 meters to greater than 1000 kilometers, will be determined statistically.  The pattern of changes in their relative importance along a gradient of increasing distances will be analyzed.  Specifics of isolation will be evaluated through the inclusion of discontinuous ranges.  These analyses test the fundamental theory that the drivers change in a regular pattern as scale is increased.  The project increases knowledge of the importance of spatial interpretation in biogeographic theory and its applications.  The alpine tundra found in an arc across southern-to-eastern Europe, from Spain to Romania, will be studied because the species composition and environment has been recorded for thousands of plots with the same methodology.  Insights for biogeographic theory and applications will be relevant to other alpine regions, such as those of the western United States, as well as to other biomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
