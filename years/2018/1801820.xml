<AbstractNarration>Why has graduate education not facilitated greater social mobility while undergraduate education has? College is often thought to be the great equalizer because it promotes upward mobility.  But the expansion of higher education may not ensure equal opportunity for everyone, especially when a growing number of people are acquiring an advanced degree. This project will study why the influence of family background becomes stronger among advanced degree holders while it is still weak among those with a BA/BS degree only. This study evaluates three explanations by studying the income levels of those with at least a BA/BS degree.  These people may:  1) attain a highly-lucrative advanced degree such as an MBA or professional degree (vertical selection); 2) major in a non-vocational field of study at the undergraduate level and a profitable one at the graduate level, including health, law, and business (horizontal selection); or 3) complete education at an earlier age and have more years of work experience (cumulative advantage). The project will provide implications for families and educators concerned with the relative tradeoffs for investment in various types of higher education.  The project will also provide implications for states and U.S. society generally in creating policies aimed at promoting useful educational investment.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will analyze income returns to education for adults who achieve various levels of higher education.    The project will analyze over 150,000 respondents aged 35-54 from the 2003, 2010, 2013 and 2015 National Survey of College Graduates data and the IPUMS 5% Census data with at least a bachelor?s degree and having a positive income. The project will use log-multiplicative layer effect and multivariate regression models to examine the extent to which vertical selection, horizontal selection, and cumulative advantage explain income level differences.  The project will also study gender differences in these processes as well as how these effects have changed over time.  The project will inform sociological theories concerned with social mobility and the role of social selection into various types of higher education in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Until the late twentieth century, studies suggested that a college degree is the great equalizer that reduces the effects of family background on children&rsquo;s education, occupation, and earnings. The great equalizer argument raised the expectation that mass higher education can improve intergenerational social mobility. However, despite the rapid expansion of higher education in the United States, the association between parents&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s socioeconomic status (SES) has not been attenuated over time. Besides, recent studies in the twenty-first century have begun to report strong intergenerational socioeconomic associations among college graduates. The purpose of this dissertation project is to elucidate the parental effects on college graduates&rsquo; socioeconomic attainment. Based on the educational stratification theories, we conducted three empirical studies of the effects of parents&rsquo; SES on children&rsquo;s labor market outcomes, graduate education, and other life chances after they obtain a college degree. We utilized pooled datasets from the National Survey of College Graduates for 2010, 2013, 2015, and 2017.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the first study, we addressed the puzzle of the U-shaped pattern in intergenerational socioeconomic associations over children&rsquo;s educational levels. Recent research indicated that the parental effects on children&rsquo;s SES become weaker as their education level rises, reaches its weakest point at the undergraduate level, then resurfaces at the graduate level. If a college degree is the great equalizer for intergenerational social mobility, it is baffling that the intergenerational socioeconomic association is stronger among advanced degree holders than those holding a bachelor&rsquo;s degree only. We found that the following three educational sorting mechanisms fully explain the strong intergenerational socioeconomic association among advanced degree holders: Children from high-SES families (1) obtain expensive and financially rewarding advanced degrees, including professional and doctoral degrees; (2) major in academic fields of study, such as arts and science, attending selective institutions at the undergraduate level and switching into hyper-lucrative fields of study, such as law and medicine, at the graduate level; and (3) complete their graduate education at a younger age and enjoy income growth over more years of labor market experience.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Second, we further examined whether financial support from family accounts for children&rsquo;s chances to obtain an advanced degree. Students relying heavily on student loans or employment have had a lower chance of obtaining an advanced degree than those whose families provide sufficient financial resources to pay the entire college tuition. As tuition increases over time, more students are relying on multiple funding sources to finance their college educaiton. Among those who entered the college between 1966 and 1975, those mobilizing three or more funding sources were more or equally likely to complete a graduate program compared to students fully funded by their families. However, for those who entered college between 1986 and 1995, those who used multiple funding sources are less likely to obatin an advanced degree compared to whose parents fully supported their college educaiton. . Our result implies that the importance of funding sources during undergraduate education has increased for further education in graduate schools.</p> <p>Last, we investigated whether parents&rsquo; socioeconomic status is related to college loan repayment after graduation. As students have relied on massive student loans to manage the rising college tuition, the education debt burden has restricted socioeconomic advancement and well-being after graduation. However, the socioeconomic importance of student debt has been overlooked in previous studies of intergenerational socioeconomic associations among college graduates. We found that students from low-SES families owe more education debt throughout their adulthood compared to their counterparts from high-SES families who borrowed the same student loan amounts, even after controlling for their education, occupation, earnings, and other labor market characteristics.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In conclusion, the three empirical studies show that mass higher education cannot be a panacea for reducing the effects of family background on children&rsquo;s socioeconomic attainment.
