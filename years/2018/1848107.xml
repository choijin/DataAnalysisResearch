<AbstractNarration>The investigator seeks to understand how galaxies form with such amazing varieties of structure and content.   Astronomers have found that galaxies grow through a balance of gas loss, gas in-fall, and star formation. However, what drives these processes is only poorly understood. She will model dwarf galaxies, which are ideal test subjects for studying galaxy growth.   The dwarf galaxies have low masses, making them especially sensitive to the energy input from newly forming stars.  The investigator plans a comprehensive comparison of the observations to their numerical models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When studying the growth of dwarf galaxies, astronomers must first account for the environment in which they exist. Dwarf galaxies are generally found close to more massive galaxies, which can both prevent gas accretion onto dwarf galaxies and aid gas loss from them. Therefore, the investigator will examine the effects of both environment and internal processes on the growth of dwarf galaxies. Using extremely high-resolution, realistic computer simulations, she will map the flow of gas to identify what spurs and halts dwarf galaxy growth. To further study the effect of environment, she will compare the properties of dwarf galaxies at different distances from more massive galaxies. Finally, she will examine the gas transferred from dwarf galaxies to their massive neighbors, to better understand the connection between galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In parallel with this research, the investigator will develop computational exercises, such as labs and open-ended research projects, for undergraduate physics students. These lessons will develop students' programming abilities while reinforcing skills like problem solving and persistence. This project also supports continued efforts to increase inclusivity within the Grinnell College science division. Additionally, it will support summer research opportunities for twelve undergraduate students, including opportunities to present at national conferences and to visit collaborators at research institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
