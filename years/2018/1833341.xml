<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop a new tool for weighing trucks as they cross bridges.  Compared with existing truck weighing systems, the technology promises to be inexpensive, easy to deploy, fast and very difficult to evade.  More consistent real-time identification of overweight trucks could significantly decrease the tens of billions of dollars per year of roadway damage caused by these overweight trucks.  An additional benefit of the system is that it promises to provide a new tool to identify changes in the deformation response of bridges.  These changes will help to diagnose structural damage to bridges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project employs electro-optical technology to monitor the structural deformations of civil structures in real-time. The intent of this technology is to augment/replace existing systems that rely on load cells at weigh stations.  The technology measures the deformation of structures under dynamic loads with a passive camera system that can monitor the structure from a distance. The system uses off-the-shelf commercially available video cameras to monitor a specific target on a structure, such as a fastener, reflector, or structural feature. The real-time video is then processed using proprietary pixel manipulation algorithms to calculate sub-millimeter displacements and rotations in 3 axes. The information, when observed in real-time, as well as the data products generated from the archived data can be used to determine the performance of structures, the impacts of dynamic loading, and even the prediction of structural failures. The system can also be used to identify overweight trucks in order to enforce weight limits on roads and bridges. This system provides high bandwidth measurements while exposed to typical lighting condition dynamics or other ambient conditions. We have conducted real-world conditions tests on bridges and a building that validate the feasibility of the technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project focused on the question of the viability of a start-up company that will deploy a new technology to detect over-weight trucks (we call it WeighCam).  Prior to this I-Corps project, we had already demonstrated that consumer-grade cameras are capable of recording the displacement of a highway bridge caused by the weight of trucks on the bridge.   Currently, trucks are weighed at specialized weigh stations using conventional weight scales.  These weigh stations are very expensive to build and operate.  Worse, many trucks avoid measurement when the stations temporarily close because of excessive truck traffic (they don’t want to create traffic jams).  In some cases, overweight trucks re-route around known weigh stations.  WeighCam is designed to weigh a truck using high-resolution video recordings of any highway bridge.  In principle, there is no upper limit to the rate at which trucks can be weighed.  Furthermore, the system is portable and compact, so overweight trucks will not be able to know when they are being weighed.  This I-Corps project focused on 1) defining the need for such a product, 2) estimating a user base for WeighCam, and 3) a potential business plan to develop a viable start-up company to implement the technology.  In fact, the primary outcome of I-Corps projects is a decision by the I-Corps teams about the viability of developing a successful company to turn a promising technology into a practical reality.  This decision is made after the team members define the problem they wish to solve and then investigate the interest of potential users.  We interviewed over one hundred knowledgeable people from a large variety of government agencies (especially CA Dept. of Transportation), and also employees of companies that currently market systems to weigh trucks.  We discovered that overweight trucks are a major source of damage to our road systems;  elimination of overweight trucks would save billions of dollars of highway repairs annually.  We also discovered that current systems that are designed to weigh trucks as they pass over pressure sensors (known as weigh-in-motion) have not had the hoped-for impact on over-weight truck traffic.  Therefore, our proposed solution promises to provide a truly unique and effective solution for this problem.  That is, there is a clear need for this product.   It seems that governmental agencies that maintain roads will be the most obvious users of this technology.  We interviewed transportation engineers from state and city agencies about the viability of this technology.  In general, there was strong interest.  However, many of these agencies are large bureaucracies in which decisions are made deliberately; individuals within an agency are prevented from making decisions without instructions from the top management.  That is, it appears that it may be difficult to support a start-up company that relies on transportation agencies as the customer; they are interested, but they won’t take risks.  Based on this finding, we modified our proposed product so that the product will consist of access to real-time information about truck weight that is available through an internet interface.  In that way the transportation agencies could use the system without actually purchasing new hardware.  Once the efficacy of Weigh-Cam is established with a user, then the user will be required to pay for new data streams.  This is a standard marketing tool for innovative smart-phone applications.  That is, although the problem of a customer base for WeighCam is inherently difficult, we decided that there is a viable strategy to solve this problem.  As it turns out the questions of finding a user base and also developing a business plan seem to be closely coupled.     At the end of the I-Corps project, we decided that WeighCam is a potentially viable new start-up company.  Based on the I-Corps process, we decided to continue to pursue development of a company to market WeighCam.  In fact, we were awarded an NSF SBIR phase I development grant that provides the financial support to continue technical development of the technology utilized by the system.
