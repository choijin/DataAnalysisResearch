<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Conference on Complex Geometry and Several Complex Variables" that will be held March 9-11, 2018 at the University of Notre Dame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the field of complex geometry.   A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.   The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.   More information will be made available at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;https://www3.nd.edu/~conf/complex_geometry2018/</AbstractNarration>
