<AbstractNarration>The 8th Meeting on Hydrodynamic Quantum Analogs (HQA8) is scheduled to be&lt;br/&gt;held on July 23-27, 2018 at Brown University. We anticipate that the meeting will be attended&lt;br/&gt;by approximately 30 participants from countries worldwide including: United States, Mexico,&lt;br/&gt;Brazil, Belgium, Australia, and the United Kingdom. HQA8 it the eighth of a series of meetings&lt;br/&gt;on a field that began with the pioneering work of Yves Couder and Emmanuel Fort on walking&lt;br/&gt;droplets. A liquid droplet can ?walk? by bouncing on the surface of a vibrating bath of the same&lt;br/&gt;liquid through a resonant interaction with the wave field it creates. The ensemble of drop and&lt;br/&gt;waves has been called a walker, which constitutes a wave-particle association at the macroscopic&lt;br/&gt;scale which have been shown to exhibit several quantum-like features. Funding will be used to&lt;br/&gt;provide travel support for students and researchers that would otherwise be unable to attend as&lt;br/&gt;well as to support some costs associated with the workshop itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Walkers have sparked the interest of scientists for being a macroscopic system exhibiting some behaviors thought to be exclusive to the microscopic, quantum world. The workshop provided participants with an opportunity to share their findings and take part in discussions with the growing HQA community. Funding allowed students and researchers from abroad who could not afford the cost of travel and accommodation to join the meeting. The funding also allowed for an inexpensive setup that allows for the striking visualization of the basic phenomenology of walkers to be implemented for the event and used for a Student Visualization Workshop for student attendees, led by the PI.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/27/2019<br>      Modified by: Daniel&nbsp;M&nbsp;Harris</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1841840/1841840_10556425_1574884187306_Flyer_HQA8--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1841840/1841840_10556425_1574884187306_Flyer_HQA8--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Flyer"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1841840/1841840_10556425_1574884187306_Flyer_HQA8--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Flyer"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Flyer used to advertise meeting held at Brown University.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Daniel Harris</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daniel&nbsp;M&nbsp;Harris</div> <div class="imageTitle">Flyer</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1841840/1841840_10556425_1574884283000_HQA8group--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1841840/1841840_10556425_1574884283000_HQA8group--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Group Picture"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1841840/1841840_10556425_1574884283000_HQA8group--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Group Picture"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Group Picture of Attendees at HQA8 Meeting.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Daniel Harris</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daniel&nbsp;M&nbsp;Harris</div> <div class="imageTitle">Group Picture</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1841840/1841840_10556425_1574884383717_viz1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1841840/1841840_10556425_1574884383717_viz1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student Visualization Event"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1841840/1841840_10556425_1574884383717_viz1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student Visualization Event"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students from different institutions practicing visualization techniques together learned during Student Visualization Event hosted by PI.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Daniel Harris</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daniel&nbsp;M&nbsp;Harris</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student Visualization Event</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1841840/1841840_10556425_1574884519981_viz2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1841840/1841840_10556425_1574884519981_viz2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Bouncing Droplet"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1841840/1841840_10556425_1574884519981_viz2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Bouncing Droplet"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">An photograph captured by students from during Student Visualization Event hosted by PI.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Daniel Harris</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Daniel&nbsp;M&nbsp;Harris</div> <div class="imageTitle">Bouncing Droplet</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
