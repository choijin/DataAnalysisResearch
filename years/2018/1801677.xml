<AbstractNarration>Environmental resilience has been a growing challenge for city administrations around the world. Environmental disasters alone are likely to cost cities billions of dollars and have the potential to plummet an estimated 77 million city dwellers into poverty. Cities are first responders and political actors who can effectively mitigate and adapt to environmental and economic changes. Civic infrastructures, or networks of private, pro-social organizations that include the nonprofit sector and socially responsible corporations, can enable local action. This project asks why city action, or communities' ability to act, differs between locales.  Project findings can help policy-makers to identify the ways in which targeted public investments and policies can improve the resilience of communities to natural disasters and other unexpected crises.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project integrates urban sociology and organizational sociology to study city variation in urban resilience. The research design is large-scale and comparative. The first part of the study examines how the relationships between cities through membership in professional associations shape urban resilience strategies. The second part of the study focuses on all cities above 50,000 inhabitants in the United States to study the association between the density and multiplicity of civic infrastructures and city action.  Data analytic techniques include econometric fixed effects-models with computational measures based on affiliation networks and structural topic modeling. Semi-structured interviews with urban resilience practitioners worldwide allow for cross-validation of the hypotheses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This dissertation investigated strategic attempts to mitigate and adapt to climate change by local means, so-called city climate action. In the past, sociologists have focused on nation states, corporations, and individuals as the key actors that respond to social and environmental challenges. But with nation states gridlocked by polarization and corporations and individuals stifled by their inability to overcome collective action problems, the role of cities in fostering resilience is becoming an increasingly important issue. Since cities are responsible for more than 70% of carbon emissions, their discretionary strategies and investments -- estimated to total some $80-100 billion annually over the coming decade -- are key to mitigating and adapting to climate change.   The dissertation responded to the observation that some cities are indeed at the forefront of finding and enforcing solutions to social and environmental problems, including climate action, while others remain stuck on the back benches. To understand when and why cities engage in meaningful action, the inquiry drew on literature in organizational, political, and urban sociology and developed a framework of city action. City action is argued to be a result of the interplay of a place-based organizational ecosystem and the shared cultural and political environment in which cities have come to be embedded. This framework offers a new way to analyze the origins, diffusion, and implementation of innovative policies and practices among cities.  Three studies examined this argument empirically. One study compared strategic plans among the largest cities in the world and found that the presence and content of plans -- especially with respect to climate change --depends on the city's network position in an emerging professional network of inter-city associations. A second study focuses on city action in a single country, the United States, to show that membership in professional associations and the presence of local civic associations influence municipal sustainability practices. A third study showed that city leaders are not alone in their efforts to make cities more resilient. Organizations that are physically located in cities -- nonprofits, public agencies, and firms -- lead the transition to more sustainability construction by adopting green building certifications, to which city halls respond through regulation.  Across the three studies, civil society emerges as an anchor of urban resilience that leads by example, guides the actions of public administrations, and knits an emergent professional network of cities.
