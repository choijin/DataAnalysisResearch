<AbstractNarration>Smart cities and Internet of Things (IoT) represent a domain of exponential growth, profitability, and immense opportunities in the coming decades, and are expected to revolutionize life. A key roadblock in realizing the immense potential of this disruptive technology is that at present there isn't any integrated system level support to build sophisticated smart city applications or services. Current efforts have mostly been in silos and building applications using the IoT or smart city infrastructure remains an arduous task. Edge computing technology, which allows data produced by IoT devices to be processed closer to where it is created is considered crucial for the success of the smart city and IoT visions, but there are some significant challenges that this project seeks to address.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will identify a set of core system level services needed to build sophisticated context-aware applications at the edge, investigate systems and algorithmic challenges in the design and implementation of these services, and build a holistic middleware framework that exposes these services to the edge application developers in an accessible, well integrated manner. The utility of this framework will be demonstrated by developing three novel smart city and IoT applications that are representatives of the type of applications that will be commonplace in the future. Overall, this project will expedite the construction of sophisticated context-aware edge applications and contribute to the growing body of work on smart city and IoT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will integrate research ideas into the educational mission that involves students at high school, undergraduate and graduate levels. The framework will be made available to researchers in academia and industry and contributed to the open source infrastructure for edge computing research and education. As edge computing holds great promise for building transformative context-aware applications for everyday life, the proposed research will contribute to better quality of life and the nation?s economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
