<AbstractNarration>This proposal is to request partial support for the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Laser Diagnostics in Combustion. The meeting will be held at Les Diablerets, Switzerland, June 22 - 28, 2019. The requested fund will be used for supporting students and postdocs who will attend the meetings. Particularly, the GRS is specifically aimed at young scientists. The meeting will be focused on the most recent scientific advances in optical diagnostics and their demonstrated or expected impact, in addition to diagnostic needs. Topics will include precise and accurate measurements of fluid motion and temperature, chemical composition, and transient and multi-phase phenomena under a wide range of conditions, including high pressure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combustion is responsible for providing the majority of global energy needs but generating a large fraction of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gases. Combustion processes are complex in that they involve multiphase, chemically reacting flows at high temperatures. Combustion diagnostics requires advanced instrumentation and scientific knowledge. This conference will bring together scientists and engineers with a strong interest in laser-based combustion diagnostics to discuss current approaches, latest developments, promising opportunities, and unaddressed needs for measurement techniques for probing combustion processes. This conference is unique because it is not focused on reviewing previous research; instead it highlights novel, bold, and often controversial advances of today and tomorrow. This conference will contribute significantly to the understanding of the state-of-the-art technology in laser diagnostics in combustion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
