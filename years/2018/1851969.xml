<AbstractNarration>With support from the NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, this Capacity Building project aims to serve the national interest in high-quality STEM teaching by preparing more STEM-certified teachers to serve in high-need school districts. The project intends to build this capacity by reviewing and updating curricula to produce highly-qualified graduates in four years with dual degrees in a STEM field and in education.  It intends to create smooth pathways for transfer students to enter and succeed in these dual-degree programs. The project will develop or strengthen partnerships between Webster University and St. Louis Community College, Ritenour School District, and nonprofit organizations, including the Academy of Science of St. Louis and the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis.  These partnerships will contribute to advancing capacity for submission of a collaborative Noyce Track 1 proposal.  The project will investigate factors that affect undergraduate STEM majors' interest in teaching as a career.  As a result, it can contribute new knowledge about pathways to teaching for STEM undergraduates and the challenges faced by high-need school districts in attracting and retaining outstanding STEM teachers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project activities involve reviewing and updating pathways to dual degrees in education and one or more STEM fields (chemistry, biology, mathematics, or computer science), and revising formal articulation agreements between the University and Community College to incorporate these new pathways. It is expected that the updated curricula will provide high quality mentoring, relevant field experiences, and meaningful research opportunities for STEM majors interested in teaching careers.  The project intends to use surveys and interviews with multiple stakeholder groups to understand 1) specific difficulties faced by local high-need schools in hiring and retaining highly qualified STEM teachers and 2) factors that inhibit students from dual majors in STEM and education. The project expects to develop new recruiting strategies to inform prospective and current students about the new dual degree pathways.  The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 mathematics and science teachers in high-need school districts and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 teachers in high-need school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Our team was successful in each of the four goals that we described in the proposal funding above. We have created stronger pathways between our partner school district, Ritenour, our community college partner, St. Louis Community College Forest Park, and Webster University. We have created and improved the curriculum for students wanting to pursue a STEM education program in Biology, Chemistry and Mathematics. We have worked with STLCC to review and revise the articulation agreements to make the transition from community college to four-year institution seamless. We have increased the research opportunities for the students to better prepare them for their careers as a STEM educator. We have strengthened the partnership with community organizations to provide our students with new and unique research and community engagement opportunities. These partners include: Academy of Science St. Louis, Urban League of St. Louis, Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, Ritenour School District and St. Louis Community College. These partnerships will provide students with numerous STEM and educational opportunities to work with the community in STEM experiences. Finally we have new and exciting mentorship opportunities utilizing teachers from Ritenour, STLCC, Webster and alumni who bring decades of experience that they will share with our new STEM teachers to provide them with best practices, techniques and resources to make them highly successful in the classroom.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/22/2021<br>      Modified by: Anton&nbsp;S&nbsp;Wallner</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
