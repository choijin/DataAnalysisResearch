<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students from historically underrepresented minority populations (African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians or Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders) to successfully complete high quality degree programs in STEM.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Northern New Jersey LSAMP Bridge to the Baccalaureate (NNJ-B2B) project continue its partnership between four community colleges in the state, namely, Passaic County Community College (PCCC), Hudson County Community College (HCCC), Union County Community College (UCCC) and County College of Morris (UCM), to increase transfer rates to four-year STEM degree programs for traditionally underrepresented minority students.  PCCC leads the alliance which includes two new community colleges - UCM, an emerging Hispanic-serving community college, and HCCC during the three-year project. The goal is to increase the number of transfers by 900 students during the project period. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NNJ-B2B institutions will leverage knowledge generated from prior NSF funded projects to bring expertise to the design and implementation of a range of high impact practices that will aide in achieving its transfer goal and transform its recruitment and retention interventions and institutions.  Students will benefit from early undergraduate research experiences and mentoring activities in addition to social integration activities with institutions in the Garden State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation led by Rutgers University.  Leadership and governance activities of the alliance will continue emphasis on improving articulation policies with four-year institutions. A longitudinal study of students participating in the B2B project since 2014 is proposed along with process evaluation.  Project outcomes will be disseminated locally and nationally through conferences and on-line STEM education journals. Findings from this LSAMP B2B project will benefit educational institutions and the STEM community nationally in broadening participation efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
