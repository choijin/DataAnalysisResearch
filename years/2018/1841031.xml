<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project technology has potential to be transformative in power generation.  The ultimate goal of this project is to produce aneutronic fusion energy in a system that is small, simple and inexpensive.  This system will produce power that is as clean as renewable energy while simultaneously removing the need for energy storage that is required for intermittent sources like wind and solar power.  It utilizes new, innovative physics which has not been incorporated in fusion devices before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  This SBIR Phase I project proposes to study a plasma-based fusion device which has two rings that oscillate in the axial and radial directions.  The rings will be confined in an axial harmonic oscillator potential.  The two rings collide with one another axially when both rings have their maximum axial velocities. Fusion occurs primarily from the relative velocities of the rings, not from the thermal energy in the plasma.  This will allow for the use of advanced aneutronic fuels.  The primary goal of the phase I is to evaluate the theoretical feasibility of this system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The ultimate goal (of which this Phase 1 SBIR is a first step) is to produce aneutronic fusion energy in a system that is small, simple and inexpensive.  The planned application for this device is as an energy source for space propulsion.  Fusion devices can provide a small, high power density energy source which can be incorporated into a space propulsion system (see Figure 1).  We are planning to use an advanced fusion fuel (proton-Boron11) which does not produce neutrons or other penetrating radiation.   Chemical rocket systems are not well suited for space travel to Mars and beyond.  They are not  powerful enough and as a result travel time to Mars is a minimum 210 days in each direction (see Figure 2).  The result is the astronauts are subjected to about 1.0 Sv of radiation for the trip.  This is the maximum amount of radiation that a worker is allowed in their entire lifetime, and may lead to radiation sickness (see Figure 3).     For Phase 1 we designed, analyzed and built a plasma-based device which has two spinning plasma rings that oscillate in the axial and radial directions.  These rings are confined in a harmonic oscillator potential. The two rings collide with one another axially when both rings have their maximum axial velocities. Fusion occurs from the relative velocities of the rings.  This will allow for the use of advanced aneutronic fuels (see Figure 4). The primary goal of the phase 1 work is to demonstrate that the desired harmonic oscillator potential well can be formed and that oscillating plasma rings can be maintained in the potential well.  Langmuir probes were implemented to detect the rings.  The theory predicts that the rings will produce a response at twice the drive frequency of the oscillator.  This is demonstrated in Figures 5 and 6 where the plasma enhances the response signal by 34 db, or roughly 15 orders of magnitude.   The major outcomes are:  The oscillating plasma ring experiment was designed, built and operated.  Results showed a strong frequency doubling on the Langmuir probes, which is consistent with two oscillating plasma rings.
