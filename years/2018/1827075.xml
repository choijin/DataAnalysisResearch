<AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to establish an international research and education partnership between the University of Michigan (U-M) and University of Bologna (UniBo) in Italy.  The proposed work is envisioned to improve the quality-of-life of people with disabilities and their caregivers, transform the knee-ankle-foot-orthosis care to data-based diagnosis and model-based design and 3D-printing, and provide an international research experience to students. The goal of this collaboration is to provide a high-quality international research experience to University of Michigan students to increase student diversity and retention and advance students' ability in and knowledge of culture, globalization, leadership, teamwork, and communication. The key intellectual merit of this collaboration is in the model-based design, 3D-printing, and evaluation of individualized assistive devices. The project will utilize technical knowledge gained from University of Michigan and will improve individualized assistive devices such as the knee-ankle-foot orthosis, a brace that helps people with leg instabilities to walk. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific objective of this award is to establish an international research and education partnership between the University of Michigan (U-M) and University of Bologna (UniBo) in Italy on the model-based design, 3D-printing, and evaluation of individualized assistive devices (IADs). The project is focused on the advancements in 3D-printing and wearable sensors that enable the design and fabrication of assistive devices for individual needs.  Patient-specific biomechanical models will be developed to analyze the motions and forces associated with the daily activities of a patient. For example, from models of patient-specific knee joint motion, compliant 3D-printed knee joints will be analyzed and designed to improve the function of individual assistive devices.  Combined metal 3D-printing, precision machining, and mechanical testing will be used to fabricate and test the compliant knee joint.  Finally, the knee-ankle-foot-orthosis devices fabricated by conventional and 3D-printing methods will be evaluated on patients in clinic and during daily activities. Specifically, this project aims to design, fabricate, and evaluate an individualized knee-ankle-foot-orthosis (KAFO) with metal and plastic 3D-printed parts. Students will study four research topics related to the KAFO: (1) biomechanical quantification of activities and lifestyles of KAFO patients, (2) analysis and design of a patient-specific compliant knee joint, (3) manufacturing of compliant knee joint, and (4) evaluation of the patient-specific KAFO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed work in design, 3D-printing, and evaluation of personalized assistive devices is to re-establish the quality-of-life of people with disabilities by restoring normal joint motion and function. Personalized assistive devices with good fit and quick delivery can greatly benefit patients as well as their caregivers. Further, tailoring the function of these devices to the patient improves their ability to ambulate and reduces the chances of reinjury. The transformative aspects of this project are the mass production of custom assistive devices and the long-term monitoring of the gait and mobility of assistive device users for physical and psychological diagnosis and prevention of fall and other accidents. The knowledge and biomechanical models can improve the design practice and evaluation of the efficacy of a broad range of assistive devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
