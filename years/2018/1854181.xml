<AbstractNarration>The field of spatial statistics is an expanding subset of statistical science with numerous applications in a wide variety of specialties such as geophysical, environmental, ecological and economic sciences.  Modern datasets in these sciences often involve multiple variables observed at thousands to millions of irregularly spaced geographical locations.  Associated scientific goals include surface estimation, stochastic simulation and statistical modeling to gain insight of underlying phenomena.  Statistical analyses require flexible nonstationary and multivariate constructions, which have heretofore been hampered by a lack of models adequate for datasets of large magnitude.  This project addresses this gap in statistical science, developing a unifying framework for nonstationary and multivariate spatial models capable of modeling complex spatial dependencies.  Additionally, the justification for the use of nonstationary models is generally relegated to empirical results with data and simulation experiments; this research will develop a companion theory for exploring the relative benefit of these more complex spatial models. Using the tools introduced in this project, the final major goal is to develop a gridded data product for the historical climate of the United States based on large, irregularly spaced observational networks with transparent statistical methodology and formal quantification of the uncertainty in such an analysis.  Historical data products such as this are of crucial importance in the fields of atmospheric and climate sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern spatial statistics has increased focus on developing methods for massive spatial datasets that involve multiple variables with complex dependency structures.  This research aims to foster a common framework via multiresolution processes for modeling nonstationary and multivariate spatial structures that does not break down in the face of large sample sizes.  Multiresolution processes lend themselves to fast estimation and computation, and also to the linked theoretical questions of asymptotic behavior of spatial estimators.  For example, there is a lack of rigorous theoretical treatment of nonstationary approaches, with current understanding limited to experimental results.  The companion large sample theory of this research is aimed at identifying situations in which nonstationary models provide tangible benefits over simpler stationary cousins.  A linked goal is approximation theory for existing spatial constructions; special multiresolution constructions can approximate existing covariances such as the Matern, allowing for a theoretical treatment of spatial smoothing under these common classes of covariances.  Additionally, the project will generalize the notion of a multiresolution process to the multivariate setting, allowing for feasible and flexible inference-based modeling of massive multivariate spatial datasets.</AbstractNarration>
