<AbstractNarration>This research is targeted at making a fundamental breakthrough in understanding of the dynamics of the solar atmosphere by conducting the first detailed observational characterization of the Sun's internal gravity waves. These waves are likely playing a significant role in the dynamics of the Sun?s atmosphere (that affects Earth's "space weather"), but little is known about them because of difficulties observing their oblique paths and small vertical wavelengths. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will radically change this situation by determining the role internal gravity waves play in the energy balance of the solar atmosphere - both the "traditional" gravity waves with frequencies below the Lamb frequency and the recently discovered "anomalous" gravity waves with frequencies above the Lamb frequency. This will be accomplished by combining the data from two high sensitivity and stability Doppler magnetographs deployed to the Antarctic South Pole Station along with the data collected by the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager instrument on-board the NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in space. The project will be imaging "line-of-sight" solar plasma velocity fields with high spatial resolution at three separate heights in the solar atmosphere. These images will provide the basis for the first detailed characterization of the properties of internal gravity waves as a first step towards developing suitable diagnostic tools for probing the solar atmosphere from the ground. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solid science, collaborative effort, and the Doppler magnetographs' deployment to Antarctica provide an ideal opportunity to achieve excellent education and outreach goals. By providing undergraduates and college students with Antarctic research experience, the proposal demonstrates how a future generation of researchers can make meaningful contributions to the cutting-edge science.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong></strong>Internal gravity waves (IGWs) are waves that are driven by gravity and buoyancy forces and are seen throughout the solar system. These waves play an important role in mixing material and transporting energy and momentum in planetary atmospheres, oceans, and the interiors and atmospheres of solar-type stars. IGWs play an essential role in the coupling of the Earth's lower atmosphere to the ionosphere. While in the oceans, IGWs power the overturning meridional circulation that affects pollutant disposal, marine productivity, and global climate. Outside of Earth, IGWs are found on Mars, Venus, and Jupiter. They also exist on the Sun, where they are randomly excited by overshooting convection at the top and bottom of the Sun's convection zone. The IGWs generated at the top of the convection zone, near the Sun's surface, have been proposed as agents for heating the Sun's outer atmosphere. They are also likely to play a significant role in this region's dynamics. However, their oblique paths and small vertical wavelengths have made them challenging to observe; consequently, IGWs in the Sun have not garnered the same level of attention they have in other disciplines. This project's primary goals were to make the first detailed measurements of the IGWs in the Sun's atmosphere, characterize their properties, and take an initial step toward capitalizing on their potential as a diagnostic tool for probing the solar atmosphere.</p> <p>To acquire the necessary data for our studies, we upgraded two instruments that we built for an earlier seismology program in 2007, designed to use acoustic waves to probe the Sun's interior and atmosphere. The upgrade allowed for collecting high-resolution images of the velocity and magnetic fields at two heights in the Sun's atmosphere. We then deployed the instruments to a site near the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, where we performed two observing campaigns during the austral summers of 2016/2017 and 2017/2018.&nbsp; We obtained three data sets with more than 20 hours of uninterrupted measurements, significantly longer than can be acquired at a low-latitude site. We were prevented from getting even longer data sets by several instrumentation malfunctions during the observations and historically lousy weather during the first campaign.</p> <p>We analyzed these data, along with data acquired simultaneously by the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager instrument in space, which added value to our internal gravity waves study and also our investigation into using acoustic waves to probe the Sun's atmosphere.</p> <p>We succeeded in achieving our central goal and have developed a method to image and characterize internal gravity waves in the solar atmosphere. Our approach is a significant advance over the previous detection method, which only measures the average properties of IGWs. Our new method uses the three-dimensional cross-correlation function between the vertical velocities measured at different heights in the Sun's atmosphere. The approach was motivated by similar techniques used in time-distance helioseismology and seismic interferometry. We have shown that the new measurement technique is sensitive to flows in the solar atmosphere and offers a probe for mapping their behavior. This capability provides a first step for using IGWs as a new tool for probing the solar atmosphere's characteristics.</p> <p>We have also produced the first-ever spatial maps of the acoustic cut-off frequency, radiative damping, and sound speed in the Sun's lower atmosphere. The maps of acoustic cut-off frequency showed that in the vicinity of active regions, the cut-off frequency is larger than its value in the quiet Sun. This finding may explain several seemingly disparate observations of the Sun's behavior made over the past twenty years. Additionally, the acoustic cut-off frequency variation with time can potentially reveal locations where there are rapid changes in the solar atmosphere's properties, such as might be expected with an eruptive event like a flare.
