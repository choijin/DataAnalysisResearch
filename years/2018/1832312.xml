<AbstractNarration>This project supports the organization of the second NSF Expeditions in Computing (Expeditions) Principal Investigators' (PI) Meeting at the Newseum's Knight Conference Center in Washington, DC, between Sunday, December 9 and Tuesday, December 11, 2018. The 2018 Expeditions PI Meeting builds on the previous Expeditions PI Meeting and Expeditions research by fostering collaboration and promoting close interaction between academia and industry, governments, research labs, etc. The meeting is a unique opportunity to interact with a broad cross-section of the scientific community, CISE leadership, as well as with leaders in both industry and academia. It also provides an important venue for scanning horizons activities, establishing new collaborations between different collaborating teams, and exploring possible technology transfer and partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These meetings are designed to advance knowledge by exposing the progress of compelling and transformative collaborative research conducted by multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary research teams that promise disruptive innovations in computer and information science and engineering, to allow PIs to showcase their research, and to provide an opportunity to network. The 2018 Expeditions PI Meeting will bring together approximately 150 stakeholders comprising academia, industry, and government. The Expeditions PI Meeting 2018 will take place on the 10th year anniversary of the Expeditions program launch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The 2018 Expeditions PI Meeting marked a milestone project that represented the community's 10<sup>th</sup>-year anniversary as a national program, with the theme of "<em>10 Years of Transforming Science and Society</em>". The meeting was designed<em> </em>to expose the rich accomplishments and impact on society at large of CISE's center-scale, flagship projects, to discuss future directions for the program, and to serve as an "Aspiring PI Meeting" where PIs of medium and large CISE project can learn about what it takes to run an Expeditions project.</span></p> <p><span>Expeditions are the single largest CISE-funded projects. The goal of the CISE Expeditions program is to advance knowledge by exposing the rich progress of compelling, transformative, long-term collaborative research conducted by multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary research teams that promise disruptive innovations in computer and information science and engineering, that contribute majorly to U.S. economic competitiveness and enhance quality of life. Expeditions are important because they last longer over space and time and provide good ROIs to the Federal government. Twenty-two (22) Expeditions have been awarded since the inception of the program in 2008. The large majority of these projects are five years in duration and $10 million in size. </span></p> <p><span>The 10<sup>th</sup>-year anniversary celebration brought together a total of approximately 146 stakeholders comprising current and former NSF Expeditions Program researchers, students, program managers, and students from academia, industry, and government in a unique setting over the better part of three days to review the great achievements of the&nbsp;Expeditions program over the last decade. Twenty-one (21) of the twenty-two (22) Expeditions projects were represented by PIs, Co-PIs, and students who worked on each project. Project presentations were in the form of lightning talks and poster sessions.</span></p> <p><span>The event kicked off with an evening dinner on Sunday, December 11, 2018 comprising talks by Dr. James Kurose Assistant Director, NSF/CISE Directorate) who opened and moderated the dinner program; Michael Kratsios (Deputy Assistant to the President, OSTP, Executive Office of the President at the time of the event); Dr. Diane Souvaine (Chair, National Science Board and Professor of Computer Science, Tufts University); and a featured keynote by Dr. L. Rafael Reif (President, MIT) and fireside chat between Dr. Reif and Dr. France Cordova (Executive Director, NSF). Among other dinner guests were additional White House officials, former NSF CISE Assistant Directors, and Expeditions PIs.</span></p> <p><span>Pre-meeting planning for this second PI Meeting took place over a nine-month calendar period in conjunction with members of the Vanderbilt ISIS CPS VO team and NSF CISE-Management officials.
