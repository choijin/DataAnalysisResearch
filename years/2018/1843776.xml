<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop educational technologies to better train university students to innovate. To become innovators, students must gain practice solving real-world problems, such as reducing hospital acquired infections, narrowing education achievement gaps or reducing poverty. However, universities struggle to provide the labor intensive, face-to-face coaching necessary for student innovators to tackle real-world problems. This project develops a novel online project-based learning platform that helps instructors more effectively coach innovation project teams. The platform allows instructors to (a) create libraries of project goals to help students plan, (b) collaboratively author and remix design guides to help students develop technical skills, and (c) crowdsource large group, face-to-face critique to provide feedback on in-progress innovation work. The research and development in this project focus on overcoming the technical risks associated with creating the software libraries necessary to create new project-based learning platforms and supporting the complex computer-supported collaborative learning interactions necessary to achieve desired learning outcomes. By developing the technologies necessary to enable more effective project-based learning, this project will improve university education and create a more capable innovation workforce better able to tackle societal challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project will conduct research and development of the Loft platform, which combines a novel project-based learning environment, social media platform, and software components to transform how universities train social innovators. Technical risks in this project stem from software engineering, learning sciences, and computer-supported cooperative work obstacles associated with creating novel software platforms to enable new pedagogical strategies that achieve more effective learning outcomes in project-based learning environments. Software libraries will include a more powerful and flexible set of components for creating complex object hierarchies and social media interfaces required for rapid development of the crowdsourcing and real-time collaborative editing features needed for online project-based learning platforms. The platform will introduce new computer-supported collaborative learning strategies, such as collaborative remixing of instructional content, technology-supported tailoring of instructional goals to individual project teams, and crowd critique to provide feedback as good or better than individual instructors. Research and development will test the impact of the platform on learning outcomes for innovation teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This SBIR Phase I project developed an online platform, Loft that trains K-12 teachers in curriculum improvement processes so that they can achieve better, more equitable learning outcomes for their students. Specifically, Loft is designed for educational networks -- distributed networks that train K-12 teachers across schools and school districts to innovate improved curriculum to better educate the next generation. Educational networks facilitate distributed coaching -- where educational expert coaches create training material that guide teachers teams through an improvement process and provide feedback to teacher teams on developing more effective teaching practices.  However, directors of educational networks face many pain points facilitating distributed coaching networks, namely: (1) creating and tailoring training materials for coaches to use with teachers; (2) ensuring that teachers across the network receive high-quality feedback; (3) helping teacher teams conduct a high-quality improvement process; and (4) measuring the efficacy of their network to improve the network and report to their funders. Loft addresses these needs by supporting educational networks with 3 integrated apps: Loft Guides, Loft Feedback and Loft Projects that help distribute coaching in educational networks: Loft Guides provides tools for authoring and distributing online guides that facilitators and teams use to learn the innovation process.  Loft Guides combines real-time editing features with crowdsourcing management tools and the ability to remix and tailor guides for specific schools and teams.  This provides curriculum developers with the ability to author, crowdsource and tailor curriculum. Loft Feedback provides online feedback tools for both online and large-group, face-to-face critique that allows many people in the network to provide crowdsource feedback that is as good or better than an individual expert. Loft Feedback scaffolds critical parts of the improvement process to increase the amount and quality of feedback to teams. Loft Projects provides project management tools setting specific process milestones for teams (linked to Loft Guides), which supports team planning. It also notifies coaches in the network via email when teams request for help or need feedback. Furthermore, Loft Projects shows the network directors who is giving and receiving feedback, allowing directors to gather data on the efficacy of the network.  The SBIR Phase I project overcame 3 sets of technical risks: (a) the software engineering challenge of developing a complex social media platform; (b) the software architecture challenge of creating a platform that uses a modern software stack that allows quick redesign and testing to achieve a high level of performance and usability, and (c) the human-computer interaction challenge of producing software that K12 educational directors can use effectively with little training.  Software engineering milestones included successfully development of 3 novel software libraries: Discourse, which provides real-time, Facebook-like message streams;  Delta-py, that allows Google-doc style editing of guide content using the Quill editor; and Splendor, a library for declaratively writing database model that automatically produces back-end code integrated with cloud services to increase maintainability and reliability.  Software architecture milestones included successful tests of modern, progressive web app performance by providing higher performing reliable architecture with sub-second load times; adaptation to changing web components standards that required architecture redesign; and development of headless content architecture, to allow unbundling of the 3 Loft apps. Human-Computer Interaction milestones included successful empirical tests showing that: Loft Guides allows authors to quickly generate and remix content; Loft Feedback provides a greater amount of high quality feedback than competitors; and Loft projects allows directors to quickly prioritize and start responding to help requests.  This project helps expand our application of educational technology, by creating a sustainable platform to support thousands of teachers improving the education of tens-of-thousands of students. The broader impact of Loft is to help create software that can help continue to improve K-12 education. Through these 3 apps, the Loft platform can significantly reduce the time and effort it takes to support teachers making improvements to their curriculum and teaching.
