<AbstractNarration>The intensity of hurricanes is anticipated to rise with rising temperatures and individual storms can have dramatic impacts on the carbon dynamics in forests. A strong, single hurricane can convert significant amounts of living forest carbon into dead biomass, and much of that carbon will return to the atmosphere through natural decomposition and soil carbon losses. This acts as a positive feedback to a warming climate. Severe storms also change species composition making the forest vulnerable to subsequent hurricanes. The majority of studies on impacts of hurricanes on ecosystems, however, have been conducted at the plot level and over a limited range of environmental conditions. As a result, our understanding of the factors that impact forest vulnerability to hurricanes and post-storm recovery at the landscape scale is extremely limited. This research will investigate the effects of Hurricane Maria on forested landscapes in Puerto Rico using a combination of a remotely sensed satellite products, data from field plots, and mathematical models. The proposed research will generate data and knowledge essential for the development of forest management practices that are resilient to climate variability and change. Data will be made publicly available and shared with government agencies. One technician, one graduate student, and ten field volunteers will be trained in ecological research. A RAPID response is required to prevent loss of data due to vegetation decomposition and to link remote sensing data to ground observations of damage. Re-growth after storms is swift; the remote sensing signal lasts approximately 1 year following a storm, until post-storm recovery generates new leaf biomass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hurricanes represent the dominant natural disturbance in temperate and tropical forests in coastal regions of the North Atlantic. Severe storms also favor recruitment of early successional tree species that are particularly vulnerable to subsequent hurricanes, acting as a positive feedback that exacerbates ecosystem vulnerability. The spatial distribution of wind damage across the landscape depends on storm meteorology, physical landscape heterogeneity, and the attributes of individual trees and aggregate stand structure. Disentangling the contribution of each of these factors to observed damage can be difficult because tree species differ in their vulnerability to storm damage and, at the same time, are distributed in a non-random fashion with respect to landscape factors. Understanding ecosystem vulnerability to severe storms over large spatial extents requires approaches that can tease apart the contributions of landscape and local factors. The proposed research will rely on recent advances in remote sensing tools including optical and hyperspectral images and Light Detection and Ranging to generate novel insights into the landscape and local factors that lead to spatial heterogeneity in storm impacts across broad spatial extents. Investigators will address the following questions: 1) how do landscape characteristics such as topography, slope, aspect, geology, and forest age and fragmentation influence wind damage and biomass loss after a severe hurricane; 2) what is the selective pressure of hurricane damage on forest composition; and (3) how does landscape heterogeneity influence biomass recovery?</AbstractNarration>

Hurricane Mar?a was a category 4 storm that struck Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017 and brought record-breaking rainfall over much of the island. It was the most intense storm to make landfall since 1928 and the impacts of this storm may herald future forest responses to storms under a changing climate. Our research asks the following questions:     1.   How do storm meteorology, landscape characteristics (topography, slope, aspect, geology), and stand characteristics (forest age and height) influence wind damage and biomass loss after a severe hurricane? We combined remotely-sensed and damage data from 26 plots distributed across the island to evaluate the risk factors associated with the magnitude of forest damage caused by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rican forests and to estimate total aboveground biomass lost to these storms. We estimate that Puerto Rican forests lost approximately one third of standing pre-storm aboveground biomass. Total forest aboveground biomass lost was 15.79 Tg.  Storm-related rainfall was a stronger predictor of forest damage than maximum wind speeds. Spatial variation in soil water content and antecedent rainfall were also important risk factors, corroborating the importance of precipitation in regulating forest damage. Previous research has attributed vegetation damage to high wind speeds but our results suggest that rainfall is a more significant risk factor. Expected increases of 20% in hurricane-associated rainfall in the North Atlantic highlight the need to consider how such shifts will influence terrestrial ecosystems.     2.   Do hurricanes favor some species over others? If so, are the effects of H. Maria different from those of previous, weaker storms?  We compared tree damage data collected in the same forest in Puerto Rico after Hurricanes Hugo (1989, category 3), Georges (1998, category 3), and Mar?a (2017, category 4). Mar?a killed twice as many trees as Hugo, and for all but two species, broke 2- to 12-fold more stems than the other two storms. Large trees and species with weak wood were particularly vulnerable to uprooting and breakage. Considering observed high delayed mortality rates of broken stems, we estimate that Hurricane Mar?a will triple tree mortality rates in this forest relative to Hugo.      3.   How does hurricane severity influence biomass recovery?  We are using tree damage and recovery data collected after the storm to evaluate the nature and rate of forest recovery under more severe storms. The model predicted reductions in aboveground biomass but increases in belowground carbon storage along with large shifts in tree composition and a massive amount of carbon emissions to the atmosphere under more intense hurricanes.  With increased intensity, future hurricane events would convert an equivalent of 25% to 35% of the average annual tropical forest carbon storage rate in Puerto Rico into respired downed or dead biomass.              With increased intensity, future hurricane events would convert an equivalent of 25% to 35% of the average annual tropical forest carbon storage rate in Puerto Rico into respired downed or dead biomass.
