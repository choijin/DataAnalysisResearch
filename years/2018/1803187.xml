<AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation award enables the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) to administer a travel grant program for approximately one hundred U.S. based mathematical and computational scientists, early career faculty, and graduate students to attend the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM 2019), to be held July 15-19, 2019 at the Universidad Valencia, Valencia, Spain. The ICIAM is the premier international conference for applied mathematics, with approximately 500-750 U.S. participants anticipated. Travel grants to applicants will be awarded on a competitive basis. Applications will be evaluated by a panel of professional mathematical and computational scientists to select a diverse group of well-qualified researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applied and computational mathematics are global enterprises with significant impact on technology and economic development. ICIAM is an effective way to foster the interaction of U.S. mathematical and computational scientists with the international community of researchers and practitioners from academia, government and industry. The program for ICIAM 2019 will be distinguished by its focus and its outstanding speakers selected by the scientific program committee.  Focus areas in applied, industrial and computational mathematics will be chosen based on their current and future importance. More information about the conference is available at http://iciam2019.org/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this grant from the NSF DMS Infrastructure Program was to fund travel for U.S.-based mathematical and computational scientists, early career faculty, and graduate students to attend the Ninth International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM19) held in Valencia, Spain, July 15-19, 2019. Held every four years, ICIAM is a worldwide congress for industrial and applied mathematics that has high prestige, visibility, and impact. Travel awards were designed to (partially) cover air transportation, lodging, and registration costs consistent with the rules and procedures of the National Science Foundation.  An important objective of this grant was to help ensure strong participation of U.S.-based researchers in this high-profile international congress.  SIAM established a website with information on ICIAM19, including details about the travel awards and a link to SIAMâ€™s travel awards portal.  Through this portal, SIAM collected 77 travel award applications, 8 of which were from researchers who earned their Ph.D. degree before 2014, 42 of which were from early career faculty and 27 of which were from students.  22 applicants self-identified as women and 55 self-identified as men.  8 applicants self-identified as Hispanic or Latino. 3 early career faculty and 2 students were affiliated with institutions outside of the U.S. and were therefore not eligible.  Evaluation of the materials submitted by each applicant (a letter of application, a recent CV, and a letter of recommendation) was performed by a committee of three Ph.D. mathematicians.  Of the eligible applicants, all were found to have submitted materials meriting the travel award.  After withdrawals due to circumstances preventing attendance, 63 awardees were reimbursed for travel expenses.  Participation in ICIAM19 was especially important for graduate students and early career researchers since it allowed them to engage with the latest research from around the world in their areas of focus and, equally importantly, to establish contacts with researchers that they might not be able to meet in other circumstances.  Their participation in ICIAM19 has contributed to the advancement of the mathematical sciences, it has accelerated the professional development of the U.S.-based workforce, and it has elevated the stature of U.S.-based research in the mathematical sciences on the world stage.
