<AbstractNarration>The workshop will focus on the processes that are needed to link multiple interventions and work at different institutional levels to accomplish systemic and cultural changes that become embedded in the values, norms, and behaviors of faculty working in institutions of higher education. Drawing on the experience of past NSF ADVANCE grantees the workshop will document the structural processes that facilitated the institutional change within ADVANCE institutions.  This project will document this important aspect of learning that past NSF ADVANCE grantees have accumulated through many years of experience.  This information will be shared broadly with others interested in pursuing organizational change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop complements prior work by the PIs on the web-based StratEGIC Toolkit which provides text and video resources describing specific interventions of past NSF ADVANCE grantees.  The toolkit helps organizational leaders decide what to include in an institutional change effort to enhance STEM faculty gender equity. This workshop will focus on issues of process that the past NSF ADVANCE grantees have identified as critical for achieving change goals.  Preliminary information suggests that processes such as constructing a diverse leadership team, planning and delivering strategic communication, and leveraging multiple change interventions are all strategies that facilitate systemic change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The project has advanced understanding of the processes of organizational change that are important in ADVANCE Institutional Transformation (IT) projects. ADVANCE IT projects are institutional awards that seek to increase women’s representation and involvement as faculty in academic science and engineering discipline. Awardees do this by developing and implementing system-wide efforts to identify and remove organizational constraints that lead to gendered biases in hiring, promoting, or advancing faculty into leadership, and that inhibit women’s success in their faculty roles.   In previous work, the team studied ADVANCE IT projects and developed and published analyses of the interventions those projects developed to address gender inequities at different levels within higher education systems. Such interventions include, for instance, changes to hiring and promotion processes that expose and reduce implicit bias, or policies and procedures that allow faculty to arrange flexible work situations to accommodate their personal or family needs.  In the process of this research on interventions, we also developed a list of organizational processes that are important in accomplishing the change goals of ADVANCE awardees. We call these ‘scaffolding processes’ because they provide structural support and high-level connections for the multi-lever, multi-level change interventions, thus enhancing how these interventions work together to have greater institutional impact. Examples include processes such as working with institutional leaders, building and sustaining the project team, communicating with diverse stakeholders, and using data to shape the work and make decisions. In the current project, we held a working meeting with eighteen experienced and diverse institutional leaders from around the US to discuss these scaffolding processes and how they appeared (or not) in their own work. We refined a workshop-based data-gathering approach that engaged these leaders in targeted conversations to draw out their knowledge and generate collective insights. We also confirmed that the organizational processes identified earlier are important for newer ADVANCE projects and for change efforts in other domains of STEM education, such as instructional change. Finally, information captured at the workshop enriches the data we have about these organizational processes and helps to identify where we still need to learn more. Our planning work and participants’ advance preparation provided a sound foundation for sophisticated and collegial discussions and fostered fruitful connections. We concluded that the processes we discussed with people are portable: these key processes of change have resonance not only beyond the early generations of ADVANCE where our data were initially gathered, but for later generations of ADVANCE projects and beyond ADVANCE into other arenas of institutional change that are crucial to ensure effective and equitable STEM higher education across the nation.
