<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the advancement of battery technologies. The race for the perfect battery is intensifying due to growing global demand for both the electric vehicle (EV) and stationary storage industries. The search is on for new ways to improve energy and power density, reduce charging time, and extend battery life. The project will create a diagnostic tool that provides an unprecedented glimpse inside the battery and has the potential to accelerate scientific understanding of how batteries age. A more accurate assessment of battery degradation in real time can inform on-board algorithms, can improve overall battery pack efficiency, and has major cost saving impacts for automakers and stationary storage users. This predictability enables more cost-effective warranty management, improved charging and safety algorithms, and ever more efficient battery pack designs.  Having a sense of remaining useful life also enables the battery to be re-used in a secondary application - creating new business opportunities while a new revenue stream making batteries more sustainable.  Ultimately, this reduces costs for both consumers and manufacturers, and contributes to greener use of resources for society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project unlocks key insights for large-format lithium batteries. Today?s battery management systems (BMS) do not track a battery?s actual degradation metrics so it cannot forecast remaining useful life. This makes it hard to predict the ?cliff?, a sudden and steep drop in capacity near a battery?s end of life.  This forces battery makers to overdesign battery systems to reduce chances of premature failure before the warranty expiration. The proposed research employs electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) onboard a BMS.  EIS is a diagnostic tool that measures battery impedance - something only possible in a lab setting today. Tracking impedance unlocks a lifetime of degradation data and helps battery engineers better understand the long-term degradation behavior of high voltage battery packs. The project will focus on 1) minimizing the required hardware to measure impedance of each cell in a series-connected battery pack, and 2) reducing the down-time associated with the impedance measurement. The proposed innovation blends a unique hardware architecture with wide-bandgap semiconductors and adaptive charge-control algorithms to minimize hardware size. These help to reduce overall system cost and unlocks orders of magnitude improvement in hardware scalability over existing EIS methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The Phase I research project addressed roadblocks to ReJoule’s vision of a battery testing technology that accurately monitors the health, safety, and reliability of large-format batteries like those used in electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems (ESSs).  ReJoule’s technology uses an advanced characterization technique which is effective in controlled, laboratory-settings but is cost-prohibitive, bulky, and therefore impractical in uncontrolled real-world settings.  Outcomes of the Phase I project demonstrated the technical feasibility and economic viability of ReJoule’s innovation by improving its performance while reducing size and cost.  This has enabled ReJoule to start conversations with potential customers to deploy and commercialize the technology.   NSF support from Phase 1 research allowed ReJoule to:   perform experiments to compile an aging database on various battery chemistries   speed up assessment of key metrics like a battery’s state-of-health (SOH) and state-of-charge (SOC)   scale down the size of its hardware making it easier for potential customers (i.e., EV and ESS makers) to incorporate ReJoule's technology into their own more seamlessly.    These improvements will be increasingly important as trends in electrification continue.  By providing more information about a battery’s health, ReJoule can:   reduce testing times from hours down to minutes   help customers create more efficient battery packs   mitigate battery safety concerns   enable cost-effective repurposing of used batteries in a secondary application.   The Phase I project demonstrated that in one year and with a small team, ReJoule's innovation can cost effectively monitor the health and safety of batteries used in EV and ESS applications.  ReJoule’s next step will be to deploy this technology in field demonstrations to refine the innovation for large-scale commercial deployment.
