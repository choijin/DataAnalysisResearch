<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Summer Symposium in Real Analysis" that will be held June 24-29, 2019 at Trinity University.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of harmonic analysis, differential equations, mathematical biology, geometric measure theory, fractal geometry, dynamics and probability, nonlinear operator theory, and regularity theory for elliptic equations under minimal smoothness assumptions. A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be made available at: https://sites.trinity.edu/alamo-symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Summer Symposium in Real Analysis XLIII took place in San Antonio, Texas, from June 22 to June 26, 2019.There were about fifty five  participants from fifteen countries: USA, Canada, France, Italy, Poland, Russia, India, The Philippines, Nigeria, Finland, Senegal,  Czech Republic, Botswana, Brazil, Vietnam. In total, there were six keynote speakers who delivered each a one- hour lecture and twenty three  other speakers who delivered each a thirty-minutes presentation.

There were ten black or African Americans attendees, among which three keynote speakers and three regular speakers. There was a total of ten  students among which three  graduate students and seven undergraduate students who all received support from the NSF.  Intellectual Merit: Attendees to the Symposium were exposed to high caliber presentations from renown experts in the field of real analysis that included Profs. Brett Wick, Eric Sawyer, Maarit Jarvenpaa, Charles Chidume, Abdul-Aziz Yakubu, and Miranda Teboh-Ewungkem. The topics discussed were theoretical and applied enough to advance or eventually transform knowledge in the field.  There were questions and answers sessions, specifics research teams that met to discuss their individual research or how to collaborate on new research.   Broader Impacts: The participation  of women, students, researchers from underrepresented communities to this symposium shows the potential broader impact to the society as whole. Indeed, most students, women, and community of color were attending  for the first time such a meeting. For  Trinity University, the host institution,  it was only the second time to host  such a conference in mathematics in the last fifty years. Students at Trinity University got to meet and mingle with experts in mathematics, an opportunity they normally will not have. Conference Attendees got to visit the city of San Antonio during the planned excursion. The benefit to the participants, institution, and the society as whole could be great, since  similar experiences could be recreated, long lasting bonds and collaborations may have been established.   Summary: In all, the Summer Symposium in Real Analysis XLIII delivered on its promise to assemble experts in the field of Real Analysis and connected fields for a week long discussion on diverse topics Real Analysis and Applications.  It also delivered on its promise to make the attendance open to the general public, students, women, and underrepresented communities. It is hoped that it also  fostered vivid discussions, valuable connections, and long lasting bonds among the attendees.
