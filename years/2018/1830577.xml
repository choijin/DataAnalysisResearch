<AbstractNarration>This Leading Engineering for America's Prosperity, Health, and Infrastructure (LEAP-HI) project promises important improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of brain cancer, brain trauma and cranial defects, the mapping of brain function, and neurostimulation. The award supports fundamental research to overcome current difficulties in guiding acoustical energy through the skull and into the brain in a controlled way.  It will investigate vibration and wave propagation characteristics of the skull-brain system over a broad frequency range, from low frequencies to the ultrasound regime, by using synergistic analytical, computational and experimental methods to thoroughly and systematically investigate the vibration, vibroacoustics, and wave propagation properties of the skull-brain system and explore their relevance to medical diagnosis and therapy. The investigation of the skull and brain as a combined dynamical system will not only advance understanding of ultrasound-based treatments, but also open new possibilities for diagnosis and therapy. Overall, the outcomes of this research project are expected to have broad societal impacts in areas related to the public health, especially for disorders and diseases related to the brain and central nervous system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this interdisciplinary research project is to explore the vibration and ultrasonic wave propagation characteristics of the skull-brain system to improve therapeutics and diagnosis. The specific research questions are: (1) can an in-depth understanding of the coupled vibroacoustics of the skull-brain system be leveraged to more effectively overcome the skull barrier; (2) can the use of Lamb waves and longitudinal bulk waves enable the targeting of currently inaccessible brain regions for therapy; (3) can parametric array effects coupled with modal vibrations of the skull-brain system lead to improved targeting over the therapeutic and imaging frequency ranges? Research activities will be concentrated on the following two major components: (1) feasibility demonstration of spatially phase- and amplitude-modulated Lamb waves for targeting of currently inaccessible brain regions for ultrasound-based treatments, and (2) investigation of parametric ultrasound and acoustic radiation force effects coupled with modal vibrations of the skull-brain system for improved targeting over the therapeutic and imaging frequency ranges. The interdisciplinary research team will be focused on tasks pertaining to Lamb wave-based trans-skull ultrasound transmission and focusing, ultrasound excitation of skull-brain system vibration modes, and finite-amplitude sound propagation effects in the brain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ - We demonstrated the excitation of guided waves in a cadaver human skull, characterized leaky vs. non-leaky wave propagation behaviors, and identified the relevant frequencies and typical wave modes involved. Experiments were supported by numerical simulations performed using finite-element models obtained from CT-scan of the same skull with fluid loading in the cranial cavity.    - We derived a general solution (numerical and analytical) for sound propagation in heterogeneous mediums based on the angular spectrum approach and showed that it can be used to correct for skull aberrations.  - We demonstrated that parametric array excitation using high frequency focused ultrasonic fields (~1 MHz) is possible through human skull.  - We also demonstrated the excitation of a low-frequency vibroacoustic mode via ultrasound parametric excitation at high frequencies, as a succcesful experiment of the coupling of high frequency ultrasonic excitation with audio-frequency vibroacoustic response.  - Ultrasonic wedge transducers were successfully used to excite leaky and non-leaky Lamb wave modes (and scanning laser Doppler vibrometry was used for measurement). For instance, in the parietal bone, the lowest anti-symmetric Lamb wave mode was excited between 200-600 kHz, and higher-order Lamb waves were excited from 1 MHz to 1.8 MHz.  - From the experimental dispersion curves and average thickness extracted from the skull CT scan, we estimated average isotropic material properties that capture the essential dispersion characteristics using a semi-analytical finite element model.  - Successful excitation of leaky Lamb waves was confirmed experimentally for wave modes with phase velocity faster than the speed of sound in water, which may find applications in imaging and therapeutics at the brain periphery or skull-brain interface.  - Non-leaky Lamb waves were also excited successfully, which might potentially lead to applications such as skull related diagnosis (e.g. for the sutures).  - The proposed phase correction method based on the angular spectrum approach could provide a computationally efficient and accurate method for trans-skull transmit focusing.  - The generated low frequency pressure wave due to parametric array excitation has same the directivity with the high-frequency frequency focused ultrasound pulses.  - Coupling of high frequency parametric excitation with low frequency vibroacoustics of the skull suggests that the skull dynamics can be used as a feedback mechanism.
