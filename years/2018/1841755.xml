<AbstractNarration>Today's fast-moving and competitive markets increase the frequency of product updates and rapidly expand demands for customized parts. Accordingly, high quality, low-cost prototyping and low volume manufacturing processes are desirable. No proven additive manufacturing or rapid prototyping approaches exist for sheet metals or large, thin parts - conventional additive manufacturing has too small of a build space and warps too much to produce parts such as automotive body panels. Incremental sheet forming (ISF), which utilizes a small tool to induce local deformation as it translates over the metal sheet, is a manufacturing approach that has been investigated recently because of its die-less setup, universal tooling and high flexibility. However, achieving dimensional and geometric accuracy as well as surface finish of the current ISF formed parts are a challenge, but the main drawback is the limited formability in the approach, leading to very high scrap rates. Ultrasonic vibration, known for its bulk material softening effects, surface modification and friction behavior improvements, offers promise in alleviating these concerns. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award supports fundamental research to advance knowledge of the ultrasonic effects on material behavior in ISF processes. Success in this unique multidisciplinary study will lead to significant improved formability and process capabilities. Leveraging this new knowledge will expand ISF applications in various industries, such as aerospace, automotive, defense and medical, so that it has direct positive impact on the US national security and economic welfare. Students involved in the project will gain multidisciplinary knowledge and research capabilities including material, mechanical and manufacturing science and technologies. Outreach activities will emphasize the mentoring of women and underrepresented minorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is an innovative improvement of the incremental sheet forming (ISF) process by effectively applying ultrasonic vibration to the tool during the forming operation. The potential benefits are to reduce forming force, increase formability, increase dimensional and geometrical tolerance and improve surface quality. This collaborative project includes an integrated experimental and modeling study of material behavior during tensile testing with ultrasonic vibration utilizing high speed digital image correlation analysis.  The results will serve to design an effective approach for incorporating ultrasonic energy into ISF process. Ultrasonically assisted ISF will then be performed under different conditions. The interaction mechanisms between ultrasonic vibration and material deformation during ISF will be studied in terms of in-process variables, post-processing properties and multi-scale microstructure. The effect of ultrasonic vibration on both surface and bulk properties will be studied, including the impact on texture and grain size. The goals of this project are (1) understanding of the fundamental principles that govern the material behavior under ultrasonic vibration and (2) demonstration of the improvements enabled by ultrasonically assisted incremental forming process for complex free form geometries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This collaborative project demonstrated the efficacy of applying ultrasonic vibrations to the tool during incremental sheet forming (UA-ISF). The results provide insight into how to effectively reduce the forces during ISF and potentially increase the geometrical accuracy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The novel characterization techniques utilized in the study also advanced the understanding of the relationship between acousto-plasticity physics and its dependence on different material systems, microstructures, and modes of deformation. The better understanding of the underlying acoustic effects supports the proliferation of vibration-aided manufacturing in other applications such as machining and drilling. The project furthers the design and development of various innovative hybrid manufacturing processes, which leverage the existing technologies and accelerates wide applications of newly developed advanced materials.&nbsp;In this collaborative project, the Ohio State University (OSU) team leads an integrated experimental and modeling study of ultrasonic effects on material deformation behavior in terms of flow stress, strain distribution and microstructure evolution. The University of Michigan team leads UA-ISF studies, where both UA single-point incremental forming (SPIF) and UA two-point incremental forming (TPIF) are comprehensively analyzed in terms of forming force, surface roughness, deformed sheet thickness, texture and grain size. The two teams are collaborating closely to effectively incorporate ultrasonic energy into ISF process and reveal the underlying physical principles based on the efforts and expertise from the two sites.</p> <p>At the UM site, they demonstrated the use of ultrasonic vibration in incremental sheet forming (ISF), a complex manufacturing process with various deformation modes. An ultrasonic transducer was outfitting into a computer numerical control (CNC) machine operating at 20kHz frequency. A spring collet can be used to attach various size of hemispherical tools used in ISF. The use of ultrasonic vibrations in single-point incremental forming (SPIF) was shown to be ineffective. Since SPIF does not utilize supports, such as a die, the sheet is free to vibrate and resonate which diminishes the acoustic energy transfer. This can be visualized in Figure 1, where the force dips represent instances of resonance. In two-point incremental forming (TPIF), the sheet is supported by a partial- or half-die, enabling better transfer of acoustic energy and results in significant force reduction as shown in Figure 2. The vibrations also assisted in reducing the degree of abrasion and adhesion wear on the sheet surface, improving the surface roughness. The ability to alter the thickness of the sheet locally, through selective use of vibrations, was also demonstrated (Figure 3). Coupling the material model with UA-ISF will allow for local and selective use of acousto-plasticity to achieve the desired material properties and dimensional tolerances. The OSU team and UM team have regular bi-weekly meetings to discuss results and exchange findings. UM team also supports base aluminum alloys for the OSU team to perform material testing.</p> <p>These UA-ISF results are analyzed together with the UA micro tensile tests results from OSU site. The novel material testbed provides information regarding the local evolution of strain in-situ and the ability to correlate material microstructure to the magnitude of acoustic softening. This capability provided initial insights on how to decouple multi-dimensional defects (dislocations, grain boundaries) and their influence on the acousto-plastic effect. This enables the development of a more robust material constitutive model, furthering the nation?s effort in advancing integrated computational material engineering (ICME) and design. The preliminary results show a direct correlation between the applied vibration amplitude and the magnitude of softening. There was no significant sensitivity of the flow stress reduction to strain rate (0.06/s and 1/s) and heat generation that was too minimal to cause softening or microstructural change. Using electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) characterization, a reduction in grain boundary misorientation density and a more distinct texture evolution was observed.&nbsp;Preliminary finite element modeling (FEM) did not capture the full force reduction, indicating the softening effect is caused by something beyond the oscillatory displacement (stress superposition).</p> <p>The results of the project can have broader impacts on manufacturing. Acousto-plasticity effect can be extended to different materials systems which have been notoriously difficult to form or require additional post-processing steps. The approach can be extended to double-sided incremental forming (DSIF), which utilizes a moving support tool, and robotic forming allowing for greater geometric freedom. The dual benefit of the agile nature of ISF and the unique solution of ultrasonic-aided vibration allows various industries, including aerospace, automotive and medical prosthesis, to achieve customized parts, improve turnaround time, and design optimal material properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of this collaborative project are disseminated through conferences, seminars and journal publications. The results are also presented in the Manufacturing USA institute, LIFT to attract attention from industrial members. Boeing company agrees to provide in-kind support for the project.
