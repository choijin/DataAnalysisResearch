<AbstractNarration>This project addresses a fundamental question in the study of life: when, how, and why do animals exhibit large-scale species loss and gain through time? Complex life has experienced countless rounds of such changes over the last 500 million years varying in geographic scale from local to global, in timing from days to tens of millions of years, and in scope from single species to all life. Despite the numerical dominance and ecological importance of fishes in modern oceans, little is known about their specific responses to events like mass extinction or the triggers of their proliferation. This project is assembling and analyzing the first comprehensive databases for all known fossil fishes through time. Processing this data involves training teams of undergraduates in cutting-edge 'Big Data' analytics and programming, imparting essential skills for multiple careers. These efforts are revealing the origins of modern fishes and fundamental biodiversity processes and are informing fisheries and conservation efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fishes are vastly diverse (34,000 living species) and are key components of aquatic ecosystems, functionally distinct from both benthic invertebrates and terrestrial tetrapods. Patterns and processes of fish turnover are therefore essential for understanding modern biodiversity, selective mechanisms driving its origins, and biosphere evolution. There is growing evidence that fishes have exhibited distinct sequences of biodiversity loss and gain over their 500 million year history. However, elucidation and understanding of this record is hampered by a lack of appropriate, comprehensive datasets for most intervals. This project is creating global diversity, environmental and ecological compendia for fossil fishes. These data are revealing temporal patterns of turnover and are enabling direct testing of when fish diversity trends were primarily driven by 1) selective mass extinctions ('Big Five' and others, including unknown or second-order extinctions), 2) longer-term environmental changes ('Ice House' vs. 'Hot House' Intervals), or 3) competitive replacement. Creating the database of fossil fishes is enhancing infrastructure for research and education. Teaching and training students are central activities in this project and are advancing discovery and understanding. Benefits of this project to society include the potential to inform public policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
