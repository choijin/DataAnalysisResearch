<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans,Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is to increase the quantity and competitiveness of STEM graduate students from historically underrepresented minority populations, with emphasis on STEM doctoral matriculation and completion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2018-2020 Western Alliance to Expand Student Opportunities (WAESO) LSAMP BD program will recruit twelve (12) alumni from LSAMP institutions nationwide for STEM postbaccalaureate studies at the University of Arizona (UA).   Student support in the form of stipends and cost of education are provided for two years for each student. The institution commits to assisting the students financially through research and teaching assistantships as well as through competitive institutional fellowship opportunities to complete the STEM doctoral degree program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evaluation consists of formative and summative approaches and incorporates the graduate education self-efficacy scale (GESES) instrument which quantifies self-efficacy for academic, research and social skills.  Outcomes will be disseminated broadly through the institution's website, scholarly journals, and presentations at STEM professional conferences. The project findings from the research and evaluative activities increases scholarly knowledge on broadening participation in STEM disciplines at the graduate and post-graduate level while contributing to the diversity of the nation's STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this project was to locate/recruit and guide a cohort of 12 underrepresented minority (URM) science technology, engineering math (STEM) students.  The selected students were four African American, seven Hispanic, one Native American and three of students were woman. The students were starting off in graduate programs either as  MS or PhD candidates and the intent of the cohort was to give them the tools and guidance needed to prepare them to be competitive and successful in their STEM graduate programs and in their future chosen career fields.  The project recruited high quality students who were pursuing either MS and/or PhD degrees; provided them with a major fellowship, research project, mentoring, cohort community and professional development opportunities.  By the end of the project, cohort students indicated they had the tools to prepare them for success in either their PhD program or in their chosen profession after achieving their degree goals.  The cohort allowed students from African American, Hispanic, and Native American communities to overcome obstacles and collaborate on research projects, service activity planning, and applying for graduate assistantships and fellowships.  Students from the cohort also attended conferences, presented posters, and prepared to publish research.  These 12 students know they have the support from their cohort, faculty, and staff to further their education and to be successful in their chosen fields.  With the skills they have learned in the cohort they now serve as mentors to other students.  With the research they have completed, three students have completed their masters degrees and seven students are currently in their chosen STEM PhD programs.
