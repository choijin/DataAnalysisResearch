<AbstractNarration>This project supports the deployment of an instrument to measure black carbon (BC) in the atmosphere during a field study that is planned to take place during mid-June through mid-July 2018, near Monterey, California.  The instrument will be part of a broader suite of aerosol, cloud, and precipitation probes to be flown on the Office of Naval Research Twin Otter aircraft with the goal of assessing the effects of aerosol particles on marine clouds.  These data will be used to assess the influence of ship exhaust and biomass burning on the marine atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Detailed analysis of Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) data will be used to determine the mixing state of black carbon aerosol; that is, the amount of non-refractory material mixed with black carbon on a per-particle basis.  The nature of black carbon aerosol will be used with back trajectory analysis of the sampled air masses to determine if different types of black carbon particles can be attributed to different sources.  The measurements made through this project will address questions such as: (1) How does the nature (size distribution and mixing state) of BC aerosol in the Eastern Pacific compare to that in other remote, marine environments where similar measurements have been performed? (2) Can the nature of BC aerosol be used to determine the source of that aerosol? And (3) What is the relationship between BC aerosol mixing state and particle scavenging in the marine boundary layer?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Refractory black carbon (BC) aerosol, sometimes called soot, is an important type of aerosol particle in Earth’s atmosphere.  BC aerosol strongly absorbs solar energy and, thus, can have a climate forcing potential as strong as carbon dioxide in some regions.  Although remote, marine locations across the world typically have few airborne particles polluting these regions, BC aerosol has, nonetheless, been measured in quantifiable amounts in these regions.  Because of its strong absorbing properties, even these small amounts of BC can impact the local climate and cloud dynamics.  This RAPID project allowed a team from Clemson University to bring a single particle soot photometer (SP2) instrument, which measures black carbon aerosol, to an aircraft field measurement campaign.  The field project, called the Marine Aerosol Cloud and Wildfire Study (MACAWS), occurred in June and July of 2018.  A suite of aerosol and cloud instruments were installed on the Naval Postgraduate School Twin Otter aircraft, which flew 16 measurement flights out of a regional airport just north of Monterey, CA.  Three types of research flights were conducted:  aerosol-cloud studies, cloudy-clear air studies, and wildfire studies.    The SP2 instrument is a laser light-scattering and laser-induced incandescence measurement technique that is very specific for measuring the mass of individual black carbon-containing particles.  The main goal of this RAPID project was to add this powerful measurement technique to the suite of instruments that were already planned for the MACAWS mission.  This capability has resulted in a high time-resolution dataset of single-particle BC aerosol measurements over the Eastern Pacific/Central Coast of California, including number and mass mixing ratios, mass and size distributions, and number fractions of coated versus uncoated BC particles.  Together with the existing payload of instruments on the Twin Otter, a number of studies are complete or currently underway with the MACAWS dataset, including studying aerosol-cloud interactions from the perspective of aerosol hygroscopicity and cloud condensation nuclei (Schulze et al., 2020, Earth and Space Science), studying the effect of wildfire plumes on the region as a whole, and studying the effect of black carbon aerosol, in particular, on the marine stratocumulus clouds prevalent in the region.  A number of scientific discoveries, specifically from the BC dataset, have been made during these studies.  For small wildfires, or those near the end of their life, the plume from the fire is hard to separate from an already fairly polluted region, namely the Sacramento Valley of California.  For larger wildfires with a more distinct plume, the size distribution of the individual BC particles is also distinctly different than for an urban plume &ndash; that is, biomass burning BC has a larger median diameter than urban-emitted BC aerosol has.  Use of back trajectory models, such as Hysplit, to determine source locations of airmasses can prove challenging, even with the high-time resolution measurements from the aircraft to help validate these models.  Measurements over the ocean indicate clear evidence for wet scavenging of BC aerosol by the marine stratocumulus clouds in most cases; however, there is also evidence that BC can remain in the cloud layer during some sampling periods.  Above the marine stratocumulus layer, just above the temperature inversion, there persists a layer of BC aerosol about 400 meters thick, which is likely the result of pollution being advected offshore.  Well above this just-above cloud layer, in the free troposphere above about 1000 meters in altitude, another layer of BC aerosol is usually found, likely the result of longer-range transport of pollution.  These findings add to our knowledge of the complexity of the atmosphere and aerosol-cloud interactions in what is usually considered to be a ‘clean’ marine region.  A number of broader impacts have resulted from this work.  First, the scientific discoveries listed above have been disseminated to the scientific community through conference presentations and a publication, with more peer-reviewed articles currently underway.  Second, this project contributed to the education of 7 undergraduate researchers who gained experience with data analysis and laboratory experiments.  Third, this project partially supported 2 Master’s students who have led much of the work analyzing the SP2 measurements and presenting the results at conferences.
