<AbstractNarration>The research seeks to advance our understanding of internal dynamics in governing Tropical Cyclone (TC) intensification and improve forecasting skills for rapid change of TC intensity. The results and products of this project can be immediately implemented in operational models for TC prediction, disseminated to the broader TC modeling community, and used in Principal Investigator (PI)'s course teaching in TC theories and applications. The project supports a postdoctoral researcher.  The educational goal of the project is to train and educate the next generation of scientists with the engagement of postdoctoral researcher and graduate/undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conventional view of Tropical Cyclone (TC) intensification regards the absolute angular momentum as a materially conserved quantity above the friction layer.  This study seeks to demonstrate that the eddy process associated with eyewall and rainband convection serves as a sole forcing for the azimuthal-mean angular momentum conservation.  It is this forcing that provides an ultimate mechanism for triggering and driving Rapid Intensification (RI) of TCs that cannot be explained by the classic TC intensification theories.  At the current resolution of operational models, the PIs demonstrate that the sub-grid scale (SGS) forcing above the PBL associated with convection poses an important bearing on TC intensification, especially RI.  How to generate a realistic SGS forcing aloft in the TC inner-core region is a new challenge in turbulent mixing parameterization that has not been previously explored.  The most important features of this EAGER project are: (1) advance our understanding of the role of eddy forcing associated with eyewall and rainband convection in modulating intensity change of TCs and (2) develop physically robust parameterization to represent sub-grid scale forcing associated with convection above the PBL in numerical models used for TC prediction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Accurate prediction of tropical cyclone (TC) intensity change is difficult because the storm intensity is not only governed by environmental conditions but also internal processes.  TC intensity change involves a complicated interaction of multiscale physical processes. The main goal of this project is to advance our understanding of the role of turbulent eddies in modulating storm intensity. This project examined how and why turbulent eddies that have scales smaller than the grid space of a numerical prediction model affect the TC structure and intensity. One of the important sub-grid-scale processes is turbulent mixing in the planetary boundary layer (PBL). In TCs, turbulence is generated not only by shear and buoyancy production in the PBL, but also by radiative cooling, evaporative cooling, and inhomogeneous diabatic effects above the PBL. While the eddy forcing term is negative definite in the PBL, the sign and magnitude of the eddy forcing above the PBL is indefinite. From the perspective of conservation of absolute angular momentum, the high-order eddy term may be important for driving the evolution of the primary circulation.    In this project, we evaluated the effects of vertical mixing strength both within and above the PBL on TC intensity changes in numerical simulations. We also analyzed observational data collected in TCs with different intensities and intensity change rates.  Key findings of this project include:  The low-level radial flow and moist entropy are highly asymmetric in a sheared weak storm, and the vortex is tilted within the boundary layer. Boundary-layer recovery and vortex alignment favor saturation of the core region before hurricane rapid intensification in shear. The strength of vertical turbulent mixing within the boundary layer regulates the boundary layer inflow and convergence, which in turn affects the radial and azimuthal distributions of convection, vortex tilt evolution in shear, convergence of absolute angular momentum, and thus the storm intensity. Eddy forcing associated with clouds above the boundary layer affects the storm intensity mainly by modulating the eddy advection of absolute angular momentum and ventilation process.   The intellectual merit of this research is improving our understanding of the role of internal dynamics in TC intensification. The results and products of this EAGER project can be implemented in operational models for TC prediction and used in courses related to TC theories and applications.
