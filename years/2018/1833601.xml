<AbstractNarration>Basic and engineering science can deliver game changing advances in the way we live and the disciplines of computational and applied mathematics are increasingly central to these developments. The Texas and Louisiana SIAM Section spans a geographical region including 13 Universities and several Medical and Industrial Research Centers. Motivated by this exciting synergy the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Texas-Louisiana Section Meeting will be held from 10/5/2018 through 10/7/2018 at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge Louisiana. The Meeting  offers a special opportunity for increasing diversity and breadth of participation by actively engaging a much broader base of younger applied mathematicians than in more standard symposium formats. This symposium format allows undergraduate students, graduate students and young investigators to directly interact with the greater research community on interdisciplinary problems coming from the frontiers of science and applied mathematics. This feature increases diversity and full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields. It exposes undergraduate students, graduate students, and early career applied mathematicians to contemporary and fundamental theoretical problems challenging science; enabling future breakthroughs through interdisciplinary collaboration. One of the outcomes of this Meeting to provide a unique and valuable experience in the research education of next the generation of investigators and educators. This Meeting is intended to foster collaboration and synergy between the applied mathematics community and the basic and engineering science community and to facilitate interaction and collaboration between the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) and the Universities and Research Centers in the Texas - Louisiana region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific goals of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Texas-Louisiana Section Meeting are:  To foster new scientific collaborations between applied and computational mathematicians and researchers in the basic and engineering sciences in order to address contemporary problems at the frontiers of science. Mini symposia include Mathematics in Gulf of Mexico offshore oil and gas production, Modeling, analysis, and computation in mathematical biology, Computational methods for waves in complex media, High-order accurate numerical methods for multi-physics problems, Numerical PDE/ODE and high performance computing applications, Mathematics in oil and gas exploration and production, Spectral theory of differential operators, Multiscale methods and uncertainty quantification for porous media, Numerical approximation of fractional differential equations, Mathematical and computational aspects of fracture, Nonlinear partial differential equations and applications, Numerical Geometric PDE, and Nonlinear modeling of disease dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The grant provided partial travel support for over 10 undergraduate students, 10 graduate students, and 6 early carear Professors and Postdocs to participate in this conference. The LA-TX undergraduate conference was held Friday October 5 and allowed undergraduate teams to present their research in the form of 20 minute talks. Over 70 people attended and participated in the undergraduate talks on October 5. The TX-LA Section SIAM symposium held on October 6 and 7 featured 19 minisymposia with over 150 talks and was attended by over 170 participants.
