<AbstractNarration>Microbes can produce many valuable products. One obstacle to making these products economically is our inability to easily redirect metabolism. This project will evaluate a specific class of proteins as a metabolic switch. If successful, the strategy could greatly expand our ability to manufacture chemicals biologically. This project will also develop a diverse biotechnology workforce through the involvement of underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will construct and characterize novel temperature and pH responsive transcriptional regulators that are of broad interest to the greater scientific community. The project also establishes the potential of these systems as tunable, synthetic dynamic regulators of metabolic pathways. A modular approach whose elements can be easily swapped and tuned for full control of performance is proposed. Synthetic elastin-like proteins (ELPs), are applied in a novel context to recognize generic indicators of cellular stress. As sensor sensitivity is programmed by ELP sequence, sensing elements are readily adapted to a number of processes. Similarly, the transcription factor controller element may be swapped with different species- specific transcriptional activators or repressors to effect control in diverse production species and control modes. This project is expected to help transform microbial chemical factory design by introducing a new tool for the optimization of novel production pathways, thus broadening the portfolio of feasible products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project developed new transcriptional regulators that may one day be used to optimize microbial biomanufacturing of fuels, medicines and other chemicals. A challenge of microbial bioproduction is the tuning of biosynthetic pathways to minimize waste and increase bioproduction. To address this, we created modular regulators or ?valves? that are sensitive to the environment (temperature and/or pH) by linking an elastin-like protein (ELP) with a transcription factor. The response of these engineered constructs is theoretically tunable by varying the ELP and transcription factor used. We found that in response to increases in temperature, these devices reduced protein expression relative to controls in <em>E. coli</em> by more than 90% as designed. This response is reversible and thus enables the use of these devices for dynamic/autonomous process control to optimize microbial production. We also generated ELP variants that are pH sensitive, which may have application in the production of various commodity chemicals and drop-in fuels that we demonstrated have a significant impact on intracellular pH, cell health, and production yields. Despite these successes, however, we found that we could not fully silence gene expression with these constructs. We have also initiated work on pathway development for value-added compounds whose production would benefit from our engineered valves. The findings of this work have been disseminated broadly at regional and national conferences 4 times and has supported the training and development of 2 female summer undergraduate researchers, 1 female MS student, 1 PhD student, and 1 postdoc. Findings from the project are being prepared for publication in the scientific literature. A Biology ?Escape Room? that builds on principles employed in this project was also developed to engage sophomore and junior high school students from underprivileged institutions and foster an interest in STEM majors. This Escape Room was well received by the participating students, and will form a backbone of future outreach efforts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Kevin&nbsp;Solomon</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
