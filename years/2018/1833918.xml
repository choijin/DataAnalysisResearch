<AbstractNarration>The NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program supports the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need.  This S-STEM project at Roger Williams University aims to increase the retention, persistence, graduation, and career placements of lower income students.  Over a five-year period, this project will provide 68 annual scholarships to 20 students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in applied math, biology, biochemistry, chemistry, computer science, engineering, environmental science, forensic science, marine biology, or mathematics. The project aims to educate students to become critical thinkers who can collect, interpret, translate, and share scientific information critical to informed decision making. The project will train the scholarship students in science communication, using popular platforms to emphasize STEM issues of personal and societal relevance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to investigate science communication as a potential high-impact practice for increasing persistence, engagement, and placement of students in STEM careers. Although science communication has become a crucial element of graduate and professional development, relatively few programs emphasize this kind of training at primarily undergraduate institutions. A summer bridge program will introduce students to the science communication initiative via projects that target communities outside of traditional academic environments. The general education courses in public speaking and writing studies will incorporate science communication enhancements. To promote student engagement and success in STEM, the project will implement an early intervention program to identify potential academic and personal challenges. In addition, research experiences, industry internships, faculty mentoring, tutoring, and other student support services will promote persistence and student success in the STEM fields. The students will interact with academic and professional networks at meetings and conferences to strengthen their sense of self-identification with the STEM community. The project assessment and evaluation studies will explore whether participation in the program increases: 1) academic performance, retention, and career or graduate school placement; 2) self-identify and self-efficacy as STEM practitioners; and 3) the ability to communicate STEM knowledge. This project has the potential educate STEM graduates who can contribute to the STEM workforce and to the growing STEM-based economy, as well as increase knowledge about high impact practices that support the success of lower income STEM students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
