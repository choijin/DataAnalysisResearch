<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a solution to the labor shortage problem in landscaping organizations. Current solutions to the employee recruitment and retention problem lack technological innovation. Primarily, landscaping organizations hire more employees to offset resigning employees, pay higher wages, attend careers fairs, post newspaper/online ads, and hire H2B workers. The Department of Labor H2B visa program supplies approximately 10% of the landscaping workforce. According to a variety of sources, including in-person customer interviews, labor shortages in the landscaping industry are a major factor inhibiting landscaping companies' growth. This research team is developing a product to assist American small business with continuing to serve their customers and grow their businesses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project proposes robotic technology to help solve the labor shortage problem. Using robotic embedded technology the research team has implemented advanced algorithms to guide a robot prototype along a user defined trajectory. The mechatronic design of the product combined with the algorithm development gives hopeful insight into robotic prototypes' future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This work explores a significate labor shortage challenge witnessed by the professional commercial landscaping industry. Over 150 customer discovery interviews, workflow studies, and tests have been conducted with landscaping companies across the United States to understand this problem more deeply. Particular attention was paid to technology adoption to solve the labor shortage crisis including robotic lawn mowers.  The conclusion of our work is multi part (additional details can be found at monamarieresearch.com):  1. The H2B immigrant worker program is not a sustainable solution  As COVID-19 has shown, landscaping operations - and society in general - can be greatly impacted by unforeseen circumstances. The H2B program is one of the most effected within commercial landscaping. Additionally, these workers are subjected to immigration regulations and politics that many landscapers would rather not engage in - but oblige due to labor constraints.  The H2B program is an unsustainable/unreasonable labor solution for small-medium sized companies.This is particularly true for commercial professional landscapers in rural communities.     2. Landscaping work has not been adopted in mass by young millennials and generation Z.  This problem is particularly relevant for reprepetive tasks such as mowing, weedeating, trimmer, blowing, etc. Horticulture, irrigation, herbicials, sustainability, design, and construction are oftentimes the exception.     Some of the reasons for the disconnect with the up-and-coming generation are obvious others are not:   2.1 The work is physically demanding oftentimes in severe heat, many gen Z workers prefer technology and/or desk based jobs with trendy-flashy offices.  2.2 Many jobs are temporary, seasonal and dependent on weather conditions  2.3 Some of the work can include repetitive unrewarding tasks   2.4 There are considerable social changes, namely, growth in college educated workers, highly skilled trades and the gig economy (Uber, Lyft, Instacart, etc).  The NALP Industry Growth Initiative of course is working to address these disconnects.     3. Individual landscaping companies are unable to grow their market share.  The landscaping industry is extraordinarily fragmented with the top 50 companies making only 15% of the industry's revenue, yet the industry is growing at apprxomiately 5%.
