<AbstractNarration>Given the increasing interdisciplinary nature of research, exchanges between leading investigators working at the interface of biology and engineering are becoming increasingly important. In order to facilitate these exchanges, this workshop assembles a group of approximately 250-300 predominantly US scientists and engineers, at all career stages, on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca, NY June 22, 2018. Invited speakers from academia and industry and a limited number of international participants, will discuss the current and future prospects of several important and emerging fields that encompass biochemical engineering, nano-biotechnology, protein engineering and design, synthetic biology, systems biology, regenerative medicine, and personalized medicine. Invited speakers, as well as other academic and industrial leaders in attendance, will make themselves available over the course of the meeting for intellectual exchange and networking with all attendees, especially postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduate students. The results of the workshop would be posted on a website for broad dissemination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a workshop that brings together a group of approximately 250-300 predominantly US scientists to discuss the trajectory of research at the interface of biology and engineering. The workshop convenes on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. The workshop goals are as follows: (a) to mutually inform participants on current and future activities related to biochemical engineering at the interface of biology and engineering, (b) to discuss translational potential and challenges and concerns associated with the technologies related to the scientific areas of discussion, (c) to explore the educational needs and best practices for education and training and (d) to assess common ground and opportunities for collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Cornell proved to be an ideal location to convene such an activity as its beautiful setting and distance from a major city will encourage/inspire discussion and debate.  Intellectual Merit: Cornell University hosted a workshop that examined the advances that have occurred at the intersection of biology and engineering over the past 40 years that have formed the basis of biochemical engineering as we know it, and impacted the fields of systems biology, protein engineering and design, and even synthetic biology. The workshop brought together researchers from across the country to discuss advances in the field and highlight future areas at the intersection of biology that will lead to advances in understanding the rules of life, biomanufacturing, regenerative and personalized medicine.  Broader Impacts: The workshop contributed to the enhancement and improvement of scientific, engineering and educational activities by bringing together a leading group of US researchers along with some selected international participants to examine the unique educational/research ecosystem that has enabled a single individual to have an impact on so many fields during their research career. The deliverables produced (e.g., published journal articles, archived video recording of symposium) will provide inspiration for future activities by the participants, and have been shared with NSF. Diverse participants were included as well as faculty and students at all stages of their professional careers.
