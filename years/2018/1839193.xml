<AbstractNarration>A region of charge separation, known as the electrical double layer, is well-known to form at most solid/liquid interfaces.  This electrical double layer forms because the surfaces of most particles bare a slight charge, and ions in an aqueous solution, segregate to the surface to balance this charge.  The ions closest to the surface are then surrounded by secondary layer which gradually diffuses the charge.  Application of an external electric field induces a Coulombic force, which acts on this electric double layer and causes a particle or macromolecule to move, in a process known as electrophoresis. Electrophoresis can be used to separate and purify macromolecules, including identification of target cells or biological compounds for diagnostic purposes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide travel funds for twelve students to attend and participate in the 2018 Annual Meeting of the American Electrochemical Society in Atlanta, Georgia. This meeting unites academic, industry, and government researchers working in all aspects of electrokinetics. Several activities have been incorporated in this meeting to train and mentor students, including training workshops, an interactive poster session, and a Lunch with Leaders program to facilitate student/faculty interaction.  Students receiving travel awards resulting from this grant will contribute to a journal article in Electrophoresis summarizing the meeting.  This opportunity provides a key resource to facilitate student training and professional development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Annual Meeting of the AES Electrophoresis Society was held for the first time in 2018 in conjunction with SciX, the Great Scientific Exchange meeting of The Federation of Analytical Chemistry and Spectroscopy Societies (FACSS).  The meeting took place on October 21-25 in Atlanta Georgia.  Our annual international meeting involves participants from various fields and research communities including academia, industry, and federal research laboratories. The 2018 AES meeting brought new opportunities for AES since for the first time we co-organized our annual meeting with SciX.     This NSF support in the form of 15 student travel grants made a strong positive impact on student attendance and student opportunities at the first AES Meeting at Scix in 2018.  Below is a list of the two main goals we achieved with this student travel grant support from NSF.        GOAL 1: Promote the FIRST annual meeting of the AES Electrophoresis Society at Scix.    Thanks to this NSF support we had a well-attended meeting with a strong student presence. The program consisted of a total 74 presentations, from which 29 were posters, mainly given by students. Some students also gave oral presentations at the meeting.     GOAL 2: Provide student travel support to ensure student participation for our new Annual Meeting at SciX. Furthermore, these also students received additional opportunities at the conference, such as attendance to our "Lunch with Leaders" event and our Electrokinetics Workshop, offered at a very reduced student cost.     Lunch with leaders: a total of 20 students attended this event, where they had the opportunity to intact with five faculty members and entrepreneurs.  The event included lunch and it has a small cast of only $5.00.     Electrokinetics workshops: 20 students had the opportunity to learn about electrokinetics and modeling COMSOL. This was 6-hour workshop (9:00 am to 4:00 pm) focused on applying electrokinetic theory to relevant issues on a number of microfluidic platforms including capillaries, microchips, and nanochips. Starting with basic electroosmosis, participants will build and run simulations of electrophoresis, dielectrophoresis and electrochemistry including separations, bulk reactions, e.g., acid-base buffering or molecular interactions, and surface reactions, e.g., at electrodes or with interactive surfaces.  The cost was only $50.00     AES planning event: students present at this event had the opportunity to contribute with ideas to the planning of the 2019 AES Annual Meeting.
