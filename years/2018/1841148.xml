<AbstractNarration>The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) is the premier international conference in information theory, the scientific discipline that studies the mathematical foundations of reliable communications, whether by telephony, television, wireless or optical systems, and the fundamental limits of data storage, such as CDs, DVDs, flash drives, or other semiconductor media. The symposium series has run since 1954, originally every two years, and yearly since 2000. This project funds the participation of US-based students in this event. Participation at this conference will enhance the research experiences for students and provide increased opportunities for new collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students form an integral part of the Information Theory community, and the IEEE ISIT Conference continues to promote student participation through the ISIT Jack Kiel Wolf Best Student Paper Award, the creation of the ISIT tutorial series, and the Information Theory Society Student Committee. Students comprise about one-third of the participants at ISIT, and the travel funds offered through this award will support the attendance at the 2019 ISIT by students enrolled in a graduate or undergraduate program in the United States and whose papers have been accepted for presentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The funding permitted           these students to present their research to the community of           information theorists, communications engineers, and computer           scientists. Engaging students in ISIT contributed to the vitality of the field of             Information Theory, which, if history is to             serve as an indicator, is in turn the basis for US             competitiveness in the             fields of data transmission, storage, compression and             security. The NSF student             travel grant to ISIT 2019 significantly enhanced student             participation and             contributed to the success of the symposium, which attracted             over 1000 registrants, breaking previous records of             attendance.&nbsp; Of the 43 awardees,           at least 10 were female.The             award selection criteria took into account the paper             quality, as reflected in             the reviews and the technical program chair assessments, and             preference was             given to those students who are least able to afford travel.           All           students were enrolled in graduate or undergraduate programs           in the United           States and had papers that had been accepted for presentation.
