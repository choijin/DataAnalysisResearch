<AbstractNarration>Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems are important in many areas of engineering and applied science, such as modeling of blood flow, flow-induced vibrations of structures, and wave energy devices, among others, and there is significant interest in numerical simulation tools for such problems.  Conjugate heat transfer (CHT) also plays an important role in many FSI simulations, such as the cooling of turbine blades, heat exchangers, nuclear reactors, semiconductor devices, and more.  In this project the PIs aim to build upon their recent achievements to develop stable partitioned algorithms for new classes of FSI problems that also include CHT effects.  The PIs will address the development of high-order accurate schemes for these FSI-CHT problems.  High-order schemes are especially useful for wave-dominated regimes such as high-Reynolds number turbulent flows and propagation of elastic waves.  At the same time, achieving high-order accurate interface coupling approaches for partitioned schemes presents numerous intellectual and numerical challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is concerned with the development and analysis of new high-order accurate algorithms for a wide range of complex and challenging FSI-CHT problems, such as those involving incompressible or compressible flows, with possible free surfaces, coupled to rigid bodies and deforming bulk solids with heat transfer.  These new partitioned algorithms will use novel interface coupling conditions to treat both the FSI and CHT interface conditions.  The FSI interface  conditions will be based on principles we have developed for our Added-Mass Partitioned (AMP)schemes. The CHT domain coupling will extend the recently devised CHAMP interface conditions that combine ideas from optimized Schwarz iterations for domain-decomposition with compatibility interface conditions. The resulting interface couplings will provide schemes that remain provably stable for a wide range of material parameters (e.g. for light solids when added-mass effects are large).  A primary focus will be on algorithms for incompressible flows and incompressible solids. New high-order accurate fractional-step solvers will be developed for both incompressible elastic solids and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.  Complex moving and deforming geometry will be handled with deforming composite grids. Fast, efficient and scalable multigrid algorithms and automatic mesh generation algorithms will be developed as key components of the FSI-CHT solvers.  The new high-order accurate and stable AMP algorithms will complement the ones already developed by the PIs and collaborators for FSI problems, and together they will provide a suite of solvers readily available in open-source software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
