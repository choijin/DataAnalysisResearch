<AbstractNarration>Very few universities have the resources to offer graduate instruction to train aspiring fluid dynamics researchers beyond basic introductory courses. The Burgers Program for Fluid Dynamics at the University of Maryland has been addressing this situation for several years by organizing Summer Research Schools, where about 40-50 graduate students from all over the country spend one week at the University of Maryland for an intense series of lectures and hands-on tutorials by invited experts. The Summer Research Schools are designed primarily for advanced PhD students, i.e., students who have had an introductory course on turbulence and who have the desire to go deeper into the subject. The students benefit from the Schools in two different ways: (i) they are exposed to lectures from a range of experts that would not be possible in other settings; and (ii) they build a large network and community of other young turbulence researchers across the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2018 Summer Research School will focus on recent developments in the understanding of turbulence, its prediction and control using modern experimental and analytical techniques and powerful numerical simulation capabilities. Lectures will cover turbulence theory, experimental and simulation methods, turbulent transport in single and two-phase flows, transition to turbulence, compressible turbulence, the control of turbulence, and some applications. Hands-on tutorials are offered in the afternoons and evenings, where students interact with DNS datasets. Students also have the opportunity to present their own work in a poster session. The format of the school is specifically designed to promote interactions among the students and between students and instructors, with intimate coffee breaks, lunches provided in a private area, and evening socials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
