<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical description: As the limits of electrical circuitry are approached, new paradigms are needed for future generations of faster miniature information processing devices that require less energy. Presently, nearly all existing electronics rely on the movement of electric charges in the form of electrons. Electrons also possess a property known as spin, that gives them their magnetic properties. Periodic undulations of these magnetic properties result in waves known as magnons. Magnonics is a new paradigm which uses magnons for processing and storing information, albeit with reduced energy losses and greater speeds compared to traditional electronics. This project focuses on the study of physical mechanisms that enable magnonics in organic (i.e. carbon-based) magnetic materials. In particular, the control, manipulation, transport and the very sensitive detection of magnons in organic magnetic thin films is investigated. Magnonic devices based on such magnets are engineered, fabricated and tested using electrical, magnetic and optical measurements. In addition, the integration of the large arsenal of experimental efforts serves to efficiently educate graduate and undergraduate students who are involved in this highly interdisciplinary research project at the interface between Physics and Chemistry. Furthermore, through outreach conducted in the course of this project, high school and middle school students learn about the career opportunities and technological potential of Physics, Chemistry and the Natural Sciences in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description: Magnons are S = 1 quasi-particles that obey Bose-Einstein statistics and lack movement of a particle, yet their coupling to electron spins can be utilized for information transport, processing and storage. The technologies resulting from this, namely Magnonics, are anticipated to form a new paradigm for future generations of faster (GHz - THz frequencies) and reduced energy dissipation of miniature information processing devices. The goal of this project is to enhance the understanding of magnons in organic-based molecular materials. The latter are hypothesized to be superior to traditional magnetic materials due to their long magnon mean free paths that enable magnonics to be technologically viable at room temperature and close to the magnetic ordering temperature. The room temperature V(TCNE)x (TCNE = tetracyano-ethylene) magnet serves as a magnonic gain medium for studying whispering gallery magnon modes in micro-resonators, for further implementation as highly coherent quantum systems. The team focuses on film growth and fabrication of microcavities for room-temperature quantum logic, using parity-time symmetry. This project utilizes the University of Utah's large arsenal of experimental capabilities, including chemical synthesis, polymer and small molecule deposition, magneto-transport, electrically-detected ferromagnetic resonance, magnon-related spin-pumping, inverse spin-Hall effect spectroscopy, as well as device fabrication, processing and testing. Furthermore, the broad impact of an entirely new class of electronics enables educating a cohort of graduate and undergraduate students who are involved in the execution of this project, as well as outreach to local high school and middle school communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The research had an emphasis on the control, manipulation, transport, and the detection of magnons in the ferrimagnet V(TCNE)x (TCNE = tetracyanoethylene; x ~ 2) at room temperature. V(TCNE)x has a critical temperature Tc of ~ 127 oC.   We have fabricated thin V(TCNE)x films with superior magnetic properties, as characterized by a very narrow (~2 G) ferrimagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth indicative of long-lived magnons. The existence of PT symmetry in magnonic devices has been demonstrated via FMR and the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) of NiFe/Pt/Co trilayers. NiFe-like and Co-like branches as a function of the Pt interlayer thickness, d, have been observed indicating a change from a ferromagnetic (attractive) to an antiferromagnetic (repulsive) interaction.  When properly normalized, there is evidence for the existence of exceptional points, which is the "smoking gun proof" of magnonic PT symmetry.    The tunability and the efficiency of various spin waves in V(TCNE)x films for spin-pumping was demonstrated, showing that the angular momentum carried by microwave-excited coherent spin waves in a V(TCNE)x  film can be transferred into an adjacent Pt layer via spin pumping and detected via the inverse spin-Hall effect. The spin pumping efficiency could be tuned by choosing different excited spin wave modes in the V(TCNE)x film.  Also, non-coherent spin waves in a V(TCNE)x film, excited thermally can be also used as spin pumping source that generates an electrical signal in Pt with a sign change in accord with the magnetization switching of the V(TCNE)x.   Our results advance the understanding of physical processes that govern magnonics and magnonic-based spintronics, magnonic PT symmetry, magnon transport and they have led to the inclusion of OBMs as suitable magnonics materials. Thus, OBMs have the potential to revolutionize the way magnons are used as information bearers and for the manipulation of quantum bits in quantum computing applications at room temperature.
