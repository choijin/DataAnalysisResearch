<AbstractNarration>The International Conference on Computational Advances in Bio and medical Sciences (ICCABS will provide funds to cover the travel expenses of students and post-doctoral fellows. These students and fellows will have an opportunity meet senior researchers and industry experts and research results. They will also have an opportunity to present their own work. The conference proceedings are used to support course work and selected papers will be used to develop two special issues of BMC Bioinformatics and BMC Genomics journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ICCABS has the goal of bringing together scientists in all the three areas and hence serving as a collaboration platform. The strength of this conference lies in its ability to bring together scientists in various areas of bio and medical sciences and fostering collaborations among them. Collaborations across these domains have a record of leading to the discovery of novel techniques for solving challenging problems at the interface of computing and the biomedical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Background   Computational techniques are revolutionizing the way in which research is conducted in science and engineering. Unsurpassed advances have been made in various areas. This is particularly true in the domains of biology, medicine, and drug discovery. Given that these areas are of utmost importance to the society at large, it is imperative that every effort is made to enable research advances in them. It is not enough if advances are made in these areas in isolation. These communities have to work together to help each other and come up with the best possible diagnosis tools, treatment procedures, drugs for various diseases. Even though a number of conferences exist today in the general area of bioinformatics, they focus on computational biology to a large extent.     A major goal of this project is to conduct a conference to bring together scientists in all the three areas and hence serve as a platform for bridging the research efforts in these areas. The name of the conference is the International Conference on Computational Advances in Bio and medical Sciences (ICCABS). The Eighth ICCABS was held at the Stan Fulton Building, University of Nevada, Las Vegas,  from October 18th to 20th, 2018.     Intellectual Merit  The topics of interest to the conference spanned biology, medicine, and drug discovery. Some of the broader topics covered were: Biomedical image processing, Biomedical data and literature mining, Biological Big Data Analytics, Computational genetic epidemiology, Computational metabolomics, Computational proteomics, Databases and ontologies, Data Integration, Gene regulation, Genome analysis, Health Informatics, High-performance bio-computing, Immunoinformatics, Molecular evolution, Population genomics, Sequence analysis, Structural bioinformatics, Systems biology, Transcriptomics, etc. Attendees of the conference have benefited in enhancing their knowledge in these areas.     Broader Impacts  The conference was a great success as reported by the attendees. Around 60 persons attended the conference. All the talks were well attended and appreciated. The social events were also a big success. Funds from NSF were used to support 19 graduate students who represented 10 different US universities, one university from India and one university from Switzerland. Out of these, 11 students were women/URM.     Authors of accepted papers submitted full papers. These papers were put together to produce the Proceedings for IEEE. These proceedings are available online in the IEEE Xplore digital library. Each participant was supplied with a copy of the Proceedings in a flash memory stick. Out of the full papers accepted for presentation in the conference and the workshop presentations, expanded versions of around 20 papers have been invited for two journal special issues (for BMC Bioinformatics BMC Genomics). These two special issues will be edited by the General Chairs, Program Chairs, and the Workshop Chairs. These papers will go through an additional set of reviews. We expect that these special issues will be finalized soon.          Last Modified: 06/24/2020       Submitted by: Sanguthevar Rajasekaran]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
