<AbstractNarration>The Center of Building Energy Smart Technologies (BEST-East) is a partnership between The City College of New York, New York University and the BEST-West center node at University of Colorado-Boulder. Through synergistic research and development between the industry and the academia, the Center seeks to advance building energy systems to be intelligent and energy efficient. This energy sector is responsible for the highest energy end-use in the US, about 40% of total national energy consumption. We will develop and test energy technologies for environments ranging from single buildings to urban districts. This includes intelligent building envelope materials and systems, advanced HVAC systems, and building integrated sustainable energy technologies. These solutions will optimize energy efficiency, occupant comfort, resiliency in extreme events, and conservation of natural resources.  The Center will represent a unique platform for collaboration between diverse range of industries and universities, with the common goal of developing the next generation energy technologies for the built environment. The Center is committed to training the next generation engineers and scientists, which will be drawn from across the partnership to work in a collaborative environment.  The Center will thus play a crucial role in improving the nation?s building infrastructure and energy security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BEST-East Center will bring together multi-disciplinary research capabilities of US universities and partner industries to develop smart technologies that enhance energy sustainability and resiliency for individual buildings and for urban centers. In order to address the need of the rich and diverse building industry, the Center will engage in five complementary thrust research areas including: (i) Smart buildings materials, (ii) Intelligent building mechanical and electrical energy systems, (iii) Distributed and renewable energy systems, (iv) City-scale building energy informatics, and (v) Distributed data sensors and networks for the building energy industry.  Research and development for the proposed Center will be anchored on fundamentals of heat and mass transport processes at the building and city scales, energy conversion processes, building materials, information and cyber sciences.  The Center will also include technical innovations on integrated renewable energy technologies, and advanced building enclosures, fenestration and lighting, and energy informatics to yield tightly integrated, intelligent, adaptive, and efficient building energy systems.  Moreover, the Center will address pressing energy efficiency issues in new buildings as well as in existing building stocks that are in need of remedial and rehabilitation with consideration for the sustainability impacts and resiliency needs of buildings and cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  In this planning grant we conceptualized an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) for Building Energy Smart Technologies (BEST) Center to be focused on the development of smart, resilient, and integrated systems for the efficient utilization of energy in the built environment in order to design, retrofit, construct, and operate sustainable buildings and cities. Since buildings account for 40% of U.S. energy use and 75% of U.S. electricity use, developing and implementing transformational and innovative technologies for the built environment in conjunction with industry leaders are critical steps to conserve energy and ultimately sustain the U.S. economy and the natural environment. Building energy use is at the very center of the climate-energy nexus debate, and this issue will acquire more importance since over 70% of the world population will live in cities by 2050. In addition, the trend toward automation, digitization and intelligent decision support systems is increasingly affecting all industries including the building sector. The BEST center will fill a critical need by leading the development of new smart and energy efficient technologies for building energy systems.     The Center was envisioned as a partnership between two academic institutions, the University of Colorado Boulder (CU) site and the City College of New York (CCNY) site.  The workshops with the industry representatives confirmed that five topical thrust areas would best encompass the mission of the BEST Center including:  1)      Smart Building Materials  2)      Smart Building Energy Systems  3)      Integrated Energy Generation Systems  4)      Smart Cities  5)      Smart Grid Systems     Project Outcomes  The Planning Grant enabled the following key outcomes:  Validation of the value proposition of the BEST Center to Industry.  Planning and execution of an industry-university workshop where industry provided direct feedback to the academic sector about the needs, trends, and cooperative mode.  The workshop was conducted in April 5, 2019, in New York City, with more than sixty participants, with more than 20 industry and government agencies all directly related to the building energy sector. Preparation of a Phase-I Center proposal with the endorsement of both industry and government agencies in the form of commitment letters.    Intellectual Merits of the Center   The proposed IUCRC will bring together research capabilities of faculty in two US universities and partner industries. It will address technology development needs for the building industry to promote sustainability and energy efficiency, for individual buildings and for urban centers, using intelligent, sustainable and adaptable solutions.  To enable the development of new and sustainable building energy technologies, a holistic understanding of the interaction between built and-natural systems is imperative. In dense urban areas, for example, the energy and mass exchanges between the atmosphere and the buildings modify the landscape energy budgets, leading to higher energy demands that result in stress to the utility grid.  BEST envisions addressing this need by taking advantage of: indoor-outdoor energy flow models and advanced building envelope systems, demand-response informatics, application of advanced, in-situ and remote sensing for monitoring the environment and occupants, and distributed energy efficient and renewable technologies.  The Center will also include technical innovations in renewable energy sources along with advances in building enclosures, fenestration and lighting, and building energy data analytics to yield tightly integrated, intelligent, adaptive, and highly efficient energy systems at both individual building and entire city scales.     Broader Impacts of the Center  The proposed BEST center will support the U.S. building industry?s efforts to meet increasingly stringent building energy-efficiency regulations, and society?s expectations for improved sustainability in communities and cities. Indeed, future buildings and cities are expected not only to be highly energy efficient, adaptive, and resilient to meet occupant needs, but also be robust and resilient in case of extreme and catastrophic events. In a highly competitive industry, smart and energy-efficient building technologies are quickly becoming a market differentiator for residential and commercial properties. Indeed, investments in building energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies have been significant in the last decade and have created millions of jobs throughout the US. It is estimated that the US sustainable buildings sector has supported over 2.3 million jobs in 2015, and it will employ over 3.3 million people by 2018. Moreover, the US economic impact of sustainable and intelligent buildings can reach over $200 billion mostly related to avoiding health problems and the associated lost productivity. In addition to development of innovative and intelligent products, the proposed centers will also meet the education and training needs for the building industry by drawing from both undergraduate and graduate students from the four universities partners to fill the requirements of highly qualified labor, meeting future demands of sustainable and integrated buildings and urban centers.
