<AbstractNarration>As a satellite activity to the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), August 1-9, there will be a K-theory conference in Argentina, consisting of two parts: a School at the University Nacional de La Plata (in La Plata, Argentina) during July 16-20, followed by an international Workshop on K-theory at the University of Buenos Aires (Argentina) during July 23-27, 2018. This award supports US-based graduate students and young researchers to participate in the School and the Workshop. The meetings aim to catalyze research and disseminate new techniques that will allow researchers to better understand how mathematics fits together. The results will be published, both in on-line archiving sites and in published form in scientific journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The School will consist of 6 mini-courses, covering combinatorial aspects, relation to conjectures in algebraic topology, homotopy invariance, applications to physics, and classification of approximately finite-dimensional algebras.  The Workshop will allow researchers to share their recent discoveries about how K-theory helps us understand a wide-ranging family of mathematical structures and their invariants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The web page for this conference is&lt;br/&gt;www.mate.unlp.edu.ar/~gtartaglia/ktheoryconference.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this grant was to support the attendance of 10 young US-based participants in July 2018 at a Summer School in La Plata, Argentina followed by a research conference in algebraic K-theory at the University of Buenos Aires in Buenos ires, Argentina.   The participants supported were either graduate students or young post-docs, and are based in: Univ. of South Carolina, UCLA, Univ. of Illinois, Univ. of Colorado, Univ. of Pennsylvania, Norhtwestern Univ, and UC Berkeley. Their support included airfare and lodging, bth in La Plata and in Buenos Aires.  K-theory is notable for its connections with other branches of mathematics and physics. In mathematics, it has applications to equivariant homotopy theory, algebraic geometry, differential equations, geometric analysis, functional analysis, differential equations, representation theory, group theory, and linear algebra.  The meeting presented recent advances in several of the many sub-areas of K-theory in order to promote synergies between the different, but overlapping areas. Examples of this which were presented include: the Farrell-Jones Conjecture (equivariant cohomology); Bloch's Conjecture (algebraic geometry); motivic integration and dilogarithms (Hilbert's 3rd problem); the Bloch-Kato Conjecture (motives and motivic cohomology); Slice conjectures (motivic homotopy theory); Murthy's Conjecture (classification of projective modules); and the Novikov Conjecture (invariance of higher signatures for manifolds).
