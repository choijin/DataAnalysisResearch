<AbstractNarration>The Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecology (PLE), located on Pymatuning Lake in northwest Pennsylvania, is the University of Pittsburgh's field station. PLE has been a site of research and education in biology for 85 years. PLE's facilities and resources have been used by educators and researchers from over three dozen universities and colleges in the last five years, resulting in numerous scientific publications. Due to a large recent turnover in faculty with ecology-related research interests at the University of Pittsburgh, a near-term need for renovation of lab space capable of accommodating new researcher groups, and a need for the expansion of housing facilities to accommodate growth in PLE's education mission, now is an opportune time to plan for the future of PLE. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support the development of a new Master Plan, with input from PLE's research, education, outreach and conference stakeholders. Strategic planning activities to be undertaken include site visits to other regional field stations and attending the annual Organization for Biological Field Stations meeting to explore collaborations and learn from the successes of peer field stations,  hosting facilitated meetings with stakeholders to discuss the state of each PLE mission and opportunities for their improvement, and producing a new 10-year Master Plan to guide efforts to improve PLE programming and facilities over the coming decade. As PLE enters a new phase of growth that will necessitate programmatic changes, facilities renovations and new construction, the goal of this planning process is to focus the station's limited resources where they will produce the most impact on advancing PLE's core missions.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award funded activities leading to the development of a new programmatic master plan for the Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecology, the University of Pittsburgh?s biological field station. Located on the shores of Lake Pymatuning in Northwest Pennsylvania, the facility?s mission is "to foster the establishment of a sustainable culture through environmental education, field research in the natural and environmental sciences, and community involvement." Planning activities centered around the three main facets of this mission: facilitating research contributions of regional and national significance in ecology, evolution and the environment, providing field-centered courses for undergraduates, and providing content and educational resources to the regional K-12 community.     Activities undertaken with this award included (1) attending the 2018 Organization of Biological Field Stations meeting, (2) site visits to peer facilities in our region, and (3) a series of stakeholder meetings in which we sought feedback about the strengths of our programs and how they could be improved going forward.     Targets for change that emerged from our planning process focused on re-positioning PLE as an integral component of regional environmental sustainability initiatives and were coupled with a call for investigations into how to increase the accessibility and appeal of PLE programs to a broader audience. A new programmatic master plan has been drafted and is being revised in consultation with our Planning Committee and key stakeholders for dissemination in fall 2019.
