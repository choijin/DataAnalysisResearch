<AbstractNarration>The stream monitoring network at Robinson Forest (http://robinson-forest.ca.uky.edu/) is one of the most valuable aquatic research resources in the Appalachian region, and it provides critical information for understanding impacts of surface mining and forest management on freshwater resources. However, the monitoring equipment at this station is outdated and obsolete. This project will provide critical equipment upgrades to the stream monitoring network, which will improve both the quality and the accessibility of the streamflow and water quality information collected by this network. This project will also upgrade the existing Robinson Forest weather station and add another weather station, which will improve the quality and accessibility of weather data collected from this important facility. Better data quality will allow researchers to perform more sensitive and powerful analysis regarding manmade (mining, logging) and natural (insects, fire) impacts on freshwater resources. Understanding these and other water quality issues is essential for the protection and improvement of stream health, especially in Appalachia. In addition, better data accessibility will make this valuable information available for use by other researchers, state and federal agencies tasked with water resource conservation and management and the general public. Over time, this project will help reduce stream degradation and lead to the continued development of improved watershed management guidelines, improving stream health in Appalachia and beyond. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will upgrade the existing stream monitoring network at Robinson Forest to enhance both data quality and data accessibility. Currently, the monitoring equipment is old and technologically obsolete, and requires a significant amount of upkeep time for data collection and processing. This project will allow researchers to live-stream streamflow data online, dramatically improving data accessibility for PIs and other investigators. The project will also add conductivity and temperature sensing capability to the network. Currently, these and other water quality parameters are collected on only a weekly basis, which is relatively insensitive from a water quality monitoring perspective. This project will allow collection of conductivity and temperature data at 15-minute intervals, and will also allow live-streaming of these data online. These upgrades will improve the quality and accessibility of these data, improving utilization by both PIs at the University of Kentucky and visiting and collaborating scholars and scientists from other institutions and agencies. In addition to upgrading the stream monitoring network, the project will upgrade the existing Robinson Forest weather station and add an additional weather station. These stations will live-stream weather data online via the Kentucky Mesonet platform, enhancing data availability for both UK investigators and collaborators. These improvements will significantly enhance the ability of existing  investigators and potential new partners to investigate important projects including understanding impacts of surface mining on Appalachian streamflow and water quality (and associated aquatic and riparian wildlife), developing forest management guidelines for minimal stream impacts, and understanding reference quality streamflow and water quality in Appalachia. Finally, these upgrades will make these data accessible in real-time for students in relevant courses at the University of Kentucky and collaborating institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Over the years, these data have been collected and archived using various technologies, and they have been mostly inaccessible for research use?unedited and uncompiled, scattered across a number of spreadsheets and paper records. Through a partnership between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and UK, daily precipitation data for six stations and stream data from four watersheds in Robinson Forest have been compiled for 1971-2018, checked for transcription errors, and annotated for changes in methodologies. These data are planned for a formal USGS data series release on ScienceBase (doi:10.5066/P9FPLG1O), an online data-access platform. Improved accessibility of this valuable data set provides an important research resource for understanding water quality in minimally-impaired forests in the region. Preliminary results suggest that these data present a valuable opportunity to evaluate linkages among atmospheric deposition and stream chemistry, the impacts of environmental policy, such as the Clean Air Act, and effects from nearby land disturbance in the form of surface mining. Furthermore, these data enable analysis of long- and short-term changes in air temperature and precipitation patterns over the last 45 years.</p> <p>Building upon efforts to make the long-term data from Robinson Forest more robust and accessible, upgrades to the existing stream monitoring network were performed in 2019.
