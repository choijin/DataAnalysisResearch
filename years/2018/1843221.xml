<AbstractNarration>The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer&lt;br/&gt;(STTR) Phase I project is to empower providers with the unprecedented ability to treat patients&lt;br/&gt;with chronic inflammatory skin disease effectively and at a lower cost. Today, primary care&lt;br/&gt;physicians often refer patients with these conditions to dermatologists for the initial diagnosis&lt;br/&gt;and multiple follow-up appointments, especially when patients are prescribed high cost, high&lt;br/&gt;touch therapies like biologics or procedures, such as phototherapy. By introducing this&lt;br/&gt;automated severity scoring system, these providers will have the expertise of dermatologists at&lt;br/&gt;their fingertips, giving them the ability to assess disease severity and provide systemic&lt;br/&gt;treatments previously available only through specialists. It will also establish more objective&lt;br/&gt;assessments, evaluating patient progress to adjust dosage and treatments as necessary. For&lt;br/&gt;pharmaceutical companies, the ability to have non-specialists make these severity assessments&lt;br/&gt;during clinical trials reduces expensive and restrictive staffing requirements. Less expensive trials can&lt;br/&gt;help expedite new drugs to market. This innovation will enhance scientific and technological&lt;br/&gt;understanding by applying known machine learning techniques in a novel manner to solve a&lt;br/&gt;difficult visual problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will prototype a clinical tool&lt;br/&gt;that can assess images of a chronic skin inflammation, determine its severity, and suggest&lt;br/&gt;treatment. This system will be able to guide users with minimal training through the image&lt;br/&gt;collection process, determine if the information is sufficient, and request additional information if&lt;br/&gt;required via novel machine learning techniques. Currently, clinicians trying to assess the&lt;br/&gt;severity of chronic inflammatory skin diseases rely on a series of estimations and manual&lt;br/&gt;weighted averages, a time consuming and biased process. This Phase I research will explore&lt;br/&gt;what information is necessary for an algorithm to determine the severity of a psoriasis case. It&lt;br/&gt;will determine if it is possible for a machine to guide an imager through imaging regions of&lt;br/&gt;interest at higher detail, rather than the entire body at large. It will also explore how quickly and&lt;br/&gt;practically such a calculation can be performed. The end goal of the project is a working&lt;br/&gt;prototype that can consistently score a few psoriasis cases and serve as a proof of concept for&lt;br/&gt;expansion of the prototype in future work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
