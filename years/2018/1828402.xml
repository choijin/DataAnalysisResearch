<AbstractNarration>Hyperspectral imaging is a rapidly growing field of knowledge and application area in remote sensing, becoming one of the most critical skills needed by future employees in the remote sensing industry. This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant supports the acquisition of a portable Hyperspectral Imaging instruments for both laboratory- and field-based research at the University of Northern Iowa, a primarily undergraduate institution, that has a deep commitment to high-quality and high-impact scholarship to all students. The FieldSpec (R) Spectroradiometer instrument is widely used in many STEM fields including Geographic Information Science, Remote Sensing, Environmental Science, and Biology for various applications. This instrument will have an immediate impact on active research, teaching, and training activities by faculty, students, staff researchers, and trainees on and outside campus. It will enhance the curriculum in core science and technology areas, support undergraduate and graduate students to gain hands-on experience and education that connects to applied and experiential learning, and strengthen the ability of faculty to facilitate improved quality of their research and teaching. This device will promote the creation of a highly interdisciplinary research environment, enable intra- and inter-departmental research collaboration, and will increase the possibility of securing external funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major benefits of FieldSpec (R) are its portability, provision of the fastest and most accurate measurement in nearly any environment, and the capability of spectrally characterizing the chemical and structural properties of a target by collecting hundreds of contiguous spectral channels from laboratories to remote field sites. The instrument will enable: 1) the best possible approach to calibrate and validate laboratory, aerial, and satellite remote sensing images; 2) rapid, accurate, and cost-effective spectral measurements whenever and wherever it is required; and 3) development of hyperspectral signature libraries for different materials from laboratory and field settings with new approaches. Specifically, this device will provide new knowledge discovery in the science of Hyperspectral Imaging in many core interdisciplinary research areas including image processing, geomorphology/mineralogy analysis, urban and road surface materials mapping, the Arctic environments and cryosphere monitoring, plant physiology estimation, and water quality assessment, which will benefit the training of students and allow for interdisciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

This MRI grant has acquired a new Hyperspectral Field Spectroradiometer (HFS), a key component of HI,<strong> </strong>from<strong> </strong><em>Malvern Panalytical Inc.</em> (previously <em>Headwall Photonics, Inc</em>.) for the University of Northern Iowa (UNI), a primarily undergraduate institution that has a deep commitment to high-quality and high-impact scholarship to all students. The new HFS has supported three undergraduate student research projects with faculty mentors from STEM fields such as Geography, Biology, and Earth Sciences. With this state-of-the art equipment, new and unique HFS datasets were collected, new HI analytical approaches were developed by using the HFS data to generate specialized vegetation and water quality indexes, new HI studies were conducted with the integration of field HFS and image data, as well as new HFS applications were carried out in urban surface materials mapping, plant physiology estimation, and water quality assessment where the use of HFS used to be impeded by the limited access to the HFS devices and datasets. All research projects were performed at field-based to substantively explored the potentials of the field instrument in characterizing the chemical and structural properties of a given target spectrally, which otherwise would be difficult with other spectroscopy systems. The new HFS has successfully promoted a highly interdisciplinary research environment by providing hands-on experience and training to three faculty (one was women), three graduate students (two were women), and eleven undergraduate students (six were underrepresented or women) from nine disciplines on and outside of the UNI campus (e.g., Computer Science, Biology, Earth Sciences, Environmental Science, Geography, and Physics).
