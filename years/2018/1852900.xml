<AbstractNarration>With support from the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, this Capacity Building project aims to address the critical shortage of qualified STEM teachers in the state of Montana. To achieve this aim, the University of Providence will develop or strengthen partnerships with nearby colleges and high schools that serve rural and Native American communities.  This partnership will develop strategies to increase access to and interest in the University's STEM teacher preparation program, a necessary step in increasing the number of STEM majors who pursue teaching careers. To address the needs of rural Montana, the project also intends to modify the University's STEM curricula to enhance distance learning opportunities for rural students and to include Native American cultural competencies.  The approaches used in this project may serve as a model for how to address teacher shortages in rural areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central goal of this project is to develop evidence-based, innovative strategies for recruiting, preparing, and supporting new STEM teachers, especially from rural and Native American populations.  It also aims to establish the necessary infrastructure for implementing a future Noyce Track 1 Scholarships and Stipends project.  To accomplish these goals, the University of Providence will partner with high-need, local education agencies (Great Falls High School, Heart Butte Public Schools, Browning Public Schools, and Box Elder Public Schools) as well as with nearby institutions of higher education (Stone Child Community College, Blackfeet Community College, Flathead Valley Community College, Aaniih Nakoda College, Fort Peck Community College, and Great Falls College-Montana State University).  The partnership will develop strategies to recruit STEM majors from the partner institutions into the University of Providence's STEM teacher education program, and to increase the breadth of education and cultural opportunities available to these students.  The project will also modify the University of Providence's STEM curricula to include Native American cultural competencies. In the short term, this Capacity Building project will strengthen relationships between regional colleges and high-need school districts, develop innovative distance learning programs in STEM and STEM education, and increase access to STEM education for rural and Native American populations. Over a longer term, this project has the potential to: (1) provide paths to sustainable employment for teachers in economically disadvantaged populations; (2) improve the education system by increasing the cultural competence of STEM high school teachers; and (3) increase the number of Native Americans who pursue STEM careers, thereby increasing STEM workforce diversity.  The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate professionals to become effective K-12 mathematics and science teachers in high-need school districts and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers.  It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 teachers in high-need school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ STEM Teacher Pathways for Rural and Native American Populations: Building Capacity to Address a STEM Teacher Shortage in Montana       The goal of this project is to develop evidence-based innovative models and strategies for recruiting, preparing and supporting new STEM teachers, specifically from rural and Native American populations, and to establish infrastructure for implementing a future Noyce Track 1 Scholarship and Stipend project.  The two objectives were as follows:  (1) to build recruitment relationships with and student experience opportunities at IHEs and high-need LEAs, predominantly serving rural and Native American communities, and recruit internally among STEM students at UP; and  (2) to modify STEM curricula to add distance learning opportunities and alignment with Native American tribal culture and cultural competency.  Objective #1 was addressed and significant progress was made as a result of our trips to Rocky Boy and Browning. Planners for both schools were exchanged and faculty at both schools discussed working on 2+ 2 transfer agreements. Further progress was made towards objective #1 by distributing our STEM brochures to schools across North Central Montana.  Meetings with students also occurred at both Stone Child Tribal College and Blackfeet Tribal College.  Objective #2 was addressed with STEM Faculty training in distance education delivery methods for the University of Providence Faculty. Tribal College faculty were also going to be invited, but COVID 19 restrictions ended that opportunity.  Further individual sessions on distance education with University of Providence STEM faculty were also conducted.  In addition, changes were made to incorporate restorative practices into the education classes at the University of Providence and the programs objectives were aligned with restorative practices.       To assist in better understanding the education needs of rural and Native American communities, following a review of the literature on the topic, two surveys were created.  The first was sent to school administrators in rural and Native American communities and the second was sent to students in those areas.  Based on the administrator?s responses our review of the literature was supported.  All the data is reported in the attached Power Point.  One particularly telling piece of evidence was Question #3 ?Willingness to consider filling a Middle School Math or Science position with a K-8 Elementary endorsement and a Math or Science concentration.?  The fact that these administrators are 100% willing to fill Middle School Science and Math positions with teachers who have a K-8 Elementary endorsement, so long as they have a Math or Science concentration is telling.  However, it must also be noted that there is a major need for Elementary Teachers in rural and Native American communities, so the administrators might see that as an opportunity to meet two needs.  The student responses clearly indicated that there is a preference to teach in their own community (Student Responses). That information, when combined with the fact that there is some difficulty in retaining STEM teachers based on the information in the Administrative Responses, provides evidence that developing home grown STEM teachers is ideal. The challenge is delivering quality education in STEM subjects to those individuals.  This project has brought greater awareness in North Central Montana of the STEM opportunities at the University of Providence.
