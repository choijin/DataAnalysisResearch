<AbstractNarration>The research supported by this award will investigate cultural ecosystem services. Ecosystem services, the benefits provided by an ecosystem, are one basis for assigning value to healthy ecosystems. Services include the capacity of an ecosystem to provide food and water, to help mitigate environmental impacts, to produce essential nutrients, and to provide cultural opportunities and experiences. Cultural ecosystem services, such as fishing and birdwatching, are hard to price, however, and consequently have received less attention even though they may outweigh other services in terms of perceived importance. To enhance understanding of cultural ecosystem services, the researcher will investigate fishing-related cultural services and the impacts that may result from the introduction of aquaculture to supplement or replace declining fisheries.  The research is important because fisheries throughout the United States are threatened. Communities risk losing the industry that shaped their towns, local identities, and associated jobs unless alternatives are introduced that can match all of the services associated with their declining fishery, including the highly valued cultural services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be undertaken by University of Maryland anthropology doctoral student Adriane Michaelis, who is supervised by Dr. Laura J. Shaffer. The researcher has chosen to focus on oyster aquaculture, which, although known to provide many of the services associated with wild oyster fisheries, has not been studied from the perspective of its associated cultural services. The research has a comparative design. Data collection will take place in three culturally distinctive regions -- the Chesapeake Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, and coastal New England --where aquaculture of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) now occurs. The research is framed with three overarching questions: 1) What are the cultural services obtained through oyster aquaculture and how do they rank amongst related ecosystem services? 2) How do these cultural services vary regionally and according to different participant attributes? 3) Can oyster aquaculture provide the same types of cultural services as public fisheries? The researcher will gather data through a mix of ethnographic methods including through semi-structured interviews with oyster farmers, commercial fishermen, and community members; participant observation; photovoice; and a Q-sort survey using a standard platform. By looking at the effects of shifting from public to private fisheries, findings from the research will contribute to improved social scientific understanding of socio-ecological systems as dynamic systems. Findings will also help resource managers expand their understanding of the costs and benefits of different management choices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Adriane Michaelis completed her dissertation, entitled "Shellfisheries and cultural ecosystem services: Understanding the benefits enabled through work with shellfish" with the support of the NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant under the project title, "Dynamic Socio-economic Systems and Cultural Ecosystem Services: The case of oyster aquaculture." The aim of her dissertation was to detail the benefits, identified as 'ecosystem services', provided by bivalve shellfish like oysters and clams. Specifically, Michaelis identified previously undocumented cultural ecosystem services, which are the nonmaterial benefits provided by nature, or in this case shellfish (e.g., contributions to individual or community identities, experiences or relationships with nature, sense of freedom or independence, etc.).</p> <p>Michaelis worked alongside and interviewed shellfish growers (also called shellfish farmers, aquaculturists, or mariculturists), wild harvesters, and others who work with shellfish in 7 states: Alabama, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Rhode Island, and Virginia. Interviews with 218 individuals led to a list of 46 unique ecosystem services or benefits, and the majority of these benefits were cultural ecosystem services. Results illustrate the multitude of benefits that both individuals and communities enable and receive because of active, thriving shellfisheries.</p> <p>One aim of the work was to understand if and how benefits associated with shellfish farming or aquaculture differed from wild fisheries. This aim is important because, in many parts of the US, shellfish aquaculture has been introduced as a substitute or complement to the wild harvest. Interviews revealed that, for the most part, shellfish aquaculture provides similar benefits to a wild fishery, and in some cases, more benefits. Still, participant perspective was important and 22 of the 46 benefits were identified as both enhanced and diminished with a transition from wild to farmed shellfisheries, depending on one's viewpoint. For example, wild fisheries are often associated with a certain perceived degree of independence. Some participants felt that independence was enhanced with work in aquaculture because they had greater control over multiple aspects of their shellfish operation, e.g., harvest timing, quality, and selling price. Still, other participants felt that the additional maintenance and daily labor associated with farming shellfish (when compared to wild harvest) restricted their own sense of independence.</p> <p>Michaelis conducted a final online survey to better understand how perspective influenced the perception of these shellfish-related benefits. Seventy-four individuals who work with shellfish completed a survey that asked them to sort and rank the 46 benefits identified in the previous interviews, allowing for an analysis of which types of benefits were most important to individuals. Ranking patterns aligned with three different viewpoints, and analyses showed that these views were largely driven by how each individual worked with shellfish. Participants were grouped as 1) individuals who work with shellfish (as researchers or gear manufacturers, for example) but do not directly harvest shellfish, 2) shellfish growers who have never worked in a wild fishery, and 3) shellfish growers who have worked in wild fisheries. &nbsp;This research component further illustrated that perspective is important, and though participants agreed that many benefits are gained through their work, the perceived value of these benefits was variable by industry role.</p> <p>Overall, this research project provided a detailed list of the benefits enabled by work with bivalve shellfish. By working with study species and systems that are fairly well studied in terms of ecosystem services, with exception for cultural services, this project presents an ideal case study with which to understand how these benefits may change as the system changes. Most notably, Michaelis described how perceived change is variable and tied to individual perspectives.</p> <p>In addition to being the first project to describe bivalve-related cultural services and benefits to this detail, the results from this work are important for resource management and policy. The social and cultural value, beyond economics, has not been adequately accounted for in shellfish management discussions. Through this research, Michaelis and the nearly 300 shellfish growers, harvesters, and industry supporters who contributed to the project illuminate the important role that shellfisheries play in communities, providing much more than income and ecological benefits. Data provided through this work enable a much more comprehensive understanding of what shellfisheries, both wild and farmed, can mean for a community or region. The project illustrates what can be gained with the introduction of shellfish aquaculture into an area, as well as highlights what may be at risk with the loss of a wild fishery. Resource managers and industry promoters can use the data generated through this research to attract new shellfish farmers and wild harvesters, as well as contribute to greater public awareness of both wild and farmed shellfish. In turn, a more knowledgeable and informed public can generate greater shellfish sales and support of coastal fishing communities.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/17/2020<br>      Modified by: Adriane&nbsp;K&nbsp;Michaelis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1822266/1822266_10556435_1597693305701_OysterSeed--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1822266/1822266_10556435_1597693305701_OysterSeed--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Oyster Seed"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1822266/1822266_10556435_1597693305701_OysterSeed--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Oyster Seed"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">An oyster farmer holds oyster seed, young oysters that will be grown out on the farm.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Adriane Michaelis</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Adriane&nbsp;K&nbsp;Michaelis</div> <div class="imageTitle">Oyster Seed</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1822266/1822266_10556435_1597693507029_FL_FloatingBag--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1822266/1822266_10556435_1597693507029_FL_FloatingBag--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Floating Oyster Farm in Florida"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1822266/1822266_10556435_1597693507029_FL_FloatingBag--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Floating Oyster Farm in Florida"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A Florida oyster farmer tends his gear.
