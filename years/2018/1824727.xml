<AbstractNarration>This workshop is funded through the "Dear Colleague Letter: Principles for the Design of Digital Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Learning Environments (NSF 18-017)." Driven by rapid technological change, the United States is facing a critical workforce shortage in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professions. Furthermore, employers across all fields are increasingly seeking employees who possess computational thinking and data science and analytics skill sets. Eighty percent of the nation's colleges and universities are classified as small institutions and enroll 5,000 or fewer students. Many of these small colleges and universities are grounded in the liberal arts and have a tradition of infusing personalized learning and common thought across disciplines within their general education curricula. This makes them particularly well-suited for preparing students in human literacy, technological literacy, and data literacy. Because computational thinking and data science and analytics work is most often conducted digitally, it is imperative that students learn these skills in digital environments to prepare them for what they will encounter in the workplace. The next generation of digital learning environments encompassing five areas (interoperability; personalization; analytics, advising, and learning assessment; collaboration; and accessibility and universal learning design) will be used by students to learn data science and analytics skill sets. Small colleges and universities often lack the financial resources to build the necessary human and technological infrastructure to support digital learning. This workshop will design digital learning environments that will meet the substantial need for data science and analytics-educated professionals, promote equity in learning, and assist small liberal arts colleges and universities to contribute to the early development of these efforts. Experts will advise teams to design digital science and analytics curricula that will be incorporated in blueprint designs for next generation of digital learning environments meeting the needs of learners and the workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to convene a workshop that results in blueprint designs of next generation of digital learning environments to answer the question - How can science, technology, and mathematics digital learning environments be designed to enhance the digital science and data analytic skill competencies of learners at small liberal arts institutions of higher education? The research questions include: 1) How will the innovative digital learning environments prepare students for employment that requires data science and analytics? 2) How will the design of data science and analytics digital learning environments account for the variability of learners? 3) How will data be collected and learning environments assessed to measure students' data science and analytics competency? 4) How will a national consortium form and function to sustain and expand the workshop outcomes? Based on the tradition in small liberal arts colleges and universities of offering personalized learning, universal design learning for technology will be emphasized and serve as a model for supporting more underrepresented students in STEM to persist to graduation. The complexity of data sciences and analytics skill sets require an assessment of the workshop participants' progress toward meeting the planned outcomes, and education on individual motivations, both which are done through team science. Team science is also innovatively incorporated into the data science and analytics undergraduate curriculum design to educate students how their skills can contribute to a greater product that is the result of the collective contribution of the multidisciplinary team. The project draws upon the expertise of national experts who provide content knowledge not otherwise available to small liberal arts colleges and universities. The forming of a national consortium for digital learning at small liberal arts colleges and universities will sustain and expand the workshop outcomes. It will provide authentic hands-on digital learning research experience through curriculum innovations that introduce students to computational thinking, data science, and analytic skills. The result will be prepared students who fit the workforce need in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  On March 29 and 30, Carroll University hosted a workshop with the goal being to form a consortium of small liberal arts colleges that would work together to expand the usage of and development of next generation digital learning environments (NGDLE’s) for teaching data science and data analytics (DSA).  The workshop was attended by 55 people from 11 different institutions.  Randomly assigned to teams based on interests, eight teams of participants worked on team building and content goals.  Content consisted of NGDLE’s, DSA, learning science, and team science.  The consortium is working on six workstream goals, designed around four fundamental research questions:  (1) How will NGDLE’s prepare students for employment that requires DSA?  (2) How will the design of DSA NGDLE’s account for the variability of learners?  (3) How will NGDLE’s be assessed to measure student DSA competency?  (4) How will a national consortium for digital learning at small liberal arts institutions form and function to sustain and expand the workshop outcomes?    Research Question 1: Participants identified the need for skills in data mining, cleaning, analyses, and presentation/communication to nontechnical decision makers.  Interdisciplinary approaches are needed to meet the range of business needs, technical expertise, and solutions.  This includes interdisciplinary work within the curriculum, including the development of communication skills.  The shared focus on DSA content and open source NGDLE output was seen as a strength in this project.    Research Questions 2: Universal design in developing NGDLE’s and for teaching DSA was a recurring theme.  In the teaching of DSA, we need to also develop life skills, including adaptive skills for changing workspaces and job markets.  We need to inspire students in DSA early as possible, and NGDLE’s could help accelerate DSA learning.  While learning science and NDGLE’s might lead to a paradigm shift in how we teach, we need to delineate between intelligence and wisdom.  For this effort to be successful, the consortium will have to function as a learning network, providing future opportunities for faculty development.    Research Question 3: In order to develop effective assessment, effective curricular design will require faculty development, something the consortium should provide.  By constructing design teams by faculty, levels, and topics, intentionality in curriculum design can lead to effective measurement.  Define role of DSA in liberal arts and lifelong learning, as well as develop interdisciplinary processes that can support and engage learners more authentically.  Design annual workshops/conferences for teaching DSA skills, developing expertise from a pedagogical perspective, developing methods for engaging leaners, improving/easing adoption/usage of NGDLE’s for teaching DSA, and managing the wide variety of tools for the classroom.  For team work in class and assessment of teamwork, develop stakeholder management, develop understanding of roles/responsibilities and identifying individual value, and develop course assignments per team science.  Assessment tools need to be open source and consortium needs to supply technology support.  We can use assessment and DSA to improve learning and address achievement gaps.  These tools need to be seen as additions, not replacements.    Research Question 4: For the consortium to function, for enduring connections between partnering schools and industry to strengthen and grow, we must:    Share resources     Work as a learning network, embracing an openness to learn     Respect cultural differences, listen to multiple perspectives, and be aware of competition dynamics    Identify shared curriculum development and teaching commonalities    Open source output for all    Share good and bad, be open to change, have open collaborative participation that is judgment free    Have active annual workshops/conferences for continuing momentum    Pool resources, but find outside funding    Take advantage of synergies in academic, government and industry partnerships    Provide technology support, and provide/develop tools that respect different institutional cultures    Work as an incubator       June through August 2019, Carroll University led implementation of a Business Model Canvas for the consortium.
