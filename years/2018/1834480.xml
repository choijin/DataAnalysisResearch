<AbstractNarration>This award will support student travel to the seventh Midwest Programming Languages Summit, to be held at University of Wisconsin-Madison in September 2018.  This research workshop will serve as a valuable forum for researchers and students to share in-progress research ideas and receive timely feedback to influence subsequent work. This will be particularly valuable because of the high concentration of programming languages researchers in the Midwest, and because it will provide graduate student researchers opportunities to network and further develop their research and presentation skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds from this award will help support U.S. based students, focusing on graduate students at an advanced stage in their program and students who would otherwise not be able to attend this workshop. The impacts include training the next generation of researchers in this important research area. Higher priority will be assigned to students giving presentations and a strong emphasis will be put on supporting students from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The criteria used to determine who to offer a scholarship to was revised based on this informal analysis, which seems to have been effective. However, more work needs to be done in reaching out to students and inviting them to apply. Key outcomes or Other achievements: The project was successful in its main goals: bringing undergraduate and graduate students to the midwest PL summit (which counted 90 attendants); providing them with mentorship and opportunities for networking; and targeting women, under-represented minorities, and students with disabilities.
