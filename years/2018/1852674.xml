<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in three meetings of the Troy MathFest conference series, taking place in Troy, AL in April of 2019, 2020, and 2021.  This is an undergraduate mathematics research conference that includes sessions for undergraduate presentations (although graduate students and faculty are welcome to present, too), a poster session, graduate school information session, a calculus competition, and two invited faculty speakers. The goals of the conference series are (1) to help participating students develop better scientific literacy and appreciation by learning new mathematical ideas; (2) to provide the participants experience in preparing and delivering a presentation; and (3) to help better prepare the next generation of mathematicians for graduate school and beyond. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Troy MathFest is an undergraduate research conference that includes presentations by students working in a wide range of areas of mathematics. The conference provides an environment where students from various academic institutions gather to build collaborations and learn new mathematics from one another.  The conference also provides the opportunity for students to attend keynote lectures from prominent mathematicians who have records of working with undergraduates on research.  The meeting further provides the opportunity for students to learn about regional mathematics graduate programs and to connect with their representatives.  The conference concludes with a competitive and compelling calculus competition, in which students can showcase their skills and possibly win prizes. More information can be found at the conference series web site:  https://www.troy.edu/mathfest/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
