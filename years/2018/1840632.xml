<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the ability to have a standardized quality of craniofacial surgery by providing accuracy and flexibility, improved patient outcome &amp; satisfaction, reduced number of surgeries and intraoperative time resulting in reduced cost of care and patient morbidity. Regeneration of the natural bone is an additive advantage over currently used fixative implants. These implants are also a source of secondary infections and fracture, such risks are mitigated with the formation of natural tissues, eliminating the need for surgical recall. The U.S. reports ~7.5 million Emergency Department visits related to craniomaxillofacial (CMF) injuries, at a cost of $55.2 billion annually. The technology proposes a fundamental shift in CMF bone reconstruction, allowing regeneration of craniofacial bone using guided 3D printed osteoconductive scaffolds. This translates to reflecting a soft tissue flap over a defect to allow a laser or image guided analyzer to study the defect volume and contours, after which a robotic extruder deposits the scaffold into the desired area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project addresses reconstruction of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) bone defects caused by trauma, developmental anomalies or benign/malignant tumors. Our technology is transforming CMF reconstruction by 3D printing osteoconductive/inductive scaffolds directly into defects.  Preliminary studies on critical-sized calvarial defects in a rat model demonstrated the regeneration of bone while preserving dural tissue. A methacrylated Gelatin-Laponite nanosilicate bio-ink was utilized to print a mesh-like scaffold for a critical-sized defect in rat calvaria. The in-situ printing in the defects helped maintain the micro-pattern stability of the scaffold and the nano-silicate particle-enhanced bone regeneration. These results indicated the possibility of overcoming the current shortcomings in osseous tissue regeneration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit  The craniofacial reconstructive surgery ecosystem has three main customer segments/market drivers: craniofacial surgeons, hospital systems, and health insurance providers as summarized below. We conducted a total of 114 interviews with CMF surgeons, health insurance administrators, and hospital managers to arrive at the understanding of identifying the target customers for the particular market segment for which our technology fits. 1) Surgeons: CMF surgeons (OMFS, Plastic, Head and Neck) and neurosurgeons, choose the types of therapies and devices they will use during surgery. All surgeons research treatment and options and choose products that are shown to improve patient outcomes.  Interviews with CMF surgeons have revealed that their primary considerations when selecting new methods to regenerate critical defects are: 1. The ability of the technology to save operating room time 2. Reduce the need for surgical recall and revisions 3. Effectiveness to regenerate bone and associated tissues. The surgeons agreed that our proposed 3D-printed scaffolds would meet all of these requirements, and expressed significant interest in using the product. 2) Health Insurance Providers: The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as well as private insurance companies such as Blue Cross Blue Shield, have determined which medical and surgical treatments will be reimbursed. Currently, CMS reimburses bundle payments for craniofacial injuries at an average reimbursement rate of $9,000 - $15,000.  Our system would not exceed $2,500 &ndash; $4,500 per case on material and equipment operating costs, including accounting for the depreciation in value and maintenance for the robotic extruder system. 3) Hospitals: Custom PEEK or titanium implants cost the hospital approximately $8,000 -$15,000 per case, which significantly exceeds the limit of the reimbursement rate for bundle payments received by the hospital for the entire care episode of the admitted patient. Coupled with the need for surgical revisits, the cost per procedure keeps climbing. Based on our interviews with various Hospital Business Administrators, their greatest concern is with the high cost of custom implants currently used. Their biggest concern is reaching the 'Medicare the Break-even Point’," Through our interviews, we have discovered that hospitals are the primary customer for our technology. Our technology is less expensive than other options and therefore would be more attractive to hospitals from a financial perspective. This technology would save an estimated 50-75% of the costs, based on current reimbursement models. Broader Impacts Our targeted market segment is the $55.2B ($USD) spent on facility fees, physician fees and implants on 7.5 million emergency department visits each year for craniomaxillofacial (CMF) injuries. Within this overall market segment, our 2017 global addressable market is the $1.67B ($USD) estimated to be spent on custom MF plate and screw fixation implants. This addressable market is estimated to grow annually 5.6% to $2.59B through 2025. The markets in North American, Europe and Asia represent approximately 90% of the total global addressable market. We believe our ability to lower the cost of CMF injury procedures will support value pricing of our 3D printing and bio-ink capabilities within the larger target market of $55.2B and related device insurance reimbursement rates. The valorization of the concept involves elements of clinical testing, product development and market development. After validation of further clinical testing, commercialization effort will be pursued through a legal entity which will provide the opportunity for additional raising of development capital and legal agreements with other partnering organizations.
