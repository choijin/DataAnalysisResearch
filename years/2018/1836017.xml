<AbstractNarration>Most of the major cereal crops in the world were domesticated nearly ten thousand years ago and very few have been developed since then. To cope with a burgeoning population and increasingly frequent and extreme climate events, new, resilient, high-yielding grains are needed. While it is possible to identify new, adaptive traits and breed them into pre-existing crops, this often takes over a decade and is highly dependent on the availability of improvement techniques. As an alternative to preparing our current staple crops for future environmental resilience, it may be more beneficial to domesticate, improve, and develop breeding techniques for underutilized grains that are already resistant to drastic environmental change, such as teff (Eragrostis tef) and other members of the Eragrostis family. Teff is the only known crop plant that is able to withstand high temperatures, arid conditions, and both drought and flooding. Despite the fact that millions of Eastern Africans consume teff every day, the plant has not undergone extensive breeding; even modest genetic improvements will increase yield dramatically. To improve and/or domesticate members of the Eragrostis family rapidly, new techniques will be employed to introduce changes into teff versions of genes that have been shown to be important in the domestication of other cereals.  This approach would thus mimic the beneficial agronomic traits that arose naturally and were selected for in other cereal crops by ancient farmers thousands of years ago.  The information gained from this study will then be applied to domesticate weeping lovegrass (Eragrostis curvula), an edible, perennial teff relative that has the remarkable ability to produce seeds in the absence of fertilization. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Teff is the only known, C4 crop able to withstand high temperatures and both drought and flooding. However, teff has several negative agronomic traits, including highly indeterminate spikelets, small seeds, extensive tillering, and thin stems susceptible to lodging, traits that need to be modified before teff can be adopted globally as a serious alternative crop.  These issues will be addressed using CAS9 nickase/deaminase fusions to introduce SNPs into the negative regulatory elements of several known domestication/yield genes. This project will jump-start the domestication process by creating dominant, advantageous phenotypes mimicking the agronomic traits selected for by ancient farmers. As a test of this approach to speeding the domestication process, successful guide RNAs identified in teff will then be used to attempt to domesticate Eragrostis curvula (weeping lovegrass), a resilient perennial plant that undergoes apomixis and has been used as a famine food in Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

An intriguing approach to preparing for future environmental instability is to rapidly domesticate, improve, and develop breeding techniques for underutilized crops such as teff (Eragrostis tef), and other members of the Eragrostis family that are resistant to extreme environmental change.  Despite its potential as a resilient food source, teff has several negative agronomic traits, including highly indeterminate spikelets, small seeds, extensive tiller branches, and thin stems susceptible to falling over, all of which must be modified before it can be adopted as a serious alternative crop.  These problems were addressed using modified CAS9 fusion proteins to introduce base pair changes into the negative regulatory elements of several known domestication/yield genes that control these traits. By editing these genes, we attempted to ?jump-start? the domestication process by creating dominant advantageous phenotypes, thereby mimicking the agronomic traits selected for by ancient farmers.  Since these domestication genes have conserved function in many grasses, this approach could provide a blueprint for rapidly domesticating any underutilized grass of choice.      In the first year of the project we constructed new vectors designed to efficiently perform gene editing in grass crops (Figure 1), as well as new guide RNAs  targeting negative regulatory elements in agronomically important genes.  These vectors were found to successfully transform teff callus tissue (Figure 2) based on the expression of fluorescent markers present in the vector.  Starting in the second year, two vectors containing multiple guide RNAs targeting the negative regulatory elements of the wealthy farmer?s panicle (WFP), indeterminate spikelet1 (ids1), and reduced height genes were  transformed into teff.  Concurrent with this effort, new teff transformation protocols were optimized, though in the end, success was found using only previously published standard protocols relying on seed derived callus.  Five transformants were isolated initially, two of which were real based on fluorescent markers and PCR genotyping (Figure 3).  After three months in the greenhouse, one of the two displayed a clear domestication phenotype in that it flowered very early, is shorter, and has far fewer tillers than normal, phenotypes predicted by gain of function of WFP and ids1.  While still very preliminary, these results indicate that this approach may be useful in correcting some of the negative agronomic traits of wild grass crops.  We are continuing to isolate more transformants and will monitor their progeny for additional dominant phenotypes.          Last Modified: 12/14/2020       Submitted by: Sarah Hake]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
