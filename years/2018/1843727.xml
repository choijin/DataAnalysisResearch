<AbstractNarration>This EAGER Award is to explore the scientific benefits that come from a network of Quantum Diamond Microscope users.   It will lay the foundations of a community of users for a new transformative instrument for understanding of rock magnetism. The quantum diamond microscope (QDM) offers sub-micrometer spatial resolution in the imaging of magnetic fields, enabling the precise identification and analysis of ferromagnetic carriers in natural rock samples. The project will consist of the construction of two QDM setups to be distributed to user facilities, making the QDM available for a wide range of users. This team will also host two training workshops for the QDM recipient laboratories and a 3-day community workshop where researchers with interest in magnetic field imaging and its applications will gather to exchange ideas and define future directions in the study of rock magnetism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will greatly increase the availability of a transformative instrument that can be applied to understanding of, among many other subjects, the history of the Earth's dynamo, the motion of tectonic plates through time, and the history of precipitation in the Western US since the last glacial maximum. The scientific research enabled by the QDM will improve understanding of paleoclimate and pollution, both of which may be studied using high resolution magnetic field imaging methods. The work will involve the training of a post-doctoral associate as well as students at the graduate and undergraduate level in the use of a new technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funded by this grant (1843727), we have taken vital steps towards translating the quantum diamond microscope (QDM) from a one-off instrument at the Harvard Paleomagnetics Lab to a community instrument widely available to the Earth sciences community.  The QDM is a newly developed technology that uses nitrogen-vacancy color centers in synthetic diamond chips to map magnetic fields at micrometer resolution.  Its combination of capabilities? 1 ?m spatial resolution, &ge;2 mm field of view, &le;10 nT DC field sensitivity, and room temperature operation? cannot be duplicated in any other magnetic field sensor currently available.  The QDM has broad demonstrated and potential utility in the Earth sciences for understanding the mineralogical origin of magnetism in rocks and for inferring the properties of ancient magnetic fields on Earth and other planetary bodies.       This grant has sponsored the construction of two additional QDMs at the Harvard Paleomagnetics Lab in the summer of 2019.  These two units have since been distributed to the Institute for Rock Magnetism (IRM) at the University of Minnesota and the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at UC Berkeley.  Both units are currently (November, 2020) being tested and we expect them to be fully operational by early 2021.  Beside enabling Earth science research at these host institutions, these QDMs will meet the requirements of the broader Earth science community over the coming years by receiving visiting scientists and samples.  Resources from the grant has also been used to modify existing QDM setups at the Harvard Paleomagnetics Lab, resulting in improved capabilities that will be translated to future QDMs for the community.      We have also used funding to host a two-day workshop at UC Berkeley in December, 2020, during which we gathered more than 60 participants from 20 international institutions.  This workshop, named ?Magnetic imaging in rock magnetism and paleomagnetism,? was the first international meeting focused on how new magnetic imaging technologies such as the QDM can be used effectively in the Earth sciences.  The group made notably progress in identifying uses and areas of future development for the QDM and other magnetic field sensing technologies.
