<AbstractNarration>This grant supports student travel for select students to participate in the Doctoral Mentoring Consortium (DMC) at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) that will be held in Stockholm, Sweden, July 13-19, 2018. This is the premier international conference for researchers in artificial intelligence research across a fully international research community. This activity will bring together a broad community of researchers in the field of AI, and support junior researchers at this critical early-career stage.  The DMC creates the opportunity to bring in participants who might not have attended an AI conference due to lack of resources. This is especially true for those at smaller institutions and those which have less developed AI programs. Engaging such participants has the potential to draw more talent into AI research, improve research ideas in their formative stage, and engender collaborations across the breadth of disciplines.  This event provides students with invaluable exposure to outside perspectives on their work at a critical time in their research and enables them to explore their career objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project funded a selected group of Ph.D. students from the US to  attend the Doctoral Mentoring Consortium at the International Joint  Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), which was held in  Stockholm, Sweden, July 13-19, 2018.   The Doctoral Mentoring  Consortium provided a forum for the socialization into the field of  young doctoral scholar and made it possible for them to attend a major  research conference in their field.  The Doctoral Mentoring  Consortium consisted of a full day of activities, which included:  invited speakers; a career panel with   panelists at different career  stages; short talks by the students who had an accepted abstract on  their research; a poster session.  Sharing research ideas and  collaborating on research projects across national boundaries is  becoming critical to accelerate the research progress, avoid  duplication, and produce a greater return on investment.  The fact the  Doctoral Consortium included students who are not studying in the US  (none of them funded under this grant) exposed the students to different  cultures and broadened their professional networks outside their own  institution and their own country, preparing the foundations for long  term international cooperation and better cultural awareness.  The  students funded by this project have received unique and highly  valuable training.  A valuable part of training new researchers is to  give them the opportunity to interact with leaders in their research  field outside their own research group.  This helps the students seeing  their work in a broader context, gives them opportunities for receiving  different feedback, and makes them more independent of their research  advisor. The students had multiple opprtunities to extend their  professional network to other students and senior researchers.
