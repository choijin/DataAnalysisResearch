<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is more efficient heat transfer in a variety of potential industrial and consumer electronics applications.  More efficient heat transfer translates into greater computational speed and output.  In a world where electronics are growing more powerful and are ever increasing in capacity, the ability to remove heat is a significant consideration.  This platform technology has the potential to be integrated as a high performance thermal grease. One possible application is as a computer CPU grease (or heat paste, heat sink compound, heat sink paste, thermal compound, thermal gel, thermal interface material, or thermal paste).  Similar products are commonly used as an interface between heat sinks and heat sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project further develops a class of novel greases that incorporate nanoparticles to enhance their performance. Thesee are stable and homogeneous greases based on carbon nanotubes in polyalphaolefin oil.  Inter molecular Van der Waals forces and three dimensional percolation networks in the grease structure are determined to be the stability of the grease. The work builds on a recent discovery of a way to significantly enhance the electrical and thermal conductivity of the grease by including these additional additives in small amounts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview:     With this NSF I-Corp project, we have interviewed more than 100 customers and understand the market of thermal grease. In addition, A company named "Novum Nano LLC" is formed. It is a company based in South Dakota, specializing in the conversion of recent developments in nanomaterials into products that improve user experience in a wide range of industries.  The company is currently spearheading the development of thermal grease, novel oil additives, paint coatings, etc.     These products show promise and will be easily accessible to the general public, in terms of both cost and ease-of-use.  The applications of these products range from niche to widely applicable.     Intellectual Merit:     Nanomaterials such as Carbon nanotubes have long been known for their miracle-like properties, boasting thermal and electrical conductivity better than the vast majority of known materials.  Unfortunately, many setbacks have been encountered in the process of incorporating these nanomaterials into high-quality user products.  Less-refined methods to combine nanomaterials with different bases will often dilute the properties to such an extent that the cost of the nanomaterials outweigh any improvements to performance.        We have developed and refined multiple methods to incorporate nanomaterials into greases, paints, or oil additives, maintaining consistency between batches.        Broader Impacts:     The resulting products are not limited to industrial uses.  The company is exploring how to optimize performance against production costs for each item.  The thermal grease is expected to be widely usable in a wide variety of engines, CPU, etc.     The new material and concept also has broad impact to the community. The Navum nano has won the first price of Gov Giant Vision Competition. It is established to help citizens realize that South Dakota is the very best place to start a successful business. The program was designed as an opportunity for entrepreneurs to compete for seed money and a chance to achieve their dream.
