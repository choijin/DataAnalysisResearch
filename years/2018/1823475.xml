<AbstractNarration>Visualization, or the use of interactive graphic representations to support data analysis and understanding, has become integral to a wide array of application areas. This grant provides support for approximately 18 U.S.-based graduate students to participate in the IEEE VIS Doctoral Colloquium to be held in conjunction with the IEEE Visualization Conference (VIS 2018), October 21- 26, 2018, Berlin, Germany (http://ieeevis.org/). IEEE VIS is the premier forum for visualization advances in science and engineering for academia, government, and industry, bringing together researchers and practitioners with a shared interest in techniques, tools, and technology for data analysis. The focus of the VIS Doctoral Colloquium is the students' doctoral dissertation research.  Students are selected chiefly on grounds of research excellence, and this research represents the state-of-the-art in the field of visualization.  The Doctoral Colloquium provides an opportunity both for these projects to be shaped and improved through intellectual exchange as well as for the students to present and communicate the character of their work to a key group of their peer professionals. Since the students and mentors are a diverse group (nationality, gender, ethnicity, scientific discipline, and research specialization), the students' horizons are broadened at a critical stage in their professional development. Supporting participation of U.S. students in the DC VIS 2018 is important for the development of researchers, practitioners and educators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IEEE VIS was established in 1996 and has become the worldwide largest and most important conference on Scientific Visualization, Information Visualization and Visual Analytics. The conference trend has been to draw over 1,000 participants from dozens of countries to a week of research presentations, tutorials, workshops, panels, demonstrations, posters, exhibitions and scientific discussions. The Visualization Doctoral Colloquium was initiated in 2006, and has been highly successful in providing mentorship opportunities to current PhD students. Students at the Doctoral Colloquium present their doctoral dissertation research and receive feedback from senior professionals in the visualization community. This event allows the participants to create a professional network both among themselves and with senior researchers. This professional network plays a major role in their professional and educational career development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

IEEE VIS is the premier forum for visualization advances in science and engineering for academia, government, and industry, bringing together researchers and practitioners with a shared interest in techniques, tools, and technology for data analysis.  This award was able to support 16 US-based students (6 in 2018 and 10 in 2019) to travel to the premiere conference in their field, participate in discussions related to cutting edge research in their domain, and present their doctoral work to a field of preeminent experts for feedback and refinement.  Broader Impact The VIS Doctoral Colloquium brought together the most promising of the next generation of visualization researchers. This event allowed the participants to create a professional network both among themselves and with senior researchers. This professional network plays a major role in their enculturation into the profession. Since the students and faculty are a diverse group on several dimensions (nationality, gender, ethnicity, scientific discipline, and research specialization), the students’ horizons are broadened at a critical stage in their professional development.  Intellectual Merit The focus of the VIS Doctoral Colloquium is the students’ doctoral dissertation research. Since the students are selected chiefly on grounds of research excellence, this research represents the state-of-the-art in the field of visualization. The Doctoral Colloquium provides an opportunity both for these projects to be shaped and improved through intellectual exchange as well as for the students to present and communicate the character of their work to a key group of their peer professionals.  Given the distributed nature of the scientific community, performing visualization research can be a solitary and isolated endeavor for many young researchers. The purpose of the VIS Doctoral Colloquium was to allow students to discuss their research in a supportive atmosphere with a panel of distinguished leaders beyond their doctoral advisor, as well as with their peers. Students gathered helpful feedback and fresh perspectives on their research topics and possible career paths, and will had the opportunity to interact closely with expert researchers in their field. Furthermore, the colloquium supported community building by connecting beginning and advanced researchers.  More specifically, the outcomes of this colloquium were:  1. Building a cohort group of new researchers from across the world.  2. Guiding the work of the new researchers by having senior experts in the research field, coach them, and give advice on future directions.  3. Providing encouragement and support for selecting visualization research topics and research methods.  4. Giving insight on future career paths, including job searches, interviewing, industry vs. academia, patents, grant writing, student advising, etc.  5. Making attending the research conference more accessible to new entrants into the field so that they may become more integrated into the scientific community.  6. Illustrating the interrelationship and diversity of visualization research.  7. Making the new entrants’ experience at VIS an enjoyable and rewarding experience, encouraging them to return and submit to the conference in future years.
