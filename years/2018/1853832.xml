<AbstractNarration>This project supports the 2019 Colloquium and Field Study of the Sustainability of Rural Systems Commission of the International Geographical Union (IGU-CSRS), which will be hosted jointly by Macalester College and the University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire.  The Colloquium fosters collaboration and information exchange specifically focused on concepts of economic, social, and environmental sustainability of rural systems.  This Colloquium engages scholars, civic leaders, and local communities in discussions and place-specific examples of community and farmer initiatives highlighting innovative models and technologies related to sustainable rural communities in the U.S.  The collaborations and partnerships include opportunities for student participation, training, and potential internships related to these themes.  This forum also provides participants with an opportunity to develop a variety of perspectives on rural sustainability and bolster relationships between the universities and local communities.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. Midwest region is the living laboratory in which participants will examine the diverse economic and social trajectories of rural communities.  Globalization and economic development manifest differently at local levels and impact rural communities differentially, depending on linkages within global trade networks. This Colloquium and Field Study is organized around four sub-themes highlighting the importance of the local while interrogating the relationships between local social and economic vitality and national and global trends.  The first sub-theme, "Rural Innovations: Entrepreneurship and Rural-Urban Partnerships," highlights conventional and perceptual barriers between rural and urban regions and examines activities and opportunities for building healthy and sustainable regional networks. Theme two, "Recognizing rural demographic diversity," highlights the rapidly changing rural demographic landscape, including issues of aging, population decline, and increasing ethnic diversity. The third and fourth themes, "Land Use Transitions" and "Agricultural Transitions" focus on the restructuring of rural economies, including small and large-scale agriculture, new business, and innovative technologies.  This project investigates rural social, economic, environmental systems through a colloquium focused on exchanging research and experiences between scholars from around the world, and with an in-depth field-based study of rural communities in Minnesota and Wisconsin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The ability to visit and discuss the current state of agricultural practices (i.e. dairying and small business development), economies (i.e. challenges surrounding rural resource extraction and tourism economies), and changing demographics (i.e. in-migration of new populations and simultaneous out-migration of young residents), was an important Colloquium accomplishment.&nbsp; While driving between places, participants discussed their observations and how these practices, places and people were similar / different from their home countries.&nbsp; American participants had the opportunity to see U.S. agriculture and rural economies from a different perspective.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our community partners developed exemplary active learning opportunities showcasing American rural communities.&nbsp; For example, at Four Cubs Farm, colloquium participants toured one of the most highly robotisized dairy operations in the Midwest.&nbsp; The Peterson?s described the evolution of their dairy from small family dairy to large-scale dairy.&nbsp; The family also owns a local brewery, which utilizes grains grown on the dairy farm for its product, then uses spent grains as feed at the dairy.&nbsp; This example highlights an innovative entrepreneurship model that embraces both conventional agricultural practices and sustainable resource use.&nbsp; Participants also visited Chickadee Hills Homestead Farm, which produces Mangalista hogs (a heritage breed) in a system that will eventually have no external farm inputs and is part of a local foods system, including a local restaurant where participants also toured.&nbsp; In each example, rural community entrepreneurship and innovation, coupled with different methods and perspectives on rural sustainability and rural agriculture were on display.&nbsp; Participants also engaged with elders at the Fond du Lac Cultural Center and Museum and helped pack CSA shares at the Hmong American Farmers Association Farm.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/28/2021<br>      Modified by: Holly&nbsp;R&nbsp;Barcus</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1853832/1853832_10597075_1611763019363_IGU-1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1853832/1853832_10597075_1611763019363_IGU-1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Pine Brook Farm Tour"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1853832/1853832_10597075_1611763019363_IGU-1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Pine Brook Farm Tour"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">IGU-CSRS participants visiting Pine Brook Farm Restaurant near Spooner, Wisconsin</div> <div class="imageCredit">Holly Barcus</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Holly&nbsp;R&nbsp;Barcus</div> <div class="imageTitle">Pine Brook Farm Tour</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1853832/1853832_10597075_1611763119845_IGU-2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1853832/1853832_10597075_1611763119845_IGU-2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Four Cubs Farm Tour"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1853832/1853832_10597075_1611763119845_IGU-2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Four Cubs Farm Tour"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">IGU-CSRS participants visiting Four Cubs Farm in Burnett County, Wisconsin</div> <div class="imageCredit">Holly Barcus</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Holly&nbsp;R&nbsp;Barcus</div> <div class="imageTitle">Four Cubs Farm Tour</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>

Schmitz (University of Li?ge). Expected publication late 2021.  Open Access Field Guide and Colloquium Program: https://www.macalester.edu/geography/igu-csrs2019/. Continued collaborations with rural communities, creating linkages between academic inquiries and community-scale activities.  For example, several courses at Macalester College and UWEC continue to work with local partners deepening relationships and continuing to engage students with rural America.  A dozen plus businesses, farmers, local organizations collaborated with us to develop the Field Study.  Participants and collaborators exchanged information and insights into contemporary global and local rural issues.        Impact on society?     The Colloquium exemplified international collaboration and engagement.  The most significant impact on society was the direct engagement of U.S. and international rural scholars with U.S. rural people.  One international scholar said ?I was hesitant to come to the U.S. because of the way the U.S. is portrayed in the media.  But this conference and the field excursion changed my mind ? my opinion of the U.S. is very different now ? very positive?.  This sentiment was echoed by many participants.  Our rural community partners were equally enthusiastic. The ability to visit and discuss the current state of agricultural practices (i.e. dairying and small business development), economies (i.e. challenges surrounding rural resource extraction and tourism economies), and changing demographics (i.e. in-migration of new populations and simultaneous out-migration of young residents), was an important Colloquium accomplishment.  While driving between places, participants discussed their observations and how these practices, places and people were similar / different from their home countries.  American participants had the opportunity to see U.S. agriculture and rural economies from a different perspective.     Our community partners developed exemplary active learning opportunities showcasing American rural communities.  For example, at Four Cubs Farm, colloquium participants toured one of the most highly robotisized dairy operations in the Midwest.  The Peterson?s described the evolution of their dairy from small family dairy to large-scale dairy.  The family also owns a local brewery, which utilizes grains grown on the dairy farm for its product, then uses spent grains as feed at the dairy.  This example highlights an innovative entrepreneurship model that embraces both conventional agricultural practices and sustainable resource use.  Participants also visited Chickadee Hills Homestead Farm, which produces Mangalista hogs (a heritage breed) in a system that will eventually have no external farm inputs and is part of a local foods system, including a local restaurant where participants also toured.  In each example, rural community entrepreneurship and innovation, coupled with different methods and perspectives on rural sustainability and rural agriculture were on display.  Participants also engaged with elders at the Fond du Lac Cultural Center and Museum and helped pack CSA shares at the Hmong American Farmers Association Farm.
