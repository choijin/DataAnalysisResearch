<AbstractNarration>This project will support participation by US scientists, the majority of them in early career stages, at an international scientific meeting organized under the auspices of the International Glaciological Society.  The meeting is focused on understanding processes influencing glacier and ice-sheet dynamics.  It will bring together scientists from many different fields to hold interdisciplinary discussions about paleoclimate records, modern observations, and computer modeling, with the common goal of informing understanding of the stability of ice-sheets and glaciers, and predictions of sea-level rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four outcome goals for the Symposium: (i) assess the state of knowledge of glacier and ice-sheet processes and how they manifest in observations, (ii) examine the range of timescales over which these processes may act and interact, (iii) identify advances in ice-sheet and earth-system models needed to resolve these processes, and (iv) identify techniques to better utilize the paleoclimate observational record toward i-iii.  The symposium will bring together glaciologists, paleoclimatologists, geomorphologists, and glacial geologists to link research on paleoclimate records (100-100,000 year timescales) to modern observations of and models for glaciers and ice sheets.  Papers from the symposium will be published in a special issue of Annals of Glaciology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported a one-week symposium of the International Glaciological Society (IGS) held in Buffalo, NY on June 3-8, 2018.  The theme of the symposium was "Timescales and Processes of Glacier Dynamics."  A primary goal of the symposium was to unite interdisciplinary research themes across studies of glaciers, paleoclimate, oceanography, and geology in order to advance research into the flow of glaciers to ultimately improve the accuracy of forecasts of sea-level rise.  The symposium emphasized the scientific contributions of female, culturally under-represented, and early-career participants. For instance, oral presentations featured nine people of ethnic minorities; three of the five keynote speakers were female and four were early-career; and of the eleven discussion chairs, seven were female and eight were early-career.  The IGS Symposium was a big success and featured 84 presentations:  3 headline lectures open to the public, 5 keynote lectures, 50 other oral presentations, and 26 poster presentations.  There were 79 participants attending from six countries.  This award supported the travel and attendance of 22 US-based headline speakers, keynote speakers, and early-career meeting participants.  These participants were 9 graduate students (5 female, 4 male), 2 postdoctoral scholars (both male), 3 early-career faculty members (1 female, 2 male), 5 faculty keynote speakers (3 female, 2 male; 4 early-career), and three headline speakers (1 female, 2 male).  The availability of this travel support for early-career participants was advertised widely via public listservs such as Cryolist, Paleoclimate-List, ArcticInfo, Earth Science Women?s Network, and the IGS Symposium website.  The symposium contained scientific sessions from 9am - 4pm Monday through Friday, excepting Wednesday, when an organized excursion to Niagara Falls replaced the afternoon session.  Monday afternoon featured two workshops, one on Scientific Communication (also sponsored by University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences) and one on Sustainability and Inclusiveness.  Thursday evening featured a public talk on polar exploration that was part of the Distinguished Lecture Series at the University at Buffalo RENEW Institute.  One headline lecture, "Storytelling and social media: Compelling ways to share your science," outlined an exciting career in science communication, where PhD graduates can find success and impact.  A second headline lecture, "Building an ethical, sustainable future" addressed inclusiveness in science.   Scientific advances from the symposium include a technical comment in Science, a direct outcome of discussions at the symposium that was led by three early-career attendees of the symposium.  Scientific talks featured linkages between paleoclimate research and modern glaciers and ice sheets, including assimilation of paleo- or geomorphic data into analysis of present and future ice dynamics.  Talks and posters addressed interaction of ice-dynamical processes over a wide range of timescales, and identified a need for upcoming computer-based ice-sheet models to resolve new processes that influence the stability of ice sheets, glaciers, and future global sea levels.  Scientific papers from this symposium are being published in the Annals of Glaciology 78(60). Peer review and typesetting are underway, and contributions will soon be available (gold open access) at http://www.igsoc.org/annals/78/60/published.html .
