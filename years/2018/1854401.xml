<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project allows physicians, nurses, and other healthcare personnel to give medication to their patients in a more efficient and safe manner by significantly reducing the number of medication errors made in health care settings. One study calculated the economic costs of this problem in the United States to be over $2 billion in 1993, leading to longer hospitalizations, loss of income, and higher insurance premiums. Of greater importance, these errors can be traced to over 7,000 deaths.  Consumer segments include any medical institution that administers medications including medical centers, academic, major metropolitan, and regional hospitals, surgery centers, urgent care centers, dental and veterinarian offices, and nursing homes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is a proposal for a medical device designed to decrease medication errors and be compatible with vials currently used in the hospital. It uses cameras to read a printed code on a vial to positively identify the medication for safety, contraindications, expiration, manufacturer recall, and previous usage to dispense medication contained inside without the use of needles, syringes, or labels. It will also decrease medication delivery times, adverse drug reactions, contamination, counterfeiting, and waste. Our device also consists of a backend database that keeps track of medications tagged with a code to provide a record of medication given to patients. The database can be updated to prevent the delivery of recalled, expired, and previously used medications.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The basis of this device is a barcode medication administration (BCMA) system to give medication to patients and manage inventory of medications in pharmacies. Most medication errors occur from the use of intravenous medications from a number of different sources and are the leading cause of complications by anesthetists. This apparatus can improve workflow efficiency and provide multiple safety nets by automatically alerting the anesthetist to contraindicated medications and allergies, sending reminders for redosing medications, and documenting medication administration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Health care professionals &ndash; who administer intravenous medications &ndash; are interested in decreasing medication errors by using a medical device. While it is critical to understand every step with the goal of minimizing the potential source of contamination during medical treatments, we demonstrate an automized injection device, Michelangelo, that enables the preparation of customized medicine for each patient by reducing errors by 65%, which can be made by professionals. In this manner, the major goal of this project is to identify product market fit for a medical device that administers parenteral medications. In particular, the market has been chosen to be specialty infusion centers. For this, we have interviewed over 100 potential customers to receive their feedback on the value of bringing this medical injection device into the hospital system. The interviews helped us to identify whether there was a demonstrable need for this medical injection device and potential reasons why this medical injection device might fail within a hospital system. In addition to this, we have discussed how we can improve this device in order to use them in real life. If the use of Michelangelo in the hospitals is successful, Michelangelo will make a great impact by providing nurses and anesthesiologists back 21 hours, which can be used to care patients, while saving $17,000 a day for 250 bed hospitals.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/30/2020<br>      Modified by: Yoonjin&nbsp;Won</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
