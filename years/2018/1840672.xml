<AbstractNarration>New forms of energy storage needed for our national prosperity requires the development of new materials and processes. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) will support fundamental research that will contribute to new insight on processing nanostructured silicon, which may serve as a high performance anode material for magnesium-ion batteries. Magnesium ion batteries have been suggested as a safe and inexpensive alternative to the more conventional lithium ion batteries.  This research looks to overcome the fundamental barrier that restricts the storage of magnesium in nanostructured silicon, and study the relationship between the new processing route and the material performance. The surface of conventionally processed nanostructured silicon is covered with native silicon oxide, which restricts the storage of magnesium in silicon. The new processing route investigated here promises to lead to oxide-free nanostructured silicon, making it possible to reversibly store magnesium. The relationship between the size of the synthesized nanostructured silicon, the synthesis parameter, and the storage performance will be determined. Results from this research will open the way to the use of silicon -- the second most abundant element in the earth's crust, in a magnesium battery, which will benefit the US economy and society. In particular, it will lessen the concern of the material shortage in lithium and cobalt, which are currently used in rechargeable batteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reversible electrochemical alloying reaction of nanostructured silicon with magnesium remains a challenge. In this project, it is hypothesized that processing of oxide-free nanostructured silicon is the key to successful alloying reaction of silicon with magnesium. To verify this hypothesis, a new in situ processing route to oxide-free nanostructured silicon will be investigated. This process creates the  nanostructured material in situ in a magnesium-ion battery cell when the battery is being charged and discharged. The reversible alloying reactions of silicon with magnesium will be directly investigated in the same magnesium-ion battery cell throughout charging and discharging cycles. This processing approach makes it possible to avoid any exposure of the nanostructured silicon to air, thus avoiding the formation of undesirable native silicon oxide surface films that hamper the reaction between silicon and magnesium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Results and broader impacts   Results: (a) Nearly oxide-free nanoporous Si was successfully processed through air-free selective electrochemical removal of Mg from bulk Mg2Si parent materials. (b) It was found that  Mg removal from Mg2Si (demagneziation) requires a very high potential  (~1.2 V vs Mg/Mg2+, instead of ~0.2 V vs Mg/Mg2+ as predicted from thermodynamics), meaning that the reversible storage of  Mg in Mg2Si is much more difficult than theoretical predictions. (c) Processed nearly oxide-free nanoporous Si was found to be amorphous. (d) The characteristic structure size in this nearly oxide-free nanoporous Si was ~100 nm. Key conclusion: Mg can be electrochemically removed from Mg2Si to make nanoscale oxide-free nanoscale Si, but Mg cannot be stored back in this Si, probably because the 100 nm structure size in Si is still too big. We believe that processing of Si with ultrasmall structure size (10-20 nm) is required in order to store Mg back in Si.  Broader impacts: Our air-free processing approach was extended to other materials system beyond Si: (a) Nearly oxide-free nanoporous Al was made through air-free selective electrochemical removal of Mg from bulk Al30Mg70 parent materials, and it use for on-demand hydrogen generation by hydrolysis in pure water was demonstrated. (ii)  Nearly oxide-free nanoporous Mg was made through air-free selective electrochemical removal of Li from bulk Mg30Li70 parent materials, and it use for reversible Li storage, and for on-demand hydrogen generation by hydrolysis in pure water was demonstrated. (c) A "self-healing" Mg ion battery anode based on solid-liquid transition between Ga5Mg2 and pure Ga was demonstrated. Using this materials system, we demonstrated for the first time 1,000 charge-discharge cycles in Mg ion batteries (the state-of-the-art before our work is 200 charge-discharge cycles).  This work resulted in one patent (for the air-free processing method) and 6 publications high profiles journal including: Advanced Energy Materials, ACS Sustainable Chemistry &amp; Engineering, The Journal of the Electrochemical Society, Renewable Energy, Journal of Energy Storage, Scripta Materilia.
