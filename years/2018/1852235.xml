<AbstractNarration>The United States depends on a large and diverse workforce in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. In 2012, it was forecast that the US would need an additional 1 million STEM college graduates over a decade to remain globally competitive. Yet, the majority of students who enter college with intentions to major in a STEM discipline do not actually complete a STEM degree. Improving the retention of undergraduate students in STEM is thus a critical national priority. This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) project will address this need by hosting the Research in Interdisciplinary STEM Education (RISE) program at Washington State University. Over the course of three years, RISE will immerse diverse cohorts of 10 undergraduate students each summer in authentic research focused on STEM workforce development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While most undergraduate STEM education reform efforts have focused on teaching and learning at the undergraduate level, it is also important to understand the connections to K-12 and informal education settings, and to view STEM learning as a lifelong, life-wide phenomenon. The RISE scholars will advance STEM inclusion and diversity by investigating critical research questions related to STEM pathways, informal STEM education, and authentic STEM disciplinary practices. The RISE REU program will recruit undergraduate students from primarily non-PhD-granting institutions, with a particular focus on recruiting students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields. RISE scholars will participate in extensive mentoring by faculty, graduate students, and peers; a series of professional skills workshops; and cohort-building activities to increase a sense of belonging and STEM identity. RISE participants will gain understandings of the importance of collaboration in STEM, the role of educational research in improving STEM education, and STEM career pathways. A comprehensive longitudinal evaluation plan will examine changes in the RISE scholars' understanding of, appreciation for, and pursuit of career possibilities in STEM and STEM education research. Ultimately, the REU RISE project is expected to contribute to a more vibrant and inclusive STEM workforce while advancing research in STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program supports active research participation by undergraduate students in areas of research funded by NSF. This REU project is supported by NSF's Education &amp; Human Resources Directorate Core Research (ECR) Program and its Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
