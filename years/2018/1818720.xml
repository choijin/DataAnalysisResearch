<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program provides support for projects to design, implement, and assess strategies that can lead to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. This two-year planning project at Oakwood College seeks to increase the number of women and under-represented minorities in STEM by developing a program that will recruit, retain and graduate students in STEM disciplines. Transforming the institutional context to actively engage students in their learning and develop skills for them to succeed academically is a primary focus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall project goal is to increase the number of well-prepared, competitively trained minority STEM graduate who pursue graduate studies or enter the STEM workforce. Traditional lecture based and teacher-centered instructional strategies have been shown to not effectively motivate or retain students' interest in STEM disciplines. Oakwood College will incorporate evidence based pedagogies, such as Student Centered/Active Learning, Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) and Problem Based Learning, in gatekeeper courses to improve student learning and first-year retention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Children of all ages were accompanied by a parent or guardian visited the Chemistry Department to conduct hands on experiments with the parents or guardian.  STEM majors were available to assist and explain the experiments. Science Day was held on February 24, 2020 when we had over 450 Public School and Homeschool students participating.  Teachers are invited to bring their classes to visit a HBCU and conduct fun experiments and observe demonstrations.  During the School year students and faculty assist a local Elementary School teachers and students fulfill their science requirements by providing science experiments and assistance with STEM instruction.
