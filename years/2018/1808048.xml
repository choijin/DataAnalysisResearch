<AbstractNarration>PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certain organic "plastic" materials known as conjugated polymers are able to conduct electrical charge in a manner similar to traditional metals and semiconductors.  These substances are of considerable scientific and commercial interest for a wide variety of applications including energy storage, chemical sensors, and biomedical devices.  However, the fundamental mechanisms by which these materials transition from small-molecule liquids to polymer solids are not well understood.  This lack of scientific understanding limits the ability to precisely tailor these materials for specific purposes.  Specialized electron-microscopic sample stages are now available that allow for detailed local studies of the formation of these materials, revealing previously unknown aspects of this complex process.  This project will monitor the local shape and chemistry of the reaction products formed as the material proceeds from precursor liquids, through sticky intermediates, to the final solid conjugated polymer products using a high-resolution electron microscope and related analysis techniques.  The work will also enable graduate students in materials science and engineering to obtain specialized advanced education and establish new insights about the formation of polymers from small molecules using an electrochemical reaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been previously established that in-situ, environmentally-controlled electron-microscopic sample stages can be used to directly monitor the electrochemical transition from a solution of liquid organic monomer 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) to the final poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) conjugated polymer product using low-dose transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  However many fundamental questions remain unknown about the process, including the influence of comonomers and introduction of solid nanoparticles in the reaction medium.  This research project will quantify the influence of these variations in chemistry and composition on the deposition process, particularly the nucleation, growth, and redissolving of oligomer droplets back into solution when using a more hydrophilic co-monomer (EDOTacid).  The TEM experiments will be complemented with methods able to provide additional information about the chemical changes associated with the reaction, including optical microscopy, nanoscale FTIR/AFM, and microfocused Raman spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Conjugated polymers such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) are organic materials that can conduct electrical charge.  They are currently being used in a number of advanced applications including biomedical devices that can better integrate engineered components with the human body, including pacemakers, retinal implants, and cardiac mapping systems.  PEDOT films are typically deposited onto electrodes by a process known as electrodeposition, where current is used to grow thin films of the dark, solid PEDOT polymer from a clear, isotropic solution of the precursor molecules (EDOT monomer) in water.  To precisely control the properties of PEDOT films, it is important to understand in detail the means by which the solid films grow during this process.  Although local information about solid materials structure can be obtained using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), such experiments are much more difficult when the samples of interest are liquids or soft gels.  Organic materials are particularly hard to image because of their extreme sensitivity to the electron beam.  We have been able to use custom-designed sample chambers and low dose techniques to directly image the growth of solid PEDOT films from the reactive liquid precursor solution by liquid-phase TEM.  Our results have provided an unprecedented look into the details of this reaction, allowing us to see the size and shape of the intermediate states as the average size of the molecules increases during the chemical reaction.  Snapshots from high resolution video recordings obtained during the electrochemical deposition of PEDOT are shown in the attached figure, where the process was imaged at the start, early, intermediate, and late stages.  This research project provided support for several graduate students, a post-doctoral research scholar, and faculty member in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Delaware.
