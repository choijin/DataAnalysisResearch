<AbstractNarration>Title: Workshop: Computing, Information Science, and Access to the Justice System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Social science research demonstrates that low and middle-income people face significant barriers to obtaining access to the civil justice system because of an inability to afford a lawyer. While experiments with new approaches to access to the legal system have garnered much attention from courts, legal aid organizations, and the bar, there is little research about the efficacy of these new approaches. In other fields of human activity, computer scientists are creating new and powerful technologies to study how people interact with private and public institutions, as well as new communication tools, such as apps and social media, to improve these interactions. These computing-based approaches can lead to new knowledge about interactions with the civil justice system and new tools to advance the goal of improving access to the justice system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together several recent scientific, administrative, and technological trends to develop a new research agenda focused on computing and access to the justice system. These trends include emerging research on the civil justice system, the expanding digitization of information in legal institutions and organizations, and the recent rise of computational social science and the fields of human-centered computing, machine learning, and computing connectivity. The workshop will convene researchers engaged in access to justice scholarship, data scientists, human-centered computing experts, and representatives of courts, legal service providers, and other organizations embedded in the civil justice system, to generate a collaborative research agenda focused on the workings of the legal system. The workshop will produce a framework for research that applies computing methods to the scholarship on access to justice, while generating actionable knowledge about how to improve the civil justice system and strengthen its role in the United States democratic system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Today there is a civil justice crisis in the United States.  Studies show that the majority of low and middle level income people have at least one legal problem a year. A significant number of them end up in court, defendants in eviction and debt collection actions. By and large, they are not represented by lawyers.  Despite the pervasiveness of civil legal problems and court involvement, however, very little is known about how the court system works; what long term consequences court involvement has on people’s lives; and whether having a lawyer makes a difference (and when.) This workshop was intended to investigate how computing and data tools can yield new knowledge about a central institution in American democracy and produce insights about whether the civil justice system actually produces justice.     The workshop brought together researchers studying the civil justice system and computer and data scientists to develop a new research agenda focused on computing and the civil justice system. The workshop focused on three themes:  What are the core research questions that data science and computing can shed light on in the civil justice field? what methodologies and technological tools can be of use? And what barriers exist to the application of quantitative and computing science to the study of the civil justice system?     The workshop had intellectual merit. Approximately seventy academic researchers and civil justice leaders in the field participated in the two-day workshop, which was organized around possible cross-disciplinary collaborations between computing and data scientists and researchers engaged in civil justice studies. Participants represented a number of academic disciplines including law, computing science, informatics, sociology, legal design, and public policy. They also included leaders in the access to justice and technology movement. Panel presentations by civil justice studies and data and computing researchers and civil justice technologists alternated with focused break-out sessions structured around questions raised in the panel presentations. The first panel involved presentations by access to justice experts who brought participants up to date about the state of research and unanswered questions in the area of access to civil justice. The next two panels consisted of two panels with experts who use computing techniques, including machine learning and natural language processing, in other fields, and a panel of researchers who study tech design tech to increase access to justice. One panel focused on how civil justice advocates were using data science in the field to understand the justice system.     During the final breakout sessions participants discussed potential research directions in connection with the following topics: ways to analyze court outcomes; ways to analyze non-court interventions; ways to understand/respond to legal problems that do not make it to the court system; ways to improve data quality / data access / data linkage; health care access; consumer debt &amp; and rental housing; finances; children and custody; education; disabilities; income maintenance.   The level of discussion (and enthusiasm) during the final session suggested that the workshop was a success and had significant impact.  This was confirmed by subsequent conversations and collaborations that grew out of the convening (including one co-authored article and several grants for collaborations to study computing, data, and the civil justice system.)
