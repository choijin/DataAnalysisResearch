<AbstractNarration>Identification of watermarks in antique (pre-1750) laid paper is a vital forensic in determining the date and origin of its production. For artworks on paper, watermarks are a key element in dating and authentication. Classifying and distinguishing watermarks is a difficult, time-consuming task even for paper analysis experts. Recent research has shown that a computer-based decision tree can reduce dramatically the time expended in the task of watermark identification and the concomitant identification of sheets of paper made on the same mold, while at the same time increasing the confidence in the result. The application of digital image processing to this task is one example of the new field of computational art history, which has exploded over the past decade. Through this project, automation using digital image processing can scale up the task of watermark and moldmate identification to handle the universe of the hundreds of individual watermarks in the papers of prints and drawings of Rembrandt and his pupils and allow expansion of this identification beyond these artworks in major museums to the thousands in smaller museums and private collections. This is expected to energize the expansion of this valuable forensic to the thousands of watermarks in laid paper used in artworks on paper by other pre-1750 artists. Advances in computational art history stemming from this project will offer a path for the general population, which is growing quite comfortable with the expansion of computer usage in everyday life, to engage with art in a new and appealing way. Art history is one subfield within cultural heritage that has delayed the longest in joining the emergence of the digital science and humanities. The success of this project will be a major enabler for further trans-disciplinary activities between the humanities and the sciences, thereby decreasing the separation of their two cultures, which is vital as the digitization of all aspects of daily life gains dominance at a scorching pace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project continues the pioneering efforts in the new field of computational art history that is broadening acceptance of digital image processing as a vital tool in art history research as it tremendously expands the intellectual reach of art historians. As the first tools are developed in this nascent field and more scientists and engineers are drawn to the challenges of these problems, the specific needs of art historians will undoubtedly reveal new tasks requiring advances in the underlying science of digital image processing. This connection between computation and the visual humanities also offers a powerful link to combat the widening gulf in education at all levels between engineering science and the humanities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An ability to identify pre-1750 laid paper made on the same mold, so-called moldmates, by matching  their internal structural features (watermarks, chain lines, and laid lines) can provide valuable information for art historical studies.  In particular, late in the 20th century a heirachical classification of several hundred watermarks in the prints of Rembrandt van Rijn was undertaken. This culminated in their cataloging by Erik Hinterding and the resulting insightful dating of the creation of impressions of many of Rembrandt's prints.  The first problem we tackled using computer-assisted watermark and moldmate identification was a reduction of time necessary to visually identify a watermark of interest in a Rembrandt print among the hundreds of different watermarks in Hinterding's catalog.  Soon after the start of this NSF grant composition was begun of an article, which is to appear soon in the Journal of Historians of Netherlandish Art, describing a technique for building a heirarchical binary decision tree based on Hinterding's catalog.  The article provides a description of decision tree construction and utilization suited to the art history community. The article also poses a number of image processing development tasks critical for extending the degree of automation of the identification of watermarks in Rembrandt's etchings.  This decision tree analysis when supplemented with chain line pattern matching has resulted in the discovery of new watermarks among Rembrandt's prints from museum collections not consulted by Hinterding in the preparation of his catalog.  A related watermark identification task subsequently arose with the offer of access to images of the Leicester and Arundel codices of Leonardo da Vinci.  The nature of the task was completely different. The watermarks in Leonardo's papers have not yet been cataloged and categorized.  Furthermore, radiographs available of Rembrandt's prints that provide images of watermarks and chain line suitable for precise distinction despite the surface ink of the prints frequently obscuring the paper's inner structural properties were (and remain) unavailable for Leonardo's papers.  Instead, only transmitted light and surface reflected light photographs are available.  A novel optimization procedure was devised to tune removal of the surface images present in the transmitted light images.  This result has recently been published in the Journal of the American Institute for Conservation.  The revelation of inner structural features in Leonardo's papers created a desire for numerical tools to compare relative dimensions of their internal structural features, which is also quite useful in the identification of Rembrandt's watermarks by allowing precise comparison of features an observer would be reluctant to trust to just visual comparison. Separate computer-based tools were developed to compare various dimensions in the watermarks and chain line patterns. To accommodate different digital resolutions of images taken by different imaging set-ups and subject to different degrees of paper shrinkage from different treament histories, we resorted to the novel use of ratios of line segments in the images between key points in the inner structural features.   These tools were applied to an issue of significant interest to Leonardo scholars: the grouping of hundreds of Leonardo's loose sheets of writings and drawings left after his death that he had intended to collect into treatises on various subjects.  Leonardo scholars have spent great energy for decades debating their intended groupings.  With our new laid paper moldmate verification tools, we discovered the first moldmate groupings among Leonardo's papers. An article on these new forensic tools and the groundbreaking insights they offer has been submitted to the journal Master Drawings.  Due to the use of halves, quarters and eighths of a the full-mold sheet of paper by Rembrandt for his prints, only about one-third of the paper supports of Rembrandt's prints contain watermarks or watermark fragments.  Unfortunately, chainspace patterns containing less than 6 chain spaces (of approximately one inch each) are not sufficiently unique given the margins imposed by the chain line marking process to provide confident confirmation of moldmate status. This leaves laid line analysis as the remaining inner structural feature usable for moldmate identification. However, typical radiographs and photographs of antique laid paper are of insufficient resolution and/or clarity to produce countable images of the closely-spaced parallel laid lines.  Fortunately, blank pages from a 1536 French book were made available to us by the Conservation Center at New York University.  A high resolution imaging protocol was developed in the Lens Media Lab at Yale University allowing counting of the individual laid lines.  We created an original combination of lowpass pre-filtering, Fourier transformation, and phase vocoder processing that produces laid line density maps capable of identifying moldmates from the four molds used to make the 1536 book's paper.  This is a major result as it provides the first path to moldmate identification among papers without a watermark.  This work has been submitted to the International Journal for Digital Art History.       Last Modified: 03/05/2020       Submitted by: Charles Johnson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
