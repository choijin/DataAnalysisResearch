<AbstractNarration>The University of Connecticut will work together with the Arizona State University, University of Southern California, University of Arizona, and Southern Illinois University to form a new NSF Industry University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) for Networked Embedded, Smart and Trusted Things (NESTT). The vision of NESTT is to contribute to the development of an equitable, safe and secure connected world. NESTT will achieve this vision by focusing on creating holistic IoT solutions, integrating technology disciplines with expertise in law, business, and humanities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the UConn's site planning project is to hold workshops with industry partners and NESTT partner universities. The goal of these workshops is to outline a research agenda and identify industry support for an IUCRC focused on providing IoT solutions specific to cyber-physical systems, IOT requirements and architecture, cybersecurity, industrial IOT for smart manufacturing, smart buildings, grid modernization, and transportation. These application areas will be supported by UConn's expertise in systems engineering, distributed edge and cloud computing, formal methods, machine learning, data analytics, cyber-physical security, prognostics and diagnostics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multidisciplinary research at NESTT aims to integrate societal and technological aspects of IoT as a systems engineering and design problem. New scientific discoveries in NESTT and their integration with industrial practice could enable economic growth, and provide societal and environmental benefits. Access and opportunities to students who are underrepresented in STEM disciplines and relevant technology areas will be a priority. UConn's NESTT will engage with the UConn Multicultural Scholars Program, the McNair Scholars Undergraduate Research Program, liaisons at HBCUs, the National GEM Consortium, the Northeast Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate, and Summer Research Programs for minority students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The agenda, list of participants and outcomes of the UConn's NESTT IUCRC planning workshops will be posted online at UConn under the auspices of the UTC Institute for Advanced Systems Engineering (http://utc-iase.uconn.edu ) and promoted through its social media venues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
