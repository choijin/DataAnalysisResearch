<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercialization potential of this I-Corps project involves the application of multi-sensor technologies to  improve the management and treatment of patients with implanted catheters. Catheter blockage and failure results in ineffective treatment, leading to life-threatening symptoms. Hydrocephalus patients are particularly vulnerable due to their life-long dependence on implanted catheters and suffer significantly due to high implant failure rate (&gt;40% in year 1, &gt;80% within a decade). Over one million Americans currently live with hydrocephalus, and require constant drainage of cerebrospinal fluid via implanted catheter. Repeated imaging studies and invasive procedures are used to monitor catheter performance, but these methods are expensive and inadequate. MRI/CT imaging can identify catheter failure in fewer than 50% of cases. Even when combined with invasive tests, patients are often misdiagnosed and undergo unnecessary surgery. Noninvasive monitoring of hydrocephalus catheter status could eliminate expensive tests and unnecessary operations, saving the US healthcare system $2 billion annually and immeasurably improve patient quality of life. Numerous other diseases in the cardiovascular, urinary, and renal spaces also require chronically implanted catheters and would benefit from noninvasive catheter monitoring. Improving catheter monitoring would also increase scientific knowledge of chronic diseases, providing an important tool for research and therapy development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project explores the commercialization potential for a multi-sensor catheter which can be implanted in the human body. Few sensors exist on the market that can operate for long periods in the human body. There are no suitable sensor technologies for chronically implanted catheters. This team developed a new sensor technology based on microscale electrodes that are low profile and eliminate the need for encapsulation or protection against the harsh environments found in vivo. They are made only of inert biocompatible materials, such as platinum and Parylene C, which have long been used in FDA approved medical implants. The pressure sensor operates by monitoring the response of a microbubble to changes in pressure. The flow sensor uses a microscopic heater and electrodes to measure heat transfer via flowing fluid. The sensor measures the electrical signal between electrodes inside and outside of a catheter to measure blockage. Clinical tests of these sensors are currently underway in pediatric patients with external ventricular drains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
