<AbstractNarration>The classical sphere packing problem (stated by Kepler in 1611) asks how densely equal-sized, non-overlapping spheres can be fit into a region of space.  This abstract mathematical question plays a fundamental role in understanding crystalline structures in chemistry, physics, and materials science.  The question can be mathematically generalized to any number of dimensions, where it is related to other topics such as the construction of robust, error proof communication codes.  The full solution to the problem is now known in dimensions 1, 2, 3, 8, and 24.  In this project, the principal investigator and collaborators aim to apply new techniques from analytic number theory and modular forms to settle a more general question about what configuration of points minimizes energy between them.  A related version of this question would be "why do atoms in certain solids form repeating crystals?"  An answer to this question would provide a new proof of the Kepler's sphere packing conjecture, as well as resolve other open questions in geometry.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the technical side, the work of the project involves harmonic analysis and automorphic forms.  The principal investigator and collaborators aim to use quasi-modular forms to solve the "universal optimality conjecture" of Cohn and Kumar alluded to above, particularly in dimensions 8 and 24.  Other projects involving automorphic forms have potential applications to the unitary dual problem in representation theory, particularly an analysis of residual Eisenstein series and non-Langlands elements of unipotent Arthur packets for split real reductive groups.  Finally, the project aims to create new Voronoi-style summation formulas in analytic number theory using automorphic distributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main accomplishment of the award was the solution to the "Universal Optimality Conjecture" in dimensions 8 and 24, jointly with Henry Cohn, Abhinav Kumar, Danylo Radchenko, and Maryna Viazovska.  This conjecture was posed by Cohn and Kumar for dimensions 1 (which they themselves proved), 2, 8, and 24.  Its meaning, say in the 2-dimensional case (in which it is still not known), is that if one positions particles on an infinitely-long flat table which repel each other according to forces of a certain kind, then they will form a perfect hexagonal (honeycomb-like) grid.  For example, if one considers electrons repelling each other by the Coulomb potential, a conjecture of the physicist Eugene Wigner from the 1930s asserts this to be the case; the analogous "Wigner crystallization" in dimensions 8 and 24 was subsequently shown by Mircea Petrache and Sylvia Serfaty to follow from the new Univeral Optimality theorem in those dimensions.  Another result from this award is the proof of James Arthur's unitarity conjectures for all real forms of exceptional Lie groups, first for the so-called "Langlands basepoint element" with Joseph Hundley, and then later the general case with Jeffrey Adams, Marc van Leeuwen, and David Vogan.  These show certain intricate incarnations of large symmetry groups (of interest both in number theory and in string theory) preserve a notion of distance.  The award also funded the research of the PI's Rutgers University Ph.D. students.       Last Modified: 08/04/2021       Submitted by: Stephen D Miller]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
