<AbstractNarration>This graduate student training workshop (Phys-Fest 2) is organized around group collection of plant ecophysiology data. Similar to the first workshop (Konza Prairie - 2016), a solid grounding in scientific research in ecophysiology will be achieved on-hands training, collegiality and interactive data collection. A key need exists for broad training in ecophysiology, as many graduate students have limited exposure to diverse ecophysiology equipment, techniques, and data interpretation. Phys-Fest 2 will fill this need through mentored research, close interaction with faculty instructors, and evening activities designed to teach effective science communication skills. Phys-Fest 2 will be hosted by the Holden Arboretum, a species-diverse, mature deciduous forest near Cleveland, OH. Holden Arboretum contains a suspended canopy walk and an emergent tower, both of which provide an 'in-canopy experience' to workshop participants. Scheduling this workshop at Holden provides a unique scientific opportunity, insight into non-academic careers for students, and opportunities for public engagement with day visitors at the arboretum. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This workshop (Phys-Fest 2) will focus on plant ecophysiology and deviate from the typical conference format of short presentations and posters.  Here, participants will collaborate using replicate pieces of equipment to measure leaf-level and whole-plant physiology in four broad categories: plant hydraulics, gas exchange, fluorescence, and thermal/hyperspectral imaging. Measurements will be taken at multiple canopy heights on replicated trees in conjunction with a distributed instrument array including NDVI, PRI, leaf wetness, canopy temperature, and microclimate sensors. This strategy will facilitate in-canopy physiological measurements, such as monitoring the response of forest tree canopies to diurnal variations. These measurements will demonstrate fundamental ecophysiological canopy processes, provide direct linkages to gradients in canopy microclimate, and will be useful for scaling processes at sub-canopy dynamics in deciduous forests. The organization of Phys-Fest 2 is specifically designed to promote networking and meaningful interactions among participants. Two types of training in science communication in the evenings of day 2 and 3 will be held. Holden Arboretum staff will provide short workshops on engaging public audiences and in science outreach and policy. Using the information learned during this training, student participants will interact with Holden visitors during the day with the goal of engaging a public audience, and disseminating ecophysiology principles in forest canopy research. Finally, course accomplishments will be disseminated through four media outlets at the Holden Arboretum: social media, print, video, and on-site interpretative materials.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We convened a student training meeting focused on plant ecophysiology (Phys-Fest 2) from July 15-19, 2018. The meeting was held at the Holden Arboretum, near Kirtland, OH. The Holden Arboretum was selected as the venue because it provided unique access to forest canopies, insight into non-academic careers for students, and opportunities for public engagement with day visitors at the arboretum. This meeting was developed because many graduate students have limited exposure to diverse ecophysiology equipment, techniques, and data interpretation. Phys-Fest 2 fills that need through mentored research, close interaction with faculty instructors, and evening activities designed to promote outreach and professional development. Phys-Fest 2 provided full support for graduate student participation in the week-long immersive course ($500 travel voucher plus lodging at the nearby Lake Erie College and all meals prepared and shared at Holden). Phys-Fest 2 included 58 total participants including 13 faculty with varying experiences and perspectives (7 academics, 3 from industry, 1 NGO, 2 from the Arboretum). Student participants had varying educational development (5 postdoctoral fellows, 25 Ph.D. students, 15 M.S. students), and were selected to provide diversity (22% non-European ancestry), gender balance (51% female), geographic breadth (21 states represented), and differences in taxonomic focus (research interests in all major North American ecosystems).</p> <p>Intellectual Merit: Participants at Phys-Fest 2 collaborated to collect data on a pre-defined scientific question - <em>How does forest tree </em><em>physiology respond to canopy energy and microclimate gradients? </em>-- using the<em> </em>suspended canopy walk and emergent tower at Holden Arboretum, both of which provided an &lsquo;in-canopy experience&rsquo; to workshop participants. Students were organized in four categories for data collection and training: plant hydraulics, gas exchange, fluorescence, and thermal / hyperspectral imaging. Each student learned skills from all four research categories. Within these groups, students used replicate pieces of equipment to measure leaf-level and whole-plant physiology. Measurements were taken at multiple canopy heights on replicated trees in conjunction with a distributed instrument array including hyperspectral sensors, leaf wetness, canopy temperature, and microclimate sensors. This strategy facilitated in-canopy physiological measurements, such as monitoring the response of forest tree canopies to diurnal variations.</p> <p>Broader Impacts: A key goal of this meeting was to promote networking and meaningful interactions among participants. We provided two types of training in science communication in the evenings of day 2 and 3. These trainings included activities on writing your science for a public audience, how to develop professional social media and how to professionally engage policy-makers and stakeholders with scientific data. During the day on Wednesday, students were able to use the information learned during these trainings to interact with Holden visitors. The goal of this outreach was to engage a public audience, and disseminate eco-physiology principles in forest canopy research.</p> <p>Several outcomes from this meeting are evident. We have disseminated the meeting accomplishments using four media outlets at the Holden Arboretum: social media, print, video, and on-site interpretative materials. A meeting summary was presented at the Ecological Society of America Annual Meeting (Aug., 2018). Data analysis by the students is in progress.&nbsp;</p> <p>A video summary of the meeting is available online and has been viewed ~ 500 times over the first month of posting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovlodZRAW8w.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the conclusion of the meeting, student assessment was extremely positive, with regard to techniques and eco-phys skills learned, opportunities for collaboration and networking, and the ability to interact and discuss ideas with faculty participants.&nbsp; Student self-assessment shows an average increase in terms of confidence using the scientific techniques taught. &nbsp;Overall, this meeting was very successful as gauged by the positive, motivated attitude of the student and faculty participants, the enthusiasm for eco-physiology, and the potential to leverage this meeting to cultivate future scientific advances in our field. Going forward, we hope to continue this student training meeting that combines ecophysiology instruction, data collection/science, and scientific collaboration. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/13/2019<br>      Modified by: Jesse&nbsp;B&nbsp;Nippert</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1801040/1801040_10529606_1552312572405_IMG_20180717_142019804_HDR--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1801040/1801040_10529606_1552312572405_IMG_20180717_142019804_HDR--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Hydraulics group"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1801040/1801040_10529606_1552312572405_IMG_20180717_142019804_HDR--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Hydraulics group"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Troy Ocheltree teaching the Hydraulics group</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jesse Nippert</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jesse&nbsp;B&nbsp;Nippert</div> <div class="imageTitle">Hydraulics group</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1801040/1801040_10529606_1552312647412_IMG_20180718_101419123--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1801040/1801040_10529606_1552312647412_IMG_20180718_101419123--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Gas exchange"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1801040/1801040_10529606_1552312647412_IMG_20180718_101419123--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Gas exchange"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Gas exchange group as seen from the Kalberer Tower</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jesse Nippert</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jesse&nbsp;B&nbsp;Nippert</div> <div class="imageTitle">Gas exchange</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1801040/1801040_10529606_1552312775312_IMG_20180718_095927749--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1801040/1801040_10529606_1552312775312_IMG_20180718_095927749--rgov-800width.jpg" title="sample collection"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1801040/1801040_10529606_1552312775312_IMG_20180718_095927749--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="sample collection"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Seton Bachle collecting foliage samples for hyperspectral analysis from the mid-canopy position.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jesse Nippert</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jesse&nbsp;B&nbsp;Nippert</div> <div class="imageTitle">sample collection</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1801040/1801040_10529606_1552312860372_IMG_20180717_103415572--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1801040/1801040_10529606_1552312860372_IMG_20180717_103415572--rgov-800width.jpg" title="canopy walk"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1801040/1801040_10529606_1552312860372_IMG_20180717_103415572--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="canopy walk"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Kate McCulloh and students on the canopy walk</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jesse Nippert</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jesse&nbsp;B&nbsp;Nippert</div> <div class="imageTitle">canopy walk</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1801040/1801040_10529606_1552312934925_OfficialPhoto--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1801040/1801040_10529606_1552312934925_OfficialPhoto--rgov-800width.jpg" title="group photo"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1801040/1801040_10529606_1552312934925_OfficialPhoto--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="group photo"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Phys-Fest 2 group photo</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jesse Nippert</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jesse&nbsp;B&nbsp;Nippert</div> <div class="imageTitle">group photo</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
