<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) phenomenon, a well-known energy transfer process, is widely used in the arena of energy (optoelectronics, solar cells), health (photodynamic therapy, bioimaging), and environmental (sensors) applications. Therefore, several types of FRET-based molecules have been designed for these applications. However, some of them are toxic, incompatible with environment, and might require tedious multistep, expensive, and time-consuming syntheses protocols. This project focuses to develop novel, environmentally friendly, FRET-based, organic ionic materials (IMs) using simple, rapid and inexpensive methods for optoelectronic applications. Advanced electrochemical, optical and device fabrication techniques will be used at Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT) to determine the full potential of novel IMs. This fellowship allows PI to explore other IM applications and broaden the scope of her research activities. An extended stay at GIT would provide extensive exposure and hands-on experience of advanced technologies available at GIT, and develop long-term collaborations that will greatly strengthen the research activities at University of Arkansas (UA) Little Rock. This training will provide an opportunity to establish an outstanding and first-of-its-kind research group at UA Little Rock and the state of Arkansas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;This study integrates synthesis, characterization, optimization and device engineering of highly tunable FRET-based organic ionic materials (IMs) and their thin films. A novel and inexpensive approach is presented to develop a single organic molecule exhibiting FRET characteristics. Ionic liquid chemistry is exploited to develop a material with high product yield and purity along with promising FRET efficiency. IMs offer great benefits and allow simple tunability of photodynamics, hydrophobicity, thermal- and photo- stability characteristics as compared to covalent molecules. IMs have distinct advantages over the existing materials and are highly suitable to solve the ongoing efficiency and stability challenges in the field of optoelectronics. Highly thermal stable FRET-based organic IMs exhibit tremendous potential to enhance the efficiency of the optoelectronic devices. It is highly important to understand the detailed photodynamics of these novel materials to explore their full potential for multiple applications. Advanced equipment available at GIT will be utilized to understand fundamental electrochemical and photophysical properties of IMs and their thin films. Finally, optoelectronic devices will be fabricated, optimized, and investigated for their efficiency. GIT facilities are essential to accomplish the overall objectives of the proposed research. This fellowship provides a unique opportunity for materials scientists to work with experienced optoelectronic scientists/engineers. This collaboration will introduce economical and highly tunable materials for designing optoelectronic devices. Establishing a long-term collaboration with GIT will strengthen k-12, undergraduate student, graduate student, and faculty research activities at home institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
