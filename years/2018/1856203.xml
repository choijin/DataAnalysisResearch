<AbstractNarration>This award will support the 2019 Summer Biomechanics, Biotransport and Bioengineering Conference (SB3C2019) being held in Seven Springs, PA, on June 25-28, 2019. The SB3C meetings, and their predecessor SBC meetings, are generally considered the premiere annual meetings for biomechanics. The primary purpose of the meeting is to promote state-of-the-art research, collaboration, and international scientific discourse in the broad field of bioengineering with focus on biomechanics, biotechnology, biotransport, biomaterials, tissue engineering, rehabilitation and design. The organizing committee for SB3C2019 is drawn from individuals in academia and industry with significant experience in running the previous summer meetings. The meeting and its precursor meetings have traditionally provided a high-quality, multidisciplinary biomedical engineering event since the early 90's and contributed to training many generations of academics and researchers. Notably, the summer meetings series has, since its inception, prioritized the integration of students into the meeting to support their professional development and future connection to the biomechanics, biotransport and bioengineering research community. For many years, students have made up more than 50% of attendees and presenters. The theme of this year's meeting is "Creating MultiScale Connections: The Keystone of Integrative Biomechanics, Bioengineering, and Biotransport". In addition to the direct impact this conference will have on the mainstream bioengineering community, it serves an important cross-fertilization role, since attendees are drawn from a very broad range of disciplines beyond the biomechanics community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aims of the project are to sponsor travel fellowships for females and under-represented minorities; to support a diversity mentor-mentee event; and, to sponsor the prestigious Student Paper Competition by covering the meeting registration costs of the top 40 BS and MS competition submissions. Finalists and winners in the student paper competition can add this information to their resumes, and the competition provides an opportunity for students to develop as researchers and is a significant career boost, enhancing retention of the most talented students and providing role models for all student attendees. Through the technical proceedings and conference web site, information presented at the meeting will be available to multiple societies and to the public at large. Further, the conference has historically had, and is expected to continue to have more than 50 percent of the attendees being students and postdoctoral fellows and more than 25 percent female attendees. For the fourth time, the organization committee has been extended to include a Diversity Chair. Through the travel fellowships and associated workshops, the PI plans to establish this meeting as the "go to" conference for female and under-represented minority attendees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The objective of the Summer Biomechanics, Bioengineering, and Biotransport Conference (SB3C) is to promote state-of-the-art research, collaboration, and scientific discourse in the broad field of bioengineering with focus on biomechanics, fluid mechanics, biotransport, biomaterials, tissue engineering, and rehabilitation and design. The primary objective of this grant was to increase attendance and participations of females and under-represented minorities (URM). Through an application and evaluation process, and with generous support from this grant and others, 58 females and URM were able to receive Diversity Travel awards to participate in this conference, which is more than a 100% increase over the last conference in which 28 Diversity Travel awards were made. This grant also enabled the delivery of a Diversity Mentor-Mentee Event at the conference which provided a relaxed and informal environment over lunch where URM and female students had dedicated mentoring and networking opportunities with engaged faculty and industry leaders. The participants rotated through 2 matches where mentors/mentees discussed important but often overlooked topics including work life balance, time management and research productivity, successful negotiation skills, landing a faculty position, obtaining extramural funding, relationship with your advisor, conscious/unconscious bias, progressing towards tenure, and balancing work with kids.&nbsp; Out of the 575 delegates at the 2019 SB3C, 108 delegates participated in this event, with 86 mentees and 22 mentors. The conference has a very strong and long-standing Student Paper Competition for students at the Bachelors, Masters and PhD level. Robust student participation is a central and distinguishing feature of SB3C, and the Student Paper Competition is one of the primary highlights of the meeting, given that over half of the conference delegates are students. This competition grows in size each year. In 2017, there were 215 submissions to the Student Paper competition. In 2019 there were 350 submissions. With direct support from NSF, full coverage of conference registration costs to the top 20 Bachelor students and top 20 Master?s students who competed in the Student Paper Competition was awarded. Enabling these students to attend the conference through travel awards and compensated registration fees, helps to attract the next generation of undergraduates to consider graduate education in STEM fields. Furthermore, providing events at the conference, such as the Diversity Mentor-Mentee Event, allows them direct interactions with many leaders in their field which might otherwise not be possible.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/21/2020<br>      Modified by: Tammy&nbsp;Haut Donahue</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
