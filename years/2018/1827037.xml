<AbstractNarration>The Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology-Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (CREST-PRF) track within the NSF-CREST program affords support to beginning CREST Center post-doctoral investigators with significant potential, funding opportunities for training and research experiences to broaden their perspectives, facilitate interdisciplinary interactions, and assist them in establishing positions of leadership within the scientific community. The CREST-PRF research project titled "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy of Confined Fluids Using Nitrogen Vacancy Centers" aligns with the goals of the PRF program and the CREST Center for Interface Design and Engineered Assembly of Low-Dimensional Systems (IDEALS) at CUNY City College of New York, where it is housed. The project's work focuses on the study of fluid dynamics at nanoscale volumes, an area of research of broad interest across scientific disciplines and with a high potential to generate benefits to society. Collaborations with other researchers, in both international and domestic laboratories, will enhance the progress of the work. Outreach to area schools will provide opportunities for high school students to be exposed to cutting edge STEM research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's main goal is the empirical characterization of confined fluids as the dynamic transitions from bulk-dominated to interface-dominated. The work employs a novel technique, utilizing Nitrogen Vacancy Centers (NVCs) in diamonds to confine nanoscale volumes of fluids, to enable their study using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Extending previous work, the superb spin properties and unmatched spatial resolution of NVCs can be used to perform magnetic resonance spectroscopy on fluid volumes orders of magnitude smaller than what is feasible with standard means. With established techniques of dynamic decoupling and correlation spectroscopy, the diffusion dynamics of the fluid of interest can be probed, providing great insight into this poorly understood regime. Experiments with NVCs bring together specialized fields including semiconductor physics, atomic physics, magnetic resonance, quantum optics, and quantum information processing. Knowledge generated and processes developed through the project's work will be broadly applicable to innovations beneficial to society, ranging from energy storage to biomedical technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The technique however is ineffective if a very small amount of the substance to be analyzed is available. This project aimed to develop methods to use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on confined fluids in nanoscale volumes. We approach this by developing method using nitrogen vacancy centers, a defect in diamond, to amplify the signal detected in NMR. In this project, a new method using a quickly changing magnetic field, is developed to amplify(hyperpolarize) the NMR signal of carbon inside of diamond.  We then try to track down the cause of this effect and observe a connection between a some popular branched of modern physics, namely many body systems and thermalization. We can track how the signal amplification mechanism works and how it moves from carbon atom to carbon atom in the diamond.  With a good understanding of these mechanisms, one can design schemes and engineer samples to allow for signal amplification of the NMR signal of nuclei outside of the diamond. This will allow the original goal of NMR analysis of very small nanoscale samples to be possible.  The research was performed at City College of New York, under the supervisory of Prof. Carlos Meriles. During this research I mentored incoming graduate student and undergraduate student, teaching them the basics of nuclear magnetic resonance, optics, and electronics.  The work resulted in four scientific publications, which are available free of charge on arxiv.org, and two scheduled presentation at the American Physical Society's March meetings in 2019, and 2020.  The research provided me with teaching opportunities, where I gave lectures for my supervisorâ€™s introduction to Quantum Mechanics class. While at the 2019 American Physical Society March Meeting, I arranged for an interview at Sandia National Lab. I am currently a postdoctoral appointee and Sandia National labs.  The CREST-PRF provided an opportunity for me to perform frontier research and provide research opportunities to the students of City College of New York, a minority college based in Harlem. It also provided me with the professional development skills needed to plan and prepare research with a budget.
