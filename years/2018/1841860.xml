<AbstractNarration>This award will provide financial support for US participants in the conference "Mathematical Physics at the Crossings" to be held at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), Blacksburg, VA, May 20-24, 2019.  The conference focuses on recent developments in many-body quantum systems. These systems are of high relevance for the realization of the goals of the Quantum Leap initiative. The meeting will add momentum to the process of developing mathematical knowledge about the many-body quantum systems, potentially facilitating building quantum devices for medical, navigational, computational or other practical purposes.  This award will give US-based students, early-career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without other sources of support an opportunity to attend and participate in the conference. Information about the conference can be found at: http://www.math.vt.edu/HagedornFest/index.html  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The international conference "Mathematical Physics at the Crossings" will gather researchers in mathematical physics, quantum information, and physics to discuss topics of current research regarding many-body quantum systems. The topics covered include adiabatic approximation with a focus on many-body quantum systems, many-body localization problems, molecular dynamics, and periodically driven quantum systems. Study of properties of interacting many-body quantum systems is one of the central problems in today condensed matter physics, and the available mathematical knowledge about this problem is minimal. The topic is also of significant interest for scholars working in areas of quantum information and quantum computation. This conference will bring together experts in the field and will expose graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to the latest research in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
