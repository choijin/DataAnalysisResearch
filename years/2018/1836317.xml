<AbstractNarration>Debates about the innateness of warfare to human society speak broadly to the inherent peacefulness or violence of human nature. Discussions in this vein naturally turn to the circumstances in which social complexity was first established within various world regions, seeking to assess the degree to which violent conflict was foundational to the process. Archaeological study provides the most robust means of studying these long-ago developments, particularly through the analysis of large-scale features, such as encircling walls and moats, that significantly altered the local landscape. This project led by doctoral student Justin Bracken, will investigate the dynamics of construction of such early features built by the Maya of Peten, Guatemala in the Late Preclassic period (400/300 BC - AD 150). To do so, the project uses traditional archaeological excavation and mapping techniques alongside innovative GIS analyses and spatial theory, offering new approaches to the study of the built environment. The fieldwork component will employ several Guatemalan university students and local residents. This arrangement furthers their understanding of the archaeological past of their home region while offering them valuable fieldwork experience, increasing their employability on other projects. The final results will be published as a dissertation and in academic journals, and also presented at conferences in the United States and Guatemala. They will serve to pinpoint the specific role played by warfare in the rise of complex societies and offer a new angle of insight into the increasingly nuanced understanding of Preclassic Maya developments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research design of the project is centered on the following question: What roles did cooperation and conflict respectively play in the initial spread of state-level society? The question is investigated by weighing the relative contributions of cooperative behavior (numerous individuals working in concert on a common project) and conflict (the long-term investment in defense that the fortifications represent). This approach does not presuppose a hierarchical arrangement in which an elite class compelled the labor of commoners; instead, it allows for cooperative action as the driving factor. Further, it assesses the multiple effects and levels of significance of the features beyond fortification, analyzing their functions as hydrological controls, social boundaries, and delineators of ceremonial space. The small site of Muralla de Len, which rests upon a natural rise surrounded on three sides by water, provides the setting for the study. With a stone perimeter wall encircling it and a canal bisecting the widest point of access by land, the site appears oriented toward defense. Occupation at the site dates at least back to the Late Preclassic period and likely earlier, with the site layout established early in its history. Excavations into and adjacent to the perimeter wall and canal will aim to establish a firm chronology of construction of each, demonstrating their form through time and their impact upon the flow of water and movements of individuals, thereby defining their impact upon the local and regional social settings in the era of early social complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project succeeded in determining the construction sequence and chronology of the monumental features at Muralla de Le?n. These features include a stone perimeter wall around the site, 1.50 km in circumference and up to 5.5 meters tall and 12 meters thick, as well as a bank-and-ditch feature, external to that perimeter wall, that cuts off the widest approach to the site by land. It furthermore established the defensive functionality of these features, based on their form and GIS analyses of movement and fortification. Third, occupational patterns across the history of settlement at Muralla de Leon were assessed, both within the site boundaries and across the northeast Lake Macanche basin more broadly.</p> <p>These results served to indicate that the initial form of the perimeter wall surrounding Muralla de Leon was established by about 200 B.C. in the Late Preclassic period, the time of establishment of widespread sociopolitical complexity in the region. From that initial form of the perimeter wall onward it functioned defensively, as determined by GIS analyses indicating its effect upon patterns of movement across the local landscape. Later augmentation of the height of the perimeter wall occurred in conjunction with construction of the bank-and-ditch feature in the Early Classic period, at some point from 420 A.D. to 555 A.D.</p> <p>Other excavations determined that the ceremonial locations within the site were in use by the Late Preclassic period, with an increase in activity in the Early Classic leading up to the greatest flourishing in the Late and Terminal Classic periods. Occupation across the broader northeast Macanche basin outside of Muralla de Leon was limited to one other shoreline architectural group in the Late Preclassic, where excavations uncovered a 1 meter high stone wall set atop bedrock and facing the approach by land. It was completely buried by a later expansion of the plaza. By the Late and Terminal Classic periods, occupation had expanded to several hilltop sites as well, possibly for better surveillance of the basin. These time periods also marked the construction of a series of cut bedrock channel-and-pool features within a natural drainage outside of Muralla de Leon to the northeast, an apparent ceremonial feature with no immediately adjacent structures or other evidence of nearby settlement.</p> <p>The occupation and construction dynamics in and around Muralla de Le?n during the Late Preclassic, as uncovered by the project, establish that warfare was a visible and explicit factor in the establishment of social and political complexity at the time. Furthermore, an energetics analysis of the final form of the perimeter wall indicated that it could have been constructed by the local population of the basin without the need to bring in workers from elsewhere. While this fact alone does not prove that an external force did not compel the construction effort, it allows for the possibility that local forces were able to arrange for and complete the perimeter wall. Participation in this construction effort and interacting daily with the finished product would have reshaped identities for members of the local populace, who would likely have sought refuge there as well in times of conflict. The presence of monumental fortifications at an occupied site in this early era also suggests that codes of conduct meant to limit the scope of conflict did not yet have widespread acceptance in the region.</p> <p>The results of the project offer unique insight into Preclassic Maya warfare at a small site, expanding on what is known of warfare at the time from larger sites in the Mirador Basin to the north and other sites like Cival. This insight offers important detail on the regional interactions taking place at the time, further contextualizing the Preclassic developments at sites like Nixtun-Ch'ich' to the west. The project was able to extract these data from Muralla de Leon before further looting activity and other destruction rendered it inaccessible. It also was able to train several workers from the Macanche community in excavation and mapping techniques, granting them access to their local heritage and enabling them to work on other archaeological projects in the region.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/28/2020<br>      Modified by: Justin&nbsp;Bracken</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1836317/1836317_10559630_1606515450134_Figure7-1aSiteMapWithGroups--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1836317/1836317_10559630_1606515450134_Figure7-1aSiteMapWithGroups--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Muralla de Leon Site Map"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1836317/1836317_10559630_1606515450134_Figure7-1aSiteMapWithGroups--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Muralla de Leon Site Map"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A site map of Muralla de Leon, showing its architectural groups, its setting between three bodies of water, and the monumental defensive features.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Justin Bracken</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Justin&nbsp;Bracken</div> <div class="imageTitle">Muralla de Leon Site Map</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1836317/1836317_10559630_1606515533074_Figure7-9aGroupsContour--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1836317/1836317_10559630_1606515533074_Figure7-9aGroupsContour--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Exterior Groups Mapped"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1836317/1836317_10559630_1606515533074_Figure7-9aGroupsContour--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Exterior Groups Mapped"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A map of all the exterior groups encountered and mapped by the project.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Justin Bracken</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Justin&nbsp;Bracken</div> <div class="imageTitle">Exterior Groups Mapped</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1836317/1836317_10559630_1606515933047_P7211281--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1836317/1836317_10559630_1606515933047_P7211281--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Excavation of the Bank-and-Ditch"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1836317/1836317_10559630_1606515933047_P7211281--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Excavation of the Bank-and-Ditch"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Workers excavating the bank-and-ditch feature along the southeast exterior of the site.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Justin Bracken</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Justin&nbsp;Bracken</div> <div class="imageTitle">Excavation of the Bank-and-Ditch</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1836317/1836317_10559630_1606516119068_P7302034--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1836317/1836317_10559630_1606516119068_P7302034--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Interpreting a Looters Trench"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1836317/1836317_10559630_1606516119068_P7302034--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Interpreting a Looters Trench"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Omar Schwendener debates the construction history of the main temple at Muralla de Leon with the co-PI.
