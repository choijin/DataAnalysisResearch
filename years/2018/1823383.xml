<AbstractNarration>As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative research, approaches and resources for use in a variety of settings. A frequently overlooked but significantly under-represented STEM audience is people who live in rural settings. The proposed conference is the first of its kind to bring together key innovators and experts in rural Informal STEM education, to address this question: How can we build on recent innovations to create more effective and scalable pathways for informal STEM learning in rural communities?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will focus primarily on advancing informal STEM education for rural youth, but will also include some participants who cross boundaries, to situate the work in an ecosystem perspective: informal-formal education, childhood-adult education, rural ecosystems and economic drivers for STEM related jobs. The provisional list of topics will be refined through a pre-conference survey of participants, and will be followed with a report that includes survey responses, conference discussion, and final recommendations by participants. The conference will be held in Washington D.C. to enable policymakers to attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Rural Informal STEM Conference  A small conference grant from NSF supported a Rural Informal STEM Conference that was held on September 13?14, 2018. It was the first of its kind to bring together key innovators and experts in rural STEM learning outside of school. People who live in rural settings are a frequently overlooked and significantly under-represented STEM audience, who number roughly 60 million Americans.  The conference addressed questions about the overall status of informal (out of school) STEM learning in rural places, including the following: How do we define rural places? What are promising practices in diversity, equity, and inclusion in these places? How can STEM programs build community support for their work? How can such programs assess their impacts appropriately?  Key findings, as interpreted by the conference leaders, included:  1) There are myriad definitions of rural places, even within a single state or federal agency. This reflects a vast diversity of characteristics; rural places are not all the same. Rural residents are likewise very diverse, and self-identify in a variety of ways in relation to the term ?rural?; for some people the term carries negative connotations as an imposed label.  2) Building community support is likely to be a multi-year process of trust-building and co-design. It is best to avoid a ?savior mentality? by listening to what communities want and are already doing, and building on that as much as possible. Helping communities and local businesses to see the STEM already in their work can make STEM career opportunities and pathways be seen as attractive and achievable.  Programs may require a timeline that is beyond the usual grant period of 3 to 5 years.  3) Promising practices in equity and inclusion include: expecting that people in rural places will self-identify in multiple ways so that a ?community? may not be as simple as a geographical town or municipality; seeing STEM knowledge and learning opportunities in everyday activities and occupations within communities; and giving communities a significant degree of control as programs are implemented. STEM programs are likely to gain more community support if they involve not just youth but families, community members, schools, and industry in STEM programs. Also, it is important to know how a community may view people ?from away,? and to recognize that a STEM-based career may involve a wrenching move away from a rural home community.  4) Assessing impacts is an ongoing challenge, especially given that numbers of people reached can never be competitive with urban areas, no matter how effective a program is. Often programs are funded based on ?per person? costs, but these will always be biased toward high-density communities, putting less densely populated and rural areas at a disadvantage. Qualitative methods and storytelling hold particular promise for assessing impacts of STEM education programs in rural places.  These insights were shared at a series of webinars and forums, which also attracted members of the formal STEM education world, helping bridge between formal and informal STEM education.  The final report and dissemination materials will be a useful resource for practitioners interested in STEM education in rural places, and in particular future NSF-funded awardees who want to work in such places as part of their efforts to broaden participation.     The final report and related materials may be found at www.mmsa.org/RuralConference2018.          Last Modified: 11/15/2019       Submitted by: Sue Allen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
