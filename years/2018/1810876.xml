<AbstractNarration>This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) will support a collaborative team of researchers from five U.S. universities to collect data to document the performance of reinforced concrete buildings during the Puebla-Morelos, Mexico earthquake of September 19, 2017.  The ground shaking from this earthquake caused widespread damage to buildings in the epicentral region, as well as in Mexico City (approximately 120 kilometers from the epicenter). In Mexico City, approximately 40 buildings collapsed, and over one thousand structures have been identified with moderate to major structural damage.  The 2017 earthquake, having impacted an area that had already been shaken by a strong earthquake in 1985, provides an opportunity to learn about the effectiveness of reinforced concrete building repairs and retrofits made after the 1985 earthquake, as well as an opportunity to study how modern and older, unrepaired reinforced concrete buildings performed during strong ground motion. The majority of collapsed buildings were constructed prior to 1985 before there were major seismic revisions to building codes.  There were also a few cases of newer and retrofitted buildings that also sustained damage.  Mexico City has soil conditions ranging from stiff rock to very soft soil, producing a diverse set of ground conditions affecting buildings that can facilitate understanding of seismic building performance not only in Mexico, but also in the United States.  Because the United States and Mexico have similarities in reinforced concrete building construction, the collected data from this earthquake will contribute to better building design and performance assessment methods, numerical simulation methods, and earthquake intensity indices in both countries, and help foster safer buildings and more earthquake-resilient communities.  The collected data will be archived and made publicly available in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure, Data Depot and Reconnaissance Integration Portal (http://wwww.DesignSafe-ci.org).  Graduate students will participate in the data collection and gain valuable post-earthquake field experience.  The project team will disseminate its data collection and research findings through a webinar.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this RAPID project is to collect perishable data on reinforced concrete building damage that can be used towards understanding and improving seismic performance of buildings and the resilience of communities in the United States. The data collection in Mexico will be conducted in collaboration with researchers and engineers in Mexico and include the following activities: (1) survey buildings built near recording stations with emphasis on retrofitted buildings, buildings that survived the 1985 earthquake, and modern buildings, (2) document damage to non-ductile reinforced concrete buildings for calibration of existing methodologies used to identify vulnerable buildings in the United States, (3) map damage to test commonly assumed correlations with earthquake intensity indices such as peak ground acceleration, peak ground velocity, peak ground displacement, and peak or discrete spectral values of acceleration, velocity and displacement, (4) document the performance of instrumented and base-isolated buildings, (5) deploy accelerometers on damaged and undamaged reinforced concrete buildings with and without retrofits to record ambient vibrations and obtain building dynamic properties, (6) evaluate numerical models of reinforced concrete buildings by subjecting them to ground motion records obtained nearby and compare the numerical estimates and observed performance, and (7) study relationships between building performance and soil conditions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over 2000 buildings were surveyed by Colegio de Ingenieros (CICM) and the Mexican Society of Structural Engineers (SMIE) in Mexico City following the Puebla-Morelos Earthquake.  Building information including location, number of stories, and damage to structural and non-structural components was shared with the research team.  CICM, SMIE, and the Mexican Society of Geotechnical Engineering (SMIG) provided information about geotechnical zones and ground motion records from over 70 stations across the city.  Based on this information, the members of the collaborative research team and additional individuals deployed to conduct reconnaissance between October 20th and November 4th.  Approximately 110 buildings were surveyed during this period.  Also during this period, as well as from January 26th through 31st, the team instrumented 13 buildings to collect ambient vibration data.  Those buildings were selected based on damage level, permission to access the buildings, and the existence and availability of design drawings.  Ambient vibration data, which were collected using two sets of instruments, were used to infer fundamental periods for the 13 structures.  Those periods are presented for the stiff direction (perpendicular to the street) and flexible direction (parallel to the street) in Fig. 1 for the 13 structures.  The buildings typically had very different stiffness in the two principal directions because the buildings contained long, continuous brick infill walls in the direction perpendicular to the street, which substantially increased stiffness in that direction.  Based on the ambient vibration data, which provided fairly consistent periods for the 2 to 15-story buildings (approximately N/8 for the more flexible direction, and N/12 for the stiffer direction), the team investigated the correlation of estimated periods for the inventory of collapsed buildings with predominant ground motion periods, geotechnical conditions (zones), and ground motion intensities.  Unlike the 19 September 1985 Michoacan Earthquake, there was no clear relationship between estimated periods (or heights) of collapsed buildings and ground motion periods.  For the 2017 Puebla-Morelos Earthquake, most damage occurred in a narrow N-S geographic band that encompasses three geotechnical (or seismic) zones (Zona Geotecnica II, IIIa and IIIb) located between rock formations on the west side of the city and the deeper clay deposits in the lakebed region.  Severe damage was concentrated where more flexible (taller) RC frames and high ground-motion intensity coincided (see Fig. 2), which emphasizes indirectly the relevance of drift demand (because PGV has been reported to correlate well with drift demand).  The longitudinal values shown in Fig. 2 correspond with the narrow geographic band mentioned above.       Last Modified: 06/16/2020       Submitted by: Michael Kreger]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
