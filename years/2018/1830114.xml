<AbstractNarration>This is funding to support participation by about 10 U.S. graduate students and 5 senior mentors in the Doctoral Colloquium workshop held in conjunction with the 2018 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW 2018), which will be held in Jersey City, New Jersey, USA on November 3-7, 2018. The annual CSCW conference is a leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research, design and practice of collaboration, collaborative systems and social computing. The goals of the workshop are to provide feedback and advice on current research and future careers to students who are nearing graduation; to foster creativity, communication, and collaboration across diverse topics of interest in CSCW; and to build a cohort of leading student social computing researchers. The organizers will make a particular effort to reach students from groups traditionally underrepresented in CSCW (and more broadly computer and information science and engineering) in order to broaden the impact of the workshop.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The workshop will take place November 3-4, 2018 with follow-up events during the conference's main technical program. Participants will be recruited with a wide net, with an emphasis on broadening participation and diversity of institutions, topics, and fields (including but not limited to  from a variety of fields such as computer science/engineering, information science, psychology, cognitive science, and social psychology). The format includes oral and poster presentations by student attendees, a hands-on breakout session, a panel discussion, and an informal dinner and one-on-one conversations with mentors. This format enables students to share and receive feedback on their research while learning from senior and junior researchers in the field.  Workshop participants will also gain knowledge of current research conducted by their colleagues, awareness of diverse interdisciplinary methodologies, and an understanding of emerging themes in CSCW.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

On Day 1 (November 3), a meet-and-greet dinner for students and mentors was held. Day 2 (November 4) consisted of a full day of activities (9am-to-6pm). In the morning, each student gave a 15-minute presentations on their work and received feedback from other students and mentors. (Prior to the workshop each mentor was &ldquo;assigned&rdquo; to five students and was directed to read that students&rsquo; materials &mdash; i.e. a research proposal and personal statement &mdash; to prepare to give detailed feedback to their assigned students). In the afternoon, there were two rounds of small group discussions and feedback, where 2-3 students met with an assigned mentor to talk in more depth about their work and career goals.

The CSCW DC was held November 3-4, 2018 in Jersey City, New Jersey. It included fifteen advanced PhD students in CSCW and related fields along with six mentors from the CSCW community (including both junior and senior researchers from industry and academia).    The purpose of the workshop was to convene a diverse set of researchers to provide research mentorship, networking, and career advice to advanced PhD students at or near the proposal stage of their dissertation.    Participants: We received a record number of applications (47) and selected 15 students to attend. Twelve were students from U.S. universities. These students received financial assistance from this grant to attend the Doctoral Consortium. To provide diverse perspectives on both current research and career opportunities, we included three international students who were able to fund their attendance from other sources.

In the afternoon, there were two rounds of small group discussions and feedback, where 2-3 students met with an assigned mentor to talk in more depth about their work and career goals. In a final, early evening session, mentors participated in a Q&amp;A session where the students were encouraged to ask questions about faculty life, job searching, and other topics related to research careers in CSCW.    Participant Evaluation: Several weeks after the event, we followed up with a survey that asked the student-participants to reflect upon their experiences at the doctoral colloquium. The participants were asked several questions, most on a 5-point likert scale, between "excellent" (1) and "poor" (5). We also provided some open-ended questions that allowed them to provide more nuanced feedback.    The results from the feedback survey were overwhelmingly positive.

In the open-ended questions, two student participants added that the feedback on their research from diverse peers and faculty was the thing they most appreciated about the event. One student explained, "detailed feedback from others which happens rarely outside of the circle of your own research group. I liked how the mentors had read the statements and were able to give detailed feedback."    Two students provided additional comments that highlighted their enthusiasm about their CSCW DC experience:    "This was one of the best experiences I had at a conference, so thank you!!"    "This was an amazing experience. Everyone was incredibly welcoming and made my first experience in CSCW community a great one."    Other feedback (via email and in person conversations) suggested that students found the DC to be extremely valuable in terms of 1) receiving feedback on their research from outside their home research environment; and 2) developing peer and mentor relationships within the CSCW community.    As a final point and underscoring the value of NSF?s investment in this event, 1/3 of student survey respondents noted that they would not have been able to attend the 2018 CSCW Doctoral Colloquium without the financial assistance provided by the National Science Foundation.
