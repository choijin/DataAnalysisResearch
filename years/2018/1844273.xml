<AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation award provides support for the first Upstate New York Topology Seminar (UNYTS) that will take place at the University at Albany, State University of New York, on Saturday and Sunday, November 10-11, 2018. The state of New York is home to one of the largest collections of colleges and universities in the country, and many of these institutions in upstate New York are just far enough apart to make regular and sustained interactions between departments with active topology programs difficult. In recent years, a number of promising early-career topologists have started tenure-track positions in these departments. This, coupled with the phenomenal recent growth in applications of topology, creates the potential for bringing many new researchers into topological fields and producing significant ground-breaking work. With this award, the principle investigators seek to foster the development of newcomers to topology and increase the level of interaction among all researchers in topology in upstate New York by creating an annual series of weekend conferences. These conferences will highlight work done by New York topologists, and will also provide New York topologists with the opportunity to interact with each other and with established and emerging leaders in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will feature eight 45-minute plenary lectures accessible to an audience of algebraic, applied, and geometric topologists. The speakers are chosen so that participants will have the opportunity to learn about recent work in a wide range of fields within topology. Question and answer sessions following the talks will enable participants to engage in productive conversations with both the speakers and other attendees. Ample breaks along with conference breakfasts and a dinner will catalyze interactions between speakers and participants and encourage informal exchanges of ideas. The conference website may be found at https://www.albany.edu/~mv312143/unyts/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
