<AbstractNarration>Societies depend on insurance to help recover from natural disasters, and also to help guide the development of resilient infrastructure and markets. However, decision makers in the insurance industry are faced with rising climate risks, which must be properly measured and managed. Changes in the frequency or severity of hurricanes, floods, intense precipitation, droughts, wind storms, and other rare but influential natural events can massively impact total insured losses. Also, climate can lead to changes in human health through shifting exposures to heat or drought, changing air quality, and shifts towards more favorable conditions for disease. This workshop addresses how climate risks can be better measured and managed by the insurance industry. Specifically, this workshop facilitates a national, interdisciplinary scientific research discussion on modeling and managing climate risks among three different but related research communities: the climate modeling and data community, statisticians, and researchers within the insurance and reinsurance industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop aims at active scientific researchers in each community, with the goals of: sharing perspectives, methods, and databases; defining gaps of existing research; and forming actionable research paths which can only be addressed by teams which are new, collaborative and interdisciplinary. Topics discussed include: time scales for decision making and available data products; sources of uncertainty in climate data products; statements of "ideal" climate datasets and model projections from the perspectives of all research communities; extreme events as both a statistical challenge and a primary driver of losses in insurance and reinsurance; sub-grid cell phenomena such as hurricanes; and data-fusion of historical weather data products, climate model output, and insurance loss databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On November 8 and 9, 2018 in Asheville, NC, fifty-seven active  researchers gathered for a two day workshop titled "The Nexus of Climate  Data, Insurance, and Adaptive Capacity" to discuss the intersection of  these three research communities, and  to develop actionable research  paths forward for the insurance industry  to lead with climate  adaptation.  After hearing from eleven experts working areas across this  spectrum, the participants formed four breakout discussion groups to  address different  topics raised in the talks. The chosen topics were 1)  how to build a  better flood map, 2) the use of climate model  projections for insurance,  3) climate mitigation and adaptation, and 4)  high-impact possibilities  that was warmly named "What keeps you up at  night?"  The workshop listed several  potential "next-generation"  improvements to Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood maps,  with the aim  to improve rather than criticize current practices.  These  include:  moving binary measures to probabilistic measures;  incorporating land use  and projected land use into flood maps; moving  to smoother, finer-scale maps that  avoid sharp discontinuities leading  close neighbors to be treated very differently; and how commercial  insurance could be the  better venue for innovation led by the private  sector.  The group identified how the insurance industry could make better use of climate model projections for the next few decades.   Large scale extreme events like  Hurricane Harvey have tremendous  impacts on the industry as drivers of major loss.  Restating these   risks under hypothetical future climates would be a valuable planning   tool for industry.  Workshop participants discussed in great detail  how many of the costs  of climate inaction are borne by the insurance  and reinsurance  industry, and how the insurance industry therefore has a  strong leadership role to play with bringing society towards greater  climate adaptation and climate resilience.  All workshop findings  were published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.   At least one new research team was formed at the workshop itself.  That  team is now researching how climate change impacts flood risk, with  insurance industry assistance from the Casualty Actuarial Society.
