<AbstractNarration>This proposal supports eight students for their travel to attend the Association for Computing Machinery International Workshop on Security in Software Defined Networks &amp; Network Function Virtualization (SDN-NFV Security), to be held in Tempe, Arizona, USA, on March 21, 2018. SDN and NFV are two emerging networking paradigms, which introduce significant granularity, visibility, flexibility and elasticity to networking, but at the same time bring forth new security challenges. SDN-NFV Security is a leading international forum for university researchers, scientists, and industry professionals for new theories and technologies related to security challenges in SDN and NFV. Participation in workshops like SDN-NFV is an extremely important part of graduate students' research and career development, providing the opportunity for them to present their own work, attend panel and keynote speech sessions, interact with peers and senior researchers, and gain exposure to leading edge research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
