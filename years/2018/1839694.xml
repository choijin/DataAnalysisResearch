<AbstractNarration>Wei Yang of Florida State University is supported by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program in the Division of Chemistry to study biomolecular systems at biological timescales. Protein folding commonly occurs at timescales ranging from hundreds of microseconds to milliseconds and even seconds. This range presents a challenge to conventional computer simulation methods that seek to provide a quantitative description of changes on a long timescale. Only a few calculations of up to the one millisecond timescale have been reported to date. These calculations have been hindered by the lack of appropriate computational methods. Professor Yang is addressing this challenge by providing rigorous, physically-motivated mechanisms in his computational methods.  The outcome of this research may improve our ability to perform practical sampling of biomolecular motions at biological timescales.  These timescales have relevance in biochemical and biophysical processes such as protein folding (important in Alzheimer's disease and others) and pharmaceutical drug design. The new algorithms and codes are being disseminated through community-based platforms.  The researchers are also holding an annual workshop hosted at Florida State University.  The computational methods may be used by the pharmaceutical industry to discover new drug binding sites and new treatments for human health. This project has the potential to advance the health and welfare of society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is addressing the "hidden barrier" challenge that has been the bottleneck for free energy sampling of biomolecular dynamics, by realizing novel developments that qualitatively extend Professor Yang's orthogonal space sampling (OSS) framework and algorithms.  Specific aims of this project include the development of an adaptive strategy to dynamically modify the OSS Hamiltonian and associated biasing potentials during the course of a simulation.  The research group also implements higher-order biasing functions, where a higher-order biasing term can accelerate energy flow to the next lower order term in a chained relationship. Both strategies are designed to improve dynamical coupling and energy flow between the environment (orthogonal space) and the natural collective coordinate of the system, and synchronize global structural relaxation with the evolution of the collective coordinate. The new methodology is being assessed through applications to long-timescale protein conformational dynamics for biologically-important proteins that have been experimentally characterized, including adenylate kinase, beta-2-adrenergic receptor; HIV protease; and human glucokinase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The major goals of the project are to  deveop a powerful high-order orthogonal space tempering (HOOST)  molecular dynamics sampling method to enable feasible simulation of  long-timescale biomolecular dynamics.   The major activities lies in (a)  development of a mathematical framework and the corresponding  algorithmic implementation of the new adaptive dynamic reporter (ADR)  kernal method (b) using the ADR to develop a powerful high-order  orthogonal space tempering technique for efficient sampling of  long-timescale molecular dynamics. These development are primarily based  on the CHARMM-DOMDEC GPU platform.  The specific objectives of the  project are to (a) enable the  development of a novel adaptive free  energy sampling method that can be  employed as the kernel for feasible  orthogonal space sampling and (b)  further to realize a robust and  effective high-order orthogonal space  tempering implementation based on  the new adaptive recursion kernel.  This project has led to the following results:  (1) The adaptive dynamic reporting (ADR) method was successfully accomplished.  (2) The ADR method was successfully developed for high-dimension treatment.  (3) The final calibration treatment for the complete development of HOOST is partially realized.  In summary, the challenging HOOST method was almost completely developed. This method will lead to a leap-frog change for molecular dynamics sampling.     The algorithmic details and the assorted application studies will be soon submitted for publication.   The implemented methods will be disseminated through major community softwares.
