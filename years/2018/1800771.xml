The Shadow Program Committee is a professional development activity that models the scientific peer review process associated with the conference, with oversight from senior mentors that provide feedback on the quality of peer review and the conduct of the shadow PC meeting. Being on the shadow program committee is an excellent opportunity for systems researchers (PhD students, post-docs and new faculty members) to get experience in community service, i.e., program committee practices.  Shadow PC members attended a one-day shadow program committee meeting in person, which coincided with the official program committee meeting location.  This fund provide travel support to allow delegates to attend the Shadow PC meeting.     The travel grant provided support for 19 individuals to attend the Shadow PC meeting.  The attendees included 12 graduate students, 2 industrial researchers, 3 post-docs, and 2 new faculty members.  The affiliations of the funded attendees include Carnegie Mellon U., Stony Brook, Intel, Cornell, U. Washington, U. MA - Lowell, U. MA - Amherst, UT Austin, U. MI - Ann Arbor, ETH Zurich, Microsoft, Kemerburgaz U., Princeton, NC State, UPC Barcelona, Nat. Tech. U. Athens, and IBM.  Preference in allocating funding was given to members of groups traditionally under-represented at ASPLOS.  5 of the 19 funded attendees were women and 1 attendee was hispanic.
