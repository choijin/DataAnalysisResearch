<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is that it provides unique secure, tamper resistant record keeping and logging services that leverage blockchain technology for a wide range of IoT applications. The solution will provide significant benefits in terms of performance, cost (e.g., total ownership cost), cyber attack resilience, security and privacy assurance for both IoT device owners, operators, and industries utilizing IoT technology such as transportation, smart city, logistics, supply chain management, manufacture, energy, critical infrastructures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a scalable auditing, record keeping, and logging system for internal/external operations and data interactions of IoT devices, which are fundamental components to support other critical properties and operations of IoT enabled infrastructures. The record keeping and logging system solves several critical challenges in distributed IoT environment: transaction ordering and data distribution. In addition, the logging and transactional system can be the centric component for producer-consumer style applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Data management and data sharing are among the essential needs of IoT environments.  It is well recognized that the value of IoTs lies in the data and advanced IoT data analytics that may bring revolutionary changes in industries such as healthcare, manufacture, transportation, sustainability, agriculture, facility management, etc. As the number of IoT devices is expected to grow to $50Billon by 2020, there are growing demands from the market for new solutions that can address the pain in data management, data coordination, and data sharing.  Our research and investigation suggest that consortium distributed ledger has its own value and commercial advantages different from public blockchain and centralized system. The new model may allow deep integration of business value chain among stakeholders, which may overcome data sharing barriers.  Based on requirement analysis and literature survey, a system architecture for IoT data management and data sharing was designed and evaluated. The system is designed to meet the following characteristics: (i) cost reduction for IoT data owners by optimizing data transfer and data storage in multi and heterogeneous service provider environment; (ii) auditable data sharing using distributed ledger and secret sharing; (iii) consortium friendly design that facilitates creation of data sharing alliance by stakeholders; and (iv) scalable performance applying divide and conquer of smart contract execution (smart contract sharding).   Evaluation and modeling studies based on standard blockchain tools and platforms indicate: effectiveness of cost optimization for data transfer and data storage in heterogeneous service provider environment; scalable performance of smart contract sharding to support data management for large number of IoT devices and hubs.   The project explores the import computing question of how distributed systems can handle the device and data management needs of large number of IoT devices, meanwhile provide the highest level of assurance on security and data integrity. Specially, it is breaking ground in the design that applies divide and conquer for implementing the control plane for IoTs that can support scalability in managing IoT devices and data sharing. The efforts represent a step forward to provide an IoT data management and data sharing platform for stakeholders to collaborate together and unleash the power of IoT data for the benefits and wellbeing of human societies.
