<AbstractNarration>The objective of this collaborative research project is to develop a novel Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) imaging system which can simultaneously image multiple areas of brain including deep brain structures in behaving animals. This will enable, for the first time, chronic imaging of fast neural activity for deep brain structures and neuronal networks with spatio-temporal resolution of 1 ms and 100 micrometer. The PIs will validate it in a neuronal network in deep limbic and brainstem structures, but once developed it could be used anywhere in the brain. This EIT imaging technology for fast neural activity could lead to radical advances in understanding brain function and enable quantitative mathematical modeling and analysis of neural systems. This could aid the development of new treatment for neurological disorders like schizophrenia, depression and epilepsy, as well as advancing cognitive and computational neuroscience. This interdisciplinary research project will also enhance research capacity and promote the participation of underrepresented minority (URM) students in STEM education. Overall, this project will implement new technology and approaches that support our goal of increasing the participation and contributions of URM populations in neural engineering and in STEM, in general. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Functional neural imaging is critically important to determine the group cellular events that are associated with the local neuro-physiological changes in neural networks. Recent functional neural imaging technologies have allowed the exploration of the brain at the cell-biological level for the understanding of the mechanisms of mentation and brain diseases. Despite various advances, no current neural imaging technologies meet the spatio-temporal resolution and imaging coverage required to measure functional connectivity and information processing across and between cortical and deep brain structures in behaving animals. The proposed system can perform functional imaging of group activity involved in functional networks. If successful, these efforts will produce a platform that will enhance fundamental understanding of underlying mechanisms in neuroscience. It is expected that the system to be developed can assess neural activity in various nodes of functional networks thereby bridging the gap between global process and individual cell activities and substantially extend our ability to probe functional networks in the brain. This project will address the challenges to the national competitiveness and sustained STEM global leadership that can be better met through the full utilization of all of the nation's talent and resources. Improving the state of diversity and inclusion in science and engineering will allow the full benefit of a well-educated and scientifically literate population in HBCUs. STEM and neural engineering research and education will prepare our URM students for the next generation of technology and will meet the strong demand from industry for a well-prepared work force and leaders equipped with the necessary scientific understanding of advanced technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
