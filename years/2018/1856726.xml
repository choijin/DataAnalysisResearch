<AbstractNarration>The invention of the Atomic Force Microscope and Optical Traps about 30 years ago started a revolution in many branches of science by realizing an unprecedented possibility to visualize and mechanically manipulate individual molecules under ambient conditions including water, which is critical for most studies involving bio-molecules and living cells. These inventions created a new and rapidly growing field of single-molecule force spectroscopy that over the years has produced many seminal discoveries about how biological macromolecules respond to mechanical forces and how external forces may alter the course of biochemical reactions. Thus, a review of these major accomplishments, as well as identifying most promising new research objectives while discussing current methodological limitations and weaknesses in the form of a scientific workshop is long overdue. The purpose of this conference is to bring together about 40-50 participants including leading force spectroscopy experts. The organizers plan to include as participants postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students to collectively work on needed methodological improvements and to identify the most promising and exciting research opportunities and to initiate collaborative endeavors in the single-molecule force spectroscopy field.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will put strong emphasis on the synergy between multiple single molecule experimental and computational techniques.  In addition to the comprehensive discussions of variety of single molecule experimental techniques and current roadblocks, the workshop will also emphasize on prospects of measurements in situ and in vivo for all the techniques. The workshop will include two round table discussions on technical aspects of the methodologies that involve discussion of current attachments methods to surfaces and sensors as well as discussion of resolution limits, precision of measurements and fore sensor fabrication and calibration issues.  This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Workshop products include  a)    a detailed meeting report submitted to the National Science Foundation,  b)    a workshop program booklet including workshop agenda and all abstracts,  c)    a dedicated workshop website with linked workshop documents such as roundtable discussion presentations on molecular attachments, SMFS technical limitations and a compilation of the literature devoted to various methods for robust covalent and noncovalent molecular handles for SMFS,  d)    a report meeting manuscript to be published by the Journal of Cell Science     This Workshop directly contributed to the professional development of a new generation of SMFS researchers including four young PIs, a group of postdocs (5 participants) and PhD students (6 participants) and 2 undergraduate students by giving them a unique opportunity to experience lectures at the highest professional level given by the leaders of the field, by participating in workshop roundtable discussions and the poster session, and through direct contacts and conversations.   The workshop will likely have an impact on Atomic Force Microscope, optical tweezers and magnetic tweezers instrument development due to numerous examples of novel technical advancements presented by several PIs and industrial partners.     The methodological improvements related to new approaches for attachments of molecules to surfaces and those allowing an increase in measurements resolution, e.g. through probe miniaturization, will likely impact the broader area of the study of the physical principles governing biomolecular systems (Molecular Biophysics), where these methodologies are also essential.
