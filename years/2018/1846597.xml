<AbstractNarration>This 2-year planning grant enables the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, United Negro College Fund, and Thurgood Marshall College Fund to develop a national Historically Black Colleges and Universities focused effort to broaden participation in computer and information science.  This project develops a framework for achieving the following key objectives: 1) Increase the number and yield of bachelor's degrees Historically Black Colleges and Universities award in computer and information science and related fields, 2) Increase the readiness of Historically Black Colleges and Universities' science, technology, engineering and math graduates for tech workforce and tech job creation, 3) Increase the number of African American computer and information science doctoral students at all U.S. doctoral programs from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (undergrad degree), and 4) Increase the institutional capacity - including research and development - of Historically Black Colleges and Universities to achieve the above stated goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The following are recommendations for a strategy to build a framework for realizing the potential of HBCUs in innovation, commercialization, and entrepreneurship.  Sharing Knowledge - HBCUs greatest asset is each      other. Participants all agreed on the exponential value of coming together      and learning from one another.  To facilitate this shared learning across the sector,       APLU, UNCF, and the 1890 Foundation have launched efforts to create an       HBCU-wide resource center for sharing best practices and innovative       approaches to tech entrepreneurship.  Sharing Resources - Maximizing the HBCU      community’s assets requires sharing resources, i.e., funding, research      expertise, intellectual property, as well as staff, faculty, and students. Establishing       an HBCU-wide hub that would have knowledge of all the research and       sponsored programs on HBCU campuses nation-wide and therefore be able to       aggregate assets to take advantage of opportunities such as federal       grants or philanthropic gifts.   Creating a Culture of Innovation, Research, and      Entrepreneurship:         Innovative Leadership - HBCU leaders could benefit from the technology       start-up approach.         Innovative Faculty -HBCUs can       create consortia to share existing faculty across campuses to reduce       teaching loads and provide faculty with more time for research.  Innovative Students - students should be trained not just to work at leading       tech companies, but to start ones of their own. Innovative Structures - HBCUs must dismantle current structures that maintain       siloes. A robust ecosystem serves the entire campus as well as the       broader community and therefore requires connection and collaboration       across traditional lines of division.
