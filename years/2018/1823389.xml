<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) supports conferences that seek to increase the research capacity of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students and faculty at HBCUs.  Texas Southern University will host a Conference on Invitation to Mathematics at Texas Southern University on September 8-9, 2018. About forty faculty and students from Prairie View A&amp;M University and Texas Southern University will attend this conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the activities of this conference, undergraduate students will be exposed to mathematics research and techniques and gain a perspective on relations between mathematics and and other fields of science. Areas of mathematics to be discussed are: statistics, operations research, mathematical biology, and algebra. The conference will consist of research talks by mathematicians, a poster session for students, and a panel discussion with researchers and representatives from industry. The conference is to bring together scholars, researchers, educators, students and professionals. A key objective is to provide undergraduate students the opportunity to interact with a group of researchers and to learn about research and career opportunities in various fields of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The department of Mathematics at the Texas Southern University held an "Invitation to Mathematics" conference on 9/22/2018-9/23/2018.   The goals of the conference were to  (1)    introduce undergraduates to the research world of mathematics;  (2)    encourage students from underrepresented minority groups to pursue Ph.D programs in Mathematics and Mathematical Sciences;   (3)     show career paths possible with a math degree; and   (4)     provide an opportunity for undergraduates and graduates from underrepresented minority groups to interact with their peers from other institutions.  The conference consisted of a list of research talks, a poster session, and a panel discussion session.  The invited speakers and panelists were Illya V. Hicks (Rice University), Folefac Atem (University of Texas), Jianzhong Su (University of Texas at Arlington), Christina Eubanks-Turner (Loyola Marymount University), Talitha Washington (Howard University), Ken W. Smith (Sam Houston State University), Mark Tomforde (University of Houston), Natalia Hritonenko (Prairie View A&amp;M), Pamela Denkins (NASA) and Paulette N. Willis (Kumon).  The conference was well attended and received. Over 90 students and faculties from many universities attended the conference.  Participants included faculty and students from TSU, Prairie View A&amp;M, Sam Houston State University, University of Houston, University of Houston Downtown, University of St. Thomas, Southern University at New Orleans, Tennessee State University, University of Texas at Arlington, University of Iowa, Arizona State University and Nigerian Defense Academy.  It is generally hard to give a research talk that is accessible to undergraduates. Our invited speakers put in great effort to make this happen: all talks were informative and interesting to both students and faculty, even bringing out lots of laughter from the audience. The talks have exposed students to a wide range of mathematical fields including mathematical biology, computational neuroscience, optimization, graph theory, Algebra, and Statistics. Students reacted well to these talks with one comment "I didn't know math could be so fun. I hope my son can listen to these talks as well".  Faculty audiences have also expressed great satisfaction about the conference. One of our senior colleagues Dr. Robert Nehs said he attended all talks because they were all interesting to him, even though he only planned to attend a few.   Students were provided opportunities to interact with their peers and faculties over the poster session, lunch, dinners and panel session.  Undergraduate participants had the chance to consult graduate participants and faculty about graduate school. The panelists also gave a great overview of what graduate school looks like, and what scholarships are available and so on.  The conference successfully attracted students from underrepresented minority groups, exposed them to the wide range of mathematics and its applications, provided them with a platform to interact with their peers and faculties and inspired them to pursue graduate degrees. Hence, our conference has created opportunities to attract more students from underrepresented minority groups to pursue mathematics.
