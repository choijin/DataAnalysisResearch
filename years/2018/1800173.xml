<AbstractNarration>The starting materials for the chemical industry are hydrocarbons derived from fossil sources (primarily natural gas and petroleum), which must be chemically converted into higher value materials. The chemical industry's energy consumption for these process is substantial and accounts for approximately 10% of total global energy use and greater than 5% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Thus, while there are opportunities to dramatically increase the energy efficiency of large-scale chemical processes, there are also substantial scientific challenges to realizing this goal. In this project, T. Brent Gunnoe of the University of Virginia is developing a better understanding of how to perform selective and energy efficient chemical conversions that are essential to the goal of using natural gas and other fossil resources in a more environmentally benign manner. The project is a foundation for Professor Gunnoe to work with primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) to develop a program to increase interest among students from diverse backgrounds in careers as scientists and engineers, especially in the energy arena. In this program, graduate students visit PUIs to deliver short courses based on their research, and undergraduate students participate in summer research internships in Professor Gunnoe's laboratory. This project impacts the chemical industry both in terms of sustainable innovation and workforce development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Gunnoe is developing new catalysts based on rhodium (Rh), iridium (Ir) and copper (Cu) for the functionalization of carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds of hydrocarbons. A primary focus is how to combine transition metal mediated C-H activation and reductive functionalization of metal-hydrocarbyl ligands into catalytic cycles. Both transformations must be accessed under oxidizing conditions, which requires design of ligands to control the thermodynamics of metal-based redox chemistry. The outcome of these efforts is to access new catalysts that use air recyclable oxidants, thus enabling new catalytic processes for net aerobic oxidation of hydrocarbons. The proposed chemistry builds on three primary developments, based on combined experimental and computational studies.  The development of ligand designs that optimize Rh- and Ir-mediated C-H activation in acidic solvents is investigated along with the development of ligand motifs that optimize reductive functionalization of RhIII-Me and IrIII-Me bonds to form Rh(I) and Ir(I) and MeX in acidic solvents (HX).  The investigators also examine the use of Cu(II) mediated arene functionalization by a non-free radical pathway. The project is a foundation for Professor Gunnoe to work with primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) to develop a program to increase interest among students from diverse backgrounds in careers as scientists and engineers, especially in the energy arena. In this program, graduate students visit PUIs to deliver short courses based on their research, and undergraduate students participate in summer research internships in Professor Gunnoe's laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
