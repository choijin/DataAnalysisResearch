<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for Dr. Michael Kohl and his group at Hampton University, a Historically Black College und University in Virginia, USA. The group has a core function in the Muon Scattering Experiment (MUSE) in preparation at Paul-Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, and in the DarkLight project at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Laboratory) in the US. The MUSE project is a dedicated investigation of the so-called proton radius puzzle, a very prominent topic in nuclear physics. The experiment will measure the proton charge radius with high precision via lepton-proton elastic scattering, and will compare the interactions of muons and electrons of either charge with the proton at a fundamental level. The experiment will severely constrain possible explanations of the puzzle and has the potential to reveal new physics beyond the Standard Model. The DarkLight experiment in preparation at Jefferson Lab aims to discover a new particle associated with a fifth interaction suited to explain several observed anomalies in particle physics while offering a connection to dark matter. Both projects offer high-profile opportunities for students and postdocs at the forefront of international nuclear and particle physics research. The PI's research program has many facets and offers excellent opportunities for cutting-edge education and research purpose domestically and abroad. This proposal combines state-of-the-art detector development at Hampton University with its application in forefront research at PSI and at Jefferson Lab. This provides new research and educational opportunities at first-class research facilities for students from minority populations, predominantly African-Americans, and postdoctoral researchers. The development and operation of GEM detectors in the MUSE and DarkLight environments will be beneficial to advance this still novel technology with potential future applications in other experiments, as well as in the medical sector. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MUSE experiment has been proposed and approved to provide key insight in the quest to explain the so-called proton radius puzzle - the over five-standard deviation discrepancy between proton charge radius measurements with electronic and muonic probes, respectively. Possible explanations also include new physics beyond the Standard Model. The MUSE experiment aims to address one of the most pressing questions in nuclear and particle science to date. MUSE uses mixed muon and electron beams of either charge (mu+, e+, mu-, e-) to make precise measurements of the lepton-proton elastic scattering cross sections and proton form factors, with the goal to extract the proton charge radius for each probe. It will determine with the highest precision, model independently and conclusively, if there is any proton charge radius difference observed in electron versus muon scattering. At the same time it will determine the role of two-photon exchange and provide tight constraints on theory. Dr. Kohl is one of the co-initiators of the MUSE project. The role of Dr. Kohl's group in MUSE is essential to this project. This project focuses on the challenging task of high-resolution beam particle tracking at MUSE with GEM detectors, in a way not done before at low beam energies. The tracker is exposed to high rate density and beam flux, and needs to operate efficiently at a trigger rate of a few kHz. The DarkLight Phase-I project at Jefferson Lab includes a focused search for a dark photon or neutral boson in the mass region around 17 MeV/c2, where evidence for a fifth-force carrier has been reported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
