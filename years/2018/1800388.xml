<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to optimize performance, improve safety, minimize over-design, and reduce cost of battery systems in electrified vehicles. If successful, higher adoption of electrified vehicles is foreseeable in the near future to revolutionize the future transportation systems so that environmental challenges can be addressed for conserving energy and cutting back on carbon emissions and pollution. This research will also have significant impact on other applications such as aircraft electric systems, military portable devices, and aerospace battery applications, where lithium ion batteries are used for energy storage. These impacts will result in economic and social benefit and help the U.S. stay competitive globally. The theory and methodology will be integrated into education through modifications in related courses in order to engage graduate and undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies the uncertainty management and proactive maintenance of lithium ion batteries in electrified vehicles. The scope of the proposed work is to: i) increase accuracy of a baseline battery model; ii) develop an intelligent uncertainty management system; and iii) facilitate proactive maintenance decisions for lithium ion batteries. The investigators will address four issues including: i) characterization of battery model uncertainty under various battery operating conditions; ii) quantification of various uncertainties and their coupling effects in the battery system; iii) prediction of battery remaining useful life (RUL) under various battery operating conditions; and iv) validation of the proposed approaches on an electrified vehicle. Traditionally, researchers employ electrochemical models to improve battery model accuracy. However, a full order electrochemical model is not feasible for the battery management system (BMS) in electrified vehicles, and a significant level of model simplification must be established to meet the computational efficiency requirement which will cause unwanted model error. The first contribution of the research project will be to study an effective model uncertainty characterization approach to improve model prediction accuracy of a low-fidelity model (i.e., an equivalent circuit model) so that its accuracy is comparable to that of a high fidelity model (i.e., an electrochemical model) but with much higher computational efficiency. The second contribution of the project will be to develop an intelligent uncertainty management system for more effective battery performance estimation so that battery safety can be improved and lifetime risk minimized. Finally, the challenge of battery proactive maintenance stems from the complexity of battery devices. Even the best models cannot predict the complex degradation and failure mechanisms. As a result, accurate prediction of the battery RUL based on the underlying degradation theory is almost impossible. The third contribution of the research will be to study proactive maintenance decisions for batteries through accurate RUL prediction using innovative data-driven prognostics and health management (PHM) technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Three major achievements are made from 8/1/2019 to 7/31/2020 of the project period.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Firstly, we proposed model bias characterization for typical circuit-based lithium-ion battery models so that the baseline model accuracy can be significantly improved while maintaining similar computational efficiency. Under the same setting for battery state of charge (SOC) estimation, the corrected model incorporating the bias modeling consistently produces more accurate estimations than the baseline model. To further improve the confidence of the SOC estimation in particular applications, it may be necessary to include the uncertainty of the bias in the SOC estimation. To further enhance the expected SOC estimation accuracy, it is worthwhile to include more factors in the bias modeling. The research findings have been published in IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology in 2019 entitled as ?Learning of battery model bias for effective state-of-charge estimation of lithium-ion batteries?. Representative results are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, where the SOC estimation accuracy using appropriate bias modeling methods can be significantly improved.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Secondly, we proposed probabilistic battery SOC estimation considering battery model parameter uncertainty due to the cell-to-cell variability. To make the algorithm efficient and accurate, typical filtering algorithm was integrated with an efficient uncertainty quantification method for conducting iteratively probabilistic battery SOC estimation. Accuracy of the proposed approach was demonstrated by the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) with 10,000 realized samples for model parameters. As such, reliable battery SOC estimation based on the confidence level can be effectively obtained without requiring too much extra computational cost compared to a typical filter-based battery SOC estimation algorithm. The proposed approach systematically addressed the parameter mismatch issue, where nominal or rated model parameters were used instead of their true values through the characterization test, which could produce relatively large battery SOC estimation error. The research findings have been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics entitled as ?Probabilistic State-of-Charge Estimation of Lithium-ion Batteries via Integration of Uncertainty Quantification and the Extended Kalman Filter?. Representative results are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, where probabilistic battery SOC estimation can be accurately obtained considering the cell-to-cell variability, and reliable battery SOC estimation can be obtained at required confidence levels without the need of knowing the true battery model parameters.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Thirdly, we proposed a dynamic bias correction method for accurate degradation modeling of lithium-ion batteries. The proposed method calculates degradation trajectory bias from a baseline degradation model, conducts bias modeling at defined prediction intervals, and dynamically update the degradation model by adding the aggregated bias model to the baseline model. It is observed that the proposed bias correction method can consistently improve the remaining useful life (RUL) prediction accuracy when the baseline degradation model cannot truly represent the actual degradation process. Under the situation that the baseline model is very accurate, the bias function would be insignificant and quickly converge to zero. As such, the proposed dynamic bias correction method is generally applicable for prognosis with uncertain knowledge of the accuracy of the degradation model, which is particularly true for lithium-ion batteries. The research findings have been submitted to the Journal of Reliability Engineering and System Safety entitled as ?Prognostics with Dynamic Bias Correction of the Degradation Model?. Representative results are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, where lithium-ion battery degradation trajectories were predicted at different operation time using a baseline degradation model and the proposed dynamic bias correction method.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/04/2020<br>      Modified by: Zhimin&nbsp;Xi</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1800388/1800388_10375107_1596567117980_fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1800388/1800388_10375107_1596567117980_fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1800388/1800388_10375107_1596567117980_fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SOC estimation accuracy comparison</div> <div class="imageCredit">Zhimin Xi</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zhimin&nbsp;Xi</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig. 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1800388/1800388_10375107_1596567185548_fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1800388/1800388_10375107_1596567185548_fig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1800388/1800388_10375107_1596567185548_fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SOC estimation accuracy comparison</div> <div class="imageCredit">Zhimin Xi</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zhimin&nbsp;Xi</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig. 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1800388/1800388_10375107_1596567259898_fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1800388/1800388_10375107_1596567259898_fig3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1800388/1800388_10375107_1596567259898_fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Probabilistic battery SOC estimation</div> <div class="imageCredit">Zhimin Xi</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zhimin&nbsp;Xi</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig. 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1800388/1800388_10375107_1596567319809_fig4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1800388/1800388_10375107_1596567319809_fig4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1800388/1800388_10375107_1596567319809_fig4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Probabilistic battery SOC estimation at 95% confidence level</div> <div class="imageCredit">Zhimin Xi</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zhimin&nbsp;Xi</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig. 4</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1800388/1800388_10375107_1596567394516_fig5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1800388/1800388_10375107_1596567394516_fig5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 5"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1800388/1800388_10375107_1596567394516_fig5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 5"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Battery capacity degradation prediction using a baseline model</div> <div class="imageCredit">Zhimin Xi</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zhimin&nbsp;Xi</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig. 5</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1800388/1800388_10375107_1596567475833_fig6--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1800388/1800388_10375107_1596567475833_fig6--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 6"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1800388/1800388_10375107_1596567475833_fig6--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 6"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Battery capacity degradation prediction using the dynamic bias correction method</div> <div class="imageCredit">Zhimin Xi</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zhimin&nbsp;Xi</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig. 6</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
