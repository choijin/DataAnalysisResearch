<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project aims to identify optimal doses of blue light required to inactivate common clinical pathogens known to cause surgical site infections, and test a prototype antimicrobial light emitting dressing that uses the bactericidal effects of blue light to inactivate surface colonizing bacteria and disinfect surgical sites. The potential outcomes of the proposed activity are the development of a thin reusable blue light-emitting bandage that provides effective post-operative site disinfection, ultimately reducing nosocomial related infections. The proposed activity would further the development of antimicrobial blue light therapy devices, providing novel solutions to surgical site infections, Central Line Bloodstream Associated Infections, and wound infections, because of blue light therapy's proven ability to inactivate a wide range of clinical pathogens regardless of their resistance to antibiotics, ability to improve wound healing, and ability to inactivate bacteria in the biofilm state. The outcomes of this project will aid in providing a cost saving solution to Healthcare Associated Infections by reducing their occurrence, reducing the risks of human error, and improving accountability, quality and workflow. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optimization of blue light therapy is needed for clinical application for killing bacteria on the surface of patient's surgical sites, because of a radiant energy threshold that must be passed to inactivate bacteria. Due to the variation in devices and doses used in previous studies, combined with the clinical need for a device which can be easily incorporated into standard infection prevention protocols, further experimentation is needed with a device designed as a wearable for clinical implementation.  Objective 1: Determine optimal light dose (fluence) of blue light (405 nm) required to inactivate common gram positive and gram negative bacteria known to cause SSIs. Using in vitro techniques, determine the total fluence of light and treatment times required to achieve bacterial disinfection of at least a one log reduction in bacteria colony forming units.  Objective 2: Optimize device to deliver the effective irradiance while maintaining surface temperature below 43 Degree Celsius for safe use on tissue. The device is to not exceed 43 Degree Celsius on the surface of the device's therapeutic surface while delivering effective irradiance, from Objective 1, for inactivation of bacteria on surfaces.  Objective 3: Test the device's infection prevention and tissue response in a SSI porcine model. Evaluate the device in a porcine SSI model with surface-inoculated sutured incisions, made to the depth of the fascia, with optimized light-emitting antimicrobial bandage. Success criteria for bacterial disinfection is at least a 90% reduction of CFU per gram of tissue or a multiparametric and semiquantitative score (0-3 range) no greater than 1, based on standard subjective clinical markers, including fever, erythema, induration, and suppuration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

While many&nbsp;protocols have been implemented for preventing surgical sites infections, the infections persist,&nbsp;varying&nbsp;from 1% to 8% depending on the type of surgery performed. On average the infection rate is 1.6% for inpatient surgeries which are tracked by Medicare. With&nbsp;capitatedpayment systems and accountable care, hospitals are now financially responsible for the costs&nbsp;related&nbsp;to a&nbsp;Heathcare&nbsp;AcquiredInfection.&nbsp;Unfortunately with rise of&nbsp;multi drug&nbsp;resistant&nbsp;bacteria&nbsp;(Superbugs), the consequences of a&nbsp;post surgical&nbsp;site infection can be costly to the hospital and the patient. The costs related to a&nbsp;post&nbsp;surgical&nbsp;site infection can be as high as $100,000, particularly&nbsp;with infected total joint replacements such as hip or knee replacement surgeries. On average&nbsp;post surgical&nbsp;site infections increase the cost to inpatient health care between 4 to 6 billion&nbsp;annually,&nbsp;which does not include the disabling costs to the patients and loss of life. Considering that bacteria continue to evolve and become more resistant to&nbsp;antibiotics, new innovative methods are needed to prevent&nbsp;surgical&nbsp;site infections.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using funds from our National Science foundation&nbsp;SBIR&nbsp;phase 1 grant, Saber Corporation designed and built light energy delivering devices with the purpose of killing bacteria at a post surgical site or infected wound. A flexible dressing was designed which held high powered LEDs which could deliver light energy in the 405 nm range. Our innovative dressing design allowed delivery of high intensity light as well as cooled the LEDs so the dressing could be applied directly to the skin over the surgical site. Saber collaborated with an engineering design company, Paragon Innovations; the Mobile Integrated Solutions Laboratory (MISL) in the Electronic Systems and Engineering Technology Program at Texas A&amp;M University; the Biomedical Optics Laboratory in Biomedical Engineering at Texas A&amp;M;&nbsp;the&nbsp;College of&nbsp;Veterinary&nbsp;Medicine at Texas A&amp;M University and&nbsp;Bencor&nbsp;Corporation to design build and test our light emitting bandage. After successful testing of our&nbsp;prototype&nbsp;on the bench top, we performed in vivo testing of the&nbsp;devices&nbsp;using a porcine animal model. Surgical sites were created along the dorsal region of porcine to mimic spine surgery. Two layer closure was performed and the surgical site were inoculated with&nbsp;methicillin&nbsp;resistant&nbsp;<em>Staphylococcus&nbsp;</em><em>aureus</em>&nbsp;(MRSA). We performed controls which underwent surgery and inoculation with&nbsp;MRSA&nbsp;and treated animals using the same protocol as the controls except for the addition of Blue Light therapy for one hour daily for a total of three days. Working with the Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center Microbiology department we performed bacterial analysis of the specimens. When we compared our results to the controls, we demonstrated a 50% reduction in the number of&nbsp;MRSA&nbsp;colony forming units (CFU) at the punch biopsy sites when compared to the controls and an 80% reduction in the&nbsp;CFU&nbsp;counts from the removed sutures. The results supported our hypothesis that Blue Light therapy delivered via a modified dressing would reduce the quantity of a drug resistant bacteria at a contaminated post surgical site.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moving forward, Saber will&nbsp; modify the present prototype into a form factor which could be easily adopted for patient use. Once the modified device is finished (including a light emitting disposable bandage, reusable controller, and cooling component), Saber will perform in vitro and in vivo testing to assess the optimal dosing of "Blue Light" to kill different species of bacteria which frequently cause post surgical infections and&nbsp;infect&nbsp;wounds such as diabetic ulcers.&nbsp;Additional&nbsp;studies will be performed to assess safety and the effects of light therapy on the healing&nbsp;response. Several prior articles have demonstrated a synergistic effect of the light treatment including stimulation of the&nbsp;immune&nbsp;response&nbsp;and killing of bacteria. We feel the correct delivery of light is&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;at a dose which is found to be&nbsp;efficacious&nbsp;and safe. Our bandage system will be able to deliver the correct dose of light therapy&nbsp;which&nbsp;will be a form factor that&nbsp;can be&nbsp;easily&nbsp;adopted by hospitals, wound care&nbsp;clinics&nbsp;and outpatient surgical centers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/04/2019<br>      Modified by: Alan&nbsp;Glowczwski</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1820310/1820310_10558006_1567587336803_Armmodelwithmineraloil--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1820310/1820310_10558006_1567587336803_Armmodelwithmineraloil--rgov-800width.jpg" title="In vitro testing"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1820310/1820310_10558006_1567587336803_Armmodelwithmineraloil--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="In vitro testing"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">In Vitro testing of Blue Light bandage with an arm model.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alan C Glowczwski</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alan&nbsp;Glowczwski</div> <div class="imageTitle">In vitro testing</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1820310/1820310_10558006_1567587441107_LEDpattern--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1820310/1820310_10558006_1567587441107_LEDpattern--rgov-800width.jpg" title="LED pattern"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1820310/1820310_10558006_1567587441107_LEDpattern--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="LED pattern"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Six devices which were placed over the back of the porcine covering the inoculated post surgical sites</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alan C Glowczwski</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alan&nbsp;Glowczwski</div> <div class="imageTitle">LED pattern</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1820310/1820310_10558006_1567587521733_incisions--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1820310/1820310_10558006_1567587521733_incisions--rgov-800width.jpg" title="In vivo surgical sites"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1820310/1820310_10558006_1567587521733_incisions--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="In vivo surgical sites"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Surgical sites in porcine</div> <div class="imageCredit">Alan C Glowczwski</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alan&nbsp;Glowczwski</div> <div class="imageTitle">In vivo surgical sites</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
