<AbstractNarration>The proposal seeks funds to partially cover travel expenses of invited speakers and student participants and organizing expenses related to the workshop entitled "The Center for Turbulence Research Summer Program," to be held at Stanford University during June 24-July 20, 2018. This would be the 18th time that this biennial program is organized by the Center for Turbulence Research (CTR). A competitive process is used to select the participants, based on the merits of their research proposals and their research credentials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CTR summer school program is an immersive, hands-on meeting that focuses on interrogation of numerical simulation databases for testing of models and hypotheses proposed by the participants. The meeting covers many important areas of turbulent flow research, such as instabilities and transition, large eddy simulation, Reynolds averaged modeling, multiphase turbulent flows, combustion, and turbulent transport of mass and heat. Additional calculations to generate new databases are often performed during the Summer Program. The participants are divided into focus groups based on their proposed areas of research. The meeting will be attended by both prominent and young scientists from around the world, who will be discussing future directions of research and research challenges. The meeting will also foster cross-fertilization of ideas among researchers and will address modeling challenges involved in advancing the field for the next two to five years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
