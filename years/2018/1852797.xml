<AbstractNarration>The first meeting of the Number Theory Series in Los Angeles will take place at Occidental College in Fall, 2019; the second meeting will take place at Occidental College in February 2020.  The third and fourth meeting will take place in late Fall, 2020 and Spring, 2021 respectively at an institution in Souther California.  More detailed information about dates, local information, speakers, and schedules will be posted at the conference website: http://jim-brown.oxycreates.org/NTS-LA.  The topic of each meeting is number theory, broadly construed. The intent of keeping the topic broad is to encourage a more diverse group of participants in terms of speakers and attendees, and to foster collaboration amongst those in attendance. Each meeting will feature two plenary speakers and one graduate student plenary speaker. These plenary speakers will be chosen from outside of Southern California. Unlike other number theory meetings in the region, the primary focus of these meetings will be on contributed talks from mathematicians at all levels from all types of institutions, including undergraduate and graduate students and faculty at institutions without regular access to seminars and research funds. The contributed talks will primarily be given by mathematicians located in Southern California or a reasonable driving distance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there are numerous seminars in the Los Angeles region, faculty at local institutions without such seminars are often unable to find time to attend these seminars.  In addition, these faculty, along with undergraduate and graduate students, are often not afforded the opportunity to present their results in these seminars. A primary goal of the Number Theory Series in Los Angeles is to present these populations of mathematicians in Southern California with an opportunity to hear about the latest research from prominent mathematicians from outside the region, as well as others in the region, and to speak about their own research. These meetings will foster collaborations among the participants and create a more tight knit and diverse community of number theorists in Southern California. NSF funding allows this opportunity to be presented without significant cost to the participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
