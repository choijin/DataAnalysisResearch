<AbstractNarration>The National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) will evaluate the value of biological collections - defined here as living stocks of organisms and preserved repositories of biodiversity specimens and materials) - to research and education.  Biological collections are used for research in evolutionary biology, biodiversity, global change, conservation, food security, public health, the spread of invasive species, and biomedicine (among other fields). Some specimens of plants, animals, and microbes serve as "standards" or "type specimens" to be retained for future comparisons for formally described species attached to particular names under the Codes of Nomenclature. They also provide documentation that allows the comparison of past and present biodiversity and allow researchers to reconstruct important historical changes. Biological collections also harbor specimens of as yet undescribed species so that researchers today find many more new animal and plant species among preserved specimens than they do in nature. Preserved specimens also represent invaluable resources for education and training. Because many biological collections are in decline in the United States, the project will suggest long-term strategies for their sustained use.  This study will provide critical input on how biological collections can be made to adapt to changing scientific capabilities and societal needs.  Information on the NASEM's Board on Life Sciences and its products may be found at http://dels.nas.edu/bls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biological collections serve three main functions: use in research and innovation, education, and public engagement in science. This study will provide critical input on how biological collections can be made to adapt to changing scientific capabilities and societal needs.  The NASEM Board on Life Sciences will convene an independent, expert committee to review and evaluate the types of research, training, and public engagement activities that are commonly supported by biological collections.  They will examine the logistical and financial needs to advance science, education, and public outreach endeavors and recommend a range of long-term strategies to enhance the effective use of these resources.  The study will help build the research, education, and public outreach infrastructure needed to advance technologies, address national and global challenges, and prepare future workforce to engage in the diverse areas of science supported by collections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Without enhanced strategic leadership and investments in their infrastructure and growth many biological collections could be lost.  The significance of biological collections as research infrastructure continues to grow in ways that were unanticipated 20 or even 10 years ago. With strategic thinking and steady resource investments, biological collections could continue to be at the heart of scientific advances and education for the foreseeable future. Looking ahead, the committee of 13 distinguished experts whose collective experience included a diversity of biological collections, K&ndash;12 and informal education, and science communication, developed a common vision for the biological collections community in the next decade:   To provide long-term support for collections-based scientific research, instill a culture of proper stewardship for and access to biological specimens, build and grow biological collections to better represent global biodiversity in space and time, promote access to biological collections as important educational resources for the general public, and encourage the exchange of biological resources and knowledge.   With this vision, the major aim of this report was to stimulate a national discussion regarding the goals and strategies needed to ensure that U.S. biological collections not only thrive but continue to grow throughout the 21st century and beyond. This expansive endeavor requires creative leadership that encompasses a wide range of perspectives and expertise to identify the needs of collections infrastructure and ensure their sustainability and growth.  In this report, the committee first explores the ways that biological collections have contributed to society by advancing scientific discovery and innovation, enriching education, connecting non-professional communities to nature and science, and preserving Earth’s natural science heritage. Then, the committee addresses how the biological collections community is working toward a common vision in light of today’s challenges, recognizing that the future success of the biological collections community&mdash;curators, collection managers, directors, and users of biological collections&mdash;depends on addressing four interrelated issues:  upgrading and maintaining the physical infrastructure and the growth of collections; developing and maintaining the tools and processes needed to transform digital data into an easily accessible, integrated platform as cyberinfrastructure increases in complexity; recruiting, training, and supporting a diverse workforce of the future; and ensuring long-term financial sustainability.   Realizing this vision will require enhanced communication and collaboration within the biological collections community and beyond as well as a renewed and expanded commitment to maintain the diversity of biological collections, help them grow, and promote their use in scientific research and education.
