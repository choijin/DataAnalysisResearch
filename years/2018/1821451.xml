<AbstractNarration>The objective of this workshop is to convene leaders of data science initiatives across a number of research universities, in order to begin the formation of an academic community for data science. While there were only a few data science institutes/centers/initiatives at major research universities a few years ago, there are currently more than twenty such activities across public and private universities. This meeting will be the first ever convening of such a group, to allow for sharing of experiences and best practices in initiating teaching and research programs in data science. Meeting participants will discuss challenges and opportunities facing their respective institutions. One objective of the workshop group is to assume collective responsibility for preparing the next-generation data scientists in order to prepare them to be able to contribute towards the best interests of science and society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the data science leadership across different institutions, invitees to the summit will also include representatives of associated data science activities currently underway, including PIs of the NSF TRIPODS Phase I projects; participants in the NSF-funded NAS study on Envisioning the Data Science Discipline: The Undergraduate Perspective; and, organizers of NSF-sponsored workshops on Translational Data Science, Data Science Corps, and Keeping Data Science Broad: Negotiating the Digital and Data Divide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An express purpose of the summit is the formation of an academic community around data science research and teaching. Across the globe, numerous academic institutions are forming data science initiatives, leading to the recognition of Data Science as a discipline and/or as a key sub-disciplinary area. Much as the Computing Research Association (CRA) helped the computer science research community develop an identity, the organizers of this meeting believe that it will be helpful to initiate a community in data science leadership in the US, evolving into an organization like CRA for data science. This summit is the start of such a community-building effort. The intention is to initiate an organization dedicated to the enhancement of data science as a discipline, which can also convene activities to ensure a robust and growing data science community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Data science is a burgeoning field. As a result of recent technological advances, widespread and accelerated uptake of these technologies by many sectors, and increasing workforce demands, many data science initiatives across universities and colleges in the US and beyond are sprouting up at a rapid pace. The Data Science Leadership Summit, hosted on March 26, 2018 by the Data Science Institute at Columbia University, was the first convening of leaders of these initiatives.  The goals of the Summit were: (1) to initiate the formation of an academic community for data science; (2) to share best practices among academic leaders who face similar challenges and opportunities; and (3) to take collective responsibility in the broader effort to prepare next-generation data scientists to contribute in the best interests of society. This meeting was intended to be the inaugural meeting of a regular series.  One outcome of the Summit is a report, published on the ACM Digital Library, at this link:  https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3293458.   The report includes nine recommendations spanning topics from sharing data, working with industry, teaching ethics, establishing data science curricula standards, and activities to continue to build the data science community.  Given the variation of how data science initiatives are currently housed at universities, the report also includes a taxonomy of dimensions along which a university might consider in determining how it should data science would best fit in its local structure and organization.  A second outcome of the Summit is an agreement that the community will continue to hold Data Science Leadership Summits on an annual basis.  The second Summit has already been held and a third is being planned for 2019.       Last Modified: 03/07/2020       Submitted by: Jeannette M Wing]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
