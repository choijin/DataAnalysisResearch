<AbstractNarration>This award supports research in gravitational physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Many of the deepest problems in theoretical physics revolve around combining Einstein's theory of general relativity with quantum theory. The resulting theory is called "quantum gravity" and is needed to better understand the origin of the universe, the nature of space and time on small scales, and what happens inside black holes. The research supported by this award will use the latest techniques and tools to try to answer some of these fundamental problems. An essential part of the project is the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the knowledge and techniques that are central to understanding and discovery in gravitational physics. Through a range of forums from public lectures, to informing media reporters, the Principal Investigators will disseminate the directions and results of their research to a broad audience. Society at large will benefit by increasing their understanding of science and the world they live in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;James Hartle will continue exploring the interface between quantum mechanics and cosmology. He will work on extending the predictions of the no-boundary quantum state of the universe for observations today to increasingly general and detailed situations. He will further develop the generalizations of quantum mechanics that are necessary for cosmology and investigate cosmologically motivated extensions of quantum mechanics. He proposes to continue to refine our understanding of the origin of the quasiclassical realm of every day experience as an emergent feature of our quantum universe. Gary Horowitz will investigate a variety of topics in classical and quantum gravity, focussing on singularities and the origin of spacetime. He will explore whether classical singularities can be visible, or must always be hidden behind event horizons. He will also examine a recently discovered connection between potential visible singularities and charged matter. In addition, Horowitz will study how spacetime geometry emerges from a holographic theory of quantum gravity. He will consider the roll of quantum entanglement, but also pursue a new direction based on special cross-sections of the boundary at infinity. Don Marolf will explore a variety of issues in classical and quantum gravity generally related to black holes, thermodynamics, and entropy. While there is already much evidence that black holes are in some sense thermal systems (with entropy proportional to their surface area), and while this is expected to hold deep and fundamental lessons for physics, the argument has not yet been made in complete generality. Marolf will explore the required extensions and the resulting implications. Another part of his work seeks to more deeply understand so-called holographic descriptions of gravity, where phenomena in a dynamical spacetime are in fact equivalent to the quantum physics of a seemingly very different non-gravitating system. In this regard, Marolf is particularly interested in understanding the dictionary that allows one to translate physics inside black holes into the language of the non-gravitating formulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The black hole information problem has been an outstanding question in quantum gravity research since the mid 1970's. While Stephen Hawking discovered that black holes evaporate by radiating away their energy, his calculations indicate that no information is released in this process.  On the other hand, the finite entropy  of black holes, and the fact that this entropy shrinks as the black hole evaporates, strongly suggests that information falling into a black hole must be returned to the outside world.  Marolf's work on this project enabled a significant change in perspective on this problem.  First, it showed a quantitative sense in which the information inside a black hole does in fact reappear in the Hawking radiation. Second, it showed that this calculation is intimately tied to the study of closed universes in quantum cosmology, and that the evolution of black holes in our own universe can be affected by the state of universes that are at least initially disconnected from our own.  In particular, the above calculation only shows that the information in a black hole is actually returned to the external universe when the state of the closed universes has certain properties.  Otherwise, the information can simply be lost into closed `baby' universes.  This revives ideas from the late 1980's, but with a new perspective and a more quantitative understanding.     Horowitz continued his study of a surprising connection between two longstanding conjectures that he discovered about four years ago. The conjectures are cosmic censorship (which states that generic gravitational collapse cannot produce regions of arbitrarily strong gravitational fields that are visible to distant observers), and the weak gravity conjecture (which states that quantum theories of gravity should contain particles with charge larger than their mass). Horowitz had earlier shown that the weak gravity conjecture was necessary and sufficient to remove a class of counterexamples to cosmic censorship. During this project, he considered two new classes of potential counterexamples to cosmic censorship and showed in each case that the weak gravity conjecture again removes them.  He also showed the one cannot violate cosmic censorship in a context where the weak gravity conjecture would have no effect.     Horowitz also explored the singularities inside black holes that develop nonzero matter fields outside the horizon at low Hawking temperature.

When the matter field first forms, even a tiny change in temperature causes the interior to cycle through an infinite number of different forms of the singularity.     This project contributed to the cultivation of human resources by training graduate students and postdocs.
