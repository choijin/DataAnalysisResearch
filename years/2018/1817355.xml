<AbstractNarration>The International Conference on Intelligent Biology and Medicine (ICIBM) aims to promote information science, technology, and education to a great variety of trainees and young investigators, including trainees, faculty, teachers, scientists, and engineers, and to provide a forum for the cross-fertilization of ideas. The 2018 meeting will  held in Los Angeles June 10-12. Since its inception in 2012, ICIBM conference series has fostered the education of next generation of bioinformatics, systems biology, and intelligent computing scientists with cutting edge technologies and updated knowledge, as well as promoted informatics research in complex biological systems and agricultural, environmental, pharmaceutical, zoological, and data sciences. The travel awards for junior scholars are judged by the submission and quality of anticipated poster presentation.  This award would provide support for 20 US-based students and junior scholars who would be engaged in posters.  In addition, support is provided for four world leaders to speak at the meeting and interact with the junior scholars. The top scored manuscripts in peer-review will be selected for special issues in BMC journals and the International Journal of Computational Biology and Drug Design. ICIBM 2018 program will include four distinguished keynote speakers, conference invited talks, four tutorial and workshop sessions, scientific presentations, highlight talks, poster session, and other activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ICIBM 2018 will continue in providing innovative training and research collaborative programs catering to various levels of research expertise. Junior researchers will utilize resources to gain higher levels of training and information from senior experts, while established researchers will have continued access to collaborative communication and cross-disciplinary opportunities. Through extensive educational activities, collaborations, and interactions throughout the event, ICIBM 2018 will advance cutting-edge convergent research. The commitment to education and diversity through the inclusion of underrepresented students and other trainees, as well as the conference training opportunities, drives the establishment of a culturally and professionally diverse Trainee Committee.  Special issues in BMC journals and the International Journal of Computational Biology and Drug Design help to insure broad dissemination of the insights and research.  Support is provided for 20 students and four keynote speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
