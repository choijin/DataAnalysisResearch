<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a table-top powder X-ray Diffractometer. This powder X-ray Diffractometer analyses solid materials using X-rays to identify their internal composition and crystallographic structure. Successful research conducted with this instrument enables investigators to identify the sources of the minerals in sediments from deep-sea cores collected in a variety of ocean basin worldwide and in regions surrounding hydrothermal black smokers. The Diffractometer is integral part of the undergraduate and graduate students Geology curriculum at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, San Jose State University and other regional campuses and research institution in the area including the University of California Santa Cruz, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, and California State University Monterey Bay. Analysis of data done in this instrument will inform several master student dissertations at all these institutions. The instrument is also integrated in several outreach programs with local schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-Ray Diffractometer provides a fundamental tool for research and education. It benefits provenance and paleoclimate studies on deep-sea cores collected by the International Ocean Discovery Program in the Northwest Australian, Papua New Guinea and Chilean Margins. It is a key analytical tool for studies on silica diagenesis and associated authigenic precipitates in the Gulf of California. The instrumentation is also used for clay mineral analyses on cores form the Axial Seamount to determine the origin of hydrothermal mineral/volcanic glass deposits and for bulk mineralogy analyses of sediment surrounding a hydrothermal black smoker field on the northern East Pacific Rise (Alarcon Rise). The instrument also supports various projects that include the mineralogic interpretation of X-ray fluorescence data from deep-sea cores, mineralogic analysis of cores collected by Remotely Operated Vehicles from cold seeps, mud volcanoes and scheletal carbonates, mineralogic analyses of fish otoliths and changes in coralline algae mineralogic characteristics in relation to ocean acidification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2018, the NSF-MRI (National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation) Program has granted Dr. Ivano Aiello and Dr. Ryan Portner of the College of Sciences of San Jose State University (SJSU) the funding to acquire an X-ray Diffractometer (XRD). The instrument (a Rigaku SmartLab SE) was installed at the beginning of 2019 in a dedicated laboratory at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML), a detached marine facility of SJSU that offers one of the most a prestigious Masters programs in Marine Science in the US.  An XRD is a powerful instrument for science research and education in marine and earth sciences. The instrument uses the unique diffraction patterns created by an incident X-ray beam on a powdered sample to characterize the crystalline phases present in a variety of materials including minerals, sediments, rocks, and biological material such as shells and bones. Specific software and dedicated databases further allow the identification of these phases and to quantify the composition of the examined materials.  XRD is an indispensable tool for the introduction of undergraduate and graduate students to the discipline of mineralogy, and for students studies not only in the classic fields of the geosciences, but also in the cross-disciplinary fields between geosciences, chemistry and biology.  After an initial phase focused at training researchers and students to the use of the instrument, its proprietary software and at testing different procedures to prepare the samples for the XRD analyses, the instrument was put to work on a variety of projects some of which culminated with publications in peer-reviewed journals including Nature.  For instance, with the XRD we were able to learn that at the bottom of the oceans, in the hot, salty waters of deep hypersaline anoxic basins (some of Earth’s most extreme and toxic environments) the activity of extremophile microbes causes the formation of tiny (a fraction of a mm in thickness) particles of a carbonate mineral called dolomite. Because of the small size of the particles and the convective motion of the dense fluids in which they occur, the dolomite particles can stay in suspension and muddy the waters for hundreds of years.  The XRD was also used to identify the nature of the minerals that form in a complex hydrothermal system in the Gulf of California. The vertical distribution of minerals in cores collected from the subsurface of a circular mound "Ringvent" where hydrothermal activity persists 10 miles away from one of the spreading center, suggest that the system has been evolving from "hot" to "lukewarm" over the last several thousands of years.  Finally, the XRD has been used by several students for their graduate research at MLML, SJSU and from other academic institutions in the Monterey Bay and San Francisco Bay area and it was the centerpiece of an advanced class offered at MLML in Fall 2019.
