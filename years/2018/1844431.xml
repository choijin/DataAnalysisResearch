<AbstractNarration>The New York Hall of Science (NYSCI) will host a community-based convening, and a series of follow-up to advance the knowledge base and increase the capacity of educators who support STEM pathways for STEM opportunities. The objective of the NYSCI Neighbors STEM Collaborative will be to engage principals, parent coordinators and parents, science cluster teachers, and English Language Learner instructors from schools in Corona, Queens, to help guide NYSCI staff in developing a framework for integrating museum activities aligned to the newly implemented New York State Science Learning Standards. The convening will help develop the foundation for building a national community of practice that will serve to amplify work on STEM and first-generation immigrant students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are very few places where first-generation immigrant families can go that provide opportunities for an intergenerational approach to learning, where families and children learn together. The NYSCI STEM Collaborative will lead to a community of practice where teachers, parents, ELL instructors, and museum staff co-develop activities to strengthen teaching and learning in STEM between the school and the museum. This work will also contribute to a small, but growing body of research literature examining the role that science centers can play in impacting local communities and extend this work by anchoring it deeply in the lessons learned throughout the NYSCI Neighbors initiative. The Institute will combine research projects, the development of methodologies for the study of diverse families and youth, training graduate students and disseminating research findings. The project will disseminate the lessons learned in this initiative through two major organizations. First, NYSCI is partnering with the Institute for Immigration, Globalization and Education. Second, NYSCI has been invited by the Carnegie Corporation of New York to engage a group of science museums across the country all of whom are working to deeply engage first-generation communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In order to build stronger connection between families, schools and NYSCI’s assets, NSYSCI staff proposed a series of workshops with museum staff and key school stakeholders. The workshop’s goal was to host a series of convenings that brought together a number of with key educational partners from our local community including parent coordinators, elementary and middle school teachers, as well as science cluster teachers and teachers of English language learners, to help to guide NYSCI staff in developing a framework for activities in the museum that would support development student learning in schools.

At a culminating meeting with all the stakeholders to report our findings.     A number of steps were taken to improve program practices and our interactions with schools. The following programs have begun this fall:     Bringing the Museums to the schools NYSCI Residencies Presentation at PTA Meetings and Parent Coordinator Meetings at schools NYSCI has increased the number of youth ambassadors who work during the Homework Host science fairs for museums at schools Bring Activities to Schools during Parent Nights. Parent Coordinators are arranging tours of the NYSCI with parents to get a better sense of what the museums offers and how they can engage their children in learning after school.   The workshop on engaging first-generation immigrant students and their families  informed our understanding of the potential intersections of young people's experiences across school, home, and science centers.  The workshop allowed staff at NYSCI to understand both the challenges and opportunities to serving families in museum spaces.  Last spring our program staff began to make changes to way in which we engage families in schools.  We recently began working with schools and parent coordinators to familiarize the schools and groups of parents to NSCYI.  We also have began a residency program where our staff spends 8 weeks at a school and have two-hour science sessions one week in the afternoon. This development was essential for schools farther away from the museum and where parents and students have more difficulty attending NYSCI regularly. Another new development included having NSYSCI staff having more of a presence in the community.

Overall, NYSCI has worked to inform the local schools and parents the value of the science museum and how can be a hub for learning. First-generation parents assume that formal school is the primary mechanism for learning&mdash;the workshop helped to change many of the perceptions they had about ways in which children can learn in museums.  There has been a growing appreciation for the fundamental role of non-school science education institutions can play in communities. (Falk &amp; Dierking, 2010).    This project informed our approach by broadening our understanding of the potential intersections of young people's experiences across school, home, and science center.  We are currently working with a network of museums around the country that are working on community and family engagement.  Each of the participating organizations has a pre-existing commitment to serving recent immigrants in their local communities.

The long-term potential of the Coalition for a STEM Future is to accelerate and leverage local learnings from sites across the country to grow a movement that can help immigrant- origin youth and their families recognize themselves as active participants in shaping, creating, and advancing a world that uses STEM to solve tomorrow’s problems and create economic opportunity for immigrant and first-generation children more broadly.
