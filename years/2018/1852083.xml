<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, will support the training of 12 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2019- 2021. The theme of microbial symbioses and biodiversity will allow students to gain an appreciation of microbes and their interactions with other organisms and the environment. Research projects will focus on 5 core areas: 1) systematics and evolution; 2) plant/animal mutualistic and antagonistic interactions; 3) microbes and the environment; 4) microbial metabolites and bio-products and 5) genetics, genomics and bioinformatics. Students will receive training in core elements of interdisciplinary research, including experimental design, data interpretation, professional network development, and scientific ethics. Additional activities include seminars, mentor-mentee and student meetings, professional development activities, and field trips. Applications will be reviewed based on the following: a) resume; b) student personal statement; c) letters of recommendation; d) interest in the faculty mentor research program; and e) potential impact on the student career. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 36 students, primarily from 2-year colleges in Western US and across the country and schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will develop research skills and independent thinking enhancing their success for careers in academia, industry, and government agencies. Students will be supported to publish their research, and many will present results of their work at scientific conferences. A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. In addition, weekly assessments will measure the quality and effectiveness of different components of the program including the research experience, mentors, professional development activities, and housing. Students will be tracked for at least five years after the program to determine their career paths. Students will also be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting https://www.stocklab-insectpathogens.com/nsf-reu-site.html or by contacting the PIs, Dr. Patricia Stock (spstock@email.aizona.edu) and Dr. Gayatri Vedantam (gayatri@email.arizona.edu).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
