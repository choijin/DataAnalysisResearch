<AbstractNarration>The availability of low-cost head-mounted displays has made virtual reality affordable to consumers and there are now millions of virtual reality users worldwide.  The most natural way to explore a virtual environment is to walk and turn, just as one does when exploring a real environment.  However, many virtual reality systems lack necessary technology to allow physical walking, and those that do allow physical walking provide only limited walking space.  Therefore, virtual reality users must rely on navigation interfaces to fully explore the virtual environment.  Perhaps the most common technique is the teleport interface, in which the user points a virtual laser pointer to the desired location in the virtual environment and is then directly transported to that location.  The teleport interface is easy to learn but lacks body-based cues normally associated with walking, such as leg movement and sense of balance, which can cause rapid disorientation.  This project's goals are to evaluate the effects of the teleport interface on navigation and to identify ways to help users stay oriented when using the teleport interface.  Teleporting is likely to be especially disorienting for some users, such as those with low spatial ability, so this project incorporates a personalized approach to determine the amount of and type of adaptive navigation support that should be provided to a given user.  Findings from this project will support creation of the Design of Virtual Environments (DOVE) website, a public Wikipedia-style site for research-based guidelines from virtual reality research, along with materials to support both undergraduate and graduate education and outreach to programs targeted at broadening participation in computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses a novel framework based on concordance/discordance between movement through a virtual environment (VE) and movement of the user's body.  Within this framework, this project evaluates the impact of three common navigation interfaces (walking, teleporting to change position, and teleporting to change position and orientation) and several types of environmental cues on users' ability to perform two fundamental navigation tasks. The first task, spatial updating, involves keeping track of self-location and orientation when moving through space, answering the question, "Where am I?" Disorientation represents a failure of spatial updating. Accurate spatial updating is critical for a successful VE, particularly in time-sensitive domains such as remote medical assistance and training for extreme workplace circumstances. The second task, cognitive map formation, involves storing experienced locations and relationships between them in memory, and is critical for tasks that involve navigation to remembered locations or selection of alternative routes or shortcuts, e.g., "How do I get there?" The results from a series of experiments will be used to make evidence-based recommendations for navigation interfaces and aids that VR designers should ideally include in a VE, either uniformly or using an adaptive personalized approach based on users' spatial abilities or other individual differences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
