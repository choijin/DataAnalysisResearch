<AbstractNarration>The principal investigator studies complex network structures in amphiphilic mixtures under a framework that includes degenerate diffusion and functionalized Cahn-Hilliard (FCH) energy.  Network structures in complex systems have close relations to phase transitions, materials science, and mathematical biology.  He develops methods to model and analyze the development of structures in amphiphilic mixtures and their properties.  Such systems include biological membranes and polymer materials like polymer electrolyte membranes.  Biological membranes play critical roles in biological processes such as protein transportation, drug encapsulation and delivery.  Polymer electrolyte membranes are key ingredients of fuel cells that are able to efficiently produce clean energy and are a promising replacement for traditional batteries.  Their effectiveness is directly related to their fine structures.  In the course of this project, a graduate student and an undergraduate student are trained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator concentrates on the influence of degenerate diffusion on the dynamics of complex amphiphilic structures, the variational properties of the functionalized Cahn-Hilliard energy, and their relation to amphiphilic structures.  He formulates bilayers, filamentous pores, micelles, and defect structures such as open edges, end caps, and triple junctions, as minimizers of the FCH energy, and relates them to variational properties of the FCH energy under various geometric constraints.  By building degenerate diffusion into the FCH equation, he is able to model biologically significant phenomena such as the co-existence of bilayer vesicles of various sizes and shapes, the diffusion of lipid molecules along lipid bilayer membranes, and the impermeability of bilayers.  He studies the evolution of the defects and the sensitivity of their energies to parametric variation, and identifies the energetic cost for the defects to form.  The tools developed in this project have wide applications in the modeling of other physical and biological systems, and in the study of other problems in applied mathematics related to nonlinear PDEs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Under this support, the PI has published 8 papers on prestigious journals. In addition, he has two papers submitted, and one more paper in preparation.      Intellectual merit.   (a) The degenerate Cahn-Hilliard equation. In collaboration with Qiang Du of Columbia University, the PI studied the degenerate Cahn-Hilliard equation with a double-well potential that is continuously differentiable. They studied coarsening mechanisms using asymptotic analysis, the coarsening rates computationally, and the existence of weak solutions theoretically. For the coarsening mechanism, their key discovery is that the interface motion is determined by a quasi-stationary porous medium diffusion process in both bulk phases, together with surface diffusion along the interface itself. For the theoretical studies, they proved the existence of a weak solution that is consistent with the physical Gibbs-Thomson effect. Their weak solution is different from the weak solution studied in the literature, as the latter is not consistent with the Gibbs-Thomson effect.   (b) The degenerate Functionalized Cahn-Hilliard equation. The FCH equation support amphiphilic structures including bilayers, filamentous pores, and micelles. In collaboration with K. Promislow of Michigan State University, the PI studied the geometric evolution laws of bilayer and filamentous pores. They also studied a modified form of the FCH functional which models highly amphiphilic systems in solvent. Together with Qiang Liu of Shenzhen University, they proved the existence of weak solutions for the degenerate FCH equation. With an appropriately chosen degenerate mobility, together with Dai’s student Toai Luong, they proved the existence of nonnegative weak solutions for the degenerate FCH equation.   (c) Minimizers for the Cahn-Hilliard energy with strong anchoring condition. Together with his student Toai Luong and Bo Li of UCSD, the PI studied analytically and numerically the minimizers for the Cahn&ndash;Hilliard energy functional with a symmetric quartic double-well potential and under a strong anchoring condition (i.e., the Dirichlet condition) on the boundary of an un- derlying bounded domain. They found a bifurcation phenomenon determined by the boundary value, and a parameter that describes the thickness of the transition layer.  (d) Phase-field model for molecular solvation. In collaboration with Bo Li of UCSD and Jianfeng Lu of Duke University, Shibin Dai studies a phase-field variational model for the solvation of charged molecules with an implicit solvent [32]. They proved the continuity of the electrostatics&mdash;its potential, free energy, and dielectric boundary force&mdash;with respect to the perturbation of dielectric boundary. They also proved the -convergence of the phase-field free-energy functionals to their sharp-interface limit, and the convergence of phase-field forces to their sharp-interface limit.   (e) Mean field model for the Ostwald ripening of thin films. The PI  rigorously derived a mean field model for the Ostwald ripening of thin liquid films through homogenization. His analysis captures the screening effect of the droplets and shows that the mean field spatially varies in a length scale proportional to the screening length.           Broader impacts.   The dissemination of these results has influenced the community of materials science. For instance, together with other researchers’ results, The PI’s results have motivated the community to discuss the role of degenerate mobility in phase field models, and also motivated researchers to check the validity of some models of coarsening in superalloys.
