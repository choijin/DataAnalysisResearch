<AbstractNarration>The STEM+C Program focuses on research and development of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to the integration of computing within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teaching and learning for preK-12 students in both formal and informal settings. The Education Development Center (EDC) will develop and facilitate a STEM+C Education Research Summit that will support the STEM+C research community to collect, share, and analyze their research findings; address NSF's Big Ideas in computational STEM fields; and because of the powerful innovation and application of computing in the STEM disciplines, the Summit will continue to catalyze the research field for advancing real-world, interdisciplinary, and computational preparation of students from the early grades through high school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The STEM+C Research Summit design will be drawn from literature on best practices of innovation networks and communities of practice (COPs) to foster the development of a STEM+C innovation COP. The COP meeting design and facilitation will give PIs an opportunity to expand on their work and explore the confluence of issues and overlaps within the STEM+C community. To encourage a research culture that is globally engaged, an international panel of STEM+C researchers will be invited to present their research on advances in STEM+C in various countries. The Summit will be a working meeting, during which STEM+C community members will learn about advances made by community members, synthesize findings around emerging research themes, and identify and/or recommend new directions for STEM+C research. Working groups organized around emerging themes will represent a nexus of intellectual work that provides opportunities for PIs to deepen understandings and relationships in those areas. Outcomes of the Summit will include, development of a unique, interdisciplinary community of practice; collectively producing artifacts and products; increased understanding of the findings of STEM+C research projects; advancement of STEM+C evaluation methods to build expertise in designing research that will lead to viable outcomes as the foundation for education innovation; develop professional peer connections leading to future research collaborations; provide opportunities to engage in syntheses research activities and ongoing articulation of program-wide findings and lessons learned; and participation in a working group that will address future strategies for STEM+C education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The STEM+C PI Summit, took place in September 2019 with 220 attendees, culminating more than five years of project funding and related implementations. As an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary program, the STEM+C Summit had multiple goals: to define what CT looks like in the service of STEM disciplines, to deepen understanding of the impact of CT integration, to share evidence of effective integration processes, to address future STEM workforce needs, and to explore crowd-sourced emergent ideas and new directions for research.     The STEM+C Summit Website   http://stemcsummit.edc.org  houses a complete history of the STEM+C  Summit including a general description of the Summit, Acknowledgments, the Summit Agenda, Session Details, Speaker Bios and information on logistics for Summit participants.  To prepare for the Summit participants submitted one page project descriptions which were collated into a STEM+C Project Description Booklet participants referred to throughout the Summit sessions.     Summit evaluation findings revealed that the Summit:  Increased understanding of the breadth of STEM+C projects and their research, leading to informed decisions about project design, priority research areas, and future proposal development  Advanced the field by engaging the larger STEM+C community in building and sharing new knowledge, best practices, and tools, and support ?synthesis? and ?envisioning? activities focused on providing input into future program directions that will yield the greatest impact. Facilitated networking among current PIs and evaluators to build expertise in developing projects that lead to desired outcomes and in developing the foundation for an innovation CoP Promoted a STEM+C research culture that is globally engaged, with increased opportunities for exchanging ideas and collaborating on an international scale Provided NSF with input from the field to inform future program directions and funding priorities and to address critical research gaps      Recommendations based on feedback from Summit participants:     Assessment: There is still confusion around learning outcomes, what quality CT looks like, what is important to measure, all of which make common and shared assessments a challenging task.  Recommendation: NSF should devote a program priority toward developing, piloting, and supporting common assessments and instruments across different project bands; develop an assessment bank or repository that includes a vetting process; and convene a STEM+C Assessment Working Group to explore these issues in a formal manner.     Community of Practice:  The STEM+C Community of Practice is strong and committed. With most projects finishing their first or second years, there still is a large working community ready and able to advance this field.    Recommendation:  A STEM+C program Center be established to support and further this community; if not a dedicated center, then a distinct and separate component of an existing center.     Defining Computational Thinking:  With so many thoughts and conflicts around the need to define computational thinking occurring at every juncture of the Summit, we recommend the issue be formally addressed. The current acceptance of varied and uneven definitions and interpretations prevents a commonality of thought, direction, and expected outcomes from the community.  Recommendation: Convene a STEM+C Computational Thinking Working Group or Task Force to explore issues related to defining computational thinking and help the community come to consensus on a working definition.     Integrating Computational Thinking:  Understanding and implementing strong integration of CT practices with STEM discipline learning requires a clear defining of both the CT skills and the disciplinary skills to be learned or enhanced. The range of project types and approaches to successful integration suggests that one type or strategy not be highlighted over others.  Recommendation: Inventory and share a collection of integration strategies and approaches, categorized by project type (grade level, STEM focus, etc.) and strategy used.     Research:  Researchers have begun discovering a broad range of outcomes related to student and teacher learning, integration strategies, equity and access, and project design, among other topics. With the program still relatively young it is early to predict or recommend specific research directions.  Recommendation: Convene a STEM+C Research Working Group to explore research issues in a multi-year formal manner.     Future: The success of the Summit and the STEM+C program as evidenced by the nearly 150 projects represented at the meeting suggests the program is quite strong and important to researchers and practitioners. The questions raised and challenges explored resonate with similar STEM education programs and initiatives, but here the context and direction highlighted the needs of tomorrow?s workforce as it necessarily embraces computation; this applies to STEM jobs as well as non-STEM opportunities. Therefore we see the future of the STEM+C program directly tied to the future of learning for a computationally prepared workforce. While still early stage, the work presented by Summit attendees and researchers has emphasized how this emerging field is so important to building and supporting a computationally literate society differently from other NSF (or other agency) programs.  Recommendation:  NSF should invite and support short, medium, and long term STEM+C projects to continue the work of the current cohorts.
