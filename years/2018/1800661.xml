<AbstractNarration>This project supports travel to the 23rd ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems, to be held in Williamsburg, VA,on March 24-28, 2018. ASPLOS is a premier forum for multidisciplinary systems research spanning computer architecture and hardware, programming languages and compilers, and operating systems. Papers in ASPLOS may target diverse goals such as performance, energy and thermal efficiency, resiliency, security, and sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
