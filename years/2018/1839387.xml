<AbstractNarration>Machine learning has become a focus of many researchers as effective solution to many complex engineering problems. At its core machine learning are the methods that provide computers ways to learn using available data. Artificial neural networks (ANN) have traditionally been the backbone of machine learning methods. While these learning systems certainly have their strengths, they also have limitations in the context of control engineering. For example, physics based models often provide key physical insight into the design of control systems for power grids, autonomous vehicles, and robots. So completely discarding such models in the context of learning based control systems is often counterproductive. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project aims to develop a new, foundational and innovative control architecture which combines the advantages of model based design methods with those of real-time learning. The architecture is based on recent advances in the mathematical modeling of dynamical systems. While well suited for a variety of applications in engineering, biology, and ecology, the target application is the safe and reliable control of smart grids.  The latter are clearly of vital importance for future economic development and the security of the nation's constantly evolving energy distribution system. Project outcomes will provide practical solutions to complex energy management problems involving uncertain power demands, energy limits, and use of renewable resources while at the same time maintaining grid stability and reliability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hybrid control architecture involves a given system and an assumed physical model both driven by the same control input. The measured difference between their outputs defines an error system. The key idea is to use a generic input-output representation known as a Chen-Fliess functional series to describe this unknown error system. The series coefficients are estimated in real-time via a minimum mean-square error estimator. Effectively, the conventional artificial neuron is replaced here by this new type of learning unit to approximate the error system. The control problem is solved via predictive control using the assumed model and the learned error system. The enabling technology is recent advances in the numerical approximation of Chen-Fliess series which make it possible to implement the scheme in discrete-time. The specific objectives of the project are to (1) advance the theoretical foundations that underpin real-time learning for control applications, including the cascading of these new learning units for deep learning (2) optimize and adapt the novel theoretical results for real-time control of smart grids to provide a priori performance guarantees. The main problem here lies in the uncertainty coming from the over-simplified/poorly modeled dynamics of the grid in addition to the action of renewable resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

This new approach combines both model-based design methods with those of real-time learning and data-driven control using an actor-critic paradigm. In particular, it was shown that online data-driven learning can be used to improve the robustness against model uncertainty by augmenting traditional engineering control systems in a way that avoids competition between them during normal operation but actively compensates or adapts when the system undergoes changes or is under stress. To support our claim, image 2 illustrates the response of a synchronous generator machine to a sudden change in its inertia.

Stimulated by these discoveries, new analytical tools were developed and new directions on the applicability of the learning-based hybrid controller were identified. These help understand how interconnected nonlinear systems such as biological neutral networks, internet communications systems, and transportation systems behave under a variety of real-work situations as well as the potential for the data-driven control of distributed energy resources (DERs) for power systems balancing affected by renewable resources uncertainty. Image 3 shows how a complex system comprised of DER can be used for tracking a power signal. The system is highly uncertain and will benefit from the tools and models developed in this project to produce an appropriate data-driven adaptive control policy.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Luis&nbsp;A&nbsp;Duffaut Espinosa</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1839387/1839387_10573691_1608835115020_block-diagram-v2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1839387/1839387_10573691_1608835115020_block-diagram-v2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1839387/1839387_10573691_1608835115020_block-diagram-v2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Diagram of a synchronous machine connected to novel learning unit.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Duffaut Espinosa, Luis A.</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Luis&nbsp;A&nbsp;Duffaut Espinosa</div> <div class="imageTitle">Image 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1839387/1839387_10573691_1608834992809_graph-v2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1839387/1839387_10573691_1608834992809_graph-v2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1839387/1839387_10573691_1608834992809_graph-v2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Response of a synchronous machine connected to the novel learning unit when a sudden chance on inertia occurs.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Duffaut Espinosa, Luis A.</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Luis&nbsp;A&nbsp;Duffaut Espinosa</div> <div class="imageTitle">Image 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1839387/1839387_10573691_1609188847695_PEM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1839387/1839387_10573691_1609188847695_PEM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="image 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1839387/1839387_10573691_1609188847695_PEM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="image 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Closed-loop system including distributed energy resources (left) and tracking response for a power AGC signal (right)</div> <div class="imageCredit">Duffaut Espinosa, Luis A.</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Luis&nbsp;A&nbsp;Duffaut Espinosa</div> <div class="imageTitle">image 3</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
