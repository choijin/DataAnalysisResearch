<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms-A (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Irving R. Epstein and his research group at Brandeis University are studying the properties of chemical reactions that are far from equilibrium.  Chemical equilibrium is a condition where a chemical reaction has not ceased, but the forward reaction to produce products and the backward reactions to produce reactants balance each other such that the concentration of reactants and products do not change.  Chemical reactions that have not achieved equilibrium shift to reach this condition, and interesting things can result in the process.  The Epstein group is conducting experiments wherein complex three-dimensional patterns of chemicals form in solution.  Epstein is also developing theoretical models to explain the emergence and evolution of these structures.  Such work may provide insights into how structures form in biological systems.  The research group is also employing 3D printing technologies to study patterns on three-dimensional surfaces.  They investigate patterns that grow on expanding domains, analogous to the situation in developing embryos and organisms.  Finally, the Epstein group is also investigating how chemical reactions may be used to drive the motion of certain materials, a concept that could lead to primitive "soft robots." The post-doctoral and graduate student researchers involved in this project are gaining experience in experimental laboratory techniques and computer simulation of complex chemical reactions.  In addition to the training and professional development, the educational impacts of the project include continued work by Professor Epstein and his students to incorporate nonlinear chemical dynamics into the undergraduate curriculum.  They also conduct STEM outreach to underrepresented minorities and generally disadvantaged communities via the Brandeis Science Posse, a program founded by Epstein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores macroscopic pattern formation originating in reaction-diffusion and related processes involving oscillating chemical reactions.  The chemical systems include the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction (BZ), the chlorite-iodide-malonic acid (CIMA) system, and the chlorine dioxide-iodine-malonic acid (CDIMA).  The Epstein group is engaging five general areas of investigation: the characterization turing patterns formed in three dimensions, pattern formation in growing domains; patterns arising from differential growth (as opposed to simple reaction-diffusion); coupled oscillators, and locomotion and chemo-mechanical transduction in BZ-gel systems.  All experimental work is supported by model simulations.  In addition to the training and professional development of a post-doctoral fellow and a graduate student, the educational impacts of the project include continued work by Professor Epstein and his students to incorporate nonlinear chemical dynamics into the undergraduate curriculum.  They also conduct STEM outreach to underrepresented minorities and generally disadvantaged communities via the Brandeis Science Posse, a program founded by Epstein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
