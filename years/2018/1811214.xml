<AbstractNarration>The Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. An immediate challenge for informal STEM education is the lack of high quality program evaluation. What does high-quality evaluation look like and how can it be accomplished? High-quality evaluation necessarily begins with good evaluation planning. In addition, although several large-scale youth-serving organizations embrace STEM, there is limited research on the interaction between STEM outcomes and social-emotional learning (SEL). This pilot and feasibility project involves a collaboration between researchers with expertise in STEM education, out-of-school time (OST) programs, social-emotional learning, and evaluation, as well as practitioners and program developers. STEM Scouts participants are grouped into "labs" of approximately 10-20 boys and girls with 3 or more leaders per group and often collaborate with local schools. The mission of STEM Scouts is to help young people grow in character and STEM skills as they explore their curiosity using experiential activities and interaction with STEM professionals. Building on prior NSF-funded work, this project expands the implementation of the Systems Evaluation Protocol (SEP), a three-stage evidence-based approach to evaluation planning involving (a) Preparation, (b) Model Development, and (c) Evaluation Plan Development. The proposed project has implications for other youth-serving organizations that also embrace a dual mission of supporting STEM and the social-emotional development of youth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are to: (1) develop a detailed theory of change for STEM Scouts that highlights the hypothesized interactions between STEM outcomes and Positive Youth Development/SEL outcomes; (2) pilot three new enhancements to the SEP (System Mapping, Ecosystem Modeling, and Model Validation); and (3) determine the feasibility of conducting a national scale STEM Scouts study. The project will utilize a research-practice partnership Evolutionary Evaluation approach and the enhanced SEP. A working group of STEM Scouts leadership and project researchers will work through initial stages of the SEP to generate a stakeholder map, logic model and pathway model (a causal depiction of how the program works). Ten STEM Scout Labs purposively selected from across the country with the goal of diverse representation will participate in focus groups. Using logic and pathway models generated by the working group, each Lab will complete a System Mapping activity to identify the larger system in which the Lab exists (e.g., stakeholders and decision-makers). Focus group participants will review and discuss their maps. Through Ecosystem Modeling they will identify the most important outcomes, key connections, and revisions they might make to their model, and discuss how the model reflects their STEM Scouts experiences. A coding dictionary will be developed to analyze focus group transcripts; findings will inform Model Verification and will be used to assess whether changes need to be made to the enhanced SEP. It is hypothesized the enhanced SEP will enable the working group to better understand factors hindering or enabling program and evaluation feasibility and success. Project findings will be disseminated to the evaluator and research community, OST program providers/developers and the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Research Overview The research questions guiding that study were: 1) What is the theory of change for STEM Scouts; 2) Is the STEM Scouts theory of change consistent with the research literature; 3) Does the STEM Scouts theory of change accurately reflect the lived experiences of youth program participants and adult leaders; and, 4) Within specific communities, what is the broader STEM ecosystem within which STEM Scouts is embedded? To address the research questions, a three-step process was used, including: model development (RQ1), evidence mapping (RQ2), and focus groups (RQ3 and RQ4). Evidence mapping was conducted to determine the extent to which the theory of change was consistent with the extant literature. Focus groups were also conducted to determine the extent to which the pathway model was consistent with youth and adult participants? lived experience and to better understand STEM ecosystems.      Results/Intellectual Merit. RQ1: A 9-member working group was convened consisting of representatives from the national STEM Scouts office (including the original program developers), as well as researchers with expertise in character development, out-of-school time (OST) programs, and STEM education. The working group met in person to create the STEM Scouts pathway model (or theory of change).

RQ2 Results: 69% of the connections on the key pathways were supported by research. The literature review also led to the addition of outcomes and language revisions to more closely align with terminology used in the literature.     RQ3 Results: A total of five focus groups with STEM Scouts adult leaders and volunteers (24), and youth (19) were conducted in five states across the U.S.. The pathway model resonated with most participants? experiences with STEM Scouts. Participants across multiple focus groups suggested adding outcomes related to learning and leadership. Parents and other family members, the availability of OST STEM programs, and schools were frequently noted as critical elements of the STEM ecosystem.    RQ4 Results: A comparative analysis of the STEM ecosystem maps across the five focus groups revealed several themes. First, the important role parents and other family members play in fostering STEM was consistently noted. The availability of extracurricular activities outside of STEM Scouts such as clubs and camps were also considered important factors in the STEM ecosystem. Participants in all five groups emphasized the role of school as an avenue for accessing STEM content.     Results/Broader Impact. This study revealed the value-added when steps including the development and validation of a detailed theory of change are taken as part of the development of a STEM education program evaluation. The critical outcomes and connections revealed by this project grounded the development and design of a high-quality evaluation of the STEM Scouts program. The results of STEM Ecosystem mapping also emphasize the need to explore both in-school and out-of-school STEM programs for youth, and particularly for youth from under-served communities, variables which are addressed in the evaluation plan and currently pending proposal.
