<AbstractNarration>Electronic materials form the core of critical technologies that drive continuing advances in computing, information technology, diagnostics and other applications. It is becoming increasing clear that conventional computers which use silicon crystals to perform most of the computing tasks will not be able to keep up with the demands for massive computing and information processing systems. It is believed that quantum computers, which work on the principles of quantum mechanics, can provide new technologies for large scale computation. Synthesizing new quantum materials is an important challenge for the development of quantum computers. Professors Ritesh Agarwal and Andrew Rappe of the University of Pennsylvania utilize the unique chemistries and reactivities of nanoscale materials to synthesize new quantum nanomaterials.  They then test these materials for unique quantum electronic properties and evaluate their performance. The researchers augment the teaching curricula at the University of Pennsylvania at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Research and educational activities are integrated by the involvement of undergraduates in research, by incorporating the latest research results into the curricula, and by training high school and college teachers from Philadelphia where there is a large percentage of underrepresented minority students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from the NSF Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program, Professors Agarwal and Rappe develop a tightly integrated experimental and theoretical program to synthesize new topological quantum materials by chemically transforming semiconductor nanostructures, while preserving structural attributes of the parent compound (e.g. crystal lattice, nanoscale morphology). Topological materials represent the next generation of quantum materials, yet the classes of topological materials realized via experiments is very small.  Theoretical predictions have suffered from the lack of appropriate materials for testing. The ion exchange synthesis method, in conjunction with recent advances in connecting quantum chemistry and topology, offers a route towards successfully addressing these synthetic challenges. Attaining a high level of independent control over chemical composition and crystal structure is highly desirable and motivates this research.  This research advances the development of materials for applications in quantum computing, cryptography and sensing that may lead to increased security and economic competitiveness for the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
