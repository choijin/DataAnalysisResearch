<AbstractNarration>Electronic systems are creating a renewed innovation cycle in many industries, including automobiles and manufacturing. These systems, which are at the heart of innovation in areas such as autonomous systems, often incorporate Machine Learning (ML) components to make decisions. Since safety, reliability, and predictability are paramount in these systems, this award funds a workshop to explore safe, reliable, and predictable applications of machine learning methods and systems, the performance of which often depends on factors that are not within the full control of the user or the system designer. These latter factors could range from uncertainties in training data, to lack of robust algorithms, to probabilistic aspects of inference mechanism etc. The organizing committee, as well as the participants are composed of individuals from academia, industry and the government, include diverse participation from minority, women and underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Examples of technical aspects to be discussed at the workshop include, but are not limited to: (1) survey of relevant machine learning techniques, (2) data analytics currently used by electronic design automation, and problems in which similar paradigms are used, and (3) robustness, test, validation and verification in the context of ML. The outcomes of the workshop will be reported publicly and shared widely with the research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The application of machine learning algorithms and techniques have dramatically increased over the past several years, since it has seemingly limitless potential to change the way systems are optimized and interact with the world around them. Electronic systems with built-in machine learning are just around the corner so the question for the electronic design automation (EDA) community is how to handle the verification, validation, and test of such systems. The workshop addressed the current state-of-the-art and formulated the key research needs in charting a path forward towards enabling the safe, reliable, and predictable application of machine learning (ML) to emerging applications.  The workshop pointed out some identified research directions for exploration:  Mathematical Basis: formal models for machine learning behavior Bounds/Guarantees: how to determine for application specific contexts Confidence: how to establish and use it for decisions, including real time Control/Decisions: system level stability, controllability, observability Trust/Security: interference, noise, malicious use Explain-ability/Understandability: models and system-level behavior Debug-ability: determining problem origin and remedies Verification and testability metrics: guide robust design Reliable application-specific data preprocessing: automatic data collection, sanitation, and preparation for machine-learning engines   The research directions are not completely orthogonal to each other and cross areas from theory to practice: mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering all play a role in advancing the state-of-the art. As with many emerging cross-disciplinary technologies, there is need for research in each of the areas individually as well as a group, since the application of theory into practice is where true impact lies for this type of technology.
