<AbstractNarration>Under this international collaborative project, Jonathan Bobaljik, David Koester, Michael Krauss and Chikako Ono (Chiba University, Japan) will work towards the completion and publication of a comprehensive dictionary of the Itelmen language, comprising all known lexical resources, work that was begun under the aegis of a 2012 RAPID award (ARC-1155973). The centerpiece of the project is the large lexical card file (12,000 + cards) assembled by A. P. Volodin (St. Petersburg) from 1962 into the 1980s. The project is coordinated with a larger effort to publish comprehensive dictionaries of the languages of "Beringia" (the Bering Sea region), and comes at a key juncture in the language's history. Itelmen is critically endangered: at this time, the number of native speakers has dwindled to fewer than 10. At the same time, there is growing interest in the Itelmen language within the Itelmen community, as well as growing scholarly attention to the languages of this region in the context of language contact across the Bering Strait.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The primary objective of this grant was to complete digitization of Itelmen language lexical data for the purpose of preparing and publishing a comprehensive Itelmen dictionary for both linguists and the Itelmen community.  The nearly 500-page Itelmen-Russian version of this dictionary (Volodin, Ono, Bobaljik, Koester, Krauss 2021) was published in spring 2021, including both a print version and a freely available .pdf version online.  Work continues towards the completion of a parallel Itelmen-English edition.  The compiled materials included the main source, the card file (13,000+ cards) of Russian linguist A. P. Volodin (which includes prior information from prior sources such as the Jochelson/Worth Dictionary of Western Kamchadal, 1960), the 12,000+ card file of Itelmen ethnographer N. K. Starkova, data from scholars, explorers and officials from the 18th to the 20th centuries and the more recent work of linguists on this project C. Ono and J. D. Bobaljik.  When the PIs of this project began work in Kamchatka there were 80 to 100 speakers of the Itelmen language and one could occasionally hear it still used in conversation on the street, in the public bathhouse and in a few homes. Two decades later, this project intervened at an important moment as the last half dozen fluent speakers and A. P. Volodin, the major Russian linguist to have studied the language were available for consultation.  When the project began in 2012 there were perhaps half a dozen fluent native speakers; at the writing of this report, only one remaining native speaker is fully fluent and fluid (along with other speakers who have varying degrees of competence).       In coordination with a previous grant to provide audio-visual documentation of Itelmen language data, this project involved working with the active speakers to expand and elaborate the recorded Itelmen lexicon.  Gathering of new lexical data was still possible during the early portion of the grant period.  Consultations with A.P. Volodin, were also an important contribution to the refining of the data before he passed away in 2018.  All of the earlier material was combined with data gathered by PI Jonathan Bobaljik and Japanese linguist Chikako Ono.  Systematic sound recordings with the various available speakers were compiled to make possible a digital Itelmen-Russian dictionary application, for both scholars and the Itelmen community, with audio recordings of thousands of words.    SIL's FLEx software was used to facilitate documentation in accord with the latest standards for accessibility and long-term digital storage of lexical data.  The FLEx database contains a total of 17,561 entries.  This database has been submitted to the Alaska Native Language Archive to ensure long-term public access, and a website version is being completed for an antipicated launch in summer 2021.  In addition to the Dictionary, various articles, book chapters and conference presentations resulted from work associated with this project. Two of the conference presentations were specifically descriptions of the project and the consultation work with Itelmen speakers.   Broader Impacts:  Information about the project was disseminated in the Itelmen community in Kamchatka by a series of presentations and by the participation in the project of Itelmen scholar and language revitalization specialist, Tatiana Degai, now an assistant professor at the University of Victoria, Canada. The presentations to the community included a talk by Collaborating PI Koester in the village of Kovran explaining the goals of the project and obtaining ideas from the community about how the materials selected might best serve their needs.  From that meeting it was decided that the best delivery method of the dictionary data, apart from the printed dictionary, would be via smart phone or tablet.  Given limited and expensive internet we decided to provide the village with a Wifi server (RACHEL-PLUS) containing the dictionary and audio-visual corpus.  A prototype of the dictionary server was given to the village Cultural Center who, after testing it, turned it over to the school for teaching purposes.  The school is now offering Itelmen language in grades 1-12 and has found the Wifi server to be very useful.  The second community presentation was given in the provincial capital city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at a regularly scheduled Itelmen language and culture evening event (vecherinka). It was attended by students, educators, Itelmen leaders, and other enthusiasts.   The third talk about the project was presented at a scholarly conference, also held in Petropavlovsk. The audience for that talk was primarily educators and other interested conference goers.   Beyond communication with the Itelmen community, presentations for the general public given by the PIs - in Berlin, Germany (Bobaljik) and to Athabascan radio in Fairbanks, Alaska (Koester) - have promoted awareness of endangered languages and the pressing need for their documentation.   Among the project sites in Connecticut, Alaska, and Japan, more than a half dozen graduate students gained experience as research assistants including training in working with endangered language materials.
