<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project are two-fold.  First, by combining virtual assistants as facilitators, an integrated system of scaffolds through the Design Notebook, and support for collaborative interactions both within a learning environment as well as virtually, the platform has the potential to provide a self-contained, self-paced, stand-alone online platform focused on culturally- and socially-relevant game design that has the potential to expose and support hundreds of thousands of learners who do not currently have access to these types of opportunities, programs, or platforms within their communities in the United States.  Second, the platform has the potential to support global collaborations between groups of learners through its ability to showcase work and its virtual play-testing capabilities that will allow users to give and receive substantive feedback about the design of a game, and thus inform its iterative design, from anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project proposes a unique online platform with supporting scaffolds, that supports learners through game design for social change virtually in similar ways as the SCAT (Supporting Computational Algorithmic Thinking) project supported African-American middle-school girls face-to-face (DRK-12 #1150098).  SCAT and its scaffolds have been shown to be effective not only at helping African-American middle-school girls engage in Computing by designing games for social change, but also in improving their perceptions of themselves as critical thinkers and game designers with an intent to pursue game design or some STEM-related field as a result.  As such, the core technology of the platform is a stand-alone online platform that scaffolds learners through designing and implementing games (video or mobile) for social change as well as develops their computational algorithmic thinking capabilities.  It will be designed to leverage the affordances of the scaffolding in the SCAT Learning Environment including the facilitator, Design Notebook, and other Scholars.  The platform will contain several key integrated sub-tools that model and coach learners as they think through their designs, make connections, make design decisions, collect feedback to inform the iterative design of their games, ask questions of themselves and their peers, reflect on their experiences, and showcase what they have created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to engage in customer discovery to determine whether there was a viable business opportunity for SCATware (now tentatively named EdSpread).  SCATware is currently an interactive prototype that was envisioned based on research from the NSF-funded project entitled CAREER: Supporting Computational Algorithmic Thinking (SCAT) ? Exploring the Development of Computational Algorithmic Thinking Capabilities in African-American Middle School Girls(DRPK-12 #1737442).  As a part of SCAT, Scholars used the Design Notebook, a of paper-and-pencil based scaffolds designed to support Scholars as they worked collaboratively in dyads to design games for social change.  We envisioned that EdSpread would provide similar support to the Design Notebook, leveraging the affordances of an online self-paced learning platform to support learners working in groups or alone anywhere in the world.  Over the course of the project, we engaged in and learned from the LEAN startup methodology as a part of the Austin I-Corps summer cohort.  Over the course of the project period, we conducted over 200 interviews nationally.   In particular, we interviewed over 200 middle school and high school principals, STEM coordinators, and teachers to understand how they find, acquire (purchase), use, and assess Computer Science (CS) resources.    We determined that there is a viable business opportunity for EdSpread.  We designed and developed an interactive prototype, which was completed in February 2019.  We have also had several of our interviewees reach out to us to offer their schools/organizations as pilot sites once the interactive prototype is ready for use and testing.
