<AbstractNarration>Populations of fish are declining across the globe. While the specific causes of the declines are unknown it is suspected that they are related to changing ice and water temperature as lakes have experienced reduced ice cover and significant thermal warming in response to environmental change. What is needed is a globally coordinated experiment to test the causes for these declines. Funds are provided to support US participants in a two-day international workshop to design and coordinate a cross-latitudinal, cross-continental experiment to evaluate the ability of freshwater whitefishes (subfamily Coregoninae) to adapt to changing temperature and habitat changes across global latitudes. Workshop participants will design a large-scale common experiment to identify the causes and consequences of global scale changes in lake temperature and ice cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will provide a unique opportunity to design and implement an international collaborative global scale experiment to assess the role of changing global thermal regimes on the role of adaptation and plasticity to changes in life history, physiology, and phenotype through genetic and epigenetic changes of a key freshwater fish family. It will be the first experiment designed to evaluate changing thermal regimes across a broad latitudinal gradient and provide a unique forum to ensure standardization, coordinated implementation, and robust data management. The workshop offers an excellent opportunity to integrate and encourage ecological and molecular approaches to enhance and strengthen understanding of environmental change impacts on global fish populations.  Besides the direct fisheries management impacts of the research, it will serve as a significant training experience in team science for the participating graduate students and early career faculty. The workshop is a joint partnership between universities and federal agencies in the USA and French National Institute for Agricultural Research, with 25 participants from 13 countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The University of Vermont received funding to support US participants in a two-day international workshop to design and coordinate a cross-latitudinal, cross-continental experiment to evaluate the ability of freshwater whitefishes to adapt to changing thermal habitat across latitudes. The workshop was held on 14-15 March 2018 in Thonon-les-Bains, France, at INRA Centre Alpin de Recherche sur les Reseaux Trophiques des Ecosystemes Limniques (CARRTEL). US participants included four graduate students, a recent post-undergraduate, two early-career faculty, and the PI who was on sabbatical at the host location. Participants came from the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point, the University at Buffalo, Cornell University, and the University of Vermont. Total participants numbered 25 from 13 countries. Outcomes of the workshop include a standardized operating protocols and methods document for fertilizing, handling, and rearing whitefish eggs to hatch, which has since been used for coordinated pilot experiments in the US, France, and Finland during winter 2018-2019. The pilot experiments suggest differences in survival and hatching times between families across different exposure temperatures, and differences among populations (northern vs southern populations) at the same temperatures, indicating a rich potential for how populations may respond to changing environmental conditions across geographic latitudes. Full-experiments are planned in North America for winter 2019-2020, comparing cisco and lake whitefish populations from Lake Ontario (43.6 degrees N latitude) to Great Slave Lake (61.5 degrees N latitude). Additionally, the workshop provided an opportunity for US participants to engage in discussions about research methods with international participants, better understand how ideas are debated and refined, and to see how international collaborative projects are initiated and executed. For example, one graduate student facilitated the workshop and has continued active engagement with international participants to design and execute the pilot studies and planned upcoming full experiments. The workshop also fostered stronger relationships among US participants - another graduate student spent two weeks in early 2019 in one of the early career faculty participant?s laboratory to better learn Restriction site Associated DNA (RAD) Sequencing techniques and data analyses for whitefish populations in North America.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/24/2019<br>      Modified by: Jason&nbsp;Stockwell</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1829451/1829451_10532969_1563994413193_IMG_1889--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1829451/1829451_10532969_1563994413193_IMG_1889--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Workshop Participants"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1829451/1829451_10532969_1563994413193_IMG_1889--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Workshop Participants"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Group photo of in-person participants at the two-day international workshop to design and coordinate a cross-latitudinal, cross-continental experiment to evaluate the ability of freshwater whitefishes to adapt to changing thermal habitat across latitudes in Thonon-les-Bains, France, in March 2018.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Severine Ruffier</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jason&nbsp;Stockwell</div> <div class="imageTitle">Workshop Participants</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1829451/1829451_10532969_1563994587651_IMG_1887--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1829451/1829451_10532969_1563994587651_IMG_1887--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Workshop in Session"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1829451/1829451_10532969_1563994587651_IMG_1887--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Workshop in Session"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Participants in session at the 2018 Coregonid Workshop in Thonon-les-Bains, France.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Severine Ruffier</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jason&nbsp;Stockwell</div> <div class="imageTitle">Workshop in Session</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1829451/1829451_10532969_1563995022004_EggWellPlate_Ont_Cisco--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1829451/1829451_10532969_1563995022004_EggWellPlate_Ont_Cisco--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Microplate with Cisco Eggs"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1829451/1829451_10532969_1563995022004_EggWellPlate_Ont_Cisco--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Microplate with Cisco Eggs"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Microplate used to incubate individual eggs during pilot experiments at the University of Vermont over winter 2018-2019.
