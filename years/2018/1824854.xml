<AbstractNarration>The U.S. is currently at a crossroads in higher education where access to quality post-secondary education is a prerequisite for entry into the middle class but the ability to afford such an education is becoming increasingly limited. Georgia Tech proposes the Scalable Advanced Learning Ecosystem to address this mismatch. Building on successful online education programs that have offered Master?s degrees in computer science and analytics, Georgia Tech hosts a workshop for higher education administrators and researchers to establish components of Scalable Advanced Learning Ecosystems that can be applied across colleges and universities. The goal of Scalable Advanced Learning Ecosystems is to create educational experiences that can be scaled to growing populations of students while providing the personalized attention that has typically been the domain of unscalable individual, face-to-face teaching and advising.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Georgia Tech hypothesizes that with growing demand for higher education, but with a limited supply of professors, advisors, and budgets to meet such demand, Scalable Advanced Learning Ecosystems can be used to provide personalization and customization for large populations of students. Human activity and expertise are used to guide the creation of this ecosystem's innovations, but day-to-day operations are machine-driven. The innovations include: Personalized Learning Systems that use artificial intelligence and machine learning to establish customized educational plans for each student; Intelligent Tutoring Systems that modify the presentation and sequence of materials in response to student performance; Data Mining and Learning Analytics that extract useful and actionable information to understand student uses of learning resources and outcomes; Scalable Online Environments that deliver high-quality, high-engagement learning experiences; and Immersive Learning Environments that simulate a physical presence in real or imagined worlds, overlay content on those worlds, and merge real and virtual worlds to produce new learning opportunities. The workshop is  held on November 29 and 30, 2018 at the Global Learning Center on the Georgia Tech campus in Midtown Atlanta, and participating institutions are selected by proposals submitted that describe each institution?s interest in Scalable Advanced Learning Ecosystems and the institution?s commitment to action to improve educational access.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scalable Advanced Learning Ecosystems     Fifty-five attendees came together on the Georgia Tech campus on November 29 and 30, 2018 to create a roadmap for creating SALEs.  Envisioned as laying the foundations for next generation learning ecosystems, workshop organizers brought together experts in the field to imagine the blueprints of what SALE would look like. This conference was conceived of as an outgrowth of Georgia Tech?s educational think tank, the Center for 21st Century Universities (C21U), Georgia Tech Professional Education (GTPE), and the provost?s Commission on Creating the Next in Education (CNE), a Georgia Tech-wide initiative which imagines education in the not so distant future. It was also a logical follow up to the Affordable Degrees at Scale conference hosted each year by Georgia Tech. The workshop featured several invited speakers, who lead conversations around the core topics. These plenary talks were followed by deep-dive interactive sessions in which participants focused on particular issues and domains and develop action plans in four tracks: Learning Design and Technologies; Business Models and Sustainability; Faculty Roles, Student Services and Student Engagement; Research, Assessment, and Compliance. Within these tracks participants examined learning and organizational goals, affordances of new and emerging technologies, institutional strengths, and societal drivers of change that coalesce in the creation of SALE. They also considered project scale, scope, costs, potential impact, and possible return on educational investment. The authors would like to express our sincere thanks for the facilitators of the deep-dive sessions and the summit participants who laid the groundwork for this white paper.     Five themes emerged from the summit: 1) enhanced learner agency; 2) transformation of instruction, assessment, and the faculty role; 3) rethinking accreditation, financial aid, and the credit hour; 4) moving towards a complex and interconnected technical infrastructure; and 5) affordability and determining return on educational investment.     1) Enhanced Learner Agency  The most sweeping theme centered on the individual learner, who will have agency over what, how, when, and where he or she learns. For example, artificial intelligence (AI) will continue to develop such that applications driven by AI will move from being a ?cognitive primer? to being a ?cognitive partner.?     2) Transformation of Instruction, Assessment, and the Faculty Role  As the learner?s experiences and choices dictate more and more of the learning process, it will also be necessary to change instruction to provide the best and most applicable knowledge and skills. The goal of using such technology should be ?to make the unfamiliar familiar.?     3) Rethinking Accreditation, Financial Aid, and the Credit Hour  In the vast and often confusing landscape of post -secondary education it is often difficult for students to know how to assign value to specific educational opportunities. If you think of higher education as an investment from which you later expect a positive return (see the Return on Investment section below) then potential students need a way to evaluate the possible risks associated with that investment.     4) Towards a Complex and Interconnected Technical Infrastructure  A major challenge to the idea of demonstrating mastery of both content and skills will be in how that information is shared with employers, other schools, or anyone who has an interest in what a student is able to do. As a learner swirls in an and out of educational activities throughout their lifetime, no matter how many different institutions touch the learner and the type of credentials and competencies are achieved, there should be a coherent and comprehensive record of activity that is owned by the learner.     5) Affordability and Determining Return on Educational Investment  As the post-secondary community considers a future with SALEs, the community must recognize the considerable ROI challenges SALEs present. SALEs strive to allow institutions to more deeply acknowledge individuality in ROI. SALEs that integrate systematic ROI investigation and reporting provide an opportunity to reshape the ROI debate, with parents, students, legislatures, donors, etc. becoming informed partners.     The experts and practitioners from a variety of domains, whom we brought together under the auspices of the National Science Foundation and Georgia Tech, identified the broad themes that will achieve Scalable Advanced Learning Ecosystems (SALEs). It should not be surprising that learners, learning environment, policies, technological infrastructure, and business sense stood up from the rest of the issues and characteristics identified. These are broad themes to address in any digital learning environment. Having said this, the devil is in the details. SALEs pose significant challenges in terms of the rapid pace of technological advances that are promising yet still elusive and resource-intensive. They expose the vulnerabilities in terms of governance (of policy making, data, and faculty role, to name a few). More importantly, not all institutions can achieve scale in all subject areas. Therefore, it will be interesting to see unfold those who will emerge as leaders and establish themselves in certain fields.
