<AbstractNarration>The Graduate Student Combinatorics Conference (GSCC) will be held April 6-8, 2017 at the University of Texas at Dallas. This will be the 14th annual GSCC, which is traditionally organized by graduate students and has benefited greatly from NSF support in the past. The GSCC focuses on graduate student research presentations and will include keynote addresses by Catherine Yan (Texas A&amp;M), Karola Mészáros (Cornell), Fan Chung Graham (UCSD), and Po-shen Loh (Carnegie Mellon). The GSCC provides a unique and invaluable opportunity for graduate students in combinatorics to experience the benefits of taking part in a research conference. Giving their own presentations allows graduate students to develop their teaching and presentation skills, helping them succeed as junior researchers. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics is a vibrant field of mathematics with applications to many disciplines including algebra, geometry, topology, probability, computer science, and analysis. This conference will inform junior investigators of recent advances made in this lively and exciting field, and provide them with a setting to present their own original research. The GSCC provides a great opportunity for graduate students to network, and has led to joint research projects among participants in the past.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Website: http://www.utdallas.edu/~nxw170830/gscc/GSCC2018.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This award provided funds to support the 18th annual Graduate Student Combinatorics Conference (GSCC), held on April 6-8, 2018 at the University of Texas at Dallas.    Over 70 graduate students representing over 35 institutions participated, with 45 graduate students each giving short twenty-minute talks on their work.  These talks were organized across three days into four parallel sessions, each reflecting a different area of combinatorics.  Student talks were punctuated by four hour-long plenary talks delivered by four distinguished combinatorialists: Drs. Fan Chung, Karola M?sz?ros, Oleg Musin, and Catherine Yan.  Combinatorics is a vibrant field of mathematics with applications to many disciplines including algebra, geometry, topology, probability, computer science, various branches of engineering, and analysis.  The GSCC promotes graduate student participation in combinatorics research, providing an invaluable opportunity for graduate students in combinatorics to experience the benefits of taking part in a research conference.  The first GSCC was hosted by the University of Minnesota in 2005, with subsequent conferences held at the University of Wisconsin (2006), the University of Washington (2007), UC-Davis (2008), the University of Kentucky (2009), Auburn University (2010), Penn State University (2011), the University of Illinois-UC (2012), the University of Minnesota (2013), Auburn University (2014), the  University of Kentucky (2015), Clemson University (2016), and the University of Kansas (2017).   As always, the GSCC conference hosted at the University of Texas at Dallas in 2018 informed junior investigators of recent advances, provided them with a setting to present their own original research, and gave them the opportunity to network with their peers and established researchers to learn about new problems and begin collaborations.
