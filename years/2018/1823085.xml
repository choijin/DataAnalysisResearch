<AbstractNarration>Although natural disasters have been used in the past to develop project-based learning (PBL) lessons, there is a lack of research that examines their use in the aftermath of a natural disaster.  The purpose of this project is to leverage ongoing efforts related to science education and the current emergency and disaster recovery landscape in Puerto Rico. The Yale Ciencia Initiative, in collaboration with Ciencia Puerto Rico, working with the Department of Education of Puerto Rico will develop culturally relevant project-based science lesson plans that incorporate the disaster context that can be implemented both inside and outside of the traditional classroom. The project will allow displaced students to continue learning under the guidance of teachers, parents or social workers.  The project will train educators in the use of disaster-related problem-based lessons and assess project implementation and the impact of the lessons. The final outcome of this aim will be a lesson plan template and implementation guidelines for other jurisdictions faced by natural disasters. The project will result in enhanced infrastructure for education by developing tools and implementation guidelines that other jurisdictions may use to develop their own lesson plans in advance of natural disasters, so as to assure continuity of learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will assess implementation through observations and rubrics, surveys for parents, educators and students, and focus groups with each of these populations. To assess the impact of contextualized PBL lessons, the project will collect survey data, before and after the educational intervention, to measure changes in students' content knowledge, as well as in attitudes that are predictive of engagement in science learning. Results will be compared to matched control groups that receive either the standard curriculum, which are not contextualized to the disaster and that does not include PBL, or a PBL lesson plan that does not incorporate the disaster or the cultural context. At least 30 educators and 200 7th grade students will be exposed during the project period to the contextualized PBL lesson plan. The resulting feasibility analysis will inform other jurisdictions preparing their educational systems for natural disasters and provide evidence for the use of contextualized lesson plans that incorporate PBL in disaster recovery settings. In addition, the project design will advance the field of PBL by allowing investigators to examine the impact of integrating current social/historical contexts to PBL lessons and by examining the relationship between changes in science attitudes and engagement, with changes in learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Through this grant we succeeded in developing two 7<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;grade project-based learning lessons (PBL), aligned to the Department of Education of Puerto Rico's (DEPR)&nbsp;curricular standards, which integrated the cultural context of Puerto Rico, as well as common challenges faced by communities following a natural&nbsp;disaster such as the hurricanes the impacted Puerto Rico and the Caribbean in 2017.&nbsp;Lessons included a final step where students together with their teachers had to organize an outreach activity to share the results of their projects to their school and/or communities. A total of 31 teachers and educators were given access to these lessons and student guides and were trained on how to implement them, as well as on project-based learning and culturally relevant science teaching strategies. Lessons were implemented by 10 educators during the 2018 and 2019 academic school years, impacting a total of 272 students. We examined the implementation of the lesson plans and changes in students' attitudes towards science, through student and parent surveys before and after the lessons and through interviews with teachers. Although results were inconclusive, due to a small sample size from difficulties recruiting students, open-text questions from parents and students and interviews with teachers produced a number of insights. Importantly, following the hurricanes, many schools and family units were without power until the summer of 2018 or longer, most schools suffered some type of long-term infrastructure damages such as mold, broken air conditioners, or closed down classrooms, which also caused many schools to operate on half time periods. These stressors compounded with new and confusing administrative requirements from the DEPR related to PBL teaching requirements. In general, results indicated that implementing a new teaching strategy shortly after a natural disaster was too ambitious for teachers and students. Instead, results suggest that train teachers in the use of the contextualized PBL strategy, prior to a possible natural disaster, could help them be better prepared and more effective in implementing these lessons in the period following the disaster. Beyond these results, the project resulted in enhanced infrastructure for education by developing new openly accessible, disaster-contextualized PBL lesson plans, implementation guidelines, and PBL lesson development templates that were integrated into the teaching resources promoted and disseminated by the DEPR. The project also resulted in the launch of Ciencia al Servicio, a new science education capacity building program based on experience with this project. The program connects science teachers with scientists for the co-creation of PBL lesson plans contextualized to the challenges and lives of Puerto Rican students. From 2018-2019, thanks to the foundations of the NSF project, the Ciencia al Servicio project has been able to deliver training to 63 additional teachers, who collaborated in lesson co-creation with 30 STEM experts, resulting in the development of 43 additional PBL lessons for grades (grades 3, 6-8, and 10) and reaching &gt;2,427 students in Puerto Rico.&nbsp;Finally, based on the lesson plans developed for the projects and the insights gathered from educators on the challenges of teaching and assuring continuity of education following a natural disaster, the team was able to better support teachers and students following school closures as a result of a series of earthquakes that affected the Caribbean region at the beginning of 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic. Following these disasters, team members used some of the PBL lesson plans developed for this NSF project and developed print and online "science education emergency kits" that covered 4-6 weeks' worth of classes.&nbsp;These resources have been distributed to teachers and students in Puerto Rico and are freely available for download and use.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/30/2020<br>      Modified by: Giovanna&nbsp;Guerrero-Medina</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1823085/1823085_10531544_1588221026305_IMG_3304--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1823085/1823085_10531544_1588221026305_IMG_3304--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Post-hurricane PBL Lessons Workshop"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1823085/1823085_10531544_1588221026305_IMG_3304--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Post-hurricane PBL Lessons Workshop"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dr. Greetchen D�az-Mu�oz trains teachers on the use of project based learning teaching strategies</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jose Madera</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Giovanna&nbsp;Guerrero-Medina</div> <div class="imageTitle">Post-hurricane PBL Lessons Workshop</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1823085/1823085_10531544_1588221197512_IMG_3279--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1823085/1823085_10531544_1588221197512_IMG_3279--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Students conducting post-hurricane PBL lesson on ecosystems"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1823085/1823085_10531544_1588221197512_IMG_3279--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Students conducting post-hurricane PBL lesson on ecosystems"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">7th grade students in Puerto Rico conducting the Terrestrial Ecosystems lesson, to explore ecosystem changes after a major hurricane</div> <div class="imageCredit">Elvin Estrada</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Giovanna&nbsp;Guerrero-Medina</div> <div class="imageTitle">Students conducting post-hurricane PBL lesson on ecosystems</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1823085/1823085_10531544_1588221388145_20180629_130203--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1823085/1823085_10531544_1588221388145_20180629_130203--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Students conducting post-hurricane PBL lesson on potable water"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1823085/1823085_10531544_1588221388145_20180629_130203--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Students conducting post-hurricane PBL lesson on potable water"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">7th grade students in Puerto Rico conducting the Clean Water lesson, to explore design of a hand washing station after a major hurricane</div> <div class="imageCredit">Elvin Estrada</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Giovanna&nbsp;Guerrero-Medina</div> <div class="imageTitle">Students conducting post-hurricane PBL lesson on potable water</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1823085/1823085_10531544_1588221644681_33245653_10156453624882300_5861055398827524096_n--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1823085/1823085_10531544_1588221644681_33245653_10156453624882300_5861055398827524096_n--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student presenting the results of PBL project"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1823085/1823085_10531544_1588221644681_33245653_10156453624882300_5861055398827524096_n--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student presenting the results of PBL project"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A 7th grade student in Puerto Rico conducting presenting the results of his ecological research project to members of his community</div> <div class="imageCredit">Elvin Estrada</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Giovanna&nbsp;Guerrero-Medina</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student presenting the results of PBL project</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
