<AbstractNarration>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engineering is an important component of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).  However, resources for supporting teachers in implementing these standards are scarce.  This project will address the need for resources by applying an innovative pedagogy called Imaginative Education (IE) to create middle school engineering curricula.  In IE, developmentally appropriate narratives are used to design learning environments that help learners engage with content and organize their knowledge productively.  To fully exploit the potential of this pedagogy, this project will combine IE with transmedia storytelling.  In transmedia storytelling, different elements of a narrative are spread across a variety of formats (such as books, websites, new articles, videos and other media) in a way that creates a coordinated experience for the user.  Once created, the curricula will be implemented in classrooms to research its impact on (1) increasing learners' capacities to engage in both innovative and direct application of engineering concepts, and (2) improving learners'  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) identity.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will be led by Smith College and Springfield Technical Community College in collaboration with Springfield (MA) Public Schools (SPS).  Additional expertise in evaluating the findings will be provided by the Collaborative for Educational Services and an external advisory board of leaders in STEM education and transmedia storytelling.  The project will result in the development of a transmedia learning environment that includes two NGSS-aligned, interdisciplinary engineering units and seven lessons that integrate science and engineering.  The research study will be implemented in four phases in eight SPS middle schools.  Approximately 900 students will participate each year.  In Phase 1, the project team will collaborate with SPS teachers to create engineering units, lessons, and standards-based achievement measures.  In Phase 2, teachers in the treatment group will participate in professional development (PD) workshops covering IE, transmedia learning environments, structure of the curriculum, and connections to NGSS.  In Phase 3 the curricula will be implemented in treatment classrooms and both treatment and control group students will be assessed.  In Phase 4, testing and assessment will continue in SPS schools and will be expanded to rural and suburban classrooms.  Teachers in these classrooms will use online multimedia PD that will ensure scalability and mirrors the structure and content of in-person PD.  Data analysis will provide evidence of whether this imaginative and transmedia educational approach improves students' capacities for using engineering concepts and enhances their STEM identity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
