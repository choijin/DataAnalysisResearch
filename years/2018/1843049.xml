<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in the increase in efficiency and reduction in cost of gathering information in surface water environments using unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). USVs have the potential to increase accessibility to bodies of water, enhance coverage, and make data collection safer by removing humans from the task. However, to fully realize the potential of USVs for gathering information, a level of autonomy with minimal need for human supervision and intervention is required. The development of this technology will open the door to the pervasive use of USVs for environmental data collection, and ultimately benefit society through: i) more information upon which to base decisions about resource management and environmental policy; ii) higher frequency of data collection activities through reduced cost; and iii) increased safety by keeping human personnel out of harsh environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lay the foundation for a transformative approach to environmental data collection in surface waters. The intellectual merit of this project lies in addressing technical challenges that will enable unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to effectively navigate autonomously in complex surface waters that may contain a range of diverse obstacles, which would otherwise be inaccessible or at best require a high degree of human supervision. This will be achieved by advancing the state-of-the-art in computer vision and machine learning toward intelligent obstacle characterization. The proposed framework interprets images or video of obstacles to extract salient features, such as flexibility or rigidity, through the innovative use of machine learning, dimensionality reduction, and tools borrowed from the analysis of collective behavior. This extra layer of information provided through the proposed framework represents a significant advancement in computer vision, which offers direct benefits to environmental monitoring and data collection by empowering USVs with new unmanned capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This SBIR Phase I project advanced the state-of-the-art in robotics-based data collection in surface water environments. Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have the potential to increase accessibility to bodies of water, enhance coverage, and make data collection safer and more efficient by operating autonomously. However, to fully realize the potential of USVs for data collection, a level of autonomy with minimal need for human supervision and intervention is required.  Currently available USVs are typically controlled by a person remotely, and some may have the ability to operate autonomously by following a set of pre-programmed GPS waypoints. Remote controlling a USV limits the practical range to line-of-site, while GPS waypoints require careful planning, and do not account for unforeseen obstacles such as protruding rocks, floating debris, or other boaters.  This project addressed technical challenges that will enable USVs to effectively navigate autonomously in complex surface waters that may contain a range of diverse obstacles, which would otherwise be inaccessible or at best require a high degree of human supervision. The framework interprets images and video of potential obstacles to form an intelligent decision to avoid or ignore them. As one example, this is particularly useful in bodies of water that may have an abundance of light vegetation. Common practice would be to avoid all regions not classified as strictly water, however in such an environment, this would leave much of the domain unnecessarily unexplored, as light vegetation may be of no harm to a USV. This framework analyzes the motion of the potential obstacle, and in the case of light vegetation, instructs the USV to ignore it as an obstacle.  Research activities for this project first focused on the collection of image and video data in surface waters, as the development of the framework was predicated on such data for developing, training, and testing.  A semantic segmentation framework aimed at classifying water/non-water regions at an adequate framerate on low-cost hardware was then created to segment out any potential obstacles in the environment.  Finally, a machine learning framework that analyzes motion characteristics of potential obstacles was developed to classify them as a region that should be avoided by the USV or simply ignored.  Overall, the system exhibited promising results that demonstrated the feasibility of combining complex machine learning and computer vision algorithms with low-cost hardware to perform intelligent obstacle classification.  The approach relies purely on image data and requires only a camera and low-cost embedded computer, suggesting it can be offered on the market at an affordable price.  This innovation is expected to open the door to the pervasive use of USVs for environmental data collection.  The broader impact of this technology is anticipated to reduce the cost of performing water quality monitoring or hydrographic surveys, and in turn benefits the fields of environmental science and hydrography with a new means to efficiently gather data.  As a result, it is expected that the increased amount of data afforded by this technology will ultimately benefit society and the environment by enabling more thorough environmental monitoring programs.
