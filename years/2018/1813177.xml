<AbstractNarration>The Centre de Recherches Math√©matiques (CRM, Montreal, Canada) is organizing a Thematic Semester on "Mathematical Challenges in Many-Body Physics and Quantum Information" during September-December 2018 (http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/Quantum2018/index.php/). The purpose of this project is to support the participation of junior researchers from US institutions in the first two workshops of the program: 1) Many-Body Quantum Mechanics (September 10-14, 2018) and 2) Entanglement, Integrability and Topology in Many-Body Systems (September 17-21, 2018). Participants to the workshops will also have the opportunity to interact with the approximately 20 junior and senior researchers who will be in residence at the CRM for an extended period during the program. The goal is to accelerate progress in the mathematical foundations and techniques of the emerging new directions in quantum science and technology and to attract young talent to this exciting endeavor as well as to better equip them for successful research in this area. In this way, the project will contribute to realizing "The Quantum Leap: Leading the Next Quantum Revolution," one of the NSF's 10 Big Ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first workshop is on the general topic of many-body quantum mechanics. Researchers working on different questions related to many-body quantum mechanics will discuss recent developments, exchange ideas and propose new challenges and research directions such as: i) the derivation of effective equations, ii) disordered many body systems, iii) open quantum systems in and out of equilibrium, and iv) quantum spin systems. The second workshop is devoted to entanglement, integrability, and topology in many body systems. Its main motivation is the exploration of concepts related to entanglement that have emerged as an important theoretical tool in tackling one of the central goals of condensed matter physics: the understanding and characterization of phase transitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
