<AbstractNarration>This award funds travel expenses for undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career investigators, in particular individuals from underrepresented groups, who present research results at the American Physiological Society (APS) Intersociety Meeting, Comparative Physiology: Complexity and Integration, in New Orleans, Louisiana, October 25-28, 2018. The meeting will be a venue for the presentation of significant advances in understanding the integrative physiology of organisms, including humans and other animals. This meeting is an opportunity for comparative physiologists to report their newest research discoveries and to develop collaborations that spark scientific innovation. Broader impacts of the meeting include: significant advancement of knowledge about organismal physiology; greater participation of individuals from underrepresented groups in comparative physiology research; development of a globally diverse and more collaborative research workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2018 APS Intersociety Meeting, Comparative Physiology: Complexity and Integration, seeks to promote the exchange of ideas and development of future collaborations of comparative and evolutionary physiologists internationally, and to encourage trainees, early career investigators, and individuals from underrepresented groups to pursue research careers in this discipline. The conference includes plenary lectures, symposia, contributed oral and poster presentations, and workshops on career development and technological/educational advances. In order to achieve the conference objectives above, APS will administer a travel grant program offering travel awards to trainees (undergraduate/graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) and early career investigators, in particular individuals from underrepresented groups (women, racial/ethnic minorities, and disabled persons), who submit abstracts to be presented at the meeting. Travel awards resulting from this award will be directed to individuals working in the research areas supported by the NSF Division of Integrative Organismal Systems. The project will contribute to broadening the participation of young scientists, with an emphasis on members of under-represented groups, exposing them to cutting edge physiological research and providing unique opportunities for professional development and networking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The specific objectives of the travel award program were to: 1) promote participation of young scientists with an emphasis on women and under-represented minorities through a travel award program; 2) interest trainees in pursuing research to understand physiological processes; and, 3) provide opportunities to form new collaborative interactions with international scientists.      Through the program, APS made 17 awards to post-doctoral and graduate student trainees to help offset the cost of their attendance at the intersociety meeting (Table 1).     While the specific demographic of the individuals that received support was not collected 53% of those supported were women. Travel award recipients were able to participate in 2 plenary lectures given by leaders in the field, as well as 37 symposia; with sessions focused on a broad range of themes in comparative physiology from molecular whole animal physiology with both general biological and clinical applications. The awardees were able to learn about the research a diverse group of speakers and interact with several hundred fellow international researchers.     Overall, the 2018 APS intersociety meeting Travel Award Program achieved one of its intended broader impacts to significant advancement of knowledge about the integrative physiology of organisms; greater participation of individuals from underrepresented groups in comparative physiology research; development of a globally diverse and more collaborative research workforce; with the ultimate impact of improving the well-being of individuals in the U.S and beyond.
