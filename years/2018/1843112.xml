<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to significantly lower the cost and expand the number of addressable markets for ice thermal energy storage. Cost effectively storing energy is imperative to a sustainable future. Storage can provide reliable access to power from intermittent renewable sources, increase the resiliency of the grid to weather events or terrorist attacks, and increase the utilization efficiency of existing assets, deferring costly upgrades. Today, ice thermal storage systems help building owners shift cooling loads from costly peak hours to when electricity is less expensive. Unfortunately the upfront cost of these systems, driven by the large cost of the cooling coil used to generate ice, prevents adoption from many users and has unduly restricted the number of addressable markets for ice thermal storage. Elimination of ice buildup on the cooling coil would reduce the size of the coil, and more importantly significantly lower the cost of these systems. Low-cost ice thermal energy storage could greatly improve the economics for long-duration energy storage technologies such as pumped thermal energy storage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to translate the discovery of surfaces with zero ice adhesion into a cooling coil that can be integrated into a functioning ice thermal energy storage system. In order to repel ice, these surfaces require complete submersion in an immiscible oil phase, making coil geometry and overall system development challenging. At the beginning of this project, various plate and tube based cooling coil geometries will be systematically prototyped and refined, measuring the freezing and melting heat transfer efficiencies. Different formulations of the surface coating will be tested as well. The most promising candidate geometries will be charged and discharged over multiple cycles as part of an ice thermal energy storage system. The results from cycling will be compared to conventional ice-on-coil technology using metrics such as energy density and heat transfer efficiency. An ice shedding cooling coil, at less than a third of the size of an ice-on-coil system, is expected to deliver improved cooling performance. Demonstration of an ice shedding cooling coil in a functioning ice thermal energy storage system will prove the technology?s readiness to scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

We explored this new design paradigm using the customer voice as our guide: lower upfront capital expense, minimize operational costs, improve energy efficiency, and lower spatial constraints.  Outcome #1  Capital and operational costs for a thermal storage system can be significantly improved by increasing the performance of the system's heat exchanger. We measured a 100% improvement in the freezing heat transfer coefficient for an icephobic heat exchanger when compared to published data from Calmac, an ice storage market leader that was acquired by Trane in 2017.

Outcome #2  Regarding cooling operational costs, the discharge (or melting) rate has the largest impact on reducing a building's peak power consumption (and demand charge). Our twenty-five fold improvement in discharge rate compared to Calmac, once again measured experimentally, is primarily driven by our ability to access convective heat transfer in an IHEX system, as opposed to relying on thermal conduction through stagnant water.  Outcome #3  In general, the refrigeration system's operating temperature has the greatest impact on an ice thermal storage system's energy efficiency. The aforementioned improved cooling rate, combined with our extended IHEX plate-based heat exchanger geometry, reduces the internal volume of an icephobic heat exchanger to one-eighth of conventional ice storage systems.
