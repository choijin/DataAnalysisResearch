<AbstractNarration>The 2018 Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group on Measurement and Evaluation (SIGMETRICS) conference will be held at Beckman Center, Irvine, California on June 18-22, 2018. SIGMETRICS brings together professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds in what has become a premier forum for discussing the development and application of state-of-the-art, broadly applicable analytic, simulation, and measurement-based performance evaluation techniques. The SIGMETRICS conference presents innovative, exciting work related to all aspects of performance for all types of computer systems. Highly original ideas, new approaches, and/or ground breaking results are expected. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel support will make possible the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend. Particular attention is paid to directing support towards under-represented groups, e.g., gender or ethnic minorities and students from smaller or less well-known institutions. The support will provide students who attend with the opportunity to interact with a diverse group of mentors and peers, furthering their education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
