<AbstractNarration>To advance the use of novel technologies to increase student learning outcomes, educational technology must be coupled with a deep understanding of how students learn and retain information. Thus, technology and the learning environment must work together to enable pedagogical approaches that promote student-centered learning. To set a research agenda for the technology-enhanced learning environment of the future, this collaborative project will conduct a series of events that explore the Future of Innovative Learning Environments.  These events will include a series of interactive, online discussions followed by an in-person workshop. Workshop participants will include twenty-nine expert participants from academia, industry, and nonprofits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to inform the future of learning environments in STEM higher education.  The project will consider the near-term and longer-term impacts, opportunities, challenges, and future research initiatives related to the development and implementation of innovative learning environments. This project will include three components: 1) Interactive, online discussions (microlabs) prior to the workshop will introduce participants to different innovative learning environments and solicit feedback from a range of stakeholders;  2) Participants at a two-day in-person workshop will engage in creative activities that help them envision how innovative learning environments might transform STEM higher education; and 3) the PIs and invited participants will synthesize the discussions and produce a report that can guide future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The eXploring the Future of Innovative Learning Environments (X-FILEs) project addressed the following question:    What are the near-term and longer-term impacts, opportunities, challenges, and future research initiatives related to the development and implementation of innovative learning environments (ILEs) in higher education STEM disciplines?    The PIs used an innovative project format in which participants gained background knowledge through interactive, online meetings prior to the workshop, enabling them to think more deeply about the topics during face-to-face discussions. Workshop attendees worked in multidisciplinary teams to explore each ILE category in terms of its opportunities for learning gains, barriers that may inhibit its implementation, potential implementation strategies, and future research. Attendees addressed these issues for all levels of STEM higher education, from community college to graduate school and both online and traditional formats.    Teams summarized their work and these notes formed the project report that weaves ideas together into a broad-based guide for the successful implementation of ILEs in STEM subjects within higher education.    Webinar and workshop attendees took a holistic view of ILE implementation in higher education by considering not only the benefits of ILEs but also addressing the problems that they create and the challenges to their implementation. For instance, how can educators use technology-based ILEs without exacerbating the digital divide among students, and what policies (either within a school or at the state or federal level) must change in order to promote the adoption of ILEs?
