<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the commercialization of a new metal ink technology in the markets of wearable electronics and sensors which depend heavily on printable and conductive inks in scalable manufacturing of electronic circuits on flexible materials.  In today's society wearable electronics and sensors have found increasing applications in daily life, especially for human health monitoring and point-of-care diagnostics via wireless interfaces with smartphones.  The market for wearable electronics and sensors is forecast to reach about $52 billion by 2020, with the market revenue being expected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of about 16%.  Findings from the customer discovery in this project will identify the market opportunity of the technology and develop the business model, leading to potential start-up business, technology licensing, and importantly, a business plan suitable for the product prototyping and evaluation by industrial partners and review by potential investors. The project will also train students and researchers for their better preparation to be entrepreneurially competitive, and to enhance their understanding of what it takes to pursue the entrepreneurship and the technology commercialization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project focuses on determining the commercialization feasibility of a new metal nanoink technology which can enable manufacturers of flexible and wearable electronics and sensors.  While the current use of silver inks has dominated the printable electronics and wearable sensors industries, the high-temperature processing requirement is inadequate for common temperature-sensitive flexible materials and the propensity of metal oxidation or mobility degrades the printed electronics.  To address the pain of high-temperature and high-cost manufacturing with a high failure rate, the core technology in this project features an air-stable and low-cost metal ink formulation with an innovative low-temperature processing capability for manufacturing wearable electronics and sensors on flexible materials.  To be competitive in the global markets of conductive inks and wearable sensors or electronics, key questions in the customer discovery focus on understanding the driving force for the targeted market, the value proposition specific to customer segments, the cost breakdown related to the manufacturing process, the decision-making process in adopting new technologies for manufacturing and packaging, and the major players and influencers in the manufacturing or product ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this I-Corps project was to conduct customer discovery directed at determining the feasibility of commercialization of an air-stable and low-cost metal ink technology in the market of wearable electronics and sensors.  The customer discovery started with testing our hypotheses by identifying the pain points in manufacturing wearable electronics and sensors and the market opportunities.  The activity has provided insights into the business model development, especially in the areas of value proposition and customer segments, for translating the technology in the market of manufacturing wearable electronics and sensors.  There are several key outcomes from the customer discovery and business model development activities.  First, the industry is changing the way we interface with electronics by enabling a wide range of applications of flexible electronics, devices, or displays with the need of conductive inks to partially or entirely print electronics on different substrate materials.  Examples include displays, touch screens, and sensors for medical and automotive applications.  Analysis of the customer interviewing results indicates that lightweight, low cost materials, flexibility, and low temperature processing are some of the driving factors enabling differentiation and premium pricing, especially for automotive sensors and touch screen sensors.  There are rapidly emerging customer segments of conductive inks in the manufacturing of wearable devices, medical sensors, and flexible displays. The market size for conductive inks is in the range of $2-4 billion.  The team has identified sensors for air-quality monitoring as a specific starting point of the major customer segments. In the current market of air-quality monitoring, most of the existing sensors are expensive and lacking of portability, reliability and long-term stability. There is a clear need of air quality sensors which are small and low cost for wearable or portable use, or having disposable and replaceable sensing component in applications. For customers in manufacturing sensors for air-quality monitoring, who need low-cost, durable and reliable conductive inks to print sensing patterns on low-cost substrates, the new technology provides low-temperature processing, air-stable and low-cost conductive inks with the same electrical performance. This technology is unlike main competitors technologies which require photonic, reductive gas or high-temperature processing which adds manufacturing cost and are inadequate for temperature-sensitive low-cost substrates.    This project is currently in the stage of developing plans going forward in terms of further business model refinement, IP, prototyping, pilot testing, fundraising to bring the technology to the air-quality monitoring sensor market.  Work is in progress seeking SBIR/STTR funding and establishing partnerships with related companies.   In addition to training the new generation of entrepreneurs in the technology commercialization front, this project has also had positive impact on the research and development front in alignment with the technology value proposition, and on the education front by incorporating some of the Lean Startup methodologies into graduate and undergraduate classrooms and laboratories.
