<AbstractNarration>In many scientific and engineering applications, it is necessary to&lt;br/&gt;solve an inverse problem; that is, to determine quantities defining an&lt;br/&gt;object or a system through indirect measurements.  The mathematics&lt;br/&gt;used to produce images in devices such as X-Ray Computed Tomography&lt;br/&gt;(CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are excellent examples.  The&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models describing an inverse problem are often so&lt;br/&gt;complicated that it is not possible to find an exact analytical&lt;br/&gt;solution, and it is necessary to use an approximation based on a set&lt;br/&gt;of simpler equations.  However, many equations may be needed; in&lt;br/&gt;medical imaging, for example, it is not unusual to compute&lt;br/&gt;approximations by solving millions of equations.  Additional&lt;br/&gt;complications arise because an inverse problem may have infinitely&lt;br/&gt;many solutions, or the solutions may change dramatically if there are&lt;br/&gt;small errors in the indirect measurements.  Thus, additional&lt;br/&gt;constraints and mathematical tools (often referred to as&lt;br/&gt;regularization) are needed to narrow the search to a set of&lt;br/&gt;appropriate feasible solutions, and to stabilize the computations.&lt;br/&gt;The type and amount of regularization is problem dependent, requiring&lt;br/&gt;the algorithms to be able to easily adapt to user and/or problem&lt;br/&gt;specifications.  The aim of this project is develop a flexible and&lt;br/&gt;adaptable computational platform that can be used for this important&lt;br/&gt;class of problems, which arise in many application areas, including&lt;br/&gt;space object identification, geophysics, microscopy and medical&lt;br/&gt;imaging. Thus advancements made from this project have the potential to&lt;br/&gt;benefit national defense, energy exploration, and human health.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Efficient iterative methods to compute regularized solutions of&lt;br/&gt;large-scale discrete ill-posed inverse problems will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;The approach will use flexible Krylov subspace iterative methods, and&lt;br/&gt;will exploit low-rank structure of data, solutions and operators. The&lt;br/&gt;approach will allow to incorporate a variety of regularization&lt;br/&gt;techniques, including sparse and low-rank constraints on the solution.&lt;br/&gt;The methods developed in this project can be used as tools to obtain&lt;br/&gt;approximate solutions of ill-posed inverse problems, and optimized&lt;br/&gt;implementations will be included in a new MATLAB package called IR&lt;br/&gt;Tools (Iterative Regularization Tools).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
