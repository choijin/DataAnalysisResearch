<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project has to do with the emerging field of Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMI). One of the main techniques for such interfaces is magnetoencephalography (MEG), where brain waves are read by using highly-sensitive magnetometers. A substantial technological hurdle exists in bringing such techniques to the mass market, however, in that existing equipment for performing MEG studies is based on SQUID (Superconducting QUantum Interference Device) magnetometers, which requires temperatures below 1K and highly specialized, shielded facility. These requirements mean that existing MEG facilities are very expensive both to acquire and operate and there exists only a handful of such facilities around the world. This I-Corps project aims to bring this technology to mass market using a recent breakthrough that shows potential for MEG at room temperature, in an unshielded environment and in 1000X smaller form factor. This will enable wider adoption and use of the technology in clinical and research settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project further develops a magnetic field sensor with sensitivity comparable to that of SQUID (Superconducting QUantum Interference Device) magnetometers while maintaining the ability to operate unshielded in Earth's ambient magnetic field and at room temperature. This sensor leverages the newly discovered phenomenon of Acoustically Driven Ferromagnetic Resonance (ADFMR) in order to operate. By using strain waves instead of microwaves to drive ferromagnetic resonance, this technique increases the coupling between the excitation wave and the magnetic element by several orders of magnitude.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The commercial potential of portable, high sensitivity magnetic sensors is based on the broad societal need for magnetic sensing in several widely-used medical imaging technologies, such as magnetoencephelography (MEG) and magnetocardiography (MCG).  Measuring extremely weak magnetic fields and field gradients created by the human body (on the order of 100 femtoTesla (fT) for MEG [1]) currently requires the use of superconducting SQUID magnetometers.  In order to perform with high sensitivity, however, SQUIDs require cryogenic cooling and magnetic shielding.  This leads to a bulky and power-hungry infrastructure for operating the system that dramatically reduces their portability and increases their cost.   A truly portable, room-temperature package that can operate outside of a shielded environment would substantially decrease the cost and space required for this equipment, making these diagnostic tools more widely accessible. This portability enhancement would then allow these diagnostic techniques to be used on critically ill or untransportable patients (those in the ICU, in the operating theater, and in the field) &ndash; a segment that has thus far seen little gain from advancements in medical imaging beyond the CT scanner.  Ultimately, however, a portable system with widespread accessibility would enable significant advancement in understanding the human brain, which would have far-reaching societal impacts.  This market opportunity has been preliminarily validated by talking to potential customers through both the regional Bay Area NSF I-Corps program and the National NSF I-Corps program, where we interviewed over 100 potential customers. We interviewed neurologists at a wide array of institutions, such as academically-affiliated hospitals, private practices and community hospitals, as well as other members of the hospital purchasing ecosystem in order to test our hypotheses on product-market fit.  By using the customer discovery process and the corresponding Lean Launchpad framework, we were able to learn a great deal about our market. For example, we found that there is a complex customer ecosystem involved in marketing our product &ndash; one that includes patients, neurologists, neurology department heads, and hospital purchasing committees. We found that in order to sell capital equipment (anything over a cost of $5000) to department heads and purchasing committees, it is necessary to have a doctor ‘champion’ your product (which only consider equipment presented by such doctors). These doctors are critical to the sales process, and need to be the main target of any marketing efforts.  Moreover, to maintain these relationships, we would need to provide not only the product, but also service contracts to maintain our product.  While Sonera Magnetics will currently focus on technical feasibility and product development, we will ultimately need to acquire a strong sales force and technical support staff.  By interviewing over 100 potential customers and learning a great deal about the medical diagnostics market and the needs of our potential customers, we ultimately identified our first segment &ndash; neurologists at academic hospitals who refer patients to other locations for MEG scans due to lack of access at their home institution.  Both neurologists and hospital purchasing committees at these institutions are more willing to purchase new technology because they are less cost-constrained and have greater incentive to provide world-class medical care to their patients, as this impacts the institution’s reputation.
