<AbstractNarration>US-Spain Collaboration in Computational Neuroscience, Madrid, February 15-16, 2018.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a workshop, led by Adrienne Fairhall and Javier Mart?n Buld?, on US-Spain collaboration in computational neuroscience.  The workshop builds on the interests of multiple NSF directorates and NIH institutes, and Spain's State Research Agency (AEI), in this rapidly developing area of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop has been organized to explore the intellectual opportunities, broader impacts, and practical considerations needed for US-Spain collaboration to be successful, with researchers and government representatives from the US and Spain in attendance.  A report from the workshop will be made available at http://www.nsf.gov/crcns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
