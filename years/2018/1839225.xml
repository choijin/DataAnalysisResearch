<AbstractNarration>The Gemini Observatory operates two large telescopes, one in Hawai'i and one in Chile.  These two telescopes provide astronomers in the U.S., Canada, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile with access to the whole sky. Using modern instruments on each telescope, astronomers are able to study everything from asteroids, comets and nearby planets, to huge super-bright stars and distant galaxies.  Plans are now under way at Gemini to prepare each telescope for a new decade of discovery. Astrophysics in the 2020s will be revolutionized by "Multi-Messenger Astronomy", an exciting new field that uses gravitational waves and high-energy particles, as well as ordinary everyday light, to study some of the most exotic objects and explosive events in the Universe. Facilities like NSF's Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), the NSF/University of Wisconsin IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory, and NSF's latest telescope, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), will detect these "messengers", changing the way we study the Universe. In support of these remarkable new observatories, Gemini will develop new computer software and new optics hardware so that astronomers can study each new discovery quickly and in high detail. In addition to making remarkable discoveries and doing amazing science, Gemini is also a leader in education, public information and outreach activities. Gemini staff bring science to the communities in both Hawai'i and Chile through unique programs such as Journey through the Universe, AstroDay, and Viaje al Universo. With this new award they will extend their reach by developing a Planetarium show that will help the public better understand Multi-Messenger Astronomy. Gemini will also run workshops for educators and communicators so that they too can explain the exciting new discoveries that will surely be made by LIGO, IceCube, LSST and Gemini over the coming decade. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gemini has proposed a challenging though very exciting program of cutting-edge development activities that are in line with NSF's strategic goals and those of its international partners in the Gemini Observatory. The enhancement of existing Adaptive Optics (AO) capabilities at Gemini-S and particularly Gemini-N on Maunakea, one of the best sites in the world for high-resolution imaging, will ensure that the observatory remains competitive in the 2020s, in the run-up to the commissioning of 30-to-40 meter class telescopes at the end of the coming decade.  Wide-field AO-corrected infrared imaging at Gemini will complement a similar capability on the James Webb Space Telescope, which will hopefully be executing its prime mission in the 2020s. At the same time, in collaboration with other national facilities, Gemini staff will develop and mature software aimed specifically at preparing Gemini for time domain and multi-messenger astronomy in a decade when LIGO and LSST will drive many of the most exciting science discoveries. The proposal's goal of ensuring that Gemini is the best positioned public 8-meter class facility for follow-up activities is clearly consistent with the wishes of the observing communities at home and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
