<AbstractNarration>In response to and in alignment with an effort undertaken by the National Science Foundation's Computer and Information Systems and Engineering (CISE) Directorate to increase broadening participation in computing (BPC) activities among its Principal Investigators (PIs), the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) and the National 4-H Council (4-H) will pilot an effort to support CISE PIs in engaging underserved youth in computer science(CS) - specifically computational and algorithmic thinking - during out-of-school time settings.  The project will develop a CS Professional Development (CSPD) toolkit that includes real-world, video-based learning modules, facilitated in-person professional development opportunities, and distance learning experiences to support educators in encouraging youth to develop their CS skills. Materials in the toolkit with be developed and, in some cases, delivered by members of the CISE community. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;4-H reaches nearly six million youth through the nation's land grant university (LGU) system, and has already embarked on a partnership with Google to teach youth both technical and interpersonal skills at three LGUs. This proposal will expand upon that foundation by developing, designing, and testing CS professional development resources at those three 4-H OST CS sites. The resources will then be packaged into a transferable toolkit that can be eventually scaled to reach the 600,000 volunteers and 3,500 educators that currently facilitate 4-H programming within LGUs and potentially opening the door for many additional members of the CISE community to contribute to 4H activities on a regular basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Empowering Out-of-School Time Educators and Students through 4-H and the Land-Grant System project developed the Computer Science toolkit (CS Toolkit), which is an online video-based professional development resource designed for afterschool and out-of-school time staff and volunteers.  The resources are available at Click2SciencePD.org and are available to anyone.  The purpose of Click2SciencePD.org is to provide research-based professional development resources that support out-of-school time educators in developing themselves or their employees? skills in facilitating STEM experiences.  Eight hours of professional development were produced in this project, and additional resources are currently being developed.   A pilot of these resources was conducted in four states through partnerships between the state 4-H program and the computer science department at a land-grant university in their state.  These partnerships were used to train a team within each state to use the CS Toolkit to provide professional development for educators, staff, and volunteers from their university, 4-H, and other out-of-school time programs.  A train the trainer workshop was conducted to train 19 4-H and computer science faculty that were going to pilot the professional development resources.  Feedback from trainers was gathered through focus groups at the end of the project. The workshops could be facilitated virtually or in person.  Some of the resources are designed to be delivered in two-hour segments and others in half hour segments.  The resources can also be combined for a four or six-hour workshop.  The research question for this project is what extent do these professional development experiences improve staff and volunteer confidence in engaging youth in computer science programs?  Confidence before and after the experiences was assessed through online surveys at the conclusion of workshops.   During the pilot, 19 workshops were offered across the four states using the resources from the CS Toolkit.  These workshops reached 305 staff, educators, teachers, and volunteers. Of those, 217 individuals participated in the Click2Science survey regarding their confidence in facilitating computer science experiences (71% response rate).  One of the questions asked on the survey was ?How confident are you facilitating activities that help youth develop an understanding of computational thinking??  The mean response for all participants fell between slightly confidant and moderately confidant before the professional development and just below very confidant after.  On all of the other questions, before training responses fell between slightly confidant and moderately confidant, while after the training the levels were just below very confidant to extremely confidant.  The increases in confidence levels were statistically significant and showed that participants? confidence in facilitating computer science experiences did improve after training.  We also conducted focus groups with the trainers about using the CS Toolkit.  The trainers loved the videos and thought the resources were satisfactory. We found that trainers with experience teaching were more willing and had an easier time adapting the resources to suit their audiences. Trainers with less teaching experience frequently requested supplemental materials that would help them deliver the professional development (e.g., PowerPoints, answer keys, etc.). No matter how versed trainers were in teaching, all seemed to want more guided tinkering time and instruction on the computer science activities that were included in the trainings.  The initial train-the-trainer program did not include enough time to try out all the activities.   This project was designed to broaden participation in computer science by students in grades K-12 by developing the computer science capacity within out-of-school time programs such as 4-H.  This project has shown that the Computer Science toolkit resources have improved the confidence level of people completing the professional development, and thus helped develop capacity in this area.  Future work will focus on developing more resources and building stronger partnerships between computer science departments and out-of-school time programs.
