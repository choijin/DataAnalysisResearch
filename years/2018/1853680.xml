<AbstractNarration>Marginal aridlands have been converted to farmlands to support increasing demand of food production. In these areas, intensive irrigation, coupled with high evapotranspiration and limited groundwater recharge, has led to accumulation of pedogenic carbonate and production of abiotic CO2 in agricultural lands. This project will be among the first to quantify such an abiotic CO2 efflux, and to define key linkages between flood irrigation, salt loading and soil-atmosphere CO2 exchange in desert agricultural soils. This project is transformative in that it examines how pedogenic carbonate formation in irrigated agricultural systems, an under-studied process but continuously magnified by human activities, impacts C cycling in one of the largest biomes on Earth. More importantly, this project has significant socioeconomic relevance at global scales, because irrigation-induced salt accumulation and elevated CO2 efflux need to be remediated through improved agricultural practice and management. This project is also highly relevant for advancing STEM education to representative population of the southwestern U.S. It will provide interdisciplinary training opportunities in Critical Zone Science, environmental geophysics and isotope geochemistry, and advanced sensor technology for both graduate and undergraduate students from primarily under-represented groups at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) where 80% of student body is Hispanic. This project will directly support two Ph.D. and four undergraduate students, and provide field experience and learning opportunities to environmental science and geology majors, including two-week summer field trips. For education and outreach, hands-on activities will be presented at the annual "Earth Science Day" at UTEP, which generally attracts ~2000 visitors from the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three agricultural sites and one natural site along the Rio Grande valley, that are typical and representative of aridland settings worldwide, will be examined in the study. Geochemical, geophysical and isotopic tools will be combined with newly designed CO2 sensors to test the overarching hypothesis that "pedogenic carbonate accumulation in irrigated desert soils emits an important anthropogenically induced flux of CO2 to the atmosphere." The project will identify "naturally formed" versus "irrigation-induced" pedogenic carbonate in agricultural soils, separate "abiotic" and "oil respired" CO2 in soil gases, and monitor the spatiotemporal variation of abiotic CO2 efflux from land to atmosphere at field scales. By identifying the major controls (including irrigation intensity and chemistry, soil texture, and type of crops), expected datasets from this field-based study can be extrapolated to large regional scales and provide the first essential assessment on the potential of irrigated agriculture to modify the land-atmosphere carbon exchange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
