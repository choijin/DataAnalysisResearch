<AbstractNarration>Large-scale, unpredictable disturbances such as storms can alter the environment, eliminating or evolutionarily changing plant and animal life, with potentially long-lasting effects.  The goal of this project is to understand the role of foraging and aggressive behavior in determining hurricane survival in the honey bees of Puerto Rico. Africanized bees invaded Puerto Rico in the 1950's, initially creating highly aggressive populations as has occurred elsewhere. Since their introduction, the Africanized bees of Puerto Rico have uniquely become less aggressive over time, as evidenced by a wealth of pre-hurricane genetic and behavioral data. This project addresses the hypothesis that storms, such as Hurricane Maria that hit Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, select against more aggressive colonies and favor bees that invest more in foraging and food hoarding. The researchers will test this hypothesis by sampling the remaining post-hurricane populations and comparing them with the pre-hurricane data. RAPID funding will provide the opportunity to study both genetic and behavioral traits of survivors and their offspring within the months immediately following the storm. The study of a population's response subsequent to major environmental and anthropogenic disturbances is of importance to the understanding of processes that shape natural and agricultural ecosystems. This project will also support Puerto Rican students to maintain research productivity in a lab severely damaged by the hurricane. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The genomes of bees from post-Hurricane Maria wild populations and domestic populations will be sequenced and analyzed to determine signatures of selection or genetic bottleneck by comparing them with pre-hurricane genotypes. Polymorphic markers across the genome will be used to test a larger number (&gt;1500) of specimens over a greater geographic area (i.e. Puerto Rico) to examine evolutionary trends and processes.  Comparisons of genetics, genomics and behavior of pre- and post-hurricane, feral and domesticated populations will test hypotheses on role of large disturbances such as hurricanes or anthropogenic influences on reducing aggressive behavior in Africanized honey bees.  Untangling the effects of chance and selective processes on honey bee genomes may identify a novel and general role of environmental disturbance in the evolution of aggressive behavior in colonial organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Large-scale, unpredictable disturbances such as storms are increasing in frequency and strength.  These disturbances can alter our environment, eliminate plant and animal life, and impacts can be lasting.  The goal of this project is to understand role of chance events vs intrinsic characteristics of organisms in determining hurricane survival in the example of honey bees of Puerto Rico.  The hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico on September 20, 2018, and eliminated an estimated over 80% of honey bee colonies.  There is a wealth of pre-hurricane genetic, genomic, and behavioral data on these gentle Africanized honey bees.  RAPID funding provided the opportunity to study immediate survivors.  Comparison of post-hurricane survivors to pre-hurricane populations lead to untangling impact of chance and selective processes on population genomes, in honey bees.  The genomes of 230 bees collected from feral and bee-keeping populations, pre- and post hurricane Maria  have been sequenced and analyzed to determine genetic markers in the genomic regions that have changed. We identified that in general the large decrease in population of bees resulted in decreased genetic variation.  This is due to the chance event of genetic drift.   In contrast, in specific genes across the genome there has been greater change that cannot be explained by chance.  Specifically variants of 12 genes that are related to information processing (6), gene regulation (4), and energy use (2) were selected in survivors.  Surviving bees are expected to be different in their food search, and use of resources based on these gene changes.   One specific behavior of concern was aggressive defense of the colony, and no genes associated with this behavior were found to be different before and after hurricane.  In addition, behavioral tests demonstrated a stable reduced defensive behavior in colonies and populations compared from 2008 through 2020.    To better examine genes and gene regions that changed in this population we also prepared a reference genome.  A detailed map of location of genes in the genome of Puerto Rico honey bee.  This is needed because location of genes may differ over generations.  In fact, we found multiple reorganization events in the Puerto Rico honey bee genome.  These could explain differences of AHB , Puerto Rico gentleAHB, and the EHB typically used in beekeeping.  Also influence of such change in order of genes on genomes is of significant interest for understanding population changes in general.   One exciting finding is that such a location associated with large scale reorganization of the genome is shown to be associated with colony aggressive behavior.  Chromosome 7 carries a large inversion that would likely resist change and carry across generations because it is different in these bees.  This region is shown to be associated with the lower aggressive behavior of Puerto Rico gAHB.  We speculate that genome organization can underlie stable change in traits, that are resistant to reshuffling due to mating.  This mechanism may be discovered in other organisms.   This study demonstrates that the study of a population’s response subsequent to major environmental and anthropogenic disturbances is of importance to the understanding of processes that affect natural and agricultural ecosystems on islands systems which are less resilient to the effects of damage.  The selective effect of such disturbances in isolated locations, as in Puerto Rico may generate important biodiversity not attainable in a well-connected, interbreeding population in the mainland.
