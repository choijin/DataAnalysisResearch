<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for graduate students and postdocs to attend the 2018 Gordon Research Conference on Photonuclear Reactions, which will be held at Holderness School in Holderness, New Hampshire, August 5 - 10, 2018.  This conference focuses on the physics accessible with electromagnetic probes at US and international facilities, and is especially relevant now that the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility has begun its 12 GeV era.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meetings such as these provide a unique opportunity for junior scientists to participate in discussions in an informal atmosphere that allows them to interact easily with senior scientists. For many early career scientists at this community, it is the first international meeting that they attend. The poster session and poster prize also are prime opportunities for young scientists to present and discuss their work, as well as obtaining recognition from the community.  The organizers have committed to broadening participation at the conference to include underrepresented groups and will advertise the conference in wide range of forums and professional societies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  Gordon Research Conferences are recognized as world premier scientific meetings. The Photonuclear Gordon Research Conference has been held biennially since 1959.  Beyond providing a preeminent meeting place for discussing the study of hadronic and nuclear physics with electromagnetic probes, it also exposes the participants to physics beyond these confines.  Because of its specific format, this conference also provides excellent networking opportunities for younger scientists. Thanks to the fund provided by NSF, 11 young scientists received support to defray their registration cost, and enjoyed a very successful conference.     Conference overview  For over 75 years, Gordon Research Conferences (GRCs) have been recognized as the world's premier scientific conferences, where leading investigators from around the globe discuss their latest work and future challenges in a uniquely informal and interactive format. Participation from students and junior researchers is particularly encouraged.  The Photonuclear Reactions GRC is a forum for the presentation and discussion of the most recent and exciting results in a wide range of subatomic physics topics. Since 1959, this GRC has been a preeminent meeting for the discussion of new ideas and results, even at the preliminary stage, providing ample and unique opportunities for young scientists and leading researchers to interact in the most scientifically stimulating environment. Senior researchers and younger colleagues are housed on campus at the Holderness School, and can meet in an informal, yet rigorous atmosphere. Having left ample time for discussions, and having ?discussion leaders? to organize these, the scientific exchanges have been engaging and rewarding. Formal discussions have been complemented by many private exchanges during the afternoon free time, both on campus and off.  The conference was structured around invited morning and evening talks, and a late afternoon poster session. The afternoons are left on purpose free to promote discussions, exchange of new ideas, and connections among colleagues, while enjoying the many outdoor activities offered by the area.  Topics for the 2018 conference were: Late Breaking Topics, Nucleon in Nuclei, Long Range Structure of Nucleons, Movement of Partons in the Proton, QCD for Neutrino, Hadron Spectrum and QCD, Imaging the Proton in 3D, Innovative Tools for the Study of Hadrons, and Origin of the Proton Mass.      Outcome  The conference has been by many metrics a success. It was attended by 113 participants and received positive evaluations, both in the official survey and in many private communications.    67% of the participants listed country of origin as United States, while 4% listed Asia and 28% listed Europe and Israel.  31% of our participants were female scientists, both speakers and attendees. 57% of our participants were young scientists (graduate students or postdocs).  Among them 10 spoke in the plenary session. We had a total of 42 speakers. 46 participants presented posters most of them being young scientists.      The final mark of success is the decision by the GRC system to renew the Photonuclear reactions  conference to the next cycle (which they did).     Leveraged support and matching resources  The total budget for the conference was $51,150 with $27,200 provided by the Gordon Research Conference organization, $9,000 by a combination of JSA and JLab support, $5000 from NSF and other contributions from Ohio University, Michigan State University and the Center for Frontiers in Nuclear Science at Stony Brooks University. In that sense the NSF funds represented an important part of our budget and were instrumental reaching the target attendance of 110 persons.     Use of NSF funds  The awarded NSF funds, totaling $5000, were  spent to support participation of young scientists. In detail, we awarded registration discounts to the following 11 graduate students, each of them receiving $450.  C. Ayuso, Poster presenter S. Barcus, Poster presenter T. Chetry, Poster presenter R.
