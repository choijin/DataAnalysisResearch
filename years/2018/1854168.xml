<AbstractNarration>Doctoral Dissertation Research: Science in Court: An analysis of selected environmental litigation in the US from 1990 to 2018&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project evaluates how scientific methods and findings have been incorporated in environmental litigation in the United States between 1990 and 2018.  The project focuses on three, key areas: 1) the types of scientific evidence used in litigation and how that evidence influences judicial decisions; 2) the factors that lead litigants to seek scientific information for use in the courtroom, as well as the factors that motivate scientists to provide that information; and 3) how uncertainties in environmental science are framed and addressed in legal disputes. This project has the potential to transform our understanding of how science is introduced, discussed, framed, and used in the judicial branch and, more broadly, in governmental policymaking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use both qualitative and quantitative methods to study about 400 lawsuits that have addressed environmental  matters between 1990 and 2018. There will be a systematic review of the briefs and decisions from these cases, complemented by in-depth interviews with a sample of individuals who participated in the cases.  The study will link the defining factors of the cases (e.g., year, type of litigants, location, legal issue, scientific issue, and judicial decision) to the outcomes of interest.  Doing so will facilitate an investigation of how litigants and the courts are reacting to scientific advances and to efforts by scientists to communicate their work in more accessible ways to nonscientific audiences.  By linking the characteristics of the scientific evidence to the outcomes of cases, the research permits future litigants to better understand how scientific information can be more effectively incorporated in legal reasoning and argumentation.  In turn, courts' decisions may reflect a stronger link between science and legal reasoning.  Furthermore, the results of this research can be utilized by funding agencies to better support research in this area. By characterizing the demand for and supply of environmental science in the courtroom, this project bridges the gaps between science, law, and public policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The dissertation consists of three essays that collectively evaluate how science has been used in climate change litigation in the United States from 1990 to 2018. The research objective is to conduct empirical assessments to find how science affects judicial decisions in climate change lawsuits.&nbsp;The first essay investigates the following research question: to what extent does scientific evidence presented in courts influence the judicial outcome of climate change lawsuits? Based on the analysis of all publicly available legal documents from all 222 lawsuits, the essay explores how much scientific discussion occurred in each lawsuit and its implications on case outcomes. Using the ordered logit regression model, the essay finds that there is a significant correlation between scientific information brought into courts by both plaintiffs and defendants, and the courts' scientific discussion. Furthermore, the essay finds that, while both plaintiffs and defendants significantly affect the courts' scientific discussion, the defendants are more influential than the plaintiffs to the courts' scientific discussions.The second essay takes a qualitative approach to study the same research question studied in the first essay. Using the qualitative methods, the essay explores the legal contexts in which scientific communication becomes critical. The qualitative analysis of 82 in-depth interviews with participants in 13 climate change lawsuits, in which climate science played a major role, shows that there are three contexts in which science becomes (or will become) critically influential in legal decision-making processes. First, science is critical in proving injury-in-fact in lawsuits, and when a state government is a plaintiff (or a part of a plaintiff group), the court is more likely to grant standing for the plaintiffs. Second, attribution science is not yet strong enough to prove causation and redressability. Third, courts mostly credit agency science, which can, at times, become a problem for the scientific community outside of government agencies.&nbsp;The third essay investigates how judges address scientific uncertainty in climate change lawsuits against federal agencies. The essay assessed the court opinions of 54 lawsuits selected from the database of 222 climate change lawsuits to evaluate how scientific uncertainty influences the judges' decision-making. There are three main findings. First, when certain scientific information is perceived to be undisputed among the scientific community, the judges are more likely to credit it. Second, judges are more likely to scrutinize the currency of the data if an agency is accused of using outdated data. Third, judges pay close attention to the scientific uncertainty issues when they are convinced that there is a notable contradiction within the agency decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/13/2021<br>      Modified by: Daniel&nbsp;Kim</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
