<AbstractNarration>1510788&lt;br/&gt;Johnson, Jeremiah&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to investigate the environmental impacts of using distributed energy storage (DES) for power system reserves and to develop operational strategies to mitigate the environmental burdens of the system. As more renewable energy sources are integrated into the power system, additional reserves are required to ensure the functionality and reliability of the system. DES is a promising alternative to generators for providing such reserves because, in general, these resources are more responsive than conventional power plants and costs are increasingly competitive. Due to their low emissions during operation, DES systems are often assumed to reduce environmental impacts. However, due to the complex nature of the power system, the use of DES may lead to negative outcomes under certain system configurations, generation mixes, and reserve requirements. Thus, it is important to thoroughly evaluate the environmental impacts of introducing DES for reserves. Using life cycle assessment (LCA), the researchers will investigate the full environmental impact of providing reserves with DES. Additionally, they will develop a reduced-form LCA that can provide real-time feedback on environmental impacts to power system operators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will advance the fields of industrial ecology and power systems. To evaluate the environmental impact of using DES for power system reserves, LCA will be coupled to optimal power flow (OPF) methods. While fossil fuel combustion is expected to be a major contributor to life cycle environmental impacts, the short product lifetime and operational impacts of using DES demonstrate the importance of upstream and downstream impacts and the need for LCA to robustly determine environmental performance. A key contribution of this work is the application of model reduction techniques to develop reduced-form LCAs so that approximate impacts can be calculated in real-time and used within the OPF. These methods which support the use of LCA for active feedback response could be readily tailored for use in other systems such as transportation and water treatment. This project also advances the formulation of the OPF problem by incorporating life cycle environmental impacts into the objective function and/or constraints. This will help us understand the tradeoff between system operation costs and environmental benefits, informing system operators and policy makers. This project will advance the utility of LCA by tailoring the method to provide active feedback to systems operations. The results of this study will identify operational strategies that improve environmental outcomes for power generation and inform public policies that strategically remove of barriers to participation for DES. This project will also yield educational impacts through the involvement of undergraduate students in research activities and the development of age-appropriate educational activities for K-12 students. The team will develop a factsheet on DES distributed by the Center for Sustainable Systems at the University of Michigan, to serve as a freely available public resource for students, researchers, and policy makers. This project will also support the development of two modules to be integrated into courses for environmental professional students and electrical engineers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Due to declining costs, energy storage devices such as batteries are now rapidly being connected to our power grid.  While these technologies are successfully fulfilling important grid services, the environmental implications of their use are not fully understood.  In this research project funded by the National Science Foundation's Environmental Sustainability program, we addressed the question: What are the environmental impacts of providing power system reserves with distributed energy storage and how can operational strategies influence environmental outcomes?  The reliable operation of the grid requires the provision of reserves to manage real-time imbalances in electricity supply and demand. Conventional generators provide reserves by holding back some capacity so that they can balance demand-supply deviations from forecasted or scheduled values. The integration of variable renewables, such as wind and solar power, increases the need for reserves. However, procuring reserves from generators can result in less efficient operation and increased air pollution. Distributed energy storage (DES), such as batteries, can provide reserves and it was generally assumed that they can do so with less the environmental impact than conventional resources.  To evaluate the environmental impact of using DES for power system reserves, we coupled life cycle assessment (LCA) and optimal power flow (OPF) methods.  The LCA framework allowed for us to consider the impacts of battery materials and manufacturing, use, and end-of-life treatment, while solving the OPF problem provided realistic grid operational results.  Through this grant, we have published several important papers that have produced new knowledge in the relationship between grid energy storage and environmental impacts.  In Lin et al, 2016, we found that the emissions impacts of adding energy storage for power systems reserves are highly case-dependent and can result in an increase in emissions. In systems with high renewable penetration levels and significant renewable curtailment, adding energy storage reduces emissions; in other systems, the impacts on emissions could be positive, neutral, or negative.  We then coupled cradle-to-gate and end-of-life LCA data on Li-ion batteries with a unit commitment and dispatch model of a 9-bus power system with energy storage used for frequency regulation (Ryan, et al., 2018).  This study used a detailed approach to characterize battery degradation and offered an expanded scope and detail for the battery LCA.  This work found that the addition of energy storage changes generator commitment and dispatch, causing changes in the quantities of each fuel type consumed and resulting in increased environmental impacts in most scenarios. We showed that the impacts caused by the changes in the power system operation (i.e., the use phase impacts) outweigh upstream and end-of-life impacts in the majority of scenarios analyzed with the magnitude most influenced by electricity mix and fuel price. Of parameters specific to the battery, round trip efficiency has the greatest effect on the life cycle emissions.  Based on our key finding that changes to power system operations tend to dominate the life cycle environmental impacts, we sought to expand and improve our treatment of battery operations in a manner that better reflects "real world" operational strategies for battery operations.  Namely, energy storage operators typically seek to provide multiple grid and local services to maximize their net revenues.  In Kern et al., 2019, we explored the ability of batteries providing three local services (reducing solar clipping, residential time of use rate management, and commercial demand charge management) while additionally participating in frequency regulation. Our results showed that aggregated BES multitasking leads to significant reductions in the required installed capacity and losses, which would yield environmental benefits from reduced materials and manufacturing burdens of BES and lower offset power needs.  Further investigation showed the potential value of exploring the environmental impacts of "non-traditional" opportunities for energy storage, such as demand response through a building's heating and cooling system to serve as a de facto battery for power system reserves, and the potential value of higher resolution treatment of the human health implications from criteria pollutants.   Through these efforts, this project advanced the state of knowledge of the environmental impacts of grid-connected energy storage and developed novel methods for linking LCA and power systems modeling.  This project also yielded educational impacts through the research involvement of two undergraduate students, both of whom are pursuing graduate degrees related to energy and environment.  In addition, the team supported the development of a factsheet on energy storage distributed by the Center for Sustainable Systems at the University of Michigan, to serve as a freely available public resource for students, researchers, and policy makers.  Course modules for graduate and undergraduate courses have been developed at the University of Michigan and North Carolina State University.
