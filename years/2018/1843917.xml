<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable researchers to recruit participants for clinical trials more quickly and reliably. A major problem in medical research is that a majority of clinical trials are delayed or canceled because of insufficient recruitment of eligible participants. By developing an independent (third-party) data aggregation platform for detailed electronic patient data through this project, researchers will be able to efficiently reach a large pool of potential participants for trials, and increase the likelihood of trial success. The resulting platform will create a much more efficient recruitment system, as the data is shared among the broader research community rather than managed by any individual research organization. With subscriptions and fees per enrolled patient, the platform will be able sustain itself while at the same time lowering recruitment costs for researchers. More broadly, the greater ability to design and execute successful clinical trials will be a huge benefit to the medical community and accelerate the pace of research and new product development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to improve the speed, accuracy, and reliability of clinical trial design and recruitment. Research organizations like pharmaceutical companies and hospitals typically maintain isolated databases with limited, static patient data. This project focuses on building a third-party data platform that elegantly stores and organizes electronic patient data. The design of the platform enables ontological queries, allowing researchers to consult data when designing trials and quickly ?testing? specific inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine feasibility. When proceeding to execute the trial, the platform will rank individuals by likelihood to enroll, and facilitate contact with potential patients that have previously provide consent to be contacted. Initial objectives of the project include the development of a methodology to abstract patient data from medical records, and programming of the database structure. Later the work will focus on quality assurance software, and algorithms to translate free-text trial requirements into filters compatible with said database. The expected outcome is a platform storing accurate data of 200 patients, with filtering and ranking algorithms that match patients to trials with nearly the same accuracy of an experienced recruitment team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Data for medical research is non-uniform, siloed, and often too limited to be useful for translational research involved in pharmaceutical drug development or study design. Sanguine has developed a novel solution in how digital medical data is organized for translational research and study recruitment. It is designed to aggregate and normalize anonymized patient data from multiple sources, including patient-reported outcomes and electronic medical records. The data is contained in an architecture that facilitates ontological queries that include multiple search parameters such as demographics, medications, family of medications, disease severity scores, and clinical terms.  The intellectual merit in the project is in building a database of patients with breadth and depth of data, stored in a uniform, consistent, and highly usable architecture. The software has been a major step forward over existing alternatives. The database has a system of filtering options that provides researchers with valuable tools to design new studies or to recruit study participants.  Researchers may use the software to identify trends or to observe the influence of specific medications on a target group of patients. They may use this information to help focus research efforts that may help identify target biomarkers or to recruit potential study participants. The database can help fulfill studies with eligible participants faster and at a lower cost than the current alternative of utilizing a siloed, institution-specific database of often outdated data.  The broader impacts of this research are that pharmaceutical R&amp;D will be performed more efficiently and accelerate the development of new treatments.
