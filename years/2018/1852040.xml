<AbstractNarration>Georgia Institute of Technology (i.e., Georgia Tech), in collaboration with Clark Atlanta University, Spelman College and Morehouse College, will host 10 undergraduate students per year over 3 years (Summers 2020, 2021 and 2022) to conduct research within topics that span Atmospheric Science, Oceanography and the Geosciences (AOG).  Selected undergraduate participants will work with faculty mentors over a 10-week period that have well established research programs on topics that include meteorology, climate science, geophysics, oceanography and planetary science.  Additionally, students will participate in a number of professional development opportunities in concert with pre-existing REU programming at Georgia Tech.  This includes regular group meetings, a weekly AOG professional development series, team-building activities, undergraduate research symposia and field trips to AOG-related industrial and government sector organizations.  At the end of the program, students will produce a conference-style research presentation and research poster as well as a research paper that may potentially lead to publication of their research. It is anticipated that these research products will prepare participants for graduate school opportunities within the atmospheric, oceanographic, geoscience  and related disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary aims of the multi-institutional NSF REU program in AOG are to: (i) provide high quality research experiences and professional development activities for cohorts of visiting undergraduate researchers, (ii) motivate and prepare talented undergraduates to pursue, and succeed in, graduate study, (iii) assemble a cadre of participants that reflects the diversity of the U.S. population, (iv) attract students from institutions that have limited research activities, (v) continue engagement of the participants beyond the summer program when they return to their home institutions and (vi) foster collaborations in research and instruction between the four institutions in the consortium.  The program seeks to enhance interactions between the institutions in the consortium and thereby enhance the capacity for research at predominantly undergraduate minority-serving institutions.  Furthermore, it is expected that the collaboration within the consortium will provide an opportunity to recruit and train a diverse group of participants, both from within the consortium and across the nation.  The professional development activities described above, in partnership with other pre-existing REU programming at Georgia Tech, serve to acquaint participants with a broad array of projects, enhance their presentation skills, and provide a perspective of AOG research in a scholarly, entrepreneurial, economic, ethical and interdisciplinary framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
