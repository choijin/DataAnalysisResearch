<AbstractNarration>Wireless microscale devices that navigate the body to diagnose and treat disease are a key element of the future of medicine, addressing localized malfunction in neurological, cardiovascular, autoimmune, cancer and other disease areas. Precise localization and spatially addressable communication are the major unresolved challenges. This proposal addresses this challenge by developing a radically new technology for microscale device localization based on magnetic resonance imaging. They will engineer miniaturized integrated circuit transducers to locate and communicate with them in vivo. They call this technology ATOMS - Addressable Transmitters Operated as Magnetic Spins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They will design, implement and optimize the performance of ATOMS in vitro and in vivo and demonstrate precise localization and targeted communication with a spatial resolution of less than 0.5 mm. They will initially focus on two applications: 1) monitor the migration of ATOMS through the gastrointestinal system of live mice, and 2) create a navigation platform for high precision surgery. To develop ATOMS devices with target operating characteristics, they will design integrated circuits capable of sensing the magnetic field, and harvesting sufficient power from the RF output of the MRI to drive the IC's functions, including sensing of local biological processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Localization and real-time tracking of sensors and surgical devices <em>in vivo</em> with high precision are required during many surgical procedures and medical diagnostic techniques. For instance, in orthopedic surgeries, long bone fractures are fixed by putting a metal rod into the bone and holding the two together using screws. It is crucial to know the precise location of the screw-holes before drilling into the fractured bone to put the screws in place. Currently, multiple X-ray images are taken to accurately locate the screw-holes. Another important application is robotic surgery that requires highly precise movement of surgical tools inside the body. The gold-standard technique to achieve precise alignment and positioning of surgical tools and implants during these procedures is X-ray fluoroscopy, which produces real-time images on a screen by using continuous X-ray beams. The total duration of fluoroscopy can vary from 1-15 min per patient and is highly dependent on the skills of the surgeon, thus causing high levels of radiation exposure to the patient, surgeon and staff.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As part of our NSF-funded research at Caltech, we have worked on developing a radiation-free system for high-precision surgical alignment, navigation and tracking, using magnetic-field gradient-based localization of microscale devices. Fig. 1a shows the application of our work in intramedullary nailing, a class of high-precision orthopedic surgery, which requires insertion of a Titanium metal rod into the medullary canal of a fractured bone, followed by locking screws. Our system is designed such that a small electronic device (shown in green) can be attached right next to the screw-hole at a known position on the rod. Another identical device can be installed on the surgical drill. A planar electromagnetic assembly consisting of magnetic field gradient generating coils for X, Y and Z, is placed beneath the surgical bed. The electromagnets produce monotonically varying magnetic fields, resulting in gradients that encode each spatial point uniquely. Fig. 1b shows the magnetic field gradient in the X-direction. The two devices can simultaneously measure and communicate the magnetic field at their respective locations to an external receiver, which maps the field-data to spatial coordinates and displays the relative locations of the devices on a computer screen in real time (Fig. 1a). This can enable the surgical team to maneuver to screw-hole locations without using any X-ray fluoroscopy.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We designed the microdevices D1 and D2 (Fig. 1b) to be completely wireless (for hermetic sealing when used as an implant) and battery-less (to eliminate lifetime and bio-compatibility issues) by custom-designing an ASIC Chip in CMOS technology. We also designed the planar electromagnetic coils (can slide beneath the patient&rsquo;s bed to ensure no inhibition to the surgeon&rsquo;s movement) for creating the 3D magnetic field gradients in a high and scalable FOV. The requirement of planarity and absence of permanent magnets (to avoid interference with metals and ensure safety) made the coil design process challenging, which we overcame by employing the gradient in the <em>magnitude</em> of the field and used a combination of fields to correct for the non-linearity. The complete system was tested <em>in vitro</em> to successfully localize the microdevices with an accuracy of 100mm in 3D, which is better than the typical imaging resolution of 200-500&mu;m obtained by clinically used X-ray imagers and CT systems.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Another focus of our NSF-funded research has been on continuous and real-time monitoring of ingestible microdevices in the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
