<AbstractNarration>This workshop is bringing together experts from different disciplines, including computer scientists, computational chemists and atmospheric chemists to discuss protocols that may lead to development of an artificial organic chemist capable of accurately predicting complex environmental chemistry in non-ideal multiphase systems. The goal of the workshop is to identify strategies that capitalize on computational approaches to solve complex chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participants of the workshop include 20-25 researchers, representing a cross-section across multiphase chemistry and computation, to identify critical open questions in computational chemistry for multiphase systems, as well as to formulate protocols for answering those questions. Topics to be included include discussions on the best combination of experiments involving theory, numerical simulations (e.g. modeling of statistical mechanics and density functional theory), and laboratory and field experimentation to test deep learning techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Detailed understanding of chemistry at interfaces and across phases has the power to describe physicochemical transformations between gaseous, liquid and solid matter on scales ranging from nanoseconds to millennia, subatomic particles to solar systems. A coordinated effort to elucidate, at the molecular level, the interactions of complex mixtures at interfaces and across phases, and develop predictive capability that describes chemical kinetics and changing chemical composition in time with a high degree of accuracy would be pioneering fundamental research for both computer and physical scientists. The dream: Development of an artifically intelligent chemist with human expert accuracy for predicting the fate of organic compounds in mulitphase chemical systems. Five topics to focus study toward achievement of "the dream" are identified and we provide recommendations:  1. Apply new computer scientists (CS) techniques to large scale chemical data sets to improve experimental design and sampling representativeness 2. Develop a CS-PS project for a multigenerational oxidation system at the forefront of environmental chemistry research to provide insights to the critical factors that control and improve predictive skill. 3. Application of an artificially intelligent organic chemist to complex, environmentally realistic kinetic systems has not been attempted and is a good first start 4. Develop an open access database is not necessarily led by NSF and coordinated with other Federal Agencies to facilitate progress in this area is recommended. 5. Application of a coordinated and multidisciplinary project (e.g., DFT modeling, MD modeling, statistical and machine learning-assisted interpretation with experimental chemical data for verification) for a multiphase system at the forefront of environmental chemistry research is an ideal place to start.
