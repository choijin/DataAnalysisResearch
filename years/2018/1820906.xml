<AbstractNarration>Experimental distributed computing services are becoming vital to support emerging cyberphysical systems.  But the capital investment and operational expenses required to sustain experimental research testbeds to host these vital services can grow large. In this project the Leafy edge compute cloud explores a new model for computing research infrastructure -- a software-only, geographically decentralized cloud testbed that expands in size through voluntary contributions of available computing hardware, on a part- or full-time basis. The LEAFY Cloud offers the prospect of a virtuous cycle: as more sites join the LEAFY edge cloud, more software developers and experimenters are attracted to the infrastructure, resulting in the deployment of more applications and services, increasing the value of new contributors offering to host a compute resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop and prototype a viral, sustainable, software-only distributed testbed for Cloud-in-the-Loop Systems, and to explore the issues involved in supporting distributed computing experiments and services. It will incorporate modern orchestration, management, and tenancy technologies, and rely heavily on open source virtualization and cloud management software technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes. LEAFY will be the first multi-tenant wide-area distributed system to deploy systems and experiments using a state-of-the-art micro-services architecture. Two experiments will be hosted and analyzed to evaluate the system: a Distributed Collaborative Visualization System and the Global Data Plane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have built an edge cloud called EdgeNet with over 30 sites offering containers on demand to researchers.  EdgeNet provides distributed computing resources, which are a key feature for networking and distributed systems research and education.  Distributed computing is absolutely critical for competitiveness and security.  Our efforts provide a mechanism for researchers to get ahead of problems in this space and help to shape the state of the art so that users are not at risk.  Building a platform to understand the problems of tomorrow, helps to shape protections for society so that we can avoid potential problems of the future.    Furthermore, there is substantial potential for outreach with industry.  The Linux Foundation is increasingly interested in edge computing efforts.  We believe that the lessons learned from EdgeNet may apply well to their upcoming efforts in this area.  Professor Cappos is engaged in this community and will work to bridge this gap  Our controller and core infrastructure is used by a variety of researchers. We have performed substantial outreach to different communities to make them aware of EdgeNet.  We have demonstrated that it is not only feasible to build such a system but also that scaling up to a larger size would require minimal investment.
