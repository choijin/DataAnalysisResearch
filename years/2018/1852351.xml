<AbstractNarration>The Collaborative Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site: Solar and Alternative Technologies (SALT) will be hosted by the University of Tulsa to encourage undergraduate students to pursue further studies in alternative energy technologies. Among the many issues with fossil fuels are the exhaustion of conventional sources, pollution and water consumption during production, and greenhouse gases formed during burning. Although new sources of fossil fuels are being found and cleaner extraction techniques are being developed, alternatives to fossil fuels are needed that produce fewer greenhouse gases. The overarching goal of the REU's research projects is to advance knowledge and understanding of alternative technologies while reducing dependence on fossil fuels for the production of energy, fuel, clean water, and/or materials. This REU supports the education of students from institutions with few research opportunities, particularly for under-represented groups and first-generation college students. Students will be actively recruited from 2- and 4-year regional institutions in the EPSCOR states Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma, as well as through the national networks of the Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation and American Indian Science and Engineering Society chapters. The students will be mentored throughout their summer research to encourage them to continue their studies in graduate work, with a goal of broadening their representation in academic research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Solar and Alternative Technologies Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site will involve undergraduate students in summer research projects for 10 weeks developing fuel, catalysts, power, clean water, and plastics from renewable sources or using renewable energy. The projects include water desalination and the production of microalgal biofuel, biocatalysts, and nanoellipsoids. More than half of the projects focus on solar energy, ranging from a new way to produce silicon, to the effects of fluid flow patterns on energy production, to the matching of energy resources and needs to create a micro-grid for local energy needs. The undergraduate students will learn about responsible conduct of research, environmental ethics, technical communication through journal articles and oral presentations, and posting about research on social media. Students will give two progress presentations and a final oral report and prepare a final written formal report, similar to a journal article. Tours will include local hydroelectric, solar, wind, geothermal, and waste-to-energy facilities. The goal of the REU is to encourage under-represented groups in the pursuit of graduate studies by mentoring them in undergraduate research. The University of Tulsa will collaborate with Oklahoma State University to evaluate the REU student experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
