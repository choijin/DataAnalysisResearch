<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Hudson River Undergraduate Mathematics Conference 2018" that will be held on April 7, 2018 at the Saint Lawrence University in Canton, New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the conference is to motivate undergraduate students to consider careers and further study in the field of mathematics. The structure of the conference is such that students will be able to network with peers and faculty, as well as to listen to a lecture from an esteemed mathematician,  as to the opportunities and life style afforded mathematical science majors, and to give students an opportunity to present the results of their research.  A strong effort will be made to invite students who are members of underrepresented groups, first generation college students, and women.   More information will be made available at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;https://stratos.skidmore.edu:8002/apex/f?p=113:1:0::::</AbstractNarration>

This year as in the past, the conference provided significant opportunities for undergraduate students to attend a professional conference and present their work, to learn about a diverse range of topics in the mathematical sciences, and to interact with students and faculty with similar interests from other academic institutions.  Below we discuss the outcomes of this conference.     The intellectual merit of this grant is that it funded four innovations to HRUMC, a regional undergraduate mathematics conference that was attended by 158 people who travelled a median distance of 150 miles to attend the conference.  The first innovation at this conference was a series of presentations on further opportunities in the mathematical sciences.

Forty-eight percent of the attendees were female and 18% of the attendees were non-Caucasian based upon the post-conference survey.     Some additional highlights from the post-conference survey.  The response rate for the survey was 81% Attendance among students was 53% female and 23% non-Caucasian. Among the student respondents, 45 (of 96) or      47%  said that attending HRUMC has      influenced their decision to follow a career in the mathematical sciences. About 55% &mdash; 53 of 96 &mdash; of the student      respondents considered HRUMC a ?vital element? of their undergraduate      mathematical experience. Students      and faculty travelled an average of 150 miles to attend the conference. Approximately 35% of those students stated      that they ?Agree? or ?Strongly Agree? that the conference has influenced      their decision to pursue graduate school or advanced study in the      mathematical sciences. Overall 92% of attendees rated their      experience at HRUMC as ?Life changing in a positive way? or ?Positive?.      These rates were 91% for students and 96% for faculty.
