<AbstractNarration>The 9th Annual Power and Energy Conference at Illinois (PECI) will take place on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in February 2018. The objective of this proposal is to request partial support for the registration and accommodation expenses of US-based undergraduate and graduate students traveling to the conference. Beginning in 2010, PECI is the oldest annual, student-run IEEE international conference about power and energy technology. PECI is an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) approved conference and technically co-sponsored by PES, PELS, and IAS professional societies of IEEE. The conference is organized by the IEEE PES/PELS/IAS Joint Graduate Student Chapter at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and is advised by faculty in the Power and Energy area of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. PECI has become a perfect place in the Midwest for industry and academic researchers to discuss future power and energy topics such as renewable energy, machines for electric transportation, smart grid reliability, security of cyber-physical systems, and power electronics for emerging technologies. Thus, the intellectual merit of PECI are the student focused nature of the conference, from the student led steering committee to all technical and presentations, and the high quality publications and posters from student attendees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PECI was founded for three key reasons: 1) to provide students in the Midwest an opportunity to participate in a research conference, 2) to provide a forum for students in the Midwest to present their research progress and outcomes for feedback to a technical audience of peers, industry professional, and 3) to inspire both undergraduate and graduate students to pursue careers in power and energy STEM fields. While PECI impact has expanded over the last eight years to include participants from around the world, we have retained our Midwest roots and mission statement by encouraging participation from Midwest universities, especially undergraduate students for the poster session. By attending PECI students benefit from closer interactions with experts, professors, and industry professionals and&lt;br/&gt;potentially receive advice or mentorship for their future career. In addition to student technical presentations and posters, students also learn about the mega-trends in power and energy and cutting edge research from three industry leaders and experts, who deliver keynote presentations and tours of a local microgrid research facility and new ECE building. Moreover, the importance of pursuing a career in power and energy is highlighted by a special careers session involving industry presentations about research demands for power and energy companies and a panel discussion regarding what a career in industry, a national laboratory, academia, or government would entail. With support from NSF, PECI seeks to reach a wider audience with this impact by encouraging participation from a larger number of&lt;br/&gt;Midwest and US schools, especially schools that do not offer a Ph.D. degree.</AbstractNarration>

Furthermore, PECI encourages discussion of systematic integration of research and teaching. Based on recent history of PECI conferences, the student program was able to attract 35% minorities and women in 2018 compared to 25% in 2017, which is a significant improvement made possible with support from NSF. In the future, the PECI committee hopes to continue increasing participation of minorities and women as well as students from schools that do not offer a Ph.D. program.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Support from NSF for student travel to PECI in 2018 enabled 33 non-authors to learn from the conference experience by covering their registration and accommodation expenses including four students from the Navajo Technical University, a tribally controlled postsecondary technical institution, as well as students from: Howard University in Washington D.C., Miami of Ohio, Kansas State, Valparaiso University, Northern Illinois University, Illinois Institute of Technology, University of Wisconsin Madison, Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, Missouri Institute of Science and Technology, Southern Illinois University Carbondale.&nbsp; Feedback from all of the students who received NSF travel support was extremely positive with many indicating that they were planning to submit papers or posters for PECI in 2019. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PECI is unique in its focus on students preparing and presenting technical papers and posters as well as learning about careers in power and energy STEM fields. This conference provides a unique opportunity for NSF to interact with and promote interaction among students, academia and the power industry to promote and discuss NSF&rsquo;s vision of technical challenges in power and energy systems, including technical, societal and economic aspects; and more broadly in cyber-physical (CPS) systems, renewable energy, and more-electric transportation. PECI is also a venue to an exciting student paper and poster competition for identifying and fostering high quality research performed by students.&nbsp; In summary, the intellectual merit of PECI are the student focused nature of the conference, from the student led steering committee to all technical and presentations, and the high quality publications and posters from student attendees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to technical presentations from 34 conference paper submissions, conference attendees had the opportunity to learn about the future of power and energy technology through an undergraduate poster session, four keynote presentations, two in-depth technical tutorials, industrial presentations by power utilities and technology companies, and tours of local research facilities.
