<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the reuse of rubber compounds from spent tires in high performance products including new tires without significant loss in product performance. Only a very small portion of those tires are currently being ground up for this purpose because of the detrimental impact  on product properties. However, larger quantities could potentially be used if the ground rubber is treated by the process of our invention. This would have several benefits.  Manufacturers could reduce material cost, the rubber recycling industry would enjoy significant growth and unsightly tire dumps with associated pollution problems would disappear. Additionally, the tire industry will become more sustainable and other unacceptable uses of old tires currently practiced, such as their use as fuels in low cost operations, would be financially challenged as novel, more profitable uses that retain the integrity of the polymer matrix emerge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to build upon studies conducted by our company during the last few years. While it was widely known that recycled ground rubber will significantly reduce physical properties, limited information and understanding existed on the basic causes. Much hope was pinned by many companies and academic institutions on the potential merit of the ground up rubber but no significant commercial process previously emerged. This work aims to develop a recycling process which does not require a devulcanization step. This was first demonstrated with model sample geometries that simulate the environment which ground rubber particles experience when added to and being co-vulcanized with fresh rubber compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Most end up being burned for fuel, placed on landfills or used for diverse civil engineering application. Only about 25% are broken up to recover the steel, fabric and rubber compounds from which they were made. The rubber is then ground into very small particles that were found useful as an inexpensive, low quality filler for asphalt coatings, sport surfaces, molded goods. They are also recycled into new tire compounds albeit in very small quantities as the addition of more than 2wt % results in unacceptable strength and abrasion resistance changes. &nbsp;</p> <p>Such performance drops&nbsp; were generally ascribed to tire material changes induced by exposures to excessive heat, high stresses and ozone while the tire from which they were produced was in service on roads. Appia, a recently founded research company, questioned the reasons for GRP to cause such drastic performance drops. Early results, expanded by experiments conducted in this effort (Figure 1) convincingly showed that the changes observed by the incorporation of for example 16 wt % GRP into a fresh rubber stock are about the same regardless whether the particles came from an discarded tire or were generated from a fresh rubber compound identical in composition to the host rubber. Subsequent experiments identified poor bonding and moduli gradients in the particles &nbsp;caused by the interdiffusion of cure inducing chemicals to be the dominant causes for the performance reductions.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>These crucial findings, a paradigm shift in understanding, allowed Appia to conceive and patent three new process options that promise to modify the GRP into a value-added product that could be recycled into tires and in other products in much larger quantities without significantly affecting performance. One of these options is the concept of using micro-encapsulation to&nbsp; coat the GRP with a thin adhesive layer that would strongly bond the particles to the host rubber matrix into which the GRP were recycled. The development and optimization of this special adhesive was investigated jointly with MIT and supported by this NSF SBIR grant. The two other process options are being developed jointly with other partner organizations.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In this study different adhesive options were explored and their performance tested with laminates composed of a cured (vulcanized) and uncured rubber strip. After a co-vulcanization the peel strength required to separate the two strips was measured to judge the bonding performance. Figure 2 compares&nbsp; the average peel strength without an adhesive&nbsp; with the best results achieved with the new adhesive that approaches the cohesive strength of the rubber compounds involved, measured by the peel strength, after co-vulcanization, of two uncured F3 strips (U/U).
