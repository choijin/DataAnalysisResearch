<AbstractNarration>This award will support the participation of students, postdoctoral scientists, and early career faculty in the symposium titled "Multiscale Modeling of Soft Materials and Interfaces" that will be held as a part of the Materials Research Society Fall 2018 meeting in Boston, MA.  The symposium will focus on recent scientific advances in the theory and simulation of these materials, that encompass colloids, gels, foams, polymers, suspensions, and bioinspired materials.  These materials are critical to technologies that include drug delivery, energy storage devices, coatings, and oil recovery.  The symposium will include distinguished invited speakers from industry, academia, and national laboratories and contributed talks and posters by students and early career scientists.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is timely in terms of the technical impact and translation to applications, due to recent advances in modeling methods and theory and recent rapid advances in high performance computing. The symposium will disseminate the latest advances in the field while simultaneously informing and recruiting the next generation of scientists and broadening the participation of under-represented groups in materials science research. Encouraging the participation of young investigators will help fill a national need to train a future work force in soft matter design and will provide a unique opportunity for young investigators to interact with leading researchers and industrial practitioners in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The properties of nanoscopic units and their macroscopic structures often determine the properties and applications of soft materials. Despite advances in experimental techniques, it is very difficult to predict the macroscopic properties of these materials with prior knowledge of their nanoscopic units or processing conditions. This limitation has been overcome via the development in advanced multiscale modeling methods and theory combined with rapid advances in state-of-art high performance computing. This combination of new multiscale modeling methods with high performance computing has been employed to test and validate the design, and predict the characteristics of novel soft materials with precision. This symposium is motivated by the Materials Genome Initiative and has addressed the design and characterization of structural and dynamical properties of soft materials using theoretical and computational modeling.  The goal of the symposium is to bring together domestic and international scientists from academic, industrial and government laboratories who employ either or both computational and theoretical techniques to explore and corroborate the design of soft materials and interfaces. This goal is supported by the aim to disseminate the latest advances in the field while simultaneously informing and recruiting the next generation of scientists, and broadening the participation of underrepresented minorities in materials research.  To achieve this goal, the organizers promoted cross-disciplinary, multi-national interactions between computational scientists from distinct sub-disciplines in soft materials and interfaces through the organization of the symposium called Multiscale Modeling of Soft Materials and Interfaces which was held as a part of the Materials Research Society Fall 2018 meeting in Boston, MA. The symposium included eight half-day invited and contributed oral presentation sessions along with one contributed poster presentation session.   The organizers broadened the participation of the symposium through the inclusion of underrepresented minorities, women, researchers and students from undergraduate institutions. The organizers encouraged and facilitated the participation of this group of researchers by triaging support for their registration, travel and subsistence.  Furthermore, the organizers awarded recognition of best poster and oral presentations delivered by undergraduate and graduate students.  In summary, the symposium enabled vibrant scientific discussions on the state-of-the-art in the design of soft materials and interfaces resulting from the development and application of computational techniques.
