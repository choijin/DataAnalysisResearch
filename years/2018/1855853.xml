<AbstractNarration>Modern sensor and digital computing technology has been generating an enormous wealth of data carrying information that is expected to have a transformative impact on virtually all branches of science, technology and society as a whole. The need to extract quantifiable information from such data sets has stimulated, in particular, a vibrant development of diverse mathematical methodologies. Despite the size of available data sites, often referred to as "Big Data", they nevertheless often fall short of providing enough information about a complex process to come up with reliable predictions, a must for any technological design. The physical laws that govern such processes can often be formulated in terms of mathematical models with excellent predictive capabilities. The more detailed information is sought on complex processes the more complex the models become with ensuing consequences for their mathematical and numerical treatment. Moreover, the identification of proper models in the classical sense may become increasingly limited. Therefore, a proper integration or synthesis of information provided by data as well as by models will be of paramount lasting importance. The central objective of the Spring School is to support young researchers in developing the necessary conceptual orientation. The project helps accelerating and fostering a broad based expertise in most topical research areas with high impact on technology and society.  Internationally renowned experts, representing  the relevant areas, will deliver six two-hour block lectures. These lectures aim, in particular, at unveiling important conceptual interconnections between different areas that are often not obvious. The lectures will be interlaced with break out sessions and opportunities for the participants to actively engage. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This covers forward and inverse tasks in Uncertainty Quantification, parameter and state estimation, data assimilation, machine learning, structural imaging in material science, and modeling. The goal is to pair these topics with recent methodological developments, in particular, those that are able to cope with the challenge of spatial high-dimensionality shared by all the above topics. Examples, to name a few, are sparse high-dimensional polynomial expansions, deep neural &lt;br/&gt;networks, low-rank and tensor methods, certifiable model order reduction concepts, sparsity promoting regularization concepts, and greedy strategies. The target attendance of about 30 young researchers is to warrant a most effective interaction with the lecturers. An internet platform and a common repository will be maintained to collect and share relevant information during periods between the workshops and to initiate future collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More details are available at http://people.math.sc.edu/imi/dasiv/SpringSchool/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

It was hosted by the Center on Data Analysis, Simulation, Imaging and Visualization (DASIV) in Sumwalt College. The sponsors of the event were the DASIV SmartState Center and the National Science Foundation.     The Spring School featured five main lecturers who are considered high-caliber representatives of their respective area of expertise and presented lectures on topics from these areas:  Albert Cohen (Sorbonne Universit?) on Least-Squares Methods for High Dimensional Problems;  Ronald DeVore (Texas A&amp;M University) on An Overview of Approximation of Functions of Many Variables;  Gitta Kutyniok (Technische Universit?t Berlin) on Theory of Deep Learning;  Eitan Tadmor (University of Maryland) on Collective dynamics: emergent behavior with long-range and short-range interactions;  Changhui Tan (University of South Carolina) on Asymptotic Preserving Schemes on Kinetic Models with Singular Limits.     In addition, three of the postdoctoral participants in the Spring School had the opportunity to present their research in half-an-hour lectures:  Simone Brugiapaglia (Simon Frasier University) on Compressive Sensing Approaches for High-Dimensional Function Approximation;  Qingguang Guan (Missouri University of Science and Technology) on Poor Global Optima for Fully Connected Deep ReLU Neural Networks - Special Examples for HD Approximation;  Majid Noroozi (University of Central Florida) on Clustering in Popularity Adjusted Stochastic Block Model.     The interactive lectures covered a diversity of topics organized under the main theme, namely, to foster synergetic synthesis of on the one hand classical "model-based" and, on the other hand "data-driven" methodologies. The topics addressed in the Spring Schools pertain to ongoing vibrant developments in areas like machine learning, notable deep learning, computational harmonic analysis, as a pillar of data science, or uncertainty quantification and related modelling or numerical analysis aspects.  The topics concern several relevant areas in Data Science which is an emerging transdisciplinary scientific field or research. The mathematical concepts treated in lectures and discussions are therefore relevant for a large range of disciplines where data in combination with physical/mathematical models provide major sources of information.     A total of 28 young researchers (students and postdocs) attended the Spring School: 12 from University of South Carolina, 3 from University of Pittsburg, 2 from Auburn University, 2 from University of Central Florida, 2 from University of Iowa, 1 from Florida State University, 1 from Missouri University of Science and Technology, 1 from Simon Fraser University, 1 from Southern Illinois University, 1 from Texas A&amp;M University, 1 from University of Georgia, and 1 from University of Louisville. In addition, 11 faculty from University of South Carolina attended some or all of the lectures.
