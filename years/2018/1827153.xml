<AbstractNarration>Through the National Science Foundation?s Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) program, this project provides a major data network upgrade for the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) that makes scientific data flows a priority. AMNH conducts scientific research and education activities spanning astrophysics, geosciences, and genomics. Scientific collaborations require increasing network capacity among scientific instruments, collaborators and researchers. These data networking improvements to AMNH directly support these research activities. AMNH's ability to move large data sets quickly between its campus and other sites across the nation and throughout the world is critical to the success of the Museum's research program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the project, AMNH implements a high-speed Science DMZ, a network specifically tuned for large data transfers. Through the Science DMZ, AMNH connects to the NYSERNet Research and Education Network, which provides pathways to the higher education community in New York State, Internet2, and beyond. Using purpose-built Data Transfer Nodes (DTNs) based on the FIONA concept, AMNH scientists can move diverse, large-scale data sets between research facilities, supercomputing centers, and collaborators via a dedicated 10Gb/s connection. The efficiencies gained enable greater collaboration, more intelligent and timely coordination of research, and increased research throughput and quality. To further facilitate collaboration, the project leverages the GLOBUS file transfer system to easily orchestrate data transfers and for disseminating AMNH's research to the broader research community. Additionally, AMNH integrates with the InCommon Federation, utilizing a common framework to provide researchers secure access to online resources. Using perfSONAR, the Science DMZ is continually monitored to ensure that throughput, latency, and performance targets are met, and data can flow unimpeded. This allows Museum researchers to focus on science rather than the logistical details of moving data. Additionally, the work of AMNH scientists informs the Museum's educational and curatorial programs, directly benefitting AMNH students and the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

As modern research continues to become more computationally driven, AMNH's ability to move large data sets quickly to and from research collaborators across the nation and worldwide becomes critical. High-speed connections to the wider research community, national computing facilities, remote scientific datasets, and research collaborators worldwide are crucial to the success of the Museum's research efforts and the educational programs that spring from that research.<br /> <br /> To address these needs, AMNH implemented a high-speed "Science DMZ", a network specifically tuned for large-scale research data transfers.&nbsp; &nbsp;This network addresses the factors that can the hinder performance through host and network tuning, performance monitoring, and the use of specialized Data Transfer Nodes (DTNs). As part of these efforts:</p> <ul> <li>AMNH      created a dedicated parallel Science DMZ (SciDMZ) network, separate and      distinct from the Museum's operational and guest services networks,      allowing Museum technologists to optimize the SciDMZ network for large      scientific data flows. </li> <li>Three      perfSONAR nodes continually monitor the SciDMZ, ensuring throughput,      latency, and performance targets are met, issues can be identified and      remediated quickly, and data flows continue unimpeded.</li> <li>Because      the SciDMZ is separate from other Museum operational networks, the      security of the SciDMZ could be tailored to meet specific research needs      without being impacted by the security requirements on the AMNH enterprise      network, thereby allowing a level of flexibility that might not otherwise      be possible.</li> <li>AMNH connects      to the NYSERNet Research and Education (R&amp;E) Network via the SciDMZ, providing      a high-speed pathway to the higher education and research community in New      York State, Internet2, and beyond via a direct 10Gbps connection to the      Internet2 and other NYSERNet peer networks. This connection is separate      and distinct from the Museum's commodity Internet connections, allowing      the full capacity of the NYSERNet/ Internet2 link to be dedicated to      research needs. This connection is also available for Museum educators and      students, giving them faster access to R&amp;E resources available via the      Internet2 and beyond.

To date, five DTNs have been deployed as part of this      project, including both general use and purpose built DTNs (serving      specific needs of astrophysics, genomics, Museum labs, and High-Performance      Computing (HPC) clusters).

AMNH has set up several ongoing transfers between the Museum and other institutions, including the Mount Palomar Space Observatory (observational data from telescopes), Yale University's / Yale Peabody Museum (CT scan data), and genomics data for use by the Museum's Sackler Institute of Comparative Genomics, sourced from University of Florida, European Bioinformatics Institute, and UC-Riverside, among others. The Museum's Microscopy and Imaging Facility (MIF) utilizes its DTN to send image data between lab instruments and remote facilities for analysis. Additionally, multiple research teams utilize the general purpose DTN for ad hoc transfers as needed. Prior the build of the SciDMZ, these transfers took significantly longer to complete or were done completely offline via drives shipped between sites due to resource constraints.</p> <p>The SciDMZ now also provides the underlying network infrastructure for the Museum's HPC systems, including the new MENDEL cluster supported by NSF Award 1925590. MENDEL and other Museum clusters have dedicated DTNs deployed as part of their ecosystem, allowing rapid and direct transfers of datasets processed on these clusters without having to move through multiple systems. The SciDMZ also provides high-speed pathways to cloud based computational resources hosted at Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the Open Science Grid (OSG). MENDEL currently uses the Internet2 to instantiate on-demand computing nodes by researchers, and this capability is being extended to other clusters. To facilitate the OSG connections, AMNH has deployed a dedicated submission server on the SciDMZ for researchers sending jobs to available OSG nodes.</p> <p>The AMNH SciDMZ has enabled greater collaboration, more intelligent and timely coordination of research, and increased research throughput and quality. It serves as the foundation for scientific computing at AMNH, and helps the Museum fulfill its research and educational mission.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/19/2021<br>      Modified by: Juan&nbsp;Montes</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1827153/1827153_10551119_1629410239661_AMNHSciDMZOverview--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1827153/1827153_10551119_1629410239661_AMNHSciDMZOverview--rgov-800width.jpg" title="AMNH Science DMZ Overview"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1827153/1827153_10551119_1629410239661_AMNHSciDMZOverview--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="AMNH Science DMZ Overview"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Overview of the American Museum of Natural History Science DMZ Network.</div> <div class="imageCredit">American Museum of Natural History</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Michael&nbsp;Benedetto</div> <div class="imageTitle">AMNH Science DMZ Overview</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1827153/1827153_10551119_1629410365723_AMNHSciDMZConnections--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1827153/1827153_10551119_1629410365723_AMNHSciDMZConnections--rgov-800width.jpg" title="AMNH Science DMZ Connections"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1827153/1827153_10551119_1629410365723_AMNHSciDMZConnections--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="AMNH Science DMZ Connections"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Overview of research and education (R&E) services facilitated by the American Museum of Natural History Science DMZ.</div> <div class="imageCredit">American Museum of Natural History</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Michael&nbsp;Benedetto</div> <div class="imageTitle">AMNH Science DMZ Connections</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1827153/1827153_10551119_1629410998805_AMNHScienceDMZ-Project1640TransferSystem--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1827153/1827153_10551119_1629410998805_AMNHScienceDMZ-Project1640TransferSystem--rgov-800width.jpg" title="AMNH Science DMZ - Project 1640 Transfer System"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1827153/1827153_10551119_1629410998805_AMNHScienceDMZ-Project1640TransferSystem--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="AMNH Science DMZ - Project 1640 Transfer System"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Overview of the data transfer system between AMNH and Mount Palomar Observatory.
