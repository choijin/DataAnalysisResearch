<AbstractNarration>This award will support undergraduate participants of the Texas Undergraduate Mathematics Conference (TUMC) which will be hosted on November 2-3, 2018 by Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas. In fall 2019, TUMC will be hosted by the University of Texas at Tyler. The conference focus is on research done by undergraduate students or in conjunction with undergraduates. This conference offers undergraduates the opportunity to see the research being done by their peers and to start the transition into the larger community of mathematical research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now in its 15th year, the Texas Undergraduate Mathematics Conference (TUMC) seeks to provide students with a forum to present their work, to discover research opportunities, and to learn more about graduate school and non-academic careers in mathematics. Conference attendees often come from groups that are underrepresented at research conferences: TUMC recruits many students from community colleges, Hispanic serving institutions, historically black colleges and universities, and institutions having at least 40% first generation college students. As part of this vital link between underserved undergraduate students and the mathematical research community, TUMC will be run without any associated cost for undergraduate participants. This support is meant to increase participation from institutions with limited resources, such as community colleges. The Executive Committee for TUMC will also expand their efforts in collecting demographic information to include information about the research activities of student and faculty participants. In particular, they will investigate the ways in which the uptake of research activities occurs in the year after attending TUMC. Additional information about the conference can be found on the website: http://sections.maa.org/texas/tumc/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
