<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to improve the resiliency of power distribution systems and make them more reliable.  To reach this goal, it is proposed in this project to break the distribution system into many small power systems (e.g., the power system of a neighborhood), each called a micro-grid (MG).  Each MG of the multiple-MG distribution system architecture can have one or more power generation sources (including renewable generation) and loads. Each MG and the components of the MG have an intelligent agent (i.e., a computer).  These agents will have local information about the MG and its components, and they can communicate with their neighboring MGs and collectively will determine the best operating scenario of the generating sources and loads within the MG, based on the availability of resource and the market price of electricity they receive from the utility.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Under normal condition, the MGs are interconnected and together they form the power distribution grid.  However, in the event of an electrical fault, the MGs can separate from one another, and the isolated faulty MG can go under repair while the healthy MGs will continue operating and be controlled independently and connect in network. When the faulty MG is repaired, it will return to service, and the MGs will form the original interconnected architecture and return to normal operation.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; The fundamental issues the project seeks to address through the proposed approach is:  it is much easier to monitor and control each MG compared to the large power system.  The proposed approach will be implemented on real distribution system models to show that the resiliency and reliability of the system are improved. Clearly, improving the resiliency and reliability of the power grid advances the power engineering field as well as serving the national interest, thus benefiting the society.  Moreover, the exploring of the proposed scientifically-based approach promotes the progress of science. And, finally, the project supports education. The opportunity for the students to work on the project gives them invaluable experience in the important field of power engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
