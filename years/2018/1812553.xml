<AbstractNarration>Increasingly medical devices are dependent on software and the wireless channel for their operations, which also pose new vulnerabilities to their safe, dependable, and trustworthy operations. Medical devices such as implantable insulin pumps, which are in wide use today, continuously monitor and manage a patient's diabetes without the need for frequent daily patient interventions.  These devices, not originally designed against cyber security threats, must now mitigate these threats. This project examines security vulnerabilities in these implantable medical device systems and offers new insights and understanding to protect these devices and prevent their misuse by users and abuse by hackers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this research addresses how to detect and defend against man-in-the-middle and replay attacks between the glucose sensor and the insulin pump or monitor device held by patients. Detection of such an attack is addressed via a personalized model to calculate and recognize abnormal glucose levels. To remotely secure the dosage setting over a wireless link, a bio-key based on personalized parameters unique to each patient with diabetes mellitus, is used.  Authentication is carried out via an acoustic-based fingerprint scheme coupled with voice pattern recognition technology. A mixed acoustic and radio wave-based secure channel in an artificial pancreas is being developed to test and validate this approach. While this project focuses on glucose sensors and insulin pumps, these security schemes can be applied broadly to other wireless medical devices. This project is being carried out at Delaware State University, a historically black college or university, and leverages collaborations with the University of Pennsylvania and University of Alabama to design a secure wireless insulin pumping system, and will support diverse undergraduate and graduate students for two years. The research results will also be used to design and implement course materials on cyber-physical systems security and will help train students to become tomorrow's cyber security professionals.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>During this project, the PI and her students proposed visible light based access control, voiceprint based access control, feature fusion and acoustic based access control for wireless insulin pump systems. Also, the PI has built a psychological data based blood glucose prediction model, which could be used as an anomaly detection model because the average error for six patients is 5.89mg/dl. Through extensive analysis, we found that the prediction results are very close to the finger-stick data. It provides an approach for the glucose sensor manufacturers to mitigate the measurement difference between the sensor glucose and blood glucose. The PI and her group also found that the EMI noise could increase the sensor glucose up to 14mg/dl. Using the previous model, such attacks could be identified. Besides, for other cyber-physical system like infant incubators, the PI and her group demonstrated that an adversary could remotely manipulate the temperature sensor measurements without tampering with the infant incubator or triggering automatic temperature alarms.&nbsp; This paper was published at the 26th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (2019).&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, the PI and her group found that the acoustic signals could be used to manipulate the mini robot, self-balanced scooter, stabilizers, screwdrivers, and VR headsets.
