<AbstractNarration>While many communities have deployed key components needed to deliver smart community services, many cities currently lack the necessary data platforms or staff expertise to handle the complexities of gathering, analyzing, or sharing smart community data. This challenge will become significantly more difficult as sensors, vehicles, and other sources provide more real-time data. Without such platforms, along with modeling and visualization tools, the promise of smart city technologies will remain unattainable, especially for smaller or low-income communities. Big data analytic tools have become a critical missing link to smart community solutions and there is a growing demand from a variety of computer science disciplines, along with industry researchers and municipal governments, to share best practices and best-of-breed tools. Creating an approach that allows for the development of secure, open, flexible, and scalable smart community big data solutions will have lasting societal impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the Smart Community Big Data Co-operative (the Co-op), US Ignite will leverage its 100 city, university, industry, and nonprofit partners to design, build and use the important capability of big data sharing to enhance local smart community efforts and generate enhanced community services. Communities are looking to quickly identify current gaps in their real-time data, applications, and modeling tools to design a cohesive smart community strategy with local partners. This current effort will extend this formula to launch new forms of smart community research, applications, and services that benefit end users through open data and data analytics. US Ignite will ensure alignment among all parties interests in supporting big data and smart community applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The Eager project funded by NSF to US Ignite has been very successful in accomplishing multiple outcomes beneficial to the communities across the United States.  The framework and architecture for a data exchange, a detailed set of data exchange requirements and the exchange format required at a data interconnect was created out of this effort. Cities have shown tremendous interest and it is expected that cities can utilize this specification across many  processes, including design, procurement, planning and testing. This effort brought together thought-leading cities and key industry members to a common platform and facilitates problem sharing helping in addressing issues across the communities. It also includes contributions from academic institutions who are helping to advance the forward-looking thinking around the future of smart city data and the possibilities that can profoundly impact the market. Below are the major goals/outcomes of the project:   Developed a data  platform  focusing on economic development to demonstrate complexities of gathering, analyzing, or sharing data  between communities. This platform could seamlessly integrate data  from different datasets across communities.   Brought together data  experts from Academia, Cities &amp; Industries and to create a Specification for Data Sharing among cities, breaking the data  silos.   Bridged knowledge gaps between communities and assist smaller or low-income communities to develop or enhance their data platform.   Made communities ready to manage big data as IOT devices multiply and Real-Time data use cases increase.   Created an economic development tool working along with the city of Portland.   Created and maintained a catalog of tools that can help cities with data management.   Created and maintained a catalog of data policies and frameworks   Built relationships between data  managers of cities through  forum events and workshops   Created a tool to abstract datasets from city open  data  websites and create a central catalog.
