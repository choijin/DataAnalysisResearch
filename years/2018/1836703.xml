<AbstractNarration>The Computing Research Association's Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research (CRA-W) aims to increase the numbers and successes of women in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) research careers. With this proposal, they will work within the 2018 Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (GHC) to (1) increase the engagement of undergraduate women CSE majors in research and encourage their interest in and preparation for graduate school, and (2) provide information, mentorship, and support for women who have worked in industry and are considering a research-focused career change.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;CRA-W will continue the development the CRA-W GHC Research Scholars Program, piloted in 2017, that brings undergraduates to the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (GHC), providing them with a research-focused experience.  In addition, CRA-W will pilot a new GHC Returning Scholars Program for women potentially interested in returning to graduate school from industry. Both programs will capitalize on the availability of role models and existing programming at GHC. In addition, they will provide (1) guidance to research-interested students on how to navigate the vast offerings at the conference, (2) opportunities for students to meet and interact with peers, role models, and mentors with similar interests in small-group settings, (3) mentors and role models for industry professionals interested in a research-focused career change, and (4) useful advice for pursuing and succeeding in a research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
