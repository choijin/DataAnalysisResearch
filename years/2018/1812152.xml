<AbstractNarration>This award supports an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. The research takes a data-driven and collections-focused approach to understand factors promoting the speciation process (i.e., formation of new species) and, therefore, the generation of biodiversity. The effort will illuminate the extent to which a reproductive bone structures may be involved in speciation in an ecologically important group of rodents, the squirrels. Such bone structures occur in some of the most diverse groups of mammals and may contribute to speciation via selection processes. Despite decades of scientific curiosity, however, the precise function of these bone structures is unknown in most groups. The fellow will leverage methods to quantify patterns of bone evolution including high-resolution imaging of museum specimens. This work will also provide authentic research experiences for undergraduate students and will broaden STEM participation at this level. Finally, this work will include science communication events that will bring evolutionary biology learning activities to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will leverage three ecologically distinct squirrel radiations (the genera Sciurus, Tamias, Urocitellus) as model systems. Key insights into mammalian evolutionary biology and selection process are expected via integration of novel genetic, morphometric, and biodiversity informatics datasets to test hypotheses on the role of reproductive structure specialization in mammals. A comparative framework will be established using phylogenomic methods to resolve phylogenies and past hybridization events. Evolutionary shape variation in bacula from focal species will be documented using CT scanning of specimens. Datasets describing bacular morphology will be captured and contrasted with those describing external organismal phenotypes gleaned from thousands of digitized museum records. Each will be analyzed in the context of geographic and niche overlap of constituent species to reveal whether patterns of bacular variation are consistent with a role in reproductive isolation of closely related lineages. All datasets will be accessible online and linked to original museum specimens, facilitating open access to the wealth of data contained in biological collections. Training outcomes include research opportunities focused on STEM-underrepresented undergraduates and dissemination of research concepts and empirical results in popular science fora. Outreach activities will increase public literacy on mammalian biodiversity and evolution, the speciation process, and the importance of biocollections for pressing scientific and societal issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A longstanding goal in evolutionary biology is to understand the process of speciation ? i.e., the process whereby new species are formed. &nbsp;A better understanding of speciation mechanisms would provide new insight into myriad patterns of global biodiversity arise and are maintained; however, that goal has been difficult to achieve because speciation can require long timeframes to complete, and may involve ongoing gene flow among diverging lineages. This project took an integrative approach to understanding speciation mechanisms in a large and ecologically-important group of mammals, the squirrels (Family Sciuridae). The specific goal was to understand the extent to which a single skeletal feature ? the baculum, or male genital bone ? may be involved in the speciation process.

The following major phases of data collection were accomplished. I established a comparative framework for studying each clade by using new phylogenomic datasets to resolve evolutionary relationships among species and identify possible past hybridization events. I produced 608 high-resolution CT scans of bacula, and worked with undergraduate students and technicians to quantify shape and size variation from these scans using linear measurements as well as more advanced geometric morphometric techniques.

The key contribution was my use of new and disparate datasets (genomic, morphological, digital museum occurrences) to advance fundamental knowledge on the role of genital specialization in mammalian evolution. Further, I demonstrated how data from hundreds of physical museum specimens and thousands of digitized specimen records can be linked within a robust statistical framework. This has aptly demonstrated the powerful role that museum specimens and specimen-derived data can have in 21st century ecology and evolutionary biology.

First, it provided key training opportunities for myself (PI McLean) as an independent and integrative scientist capable of using various ecological and evolutionary datasets to address broad-scale questions. It provided extensive, hands-on experience in generation of genomic data, use of micro-CT machines, morphometric analyses, and manipulation and statistical analysis of large and heterogeneous biodiversity datasets. By generating new digital datasets and 3D representations that are available cost-free to researchers globally, the project also added significant value to specimen discoverability and usefulness at a large number of museum collections. The project provided training opportunities in biodiversity sciences and manipulation of CT scans for 6 undergraduate students as well (3 at University of Florida, 3 at University of North Carolina Greensboro).
