<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve high-risk pregnancy care and preterm labor detection by developing a noninvasive, low-cost, point-of-care wearable electronic patch for pregnancy monitoring in both clinical and home environments. Each year, 4 million women give birth in the US. More than one in ten of pregnancies is considered high-risk, where the mother, fetus, or newborn has elevated risk of experiencing an adverse health condition. The proposed platform will allow doctors to remotely monitor and manage high-risk pregnancies and intervene, as needed, upon detection of labor or other potential complications. By enhancing early detection of fetal well-being and increasing access to care, the device will allow for improved healthcare delivery, thus increasing mother and infant safety, preventing maternal and neonatal morbidities, and lowering healthcare costs. By applying machine learning to what could become the largest and most comprehensive dataset on maternal and fetal health, the proposed platform could become a valuable resource to researchers to identify underlying causes and biomarkers of preterm birth. Primary end users are women with high-risk pregnancies, and elevated risk of preterm birth. Target customers are hospitals, health care providers and insurance companies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop an unprecedented means to support advances in maternal and fetal health: a state-of-the-art miniaturized mobile monitor that discretely sticks onto the mother's abdomen and uses sensors to noninvasively monitor fetal heart rate (FHR) and other physiological parameters in home and clinical environments. The device communicates to a smartphone, which acts as gateway to send data to a cloud-based platform, where the data is collected, stored and analyzed, with doctors able to set notification thresholds. For this project, patch technology, proven to effectively measure uterine activity and fetal movement will be leveraged to develop a disruptive product capable of detecting FHR as early as 25 weeks gestation. Miniaturization, power consumption and cost levels necessary for deployment in remote settings will be achieved. A usability study of the prototype monitor will then be conducted in expectant women in hospital settings, followed by an equivalency study to validate accuracy of the prototype compared to cardiotocogram, the current clinical gold standard. This solution will increase specificity of FHR testing, and improve interpretation of monitoring data, as well as aggregate data to train AI models to predict adverse events such as preterm birth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The monitor discretely sticks onto the mother's abdomen and uses sensors to non-invasively collect data that will allow physicians to detect anomalies early in high-risk pregnancy.

Our aim with this Phase I project was building a prototype device with ability to measure Fetal Heart Rate at or beyond 32-week gestation. To demonstrate feasibility of the product we aimed to accomplish the following goals: (1) build a prototype and evaluate the performance of the device against the clinical gold standard; (2) evaluate the usability of our prototype by patients; (3) define the commercial strategy and financial viability of the product.  The significant results accomplished during Phase 1 include:  Completed 5 design iterations on the prototype patch ending with a functional prototype that addresses the most important risks in the patch development; Developed a novel approach to fetal heart rate monitoring that reliably deconvolutes maternal and fetal heart rate and filters other sources of physiological and environmental noise; Demonstrated fetal heart rate accuracy (+/- 5 bpm compared to gold standard) substantially equivalent to gold standard hospital based cardiotocogram, commercially viable reliability at 33+ weeks gestation, identified areas for improvement to significantly improve both accuracy and reliability over the gestational ages of interest (32+ weeks) including increasing electrode spacing, using a different analog front end to improve signal-to-noise ratio, modifying instructions for use to improve wow well the patient preps the skin, attaches the electrodes, and behaves during the recordings; Validated usability of the prototype by patients from home and confirmed system performance in free living environment does not differ substantially from a controlled setting.   Having de-risked our product substantially, we now face the challenge of turning it into a user-ready device, for which we will further improve usability and lower gestational ages.
