<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be functional neuronal cells derived from human adult adipocytes that will have applications in regenerative medicine.  The goal is to develop dopaminergic (DA) neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from transdifferentiated human adult adipocytes using a DA cell induction cocktail.  This will have application in cellular therapeutics and research tools for Parkinson's Disease (PD), and other neuronal diseases. In addition, these studies will impact the field of stem cell research and regenerative medicine, since this will be the first demonstration that functional neuronal cells, the main building blocks of brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous systems, can be produced from mature fat cells that can be used as cellular therapeutics for several neurological disorders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop new technology for generation of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from adult adipocytes (fat cells), which will used as a platform to develop cellular therapeutics for Parkinson's Disease (PD), and PD research tools. Recently, using a chemical genetics approach (chemical approach or small molecule approach), engraftable midbrain DA neuronal progenitor cells (DA NPCs) from human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-hMSCs) have been generated. Additionally, DA neuronal progenitor-like cells also had been produced from de-differentiated fat cells (DFAT cells) that have several advantages over BM-hMSCs such as homogeneity of DFAT cell cultures, ease of isolation and low immunogenicity. The goal of Phase I project is to validate and optimize the DA induction protocol for generation of midbrain DA NPC from DAFT cells. Phase II will focus on clinical grade manufacturing of these DA cells and testing their therapeutic effect in several preclinical animal models of PD. Commercial products emerging from Phase I/II work include cellular therapeutics for PD and research tools for PD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Advances in technologies that can reprogram a patientâ€™s own tissue into any desired cell type will revolutionize the field of regenerative medicine. Over the last decades several cell reprogramming methods such as nuclear transfer, cell fusion and, transfection or transduction with pluripotent factors have been developed. However, these technologies require the exposure of cell nuclei to reprogramming large molecules via above mentioned interventions that raises several technical, safety, and ethical issues.          Chemical genetics is an alternative approach for cell reprogramming that uses small, cell membrane penetrable substances to regulate multiple cellular processes including cell plasticity.         Recently, using a chemical genetics approach, we have been able to generate neural-like cells and specialized neuronal subtypes (including dopaminergic neurons) from rodent, feline, and human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs).        The overall goal of Phase 1 studies is was to develop new efficient, safe, and cost-effective cell reprogramming technology to produce midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neuronal progenitor cells (DA NPCs) from human dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells that will result in the development of new cellular therapeutics for Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD), as well as commercial research products such as a DA differentiation kit, ready-to-use DA NPCs, DA mature neurons, and DA cell-based platforms for drug discovery and toxicity studies.            Screening of multiple protocols revealed a specific combination of small molecule epigenetic modifiers and modulators of specific cell signaling pathways that turn adult human fat cells into dopaminergic progenitors. Using the same neural induction protocol, we also have been able to generate DA progenitors from adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells.        Further studies will focus on investigating whether transplanted fat-derived DA progenitors into animal model of Parkinsonâ€™s will survive, integrate, and promote functional recovery.        Commercial and clinically compatible research products emerging from this work include technology for large-scale clinical grade production of DA neurons and DA cell-related research products.        These studies will have an enormous impact on the field of stem cell research and regenerative medicine, since this will be the first demonstration that functional neuronal cells can be produced from fat cells, which can be easily obtained from patients.
