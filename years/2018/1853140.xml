<AbstractNarration>The Epigenetics and Bioengineering Conference (EpiBio 2018) is sponsored by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers and will be held at The Mission Bay Conference Center (San Francisco, CA) on October 4-6, 2018. This conference will bring together biologists, chemists, and engineers to discuss ways in which their disciplines can collaborate to find novel solutions to problems that are limiting the development of epigenetic modeling and therapies. The meeting will integrate the engineering sciences with the life sciences, encourage research and development in multidisciplinary areas, educate the next generation of young scientists, and support cutting edge science to answer current and future challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topics will focus on exploring the phenomena associated with epigenetics as well as the application of this knowledge in designing new treatments and computing and modeling epigenetic alterations. There will be seven conference topics, presented in a single-track format. Sensing Epigenetic Modifications will focus on sensing epigenetic modifications in various organisms. Writing Epigenetic Modifications: This session is focused on understanding how to write epigenetic modifications for altered gene expression. Nuclear Organization: This session will focus on discussing the recent advances in understanding nuclear organization in cancer cells as well as normal cells. Epigenetic Diagnostics and Therapeutics: This session focuses on using the knowledge and database of epigenetic modifications to diagnose and treat diseases more safely and effectively. Single Cell Epigenetics: This session will focus on sharing the developments made in this emerging field. The Epitranscriptome: This session will address new findings uncovered about the epitransciptome. Computation and Modelling in Epigenetics: This session will address recent advances made in modelling and computation in epigenetics. The peer-reviewed conference proceedings will be published on the AIChE website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
