<AbstractNarration>International research collaborations are supported using a variety of partnership models. However, what works under what circumstances and why is poorly documented.  This workshop will engage key thought leaders from across the globe in a dynamic discussion of the critical issues related to international partnerships and collaborations to leverage resources, maximize synergies, and accelerate research.  Workshop participants will examine existing models of international funding partnerships and contribute to an action plan.  The workshop activities will promote partnerships, establish shared learning, and strengthen connections to support the implementation of international network-to-network collaborations responsive to global research to benefit society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this workshop is to identify the overarching issues related to international network-to-network partnerships, categorize and prioritize these issues, and develop potential solutions to tackle these challenges.  Representatives from stakeholders in international research networks who are knowledgeable about or have an interest in building network-to-network partnerships will come together in a facilitated discussion.  The workshop provides a structure that supports interaction and collaboration of key stakeholders to co-create a partnership model to support international networks of networks.  A formalized report of the workshop will (1) summarize effective partnership models, (2) capture strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to international network-to-network collaborations, and (3) propose an action plan.  The workshop and report will increase awareness of critical issues related to strengthening international research collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ International research collaborations are supported using a variety of partnership models. However, what works under what circumstances and why is poorly documented.  Therefore, the National Science Foundation (NSF)'s Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) funded Kansas State University to facilitate an international partnership workshop involving national and foreign federal funding agencies, foundations and other stakeholders in global research. The fifteen key thought leaders from across the globe represented Austrian Science Fund, Belmont Forum, CIFAR, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft - German Research Foundation, Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research/Instituto (IAI), NIH - Fogarty International Center, NOAA, Network for Transdisciplinary Research (td-net), Office of Integrative Science Enterprise /NSF,  Rockefeller Foundation, UK Research &amp; Innovation (UKRI), USAID - Global Development Lab Programs, USDA/National Institute of Food and Agriculture, and USGCRP (U.S. Global Change Research Program). The event was held in Washington, D.C. at the Madison Hotel on September 5 and 6, 2019 with the purpose of engaging in a dynamic discussion of the critical issues related to international partnerships and collaborations to leverage resources, maximize synergies, and accelerate research. The aim was to identify overarching issues related to international network-to-network partnerships, categorize and prioritize these issues, consider related funding opportunities, and develop potential solutions to tackle these challenges.  Discussion and questions covered during the workshop included:  Exploration of value-added from different models of structuring and funding international research collaborations and in what context are they effective and why?   What are the      strengths, needs, and opportunities in international partnerships, and is      there need for something new that incorporates this learning in regard to      leveraging resources and maximizing synergies to accelerate research?   Common characteristics of effective partnership models included a well-established infrastructure and governance, balanced with flexibility and ability to maximize existing synergies.   The importance of co-creation of a funding opportunity, alignment with country research priorities, and well-defined indicators and metrics to track progress and performance were significant considerations for funders.  Establishing trust within partnerships, building capacity, and communication strategies were important considerations for research teams supported by international partnerships and funders alike. Overarching issues related to the strengths, needs, and opportunities in developing international partnerships included cultivating human talent; providing effective leadership and management that is flexible and responsive; alignment for shared agreements, mechanisms for adjustments, and transparent communication; sufficient resources that value science as a global enterprise; and new approaches and funding models to drive progress in research and society inclusive of policy impacts.  Lastly, results from the workshop were intended to inform the NSF's initiative, Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations (AccelNet) focused on supporting new or strengthening existing linkages among US and international research networks.
