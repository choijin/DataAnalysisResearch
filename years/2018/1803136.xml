<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2018 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to  Chris Gerig is " Embedded Contact Homology, Near-Symplectic Geometry, and 4-Manifold invariants" The host institution for the fellowship is Harvard University, and the sponsoring scientist is Peter Kronheimer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

On such problem is to determine whether a 4-dimensional space which "looks" like a 4-dimensional sphere is in fact the standard sphere; the PI built invariants of such spaces by counting certain symplectic surfaces inside of them in attempt to distinguish them (but at the moment they are not senstiive enough).

As the work of the PI involves the relation between the aforementioned symplectic objects and certain gauge-theoretic objects (Seiberg-WItten solutions) which have origins in physics, the PI set out with collaborators to understand the physical interpretation of it.  This has resulted in 3 papers accepted for publications,  No homotopy 4-sphere invariants using ECH = SWF Lagrangian torus invariants using ECH = SWF G2 holonomy, Taubes’ construction of Seiberg&ndash;Witten invariants and superconducting vortices (joint work with Sergio Cecotti and Cumrun Vafa)   and many seminars and conferences (both online and in person) to spread this information to the broader community. Additionally, the PI organized and restarted Harvard’s "Gauge&ndash;Topology&ndash;Symplectic" seminar for mathematicians and interested students to gather from around the Boston area.
