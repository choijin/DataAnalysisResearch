<AbstractNarration>The Condensed Matter and Materials Theory and Condensed Matter Physics Programs jointly contribute support to this award. This award provides resources for a workshop that brings together theorists and experimentalists to discuss a possible new kind of superconductivity that may have application in the development of quantum computers. The workshop will be held at Rice University on April 24-25, 2018. Whether a material conducts electricity or not provides a natural classification of materials into metals like copper and insulators like silicon. Within the past 20 years, it was realized that insulators can be bit more interesting. There are the classic insulators like silicon and rubber, but there are also topological insulators which have an insulating bulk and intrinsic metallic states that surround the surfaces and edges. Bismuth selenide, a compound made from the elements of bismuth and selenium, provides an example of a topological insulator. Since the discovery of topological insulators, new classes of topological materials have been proposed, among these are topological superconductors. Superconductors have no resistance to the flow of electricity. This reflects the collective quantum mechanical behavior of the electrons in the superconducting state. Topological superconductors have a superconducting bulk. While topological insulators have associated metallic surface states, topological superconductors have exotic surface states that behave differently than collections of ordinary particles like electrons and photons - the "particles" of light, but in a way that could form the basis of computation by manipulation of a quantum mechanical state. Topological materials are robust to noise and defects that would disrupt most quantum mechanical states and severely limit their use in quantum computers.&lt;br/&gt;Driven by potential applications to quantum computing, there is now an intense worldwide search for materials that exhibit the experimental signatures of topological superconductors. This two-day workshop will bring together scientists from around the world that use experiments to probe candidate materials, as well as those that develop the theory and phenomenology of topological superconductivity.  An important distinguishing feature of this workshop will be a focus on bulk topological superconducting materials and two-dimensional surface states. The workshop will address an acute need to gather and focus theoretical and experimental leaders in this nascent field, which has received much less attention than other efforts to engineer quantum computers. Graduate and undergraduate students will be encouraged to attend the workshop to excite interest in the next generation. A report on opportunities in research on topological superconductivity will result from this activity. This workshop is aligned with the NSF's Quantum Leap Big Idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Superconductivity is a remarkable phenomenon that arises from the collective motion of electrons in materials, and in particular the partnering of electrons into so-called Cooper pairs. Superconductors can conduct electric current without dissipating energy into heat, and can levitate magnets owing to their perfect diamagnetism. Since the late 1980s, much of the condensed matter physics community has focused on understanding high-temperature superconductivity, with the hope that a room-temperature superconductor could one day revolutionize power delivery.  In the last decade, an entirely new frontier of superconductivity has been revealed, that of topological superconductivity. Owing to a "quantum knot" in the electronic structure of the bulk, which cannot be "untied" by ordinary means and thus manifests the non-trivial topology, a topological superconductor is predicted to host an exotic two-dimensional fluid at the surface of the crystal. The surface fluid consists of special particles called Majorana fermions that can be viewed as the "loose ends" of the quantum knot, which unties only at the surface. As a result the physical properties of these Majorana fermions are predicted to be robustly protected from perturbations. Most importantly, the surface fluid can be manipulated with magnetic fields, which could be used to form and move "Majorana zero modes" at the surface. These zero modes are now being actively sought in laboratories across the world, and could enable fault-tolerant topological quantum computation.  Much of the effort to realize Majorana zero modes has so far focused on artificial (engineered) systems, in which heterogeneous components must be microfabricated together to create a synthetic topological superconductor. This NSF Award funded a workshop, which instead focused on the prospects for the discovery and characterization of new, natural topological superconducting materials. The Spring 2018 workshop "Topological superconductors: Materials, topological order, and quenched disorder," was hosted by the Rice University Center for Quantum Materials (RCQM) at Rice University, April 24&ndash;25, 2018. The small, intensive workshop featured presentations by 14 top-flight experimental and theoretical researchers, invited from universities around the US as well as Japan, China, and Austria.      Key takeaways from the scientific presentations included very recent news of the possible experimental observation of Majorana zero modes in several different materials, a theoretical picture that might explain these observations, prospects for topological superconductivity in higher-spin materials, and the interplay of disorder and strong interactions on Majorana surface fluids. The search for materials candidates is still in its infancy, but the many remarkable theoretical predictions strongly suggest that finding bulk topological superconductors in the lab will open up many new avenues for fundamental materials research.  The key outcomes of the workshop included the following:  (1) The realization that better experimental probes are needed to characterize materials that could host bulk topological superconductivity. This is because conventional surface probes such as scanning tunneling microscopy have revealed contradictory results in existing materials: Majorana zero modes are observed in the presence of a magnetic field, but the expected surface Majorana fluid is absent in materials such as Copper-doped Bismuth Selenide, when the field is turned off.   (2) There is substantial evidence for "nematic" (directional) superconductivity in the existing topological superconductor materials candidates, including Copper-doped Bismuth Selenide. This is suggestive, but not proof of nontrivial topology.  (3) Other classes of materials that are just beginning to be explored as hosts for topological superconductivity include the compounds in the so-called "half-Heusler" family of materials, such as Yttrium Platinum Bismuth (chemical formula YPtBi). Like Copper-doped Bismuth Selenide, experimental results in the latter material indicate some kind of non-trivial superconductivity, but it is too soon to say whether this is due to topology.  (4) It is therefore clear that research into topological superconducting materials has already identified a number of compounds with unusual phenomenology. In this way, topology has already changed the way scientists look for and interpret data from new superconducting materials, and this is already a highly beneficial "side-effect" of the focus on identifying topological superconductors.  Finally, in contrast to conventional, so-called s-wave superconductors, topological superconductors are predicted to arise from non-s-wave pairing, a feature shared by the high temperature superconductors in the copper oxide family with the highest transition temperatures. Thus further theoretical research into topological superconductivity may also teach us something new about the still vexing problem of understanding the mechanisms behind high-temperature superconductivity. As with parallel efforts spearheaded by Google and Microsoft to realize quantum computers using engineered systems, research into topological superconductors could eventually revolutionize quantum information processing.
