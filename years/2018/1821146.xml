<AbstractNarration>This project uses the science of hurricane resilience to foster the development of student agency and appreciation for science in Puerto Rico. It will have a direct impact on over 1000 Puerto Rican middle and high school students this school year. This research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the characteristics of educational interventions after a humanitarian crisis that can foster positive adaptation. Students will gain a scientific understanding of the natural disaster that occurred and of the resilience of the local El Yunque rainforest. In addition, these investigations will provide a positive outlet for students to express their feelings in creative ways and propose design solutions for their local community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For school age children on the island of Puerto Rico, the back-to-back hurricane strikes of Irma and Maria were their first experience with the tragedy of hurricanes in Puerto Rico. There is much concern in the media and associated reader comments about the ability of the forests in Puerto Rico to recover. These concerns reveal common misconceptions about the dynamics of forest ecosystems. Long-term research conducted by Luquillo ecologists paints a different picture. The El Yunque rainforest has adapted to being struck by hurricanes on a regular basis. Engaging in investigations of El Yunque resilience at different timescales and different perspectives allows students to connect their learning about the rainforest to the current tragedy of their everyday life. Students will propose designs for their local community for rebuilding after Hurricane Maria and preparation for future hurricanes by mimicking how nature recovers from hurricanes. Researchers hypothesize that the quality of implementation will be predictive of the quality of students' projects, increased understanding of the dynamics of resilience in El Yunque, as well as increased appreciation for science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
