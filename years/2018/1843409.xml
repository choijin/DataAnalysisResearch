<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project is focused on continued development of a software platform that is used by students for peer to peer homework and studying help. After school help has historically been delivered by tutors and homework hotlines but those avenues have been proven to be inadequate in closing learning gaps for students after they exit the classroom. The proposed technology is expected to further democratize homework and studying help. Being peer to peer, the proposed technology can radically shrink the cost of personalized homework and studying help for students at their own time and pace - especially the ones from economically or socially more challenged backgrounds. The project will also explore use of an innovative business model to optimize commercial viability with impacting a broad range of students irrespective of their backgrounds. It is expected that when fully developed, the technology would emerge as a scalable low-cost option to help improve student learning outcomes both nationally and globally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key intellectual merit of this project is in the development of a Smart Study Recommendations Engine. This involves harvesting the data from the class notes uploaded by students, analyze it to surface predictive insights and automatically deliver the notes or wide-ranging peer-reviewed study materials directly to the student users based on their learning styles, learning abilities, and learning gaps, without requiring them to perform a search. It will also provide them with an ability to connect them with peers who can provide additional support. Thus, this project seeks to provide personalized study playlists based on a student profile and pair them with a peer mentor who can provide deeper clarifications as required. The key outcome to be demonstrated is that 1 in 5 students engages favorably with the auto delivered math notes, helped by a peer who can provide clarity and tutoring as needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  As a result of the NSF Phase 1 grant, we're putting the Smart Study Recommendations Engine on college campuses in 20+ states, and expanding to over 100,000 students. The core objective we set out to accomplish, was to deliver homework and studying help to students, before they ask, think or imagine where the help will come from. In doing so, we hope to shrink failure rates and accelerate college completion statistics. We desired to deliver the recommendations where students live the greater majority of their lives online, which is on their phones. Although the initial segment we began building the engine for was college students in math or science courses, with further development, we aim to expand to the 1 billion students who go to school every Monday across the globe. We've discovered that when students struggle, they desire help from classmates who understand their pain, and their issues. With our engine, we not only recommend students the help they need, but also knowledgeable classmates who can go deeper on the difficult subject matter at hand. The NSF Phase 1 grant has accelerated not only our development, but market demand for our solution. Ultimately, we are breaking down the barriers that have traditionally dictated a child's odds of success.            Last Modified: 02/09/2020       Submitted by: Gerald Meggett]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
