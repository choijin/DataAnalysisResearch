<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project?is?the development of a portable, cost-effective confocal microscope that profiles surfaces, obtains spectra, and enables immediate identification of composition, impurities, and morphology for users throughout the research and industrial markets.??The system will make a major impact in the $6.2B microscope market, with a near-term commercial potential of over 5% of the market and significant growth potential. This technology will address the needs of materials science and other research laboratories, quality control in manufacturing, and supply chain monitoring, thereby providing a positive economic impact. Integration of topographic mapping with a diverse set of spectroscopic tools enables comprehensive materials analysis at very small scales. Users will be able to identify features and defects in electronic, optoelectronic, and structural devices, as well as coatings, tubing, devices, disks, and specialty mirrors. Societal impacts include improvements in the design and manufacture of components and systems.?Because of its compact size and low cost, the microscope can be used in educational institutions, providing students with experience in measuring properties of complex objects and helping prepare them for careers in various research, development, and production settings.?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will translate spectroscopic confocal optical profile microscopy from the lab bench to prototypes with market-ready features and performance. The developed microscopes will enable spectroscopic and surface analysis of topographically complex structures.?The key innovation is the integration of precision surface profiling with multiple spectroscopic interrogation methods.??Users will capture accurate topographic maps of irregular surfaces and use them to extract spatially accurate spectroscopic and imaging information.??This approach will enable in-focus, diffraction-limited photoluminescence and Raman maps for a broad range of materials.??Research objectives include (1) integration of optical profiling with spectroscopic scanning, (2) optimization of hardware based on customer feedback, and (3) development of acquisition and analysis software.??Successful completion of these objectives will result in a portable instrument that can capture the surface topography and spectral information of a sample with tens of thousands of sample points in a few minutes, with 10-50 nanometer vertical precision and diffraction-limited spatial resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Klar Scientific designed, developed, and implemented the hardware for a modular, multi-functional confocal spectroscopic microscopy system that captures two-dimensional photoluminescence, Raman, and other scans of all of the layers of a multi-composite structure with an irregular surface.  Klar also developed an operating system that runs on a laptop and drives the instrument through a USB cable, and a sophisticated spectral fitting algorithm that can fit an arbitrary function to as many peaks as the user deems important at high-speed on a GPU-enabled laptop.  The power plane driving all internal components is integrated onto the rear of the instrument and connected to the external world with a single 120V power cord and a USB 3.0 cable.  The entire instrument is compact, about 14 inches by 16 inches by 22 inches, and weighs 35 pounds.  It is robust and may be moved at will to where the user decides to put it.   The Klar design, with multiple plug-and-play wavelength kits, can provide PL and Raman spectral scans. The data are then converted into intensity and energy maps by a proprietary fitting program, KlarFit, also integrated onto the laptop.  This single instrument is actually equivalent to over a dozen individual instruments from other suppliers and performs scans and analysis that are unique to Klar.  Early in the project, Klar chose to perform 2D scanning with a moveable x-y stage, rather than a scanned laser.  This design provides the greatest precision and highest resolution, as the laser is always normal to the sample.  Klar also chose to use a precision z stage driven by the COP autofocus algorithm implemented in Phase II. These choices provided the greatest precision and control when scanning a sample and obtaining at least 30M spectra, each comprised of 1024-2048 intensity vs wavelength channels with a spectral resolution of 0.18 nm (512 measurements and 3nm spectral resolution for the IR).   The standard stage is a voice-coil x-y stage from Physik Instrumente, with a linear range in each direction of up to 5 mm and a step size as small as 20 nanometers.  Larger samples may be scanned using the Klar jumbo configuration with an Aerotech stage having a maximum linear range of up to 10 cm and a minimum step size of 1.5 microns.  Both stages have extremely precise control and can shift position fast enough to allow for a total capture time per sampled point of under a msec.  The KlarSpec operating system controls the entire instrument.  The KlarFit fitting software allows the user to fit any spectrum to an arbitrary function with any number of peaks.  All software is compiled and runs on Windows on a laptop with a GPU card.  Klar?s technology is targeted at developers of compound semiconductor materials and devices, the next generation of electronics for which the market is projected to be $48B by 2024.  This market is dominated by high-power electronics for electric vehicles, wind power, solar power, and the 5G network.  Unlike Silicon, compound semiconductors are light emitters, making them ideal for large-scale lighting fixtures and shows, large-area flat-panel displays, and ultrahigh speed fiber optic communication.  Semiconductor light emitters are multi-stacks of various compound semiconductors selected for their bandgap and doped to produce n and p regions for diodes and lasers.  A typical stack might contain up to a dozen or more layers, each different than the other and all lattice-mismatched to the surrounding layers.  Such structures contain defects and dislocations that reduce the uniformity and power output of the devices, and their lifetime.  Users of Klar?s instruments have sought to discover these defects, determine their nature, and use this knowledge to modify and then monitor manufacturing and process control.  All milestones were achieved in the program. Klar is now moving to commercializing the instruments in a portable, affordable, and reconfigurable product line.
