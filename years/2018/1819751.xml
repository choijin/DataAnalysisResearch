<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in improving the quality of general and task lighting and reducing the amount of wasted light, thus reducing energy consumption. Solid state lighting has caused a paradigm shift in the lighting industry. However, the rapid growth of the LED has surpassed our understanding of its effects on human health and productivity, as well as the environment. Developing systems that put light only where it is needed can reduce energy consumption and improve well-being by eliminating glare and wasted light. Full control over where artificial lights shine may also reduce the disruption of natural ecosystems and agriculture caused by light pollution.? Unfortunately, a compact and low-cost solution to spatially controllable illumination is not available. Should one be brought to market, the industry could be tailored to meet the needs of each street lamp, each office worker and the entertainment industry among others. The ubiquitous nature of artificial illumination provides a unique commercial opportunity with multiple market segments for growth potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will focus on a microsystems solution to steerable lighting using a low-power, low-cost, silicon-based mirror less than 1 mm in diameter. The mirror is capable of real-time adjustments that will steer incident light with significant angular range. It is controlled using digital electronics and easily combined with traditional smart home electronics. The objective of the research is to measure the optical output of varying system setups and optical components to determine what optics are necessary for proper light output shape, uniformity, and color temperature. The project will rely heavily on a combination of test measurements and simulations to cycle through experiments rapidly and efficiently in order to converge on a manufacturing plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the major activities which was not as highlighted within the application was in customer discovery. What we found was a market opportunity in ergonomics where there is a significant gap in lighting and interest by multiple ergonomic companies and end users. Much of this was presented during the bootcamp and follow on conversations have ensued.  We also constructed a very rough demonstration of the system using much larger electronics than would be necessary for the final system. The demonstration included optical components designed for experimental work and were, therefore, much larger than ideal but certainly displayed some of the attributes our final system might have in terms of functionality.   The demonstration included both automatic adjustments to illuminate a tabletop and components sitting atop it as well as adjustments which could be made manually by someone using the system.  We measured the angular dependencies on the outputs of the test system. Based on those measurements, we varied specific properties and actual components within the system in order to optimize the output for user functionality and experience.  In all, we discovered a possible market niche as well as created a basis for initial design variations. Much work still needs to be done in order to form a compact system in terms of both user experience design and one which is well suited for ergonomics. One of the key aspects to the research was converging on what metrics constitute good user experience and proper lighting ergonomics. We believe we made progress and a proper definition is likely on the horizon for the entire industry.       Last Modified: 08/24/2020       Submitted by: Jessica Morrison]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
