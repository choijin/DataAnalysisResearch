<AbstractNarration>The multi-resolution articulation abilities of the next-generation autonomous systems, used in advanced robotics, rehabilitation, tele-operation, manufacturing and infrastructure applications are made possible by unique designs and complex mechanisms. These next generation robotic systems can benefit greatly by the development of computationally efficient tools to synthesize optimal feedback control laws to achieve specified output signal statistics in presence of model and sensing uncertainties. To support commercial applications such as package delivery, it is imperative that the robotic systems operating in uncertain environments negotiate specific waypoints with prescribed tolerance. This unique challenge of routing the vehicles operating in uncertain environments involves a strong coupling between the uncertainty propagation and control. Successful negotiation of this challenge is contingent on the development of stable optimal feedback control laws, while accounting for the uncertainties that pervade dynamical systems. The fundamental formalisms that underpin this research are widely applicable to the control of next generation robotic systems and unmanned vehicles. The project includes plans to integrate research into educational efforts involving graduate and undergraduate students, including expanding efforts to reach under-represented populations in science and engineering. Outreach activities include the technical interchange meetings with local school teachers and instituting robotics related tutorial courses to motivate middle and high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the research is to investigate a unified approach to stable optimal feedback control laws and uncertainty propagation methods by developing computationally efficient solutions to the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) partial differential equations (PDEs), respectively. Recent advances in sparse approximation and non-product quadrature rules are exploited to solve the HJB and FPK equations. The intellectual merits are drawn from advancing the state of knowledge in uncertainty quantification, optimal control theory, and numerical analysis, and integrating them effectively to realize a scalable framework for study of dynamical systems. The Conjugate Unscented Transformation (CUT) technique in conjunction with sparse approximation methods forms an enabling tool to drive the uncertainty propagation and optimal feedback control realization processes. This research culminates in the development of nonlinear stable feedback control laws for uncertain dynamic systems, impacting various estimation and control problems in engineering. The proposed research will be demonstrated on several benchmark problems, along with two key applications involving optimal momentum transfer in control of gyroscopic systems and surveillance of a ground region with the help of unmanned vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The development of stable optimal feedback control laws and uncertainty propagation through nonlinear systems poses significant challenges in the study of closed loop dynamical systems. This is due to the fact that both problems require the solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) that are multivariate functions of states and time. The optimal feedback solutions are derived from the nonlinear PDE known as Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) equation whereas the evolution of state Probability Density Function (PDF) is governed by Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation. The development of a systematic solution process for the governing PDEs is directly impeded by the curse of dimensionality, whereby the number of spatial variables for both the PDEs is equal to state space dimension. For instance, the problem of stabilization of a rigid body is a 12 dimensional problem, and simple finite element discretization strategies entail a large number of variables for effective solution process. Bellman famously termed this explosive growth as the curse of dimensionality. Furthermore, unique challenges exist in the pursuit of solution methodologies for each PDE. Difficulties associated with the solution of the HJB equation can be attributed to the nonlinearity of the dynamical system. The process is compounded by the presence of a specified terminal manifold at which we intend the state to reach at a fixed final time, where the dimensionality is increased further, to invoke mechanisms to make the feedback control process aware of the terminal manifold to be attained at the fixed terminal time. The challenge in solving the FPK PDE lies in the determination of the domain of the state PDF at any given instant of time. It is typically impossible to make this determination apriori, and one has to resolve this causality dilemma. The main focus of this research was to develop a unified approach to solve both HJB and FPK equations in a computationally attractive manner, while exploiting recent advances in sparse approximation and non-product quadrature rules. The approach comprises of a collocation scheme to break the curse of dimensionality by employing a unique combination of non-product quadrature methods and sparse approximation tools.
