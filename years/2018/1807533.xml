<AbstractNarration>This RAPID research focuses on investigating the hurricane impacts on the carbon cycling of Everglades wetland ecosystems.  Hurricane Irma resulted in extensive wind damage and the highest water levels recorded in over 20 years in the Florida Everglades. The findings and predictions that result from this study will directly address larger-scale questions about how wetland ecosystem structure and function and aquatic productivity are altered in the face of increased disturbance from hurricanes. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Wetlands within Everglades National Park have been seriously impacted by extensive defoliation, disruption of periphyton mats, large inputs of carbon and nutrients into the soil and water column, and a reduction in standing dead tissue of marsh graminoids.  Along with reductions in photosynthesis, these changes may alter anoxic conditions, supporting greater rates of methane production and release. This effort will focus on reductions in leaf area and how this contributes to floating mats of dead material that cause anoxic conditions and 'hotspots' for CH4 production and release of CO2 to the atmosphere.  This project includes additional chamber measurements necessary to interpret 'hotspot' carbon fluxes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research result from an improved foundational understanding of how wetland systems respond to hurricanes, and the effort will provide an initial vulnerability assessment of the effects of extreme high-water levels on Everglades wetlands. This study also affords research opportunities for junior faculty and technicians from underrepresented minority groups.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Hurricanes are well known to cause considerable damage to forest vegetation by removing leaves, and branches, snapping trunks, and uprooting entire trees. On September 10, 2017 Hurricane Irma hit the Florida Everglades, causing extensive damage to its forest ecosystems. Unexpectedly, we observed rows of damage in the freshwater marshes where localized storm winds ripped plants from the soil leaving floating mats of dead plant tissue. These mats facilitated physical and chemical changes where they occurred, leading to &ldquo;hotspots&rdquo; of methane production. In addition to the significant hurricane-caused damage to vegetation, the storm brought extensive rain to the area and caused water level to increase to heights not seen in decades. It was our intention to study how the storm affected the system&rsquo;s carbon dynamics. We assessed how the storm changed the system&rsquo;s ability to sequester carbon through photosynthesis, and to release it through increased respiration or methane production caused by &ldquo;hotspots&rdquo; and increased water levels. Using satellite images, we determined the area of dead floating mats, and used machine learning to develop a predictive model for their occurrence across the Greater Everglades ecosystems. We also made precise measurements of carbon fluxes, making periodic observations at sampling locations with floating mats, and continuous, half-hourly observations at two freshwater marsh locations. These measurements allowed us to estimate the impact of floating mats, and the estimate changes in the pattern of carbon dynamics due to the storm, which we scaled across the mapped area. These site-based measurements were supplemented with controlled laboratory experiments, where we tested the ability of the dominant aquatic plants to tolerate varying depths and durations of inundation and the rates of breakdown of windthrown vegetation material and uprooted soil as indicted by release of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>. The combination of vegetation damage and high waters increase both carbon dioxide and methane release from the marshes of Everglades. Hurricanes are a recurrent meteorological phenomenon along the Florida coast. Hurricane-induced landscape changes depend on a complex set of storm factors, but also depend significantly on patterns of water movement and the physical characteristics of the site, such as substrate.
