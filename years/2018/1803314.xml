<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to electrically detect the binding of protein molecules to virus particles as a means for detecting these proteins at very low concentrations, down to one picomolar.  This detection process involves a new biosensor architecture called the Impedance-Transduced BioResistor consisting of an electrically conductive and very thin plastic film in which are embedded virus particles.  These virus particles are responsible for recognizing and binding to the proteins the authors are detecting.  The electrical resistance of this virus-plastic film is then monitored using two metal electrodes, and the resistance increases when the protein of interest is detected.  The goals for this project are to improve the performance of the Impedance-Transduced BioResistor, to broaden the range of molecules that can be detected, and to discover the detailed mechanism and principle of sensor operation.  It is also proposed to design a multi-channel sensor that provides the capability to simultaneously and rapidly measure ten different proteins.  In coordination with this research program, the investigators will operate a summer outreach program, called NEXTech 2018: Nano Electrochemistry eXtensions to Technology for high school students focusing on electrochemistry and applications to nanoscience.  Laboratory experiments that demonstrate key principles will also be carried out by these students under the supervision of the graduate students funded by this grant.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    How can one design electrical interfaces that enable communication between nanoscopic biological structures and an electrical circuit? In this proposal, the authors seek to electrically detect the binding of protein molecules to virus particles as a means for detecting these proteins at concentrations down to 1 pM.  This is accomplished using an extremely simple sensor architecture called the Impedance-Transduced BioResistor that consists of a conductive PEDOT (or poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) film that contains a high volume density of M13 virus particles engineered to recognize and bind a particular target protein.  As one example, the Impedance-Transduced BioResistor detect the protein human serum albumin (66 kDa) at a concentration of 10 nM and at higher concentrations up to 800 nM.  The response time of these sensors is in the 5 second range.  A major advantage of this sensor design compared with field-effect transistor-based protein sensors - is that its performance is not degraded by the presence of salt in the solution, even at high concentrations of 1M.  Even in this case, large amplitude, high precision electrical responses to the presence of these protein molecules are measured.  &lt;br/&gt;    The goals for this project are to further improve the performance of the Impedance-Transduced BioResistor, to broaden the range of molecules that can be detected, and to discover the detailed mechanism and principle of sensor operation.  It is also proposed to design multi-channel versions of the sensor that provide the capability of measuring ten different proteins in parallel, at the same time.  A deeper understanding of the mechanism by which the Impedance-Transduced BioResistor operates will be sought.  This component of the research will involve testing a series of hypotheses that isolate several candidate mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;    In coordination with this research program, the authors will operate a summer outreach program, called NEXTech 2018: Nano Electrochemistry eXtensions to Technology for high school students focusing on electrochemistry and applications to nanoscience.  Laboratory experiments that demonstrate key principles will also be carried out by these students under the supervision of the graduate students funded by this grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In collaboration with the laboratory of Professor Gregory Weiss at UC Irvine, we have conceived and developed a new type of biosensor - the impedance-transduced bioresistor or ITBR - capable of detecting proteins in undiluted urine with 10 pM sensitivity (for DJ-1) with an analysis time of one minute.&nbsp;These label-free biosensors also operate without amplification, additional reagents, or blocking agents.</p> <p>The ITBR is a biosensor that exploits direct electrical communication with virus particles to measure the concentration of protein biomarkers for cancer and disease (Figure 1). These virus particles, which are engineered to recognize and bind a target protein of interest, are entrained within an electrodeposited virus-PEDOT film. The electrical impedance of this film directly produces the signal required for protein quantitation, eliminating the need for any additional amplification (Figure 2). In addition, no reagents such as redox couples are required for these measurements.</p> <p>The conductive polymer bilayer comprising the ITBR channel can be engineered to adjust its sensitivity. In particular, a reduction in the thickness of the PEDOT-PSS bottom layer from 70 nm to 48 nm significantly increases the resistance of this layer, from &asymp;80 &Omega; to &asymp;300 &Omega; increasing the ITBR&nbsp;signal for HSA (66.5 kDa) by a factor of 3x to 10x. Applying this strategy to the detection of a smaller protein, DJ-1 (20.8 kDa) enables the measurement of this bladder cancer marker at concentrations down to 10 pM using a measurement time of 1.0 min. in a dip-and-read modality. The extreme simplicity of the ITBR allows for its fabrication in three steps, contributing to excellent sensor-to-sensor reproducibility characterized by CoVs below 7% down to 30 pM for DJ-1, across the entire DJ-1 binding curve spanning four orders of magnitude in concentration (Figure 3)</p> <p>Direct quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurement of the mass of the bioaffinity bilayer demonstrates that the equivalent of multiple (&gt;10) monolayers of DJ-1 protein are able to diffuse into this layer from solution within one minute, a process that coincides temporally with the generation of the ITBR impedance signal. The resulting QCM binding curve for DJ-1 resembles the binding curve measured by the ITBR for this protein. Based upon this observation as well as other evidence, a simple model is proposed for signal transduction involving the dilution of the PEDOT conductor by insulating protein molecules resulting in an increased resistance for this layer, a mechanism analogous to that operating in carbon/polymer chemiresistor gas sensors (Figure 4).</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong> - The Intellectual Merit of this work is the discovery of a new biosensor - the ITBR - that operates based upon a new transduction mechanism not seen in any other biosensor, to our knowledge. But this mechanism IS seen in gas sensors that exploit carbon-filled polymer resistors. It involves: 1) the affinity-driven partitioning of the target protein into a virus-PEDOT composite material, 2) the swelling of this composite, and, 3) the interruption of conduction through the composite caused by the breakage of high conductivity electrical pathways. We find that when the virus-PEDOT layer is very thin (&lt; 100 nm), rapid response of the sensor (&lt; 1 min) is obtained. Opportunities exist for the extension of this new biosensing platform to the detection of other disease markers in urine.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong> - The Broader Impacts of this work are two-fold. First, our data suggest that the ITBR is a tool capable of detecting bladder cancer using a standard urinalysis in a doctor?s office, rapidly and cheaply. If the efficacy seen in for experiments performed on the bench top translates to single patient samples tested with prototype ITBRs, the commercialization of this device will proceed and many lives could be saved. Further development and optimization of the ITBR will rely upon the fundamental science performed in connection this CBET contract. Second, the students engaged in this research receive a tremendous breadth of experience with spectroscopy, electrical measurements, electrochemistry, and a wide variety of materials characterization tools in the course of these projects. These students are highly sought-after by prospective employers upon graduation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/02/2021<br>      Modified by: Reginald&nbsp;M&nbsp;Penner</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1803314/1803314_10543367_1625247550555_Fig1_composed_SML--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1803314/1803314_10543367_1625247550555_Fig1_composed_SML--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig 1 - ITBR Fabrication"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1803314/1803314_10543367_1625247550555_Fig1_composed_SML--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig 1 - ITBR Fabrication"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Impedance-Transduce BioResistor (ITBR). a) Gold electrodes for a two-ITBR chip showing its dimensions.
