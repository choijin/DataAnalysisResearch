<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to reveal insights into a novel type of feedback regulation (a mechanism by which a small chemical molecule can regulate its own production)  mediated by the binding of a molecule to the master protein regulator controlling the production of that molecule. The project will contribute to the scientific and professional development of postdoctoral fellows and will provide research experiences for undergraduate students in research. The project includes the development of a Summer Practical Workshop in Quantitative Biochemistry, which will benefit both undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In corn, the R protein is a transcription factor that activates transcription of genes encoding enzymes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway for purple anthocyanin pigments.  Preliminary data suggest that binding of flavonoid molecules to R, through a specific protein domain (the ACT domain), modulates the protein-protein interactions and the DNA-binding abilities of the R protein, leading in turn to differential recognition of promoters in the genes involved in the flavonoid pathway.  Experimental tests of this model will:  1) Establish the in vivo consequences of the interaction of R with flavonoids that have been identified to bind to the ACT; 2) Investigate ACT-small molecule structure-function relationships, by defining which other small molecules bind to the ACT, identifying the ACT residues relevant for the small molecule interaction, and establishing how general the results are for ACT domains in other plant transcription factors; and 3) Analyze in vivo the dynamic associations controlled by the ACT domain of R, by combining genetic resources with cellular approaches to investigate where and which interactions occur, in the presence and absence of flavonoids or other small molecules.  The work is expected to reveal a new type of feedback regulatory mechanism (metabolite binding regulating a transcription factor responsible for synthesis of the ligand), which could serve as a model for how other small metabolites might regulate their own synthesis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences (Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences; Plant Genome Research Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems) and by the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences (Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Establishing how the information coded by DNA is interpreted into specific developmental programs poses a fundamental biological challenge. Combinatorial control provides a mechanism by which a small number of regulatory proteins, the transcription factors, control a much larger number of genes, with exquisite temporal and spatial expression patterns. However, little is known on how transcription factors assemble into different regulatory complexes to control distinct sets of genes. This project focused on <em>R</em>, a classical maize gene encoding a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional regulator responsible for the regulation of anthocyanin pigments in the kernel, and contributing to the characteristic pigmentation of &ldquo;<em>Indian Corn</em>&rdquo;. Our studies showed that a C-terminal domain named ACT, because of structural similarity to similar domains present in amino acid biosynthesis enzymes across all kingdoms of life, modulated R function: When R dimerizes through the ACT domain, the bHLH region cannot dimerize and R is tethered to DNA by its interaction with the R2R3-MYB factor C1. In that configuration, the monomeric bHLH interacts with the chromatin factor, RIF1. However, when dimerization through the bHLH is impaired, for example through the proposed interaction with a small molecule, the bHLH is licensed to dimerize, recognizing canonical G-box DNA motifs. We crystallized and solved the structures of the ACT domains of R and of the Arabidopsis R ortholog, GL3. We demonstrated that flavonoid pathway intermediates modulated mRNA accumulation of pathway genes, and our results suggest that this is mediated by the ACT domain, likely by the interaction with leucocyanidin and other flavonoids. The results obtained as part of this project provide a conceptual framework on how small molecules (such as metabolic pathway intermediates) can modulate gene expression by affecting how transcription factor complexes are assembled, contributing to explaining combinatorial gene regulation, a conundrum of fundamental biological significance, with implications to all forms of (eukaryotic) life.
