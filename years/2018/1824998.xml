<AbstractNarration>This workshop is funded through the "Dear Colleague Letter: Principles for the Design of Digital Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Learning Environments (NSF 18-017)." Post-secondary educational institutions are being buffeted by three major transitions: changes in the nature of the competencies students need and want, changes in the demographic mix of people that they serve, and changes in the technologies and strategies available to build, measure, and communicate competence and expertise. Powerful new information technologies, unprecedented opportunities to gather and analyze large volumes of data, and new insights into how people learn, make it possible to imagine designing learning environments that make learning more productive, more affordable, and more gracefully adaptable to individuals throughout their lifetimes.  The new field of learning analytics has made major advances in understanding how educational Big Data can produce insights to improve classroom practices. Yet, a number of critical questions remain unanswered in important areas to ensure all Americans receive the education they need to prosper in a modern economy. The aim of this workshop is to investigate the role of learning analytics in contributing to advances in technological learning environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will bring together interdisciplinary experts to articulate the state-of-the-art and propose research priorities for learning analytics in the coming decade.  A central theme will be to explore new ways to use powerful tools in data science (machine learning, social network analysis, analytics and visualization of complex data, temporal, multi-scale and statistical models, integration of heterogeneous data, data scrubbing, wrangling and provenance tracking, data privacy and cybersecurity) to define competence, measure it, and build it using a rich array of new approaches to study learning. The workshop will also explore how the full power of these tools can be applied to the most critical challenges faced in learning analytics. The outcome of the workshop will be a clear definition of the highest priority research needs in learning analytics and a practical roadmap to guide public and private research support in these areas. The resulting white paper will provide insights to improve a wide range of learning environment contexts in in post-secondary education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

How      can these competencies be measured and communicated? How      can innovations in approaches to learning (technology and pedagogy) be      evaluated?   Two issues were identified that lie at the core of the research needed in the short term: finding a way to identify the competencies actually needed in a complex and rapidly changing economy, and finding a way to measure and communicate those competencies.  In the long term, research is needed to provide a roadmap for changing the way education and work are connected.

The result of the workshop was a proposal for the highest priority research needs in learning analytics and suggestions to guide public and private research support to achieve the needed broad impact in these areas. These included:  Strong partnerships to close the gap now separating public and private research work. Explore competencies demonstrated in educational and non-educational settingsto define the skills actually needed and convert competence gained at work with academic credentials. Validated alternative credentialsthat can demonstrating their value in real-world conditions. Privacy, and Security for conducting research with large data sets while protecting individual privacy.  Careful use of artificial intelligence to ensure that data used to train machine learning systems are not burdened by biases that could be incorporated in new tools or applications.   A research program capable of meeting the ambitious goals discussed in the workshop will not be easy to design or implement.  It will require moving away from the comfortable distinction between education and training, STEM and the liberal arts, and analysis of learning in formal education and work, to understand how the modern workplace actually operates now and in the future.
