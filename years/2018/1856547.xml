<AbstractNarration>There is an urgent need for new technologies to enable the economically-viable and environmentally-responsible use of the large amounts of natural gas currently being accessed due to recent innovations in hydrolytic fracturing and directional drilling. New methods to convert natural gas directly to higher value fuels and chemicals would limit the current practice of flaring (direct burning to carbon dioxide without energy capture).  Currently, more than 140,500 million cubic meters of natural gas is wasted each year in the flaring process.  This research project seeks to convert hydrocarbons such as natural gas, to higher value commodity chemicals by developing new catalysts that speed-up the desired chemical transformation efficiently and effectively. Cost, availability, and its benign nature, make oxygen/air the best choice of oxidant for large-scale chemical oxidation. Professor Goldberg is committed to mentoring and encouraging a diverse group of students to pursue careers in science. Her students learn to develop and analyze chemical reactions and scientific arguments, critically evaluate their data, use advanced laboratory techniques and modern analytical and spectroscopic methods, search and manage the expansive scientific literature, and communicate effectively with other scientists and lay audiences. Through participation in science outreach events and programming at the University of Pennsylvania and in the Philadelphia Public Schools, the research team educates the general public about the important role that catalysis plays in their lives. High school students in the greater Philadelphia area learn that scientists come from all backgrounds, and that this diversity is crucial in the sciences as it spurs innovation and accelerates the finding of new knowledge and solutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project targets the development of robust catalysts that can selectively activate and functionalize carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds using air or oxygen as the oxidant. New technologies are needed to enable the economically viable and responsible use of the large amounts of natural gas that are currently being accessed due to the recent innovations in hydrolytic fracturing and directional drilling methods. To this end, the research team on this project is investigating new mechanisms for the activation of alkane C-H bonds. Detailed studies of the reactions of organometallic alkyl compounds (the metal products of C-H activation) with oxygen are carried out to gain the mechanistic understanding that is needed for the design and development of methods to use oxygen as the oxidant in selective partial oxidations of natural gas. In parallel with the laboratory research, the project trains a workforce of scientists who is needed to address the many future technological challenges. This project is providing the next generation of scientists with important training and skills to allow them to be creative and effective in solving global challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
