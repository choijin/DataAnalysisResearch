<AbstractNarration>Advanced computing is a foundational technology that has an enormous and growing impact on America's science, security and economic interests - all of which are interrelated. This project aims to: identify strategic public-private research areas for American leadership in advanced computing, optimize the way the public and private sector collaborate so research advances are deployed in meaningful ways that serve America's security and prosperity, and engage many stakeholder groups and help them prepare a diverse community of Americans to lead this shift in computing. By helping the United States field a more competitive advance computing ecosystem, the project would also advance scientific knowledge that underpins that same security and prosperity, and build the resulting industry of the future - along with the accompanying jobs - in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High performance computing represents a foundational technology and business asset for improving United States? competitiveness. However, the United States, a long-time leader in the supercomputing realm, has been falling behind other nations in the development of advanced computing resources potentially ceding leadership in this space and as the global innovation leader to other countries investing in the resources to power innovation. This project will improve and expand collaboration between public and private sector groups to use the limited resources available to the high-performance computing community effectively, and strengthen the ability of firms to leverage advanced computing for economic advantage by developing skills within the American workforce, new software partnerships, and greater access to advanced computing resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Advanced computing holds an opportunity to unleash latent innovation potential in the U.S. economy by applying new tools, perspectives and resources to existing problems. Yet, America and computing in general sit at a unique moment in time where advances in generalized computing are slowing, busi- ness models surrounding technology investments are changing, and both the public and private sectors are searching for ways to continue to push productivity with no clear or reliable technology-specific solution on the horizon.  Though the stated goal of the progressive BUILD regional dialogue series across the United States was meant to elicit new-to-the-world public-private partnership (PPP) models to advanced computing technologies in the United States, conversation among participants raised a number of important policy issues, through which the Council on Competitiveness has identified recommendations to catalyze advanced computing PPPs in the United States.  "Technology Readiness"  Dialogue participants generally agreed that no current technology in development is poised to replace the current computing technology paradigm and drive the next generation of advanced computing driven productivity growth. Why? One of the most significant reasons is that the overall pool of investment in this space is much too small. In addition, the diversity of potential technologies has fractured funding sources, extending the time for companies to coalesce around a suite of technologies representing next generation hardware and software. While important to explore all avenues, this extended timeline creates a time-bound economic imperative: Without new, marketable technologies to fund operations at existing fabrication companies, there may be no domestic industry left to compete when technology representing the next S-curve ascends in the market.      Recommendation: The United States must fund PPPs to support existing market needs and offer economic incentives to rebuild the technology manufacturing sector.  "Filling Gaps Between Specializations"  The breadth of the U.S. innovation ecosystem has pushed stakeholders toward increasing levels of specialization, fragmenting and siloing many cooperative research efforts.  Recommendation: Tie public-sector PPP funding to cross-domain, cross-sector efforts to maximize innovation potential and impact.  "National Security Restrictions Limiting Access to Unrelated Tools for Innovation"  The United States has significant institutional research capabilities in its national laboratories, many of which are applied to sensitive research related to national security. This places additional barriers and security measures over all work and facilities at the national laboratory enterprise, creating additional hurdles that may discourage potential partnerships with outside entities.  Recommendation: Bring more resources ?outside the fence? to lower the barriers to new partnerships and incentivize local growth.      "Connectivity"  U.S. telecommunications infrastructure needs to be upgraded to enable more reliable and productive engagement.  Recommendation: Dedicate funding or create incentives through tax rebates for industry to build a more robust data infrastructure across the United States.      Emerging from the BUILD Series were also several new PPP models that can be carried out by the Joint Program Office and National Strategic Computing Initiative, with or without support from the Council, to increase the competitiveness of the U.S. advanced computing ecosystem.  FUTURE AREAS OF RESEARCH      The continued and rapid transformation of technology will necessarily change the tools of innovation, extent and nature of involvement of stakeholders in PPPs, and incentives for developing and deploying new technologies. The PPP models proposed in this report relate to a moment in time where incentives align in such a way that these models can succeed.  However, as the public and private sectors evolve over time in response to new technologies, business models and incentive structures, the Council (and funders of advanced computing capabilities) must constantly re-engage stakeholders to understand how their motivations have shifted, driving their interests and investment decisions in new directions. For example, a key model explored ways to expose more of America?s current and future innovators to advanced computing as a tool to enhance their own efforts. The growing democratization of tools for innovation may obviate this PPP in several years, but the United States must not let future obsolescence deter current action to optimize the current innovation ecosystem.      Deeper understanding of stakeholder motivations will improve future models for partnership, and defining measurable traits of PPPs will improve the quality of assessments examining the effectiveness of such partnerships in the future. To this end, potential future pathways for this research may follow several distinct but related avenues:  1. Engage more sector-specific computing users to understand unique challenges of a given domain.   2. Continually survey stakeholders in efficient PPPs as political and economic environments change to refine key metrics and identifiers contributing to success. Understanding why PPPs are successful will also help stakeholders identify when market conditions support the creation of a new PPP.
