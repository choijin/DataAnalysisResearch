<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project focuses on developing chemically cross-linked synthetic nanomaterials to address the unmet clinical need in promoting infection free tissue regeneration in surgical, traumatic, ocular, burn, and chronic wounds. While small wounds heal naturally, larger chronic wounds demonstrate delayed wound healing with infections, and affect over 6.5 million patients costing over US $25 billion annually in treatments. In addition, annually, 2 million Americans suffer from serious infections due to drug resistant bacteria resulting in severe morbidity, serious complications, huge economic losses with an estimated 23,000 deaths. As conventional antibiotics are failing, our ability to fight drug resistant pathogens is diminishing and the pipeline of new potential antibiotic drugs is very skim. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a product that can fight multiple pathogens through a mechanism against which bacteria are less likely to develop further resistance. Hence, the current project evaluates the feasibility of developing a novel, easily handleable dry film with potential to eliminate a variety of infectious pathogens while improving wound healing in a single application. This product is pliable, easily rehydratable, has intrinsic tissue scaffolding properties and is inherently antimicrobial against a broad range of pathogens without the use of any additional agents.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of developing a shape retaining, pliable, easily handleable antimicrobial cell-scaffolding gel matrix into a product that is simultaneously toxic to antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, while remaining conducive to tissue regeneration. This current product has a nano-porous gel matrix that promotes cellular infiltration and attachment along with utilizing a charge-based mechanism to lyse bacterial membranes upon contact. Although there is on-going research on such self-assembled hydrogels, the formation of films using these nanofibers has never been assessed before and stands to be the key technological advancement. Thus, this current proposal explores two methods for making films such as i) solvent casting methods relying on non-covalent crosslinking - where the hydrogel is applied to a surface and then allowed to dry into a film overnight, and ii) Covalent crosslinking by - incorporating cysteines by oxidizing using H2O2 or crosslinking using Schiff base formation followed by reductive deamination. The films so formed will be structurally and functionally evaluated for their ability to eliminate infections and biocompatibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
