<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from advancing the application territory of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and 4G/5G/Beyond-5G ecosystems. If successful, the obtained results would directly benefit a large portion of the current 8.4 billion wirelessly "connected things" with an estimated $273 billion market. It will facilitate "always-on, anytime, anywhere" network services and further help enable many emerging IoT applications (e.g., safe driving, remote healthcare, smart city, wearables). The technology is expected to create new business opportunities for IoT vendors, service providers, and mobile virtual network operators. If successful, it will facilitate evolution from an operator-centric network ecosystem to a user/application-centric ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a software-based solution to enabling dependable, software-defined network services for IoT applications. The objective for Phase I is to provide "always-on, anytime, anywhere" network service for billions of IoT devices and applications. Different from the current infrastructure-based solutions (using software-defined networking or network slicing), the proposed technology offers an in-device, SIM-based software solution without infrastructure upgrades or added device hardware. It enables in-SIM visibility to "black-box" mobile network operations, performs in-device optimizations using readily available mechanisms, and offers further value-added cloud services for network-wide optimization and management via crowdsourcing. The technology is readily deployable on today's IoT devices (both low-end and high-end) and provides "must-have" features for two customer segments (validated through NSF I-Corps interviews) - IoT mobile virtual network operators, and IoT application vendors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Our objective for Phase I is to offer "always available, real-time cellular network service" while enabling low-power operations. Different from the current infrastructure-based solutions (based on software-defined networking or network slicing), MobIQ is an in-device, SIM-based software solution without infrastructure upgrades or added device hardware. It offers the in-SIM visibility to the "black-box" mobile networks, performs in-device optimizations using readily-available mechanisms, and offers further value-added cloud services for in-depth network optimization and management via crowdsourcing. MobIQ is readily deployable for today's IoT devices (both low-end and high-end ones), and provide "must-have" features for two customer segments (validated in our NSF I-Corps interviews): The IoT mobile virtual network operators, and the IoT application vendors.</p> <p>We have made significant accomplishments toward our goals in this SBIR Phase I project. We have conducted customer interviews to understand the market and demands, prototyped MobIQ software to meet these demands, started field trials with our potential customers, protected our technology with patents. We next elaborate our achievements.</p> <p><strong>Customer Discovery Interviews:&nbsp;</strong>To understand the market and customers that MobIQ can serve, we have conducted 250+ customer discovery interviews. In this process, we have discovered the customer- product match for MobIQ, and started business negotiations with potential customers.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>MobIQ Product Development</strong>: We have prototyped MobIQ with the following technical features:</p> <ul> <li><strong>In-SIM mobile network monitor</strong>: The first step for client-side network optimization is to let every IoT device access the runtime, "black-box" mobile network information. Existing solutions address this issue inside the smartphones, but they are not directly applicable to IoT due to two practical issues: (i) IoT devices, such as cars, wearables, smart meters, etc., may not have the sophisticated hardware features as the smartphones. (ii) The prior smartphone solution requires system-level OS privilege ("root" in Android and Jailbreak in iOS). To address both issues, MobIQ offers an in-SIM Java applet for the mobile network monitoring. The key premise is&nbsp;that, every IoT device needs a SIM card&nbsp; for mobile network access. The in-SIM solution can thus be used by all IoT devices with mobile network&nbsp;access. Such in-SIM software does not require the root or&nbsp;jailbreak for IoT devices. Our prototype currently works on&nbsp;Sysmocom programmable SIM cards and U-Blox EVK-L2 IoT&nbsp;evaluation boards.&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>In-SIM mobile network optimizer</strong>: With the in-SIM network monitoring and analytics, MobIQ next optimize the IoT network access quality. For incremental deployability, our optimizer is a software solution based on existing in-SIM mechanisms, including the frequency band selection, radio technology selection, and multi-carrier network selections. It does not require the infrastructure or device hardware change. Our solution can achieve up to 3.74x throughput improvement and 1.9x latency reduction.&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>In-device network &amp; IoT application optimizer</strong>: To further optimize mobile network and IoT applications, MobIQ explores a value-added software solution that runs at the IoT endpoint. Deploying such software inside devices is feasible for some IoT service providers (e.g., gaming phone vendors and wireless cameras for the outdoor targeted advertising), and has been required by one of our customers. Currently MobIQ supports for two IoT applications from our validated customers: (1) Gaming phone vendors: The gaming phones need high probability of &le;100ms end-to-end latency for seamless online gaming experiences. Existing infrastructure or above-IP solutions cannot fully meet this demand. Instead, MobIQ leverages the client-side, full-stack network information to perform the cross-layer optimizations;&nbsp; (2) Outdoor digital targeted advertisers: To&nbsp;maximize the successful ad delivery rate and thus revenue for our customers, the outdoor targeted advertisers&nbsp;should achieve high model detection accuracy (thus high bandwidth) and low ad delivery latency. With the client-side full-stack information, MobIQ holistically balance the accuracy and latency to maximize the successful ad delivery rate.</li> <li><strong>Value-Added cloud service</strong>: Beyond optimization in each device, we move further toward the value- added optimization via crowdsourcing. We observe that local optimization does not always result in globally optimal performance/reliability. Instead, by crowdsourcing the information from other devices (that use different bands/technologies/carriers), MobIQ can provide global knowledge and optimize IoT devices.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Field Trials With Potential Customers</strong>: We have started the filed trials with two potential customers, Xiaomi and Vivo. We have customized MobIQ to for Xiaomi and Vivo to optimize Glory of Kings, a multi-player online mobile games with 2M active players per month. Compared with the legacy 4G LTE, MobIQ increases the probability of &le;100ms gaming latency for smooth gaming experience. We are currently in the process of running the filed tests with their radio engineers, afterwards we will start the commercial negotiation.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Property Protection</strong>: To protect our technology, we have filed three U.S. patents for the online mobile gaming booster (US Patent App. 62/914,620), outdoor targeted advertising (US Patent App. 62/937,037), and callee-based voice call spoofing mitigation (US Patent App. 62/871,572).</p> <p><span><br /></span></p> </div> </div> </div> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/06/2020<br>      Modified by: Yuanjie&nbsp;Li</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1843994/1843994_10589301_1581020464191_mobiq-overview--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1843994/1843994_10589301_1581020464191_mobiq-overview--rgov-800width.jpg" title="MobIQ"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1843994/1843994_10589301_1581020464191_mobiq-overview--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="MobIQ"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">MobIQ overview</div> <div class="imageCredit">MobIQ Technologies</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yuanjie&nbsp;Li</div> <div class="imageTitle">MobIQ</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1843994/1843994_10589301_1581020596701_game-demo--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1843994/1843994_10589301_1581020596701_game-demo--rgov-800width.jpg" title="MobIQ's in-device optimization for mobile gaming"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1843994/1843994_10589301_1581020596701_game-demo--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="MobIQ's in-device optimization for mobile gaming"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">MobIQ's in-device optimization for mobile gaming</div> <div class="imageCredit">MobIQ Technologies</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Yuanjie&nbsp;Li</div> <div class="imageTitle">MobIQ's in-device optimization for mobile gaming</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
