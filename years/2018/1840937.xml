<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of MedSwarm, a software product for radiology that will significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce medical costs. MedSwarm is an AI-based collaborative decision-making system that will significantly amplify diagnostic accuracy across a wide range diagnoses, not by replacing radiologists with AI, but by amplifying their human expertise. MedSwarm employs a technology called Artificial Swarm Intelligence that collects input from small groups of doctors and uses AI to optimize their combined accuracy. This hybrid human-AI system will achieve diagnostic accuracies that significantly outperform (a) individual radiologists using standard techniques, and (b) current state-of-the-art in software-only AI. As a product, the MedSwarm system will be deployed as downloadable software compatible with all existing radiological workstations. Distribution to diagnostic teams will be as easy as opening a web-browser and connecting to a cloud-based server. The market opportunity is best modeled on the Computer Aided Detection (CAD) market, which is projected at $1.9 Billion by 2022. MedSwarm will not compete with current CAD products, as it will provide additional accuracy on all radiology workstations, whether or not other CAD tools are in use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop, test, and validate MedSwarm, the first commercially viable system for amplifying diagnostic accuracy of radiologists by combining human and machine intelligence. The technology, called Swarm AI, does not replace radiologists with AI, but connects small groups of radiologists together and optimizes their combined insights, enabling accuracy levels that greatly exceed baseline abilities. The company anticipates diagnostic error reductions of at least 30% using the system developed in Phase I, with the majority of the improvement being in the reduction of false-positives. The proposed research requires the development of new software modules, new optimization algorithms, and new interface protocols for enabling radiologists to connect online, view the same images at the same time, and work together as a real-time system to converge on unified diagnoses. Development also requires machine learning optimization across multiple experimental parameters, to reduce the time required for each diagnosis, increasing throughput and reducing costs. The company's goals for Phase I include a proof-of-concept system that (i) significantly outperforms individual radiologists, (ii) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning systems, and (iii) can identify which cases are most appropriate for this system, as compared to alternate methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Unanimous AI has developed a powerful AI platform called Swarm that combines the benefits of human intelligence with the efficiency of real-time AI algorithms. Our unique approach uses AI technology modeled on natural swarms and enables human teams, connected over a network, to significantly amplify their collective intelligence and produce far more accurate forecasts, decisions, evaluations, predictions, and assessments.   The primary goal of this Phase I project was to advance and rigorously test our underlying Swarm AI technology and to build out the commercial Swarm platform so that it enables diverse business teams of all sizes to amplify their performance in real-world tasks.  Technically, our goals were to (i) refine the front-end (i.e. user interface) of the commercially facing Swarm platform, (ii) advance the back-end swarming algorithms that underpin our Swarm AI technology, and (iii) rigorously test performance with human subjects, validating statistically that Swarm can produce significant amplification of intelligence in real-world tasks.  We are pleased to report that we have successfully deployed, refined, and validated the Swarm platform. During this project, we made Swarm available free of charge to a number of real-world business teams and collected both subjective feedback and data feedback. We performed rigorous validation studies, and documented through numerous published research papers, that Swarm significantly increased the accuracy of group forecasts and decisions. These papers confirm that networked business teams can significantly amplify their accuracy when making decisions and/or forecasts using the Swarm platform.   Of particular note was a published paper, produced as a collaboration between Unanimous AI and Stanford University School of Medicine, that rigorously demonstrated that groups of medical doctors significantly increased their diagnostic accuracy when using the Swarm platform.  This paper, which is scheduled to appear in the journal Nature, Digital Medicine, demonstrates that a combination of real-time human doctors with AI algorithms can significantly outperform humans alone and/or AI algorithms alone.  Also of note was a paper published in collaboration with researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology showing that groups of financial analysts, when using the Swarm platform, could significantly amplify their forecasting accuracy.  We also performed a systematic optimization effort, improving our underlying methods and algorithms, improving our methods of interpolation, and creating a new post-processing methodology called Progressive Optimization of Swarm Intelligence. This project had a significant impact on the overall field of Collective Intelligence and the more specific subfield of Artificial Swarm Intelligence, demonstrating that a commercial product can be launched that brings the power of Swarm AI to enterprise teams, and validating that teams can significantly increase their performance using Swarm AI across a range of tasks. While our focus has been to advance the state of the art in the broad field of Collective Intelligence and the subfield of Artificial Swarm Intelligence, we have also seen impact in specific enterprise disciplines such as (a) medical decision making, (b) group forecasting, and (b) group prioritization.  As shown during our Phase I project, groups of doctors can significantly amplify their collective intelligence for increased accuracy during diagnosis when working as swarms.  As also shown during this project, business teams can increase their accuracy when making group judgements as swarms.  As also shown during this project, groups of sports fans can significantly increase the accuracy of forecasts when working together in swarms. And finally, as shown during this project, groups of cyber-analysts can  increase the accuracy of their risk priorizations when doing group prioritization as swarms.  By developing and deploying the Swarm platform, we now have a globally accessible resource that enables business teams to access and leverage the power of Swarm AI technology.  The only system requirement on their side is internet access and the use of standard browsers.  Because our technology of Swarm AI has been shown to enable human groups to reach better decisions than traditional methods, it has the potential for broad social impact, especially in the realm of politics and government decision making.  We believe that government bodies, local or national, could benefit by using Swarm AI to enable groups with opposing views to converge together on optimal decisions.  During the grant period, we published papers at numerous academic conferences and submitted papers to academic journals.  We did this in collaboration with researchers at Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and California Polytechnic State University.  We created a very large set of data that we will be able to mine for additional insights over time, its value extending far beyond the term of this Phase I project.   And finally, we are proud to report that were were named a winner of the 2019 Chicago Innovation Awards, recognizing the potential of our Swarm platform. And, the Swarm platform was named a finalist for Medical Innovation of the Year at the 2019 SXSW innovation awards.
