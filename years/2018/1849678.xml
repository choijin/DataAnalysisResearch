<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks support for the participation of leading experts from academia and funding agencies to explore the role of biomaterials for synthetic biology and for synthetic biology and evolution for the development of next-generation biomaterials. The theme of the workshop is "Living Interfaces" - understanding and controlling interfacial emergent bio-like order and function in far-from-equilibrium synthetic biomaterials systems.  The aim is to use the results that emerge from the talks and discussion during the Square-Table workshop to write a report that captures the excitement and promise of this rapidly growing field of research for the various communities and agencies to use as a road-map.  The proposal is to hold the workshop in Alexandria, VA in the early part of the week of 3 December 2018.  This Square-Table will engage representatives from the biomaterials, synthetic biology, and molecular evolution communities, along with funding agencies, regulators and industry. The intent is to accelerate the discovery and deployment of disruptive technologies in materials development, with important contributions expected from each of these perspectives.  The focus on "Living Interfaces" frames an exciting first challenge, the successful prosecution of which will open many other avenues of collaboration and research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The agenda is designed to identify gaps and challenges to a new paradigm for biomaterials discovery, taking advantage of synthetic biology and evolutionary approaches in ways inspired, but not on strained, by nature. The advances in biomaterials recently can bring new understanding of fundamental processes and functions covering a wide range of applications. The convergence of NSF interests in Rules of Life as part of the ten Big Ideas and so it is time to devote significant attention to understanding how organisms discover and make new materials, to expand the range of what constitutes a functional biomaterial, to use engineered or artificial "living" systems to create novel and sustainable materials for significant functions, and to extract fundamental lessons that relate structure to function. The aim is to define the outlines of an exciting new field of evolvable materials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This inaugural Square Table Workshop brought together 24 investigators in the areas of biomaterials and synthetic biology, along with a roughly equal number of representatives from the eight federal agencies that fund research in relevant areas to discuss the benefits of research on the development of new materials by biological methods, or by methods inspired by biological evolution.  This is not yet a recognized field of endeavour, primarily because it has previously been impossible to envision how such a goal could be generally accomplished.  However, recent insights into how biology makes and evolves its materials, coupled with new ways to detect, examine, and create new molecules and materials, has brought the worldwide scientific and engineering community to the brink of being able to undertake this mission.  The participants engaged in two days of discussions focused on the following questions: (1) Understanding that many aspects of modern life, including medical diagnostics and treatment, environmental protection, manufacturing, and consumer products, rely on the development of new materials, what types of new materials should this new field try to make? (2) What fundamental knowledge and capabilities do we need for this endeavour that we currently do not have?  (3) What are the barriers to developing and deploying such knowledge and capabilities, including concerns of safety, sustainability, and translation to real-world applications.  Key outcomes included the following contributions to the overall intellectual merit and broader impacts of the meeting.  Intellectual Merit  (1)   A recommendation that the community should focus on the surfaces of things, since that is where materials interact with their environments and where biological molecules and systems have have particular advantages.  (2)   Identification of three interim focus areas: (a) materials that communicate &ndash; that change in response to signals received from their environments; (b) materials that exist in non-equilibrium states &ndash; that continuously absorb and release energy to maintain or change their function; and (c) materials that evolve &ndash; that change in response to changes in their environment so as to preserve or acquire properties or functions.   (3)   Identification of the types of compositions that should be the most amenable to achieving these goals: (a) new "composite materials" composed of a variety of different components that interact with each other to achieve properties that none of them have individually, and (b) a reconsideration of the molecular building blocks ("feedstocks") that can be renewable and easily modified.   (4) Discussions of how various federal agencies, commercial organizations, and academic centers could cooperate and facilitate this type of research and development.  (5)   A continuing series of Square Table meetings on this general subject was deemed useful.  Broader Impacts  (1)   A variety of energizing benefits to science and society were identified as goals of this new field.  (2)   Concrete steps were proposed to make progress toward these goals, including the building of an intellectual foundation for the work and new research infrastructure to enable it to take place.     Overall, this exciting meeting was successful in laying the groundwork for the definition of a new field of research endeavor with great potential benefits.
