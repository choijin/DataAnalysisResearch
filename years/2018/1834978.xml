<AbstractNarration>This project is conducting exploratory research about two currently existing online scientific and scholarly communities (OSSCs), each of which was established to broaden participation in STEM in identified target communities: (a) the NSF INCLUDES Open Forum (NSF-1748345); and (b) the Deaf STEM Community Alliance's Deaf and Hard of Hearing Virtual Academic Community (NSF-1127955). The goals of the proposed study are: 1) to apply the information systems theory of the life cycle of online communities and the theory of social capital to understand the dynamics of two NSF-sponsored OSSCs that are focused on broadening participation in STEM; and 2) to strengthen NSF INCLUDES Network activities with best practices and lessons learned from the project. The project is conducting comparative analyses of the OSSCs: 1) to determine life-cycle stages of the OSSCs; 2) to examine leadership and engagement activities of community engagement managers in each community and how they evolve over time; and 3) to explore the perceptions of community members. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory research project was proposed in response to the NSF INCLUDES Dear Colleague Letter: Announcement of an Effort to Expand the NSF INCLUDES National Network (NSF 17-111).  The DCL states that Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) proposals should produce findings and results that will generate new insights for the NSF INCLUDES National Network, suggest potential strategies for engaging NSF's existing broadening participation activities in the Network, and/or highlight lessons learned that could inform the NSF INCLUDES Launch Pilots and Alliances as they develop.  The NSF INCLUDES program focuses on catalyzing the STEM enterprise to collaboratively work for inclusive change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that the research findings from this project will inform collaborative broadening participation efforts of online STEM communities to advance inclusive STEM education, research and workforce development.  Together with other NSF INCLUDES Network activities, this research is contributing to positive, transformative change within the U.S. STEM workforce and research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
