<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to engineer resistance to two bacterial diseases in citrus trees, Huanglongbing (HLB) and citrus canker.  HLB and canker have cost growers billions of dollars in destroyed trees and are decimating the Florida citrus industry. In Florida, annual citrus production has fallen from 242 million boxes in the 2003-2004 growing season to 45 million boxes in 2017-2018.  Further, citrus canker may be found in 98% of the citrus production regions in Florida. Working with the University of Florida, the goal of this project is to use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to advance natural selection to make citrus trees resistant to both HLB and citrus canker. If successful, this approach could be used to protect the 93 million tons of citrus production worldwide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this SBIR project is to develop HLB and canker-resistant citrus varieties by using gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9. Florida citrus growers need a solution to these diseases, and producing a genetically-resistant citrus variety is a promising strategy. The approach is to modify plant genes that are the targets of proteins secreted by the disease-causing bacteria. The first objective is to conduct the gene editing in commercially viable citrus varieties. This will be accomplished non-transgenically by transforming a non-integrated plasmid or purified Cas9 protein and in vitro transcribed sgRNA in citrus protoplasts. To identify gene edits, protoplasts will be grown into callus, which will be screened by PCR and DNA heteroduplex digestion as well as Sanger and/or high-throughput sequencing. The second objective will be to take plants with confirmed edits, clonally propagate them, and conduct preliminary testing for HLB or canker resistance. Plants will be inoculated with the disease-causing bacteria and then monitored for disease progression by observation of physical characteristics and measurement of bacterial titers by PCR. The best performing mutations from Phase I will be combined and used for more extensive greenhouse and field testing during SBIR Phase II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   NSF SBIR PHASE I PROJECT OUTCOMES REPORT Generating HLB and canker resistant citrus trees using CRISPR-Cas9 Award Number 1843045 Two bacterial diseases, Huanglongbing (HLB, also known as citrus greening) and citrus canker, are decimating the agriculture industry, having already destroyed millions of trees and caused billions in losses. During Phase I research, Soilcea has accomplished important objectives, reaching closer to a commercial product of a new citrus tree with improved resistance to HLB and citrus canker. We had two objectives in this project:   Objective 1: Development of HLB-resistant and canker-resistant citrus varieties by CRISPR/Cas9 genome modification of targets of CLas SDEs and CsLob1.   Objective 2: Generate plants with confirmed edits and conduct preliminary tests for canker or HLB resistance.   To accomplish the objectives, we established four total success metrics that pertained to creating disease resistance to HLB and canker: (1) sgRNA design and testing, (2) transformation and screening, (3) confirm no off-target mutations, and (4) preliminary testing for resistance.  We have achieved those objectives. The highlight of our research is preliminary HLB-resistance data, with one CRISPR-edited citrus variety showing signs of early resistance from HLB bacterial infection, but further testing is needed over the next few months. Over the course of the project period, we created 113 CRISPR-edited plants of 5 promising HLB-susceptibility genes and a canker susceptibility gene, and we also proved that using CRISPR to edit a canker susceptibility gene creates a citrus variety with improved resistance to citrus canker. These accomplishments have us well positioned to develop a citrus tree with improved resistance to HLB and canker during Phase II research that will be ready for commercialization and delivery to citrus growers in desperate need of a solution.  Accomplishment of technical milestones        Metrics   Accomplishment   Outcomes     (1) CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing design and assay   Completed   -Designed 38 sgRNAs for 5 SDE15 target genes -Identified 33 active sgRNAs in vitro.     (2.a) CRISPR Transformations   Completed   Transformed over 56,000 Citrus stems.     (2.b) Screening to identify plants with gene edits   Completed   We have generated 113 CRISPR-edited citrus plants for testing resistance.     (3) Off-target mutation screening   Completed   No off-target mutations were found in tested plants.     (4) Preliminary testing for HLB &amp; canker resistance   On-going   We have tested HLB resistance of our CRISPR-edited plants using our newly developed reverse grafting method.
