<AbstractNarration>This award supports the triennial review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) and its achievements. The review assesses the United States' position in global nanotechnology research and development. It determines trends and developments in nanoscience, nanoengineering and nanotechnology and identifies critical areas of research where the United States should lead. The study also assesses the current state of nanotechnology resulting from the NNI activities since its authorization in 2003. It evaluates the current impact of nanotechnology on the United States' economy, prosperity and national security, and based on this, recommends new or revised goals, new research areas and technical priorities, partnerships, coordination and management mechanisms, and programs to support those goals. This triennial review of the NNI generates feedback to the Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology (NSET) Subcommittee and the National Nanotechnology Coordination Office (NNCO) to serve the Nanotechnology community moving forward and to guide investments in research and development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since its inception, the NNI has resulted in many discoveries and inventions, which have had far-reaching technological and societal impacts. Nanotechnology is an inter-disciplinary field. The impact of nanotechnology arises from its potential to significantly transform numerous fields, including information technology, aerospace, agriculture, energy, homeland security, environment, healthcare, national defense, and transportation systems. The project plan is to appoint a committee of experts that meets several times. The committee is given background materials and strategic plans by the NNCO. The committee meets with sponsors and representatives from key federal agencies to discuss the statement of work. It gathers preliminary information on current activities related to the NNI. Subsequent meetings include presentations from academic and industrial representatives familiar with nanotechnology developments in the US and abroad. A final report is issued after a full National Academies review. The study report is disseminated to interested technical communities and the general public through briefings, presentations, a published manuscript and on-line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine appointed an ad hoc committee to conduct the quadrennial review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI). The overall objective of this review was to make recommendations to the Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology (NSET) Subcommittee of the White House National Science and Technology Council and to the National Nanotechnology Coordination Office that will improve the value of the NNI's research and development strategy and portfolio to the economic prosperity and national security of the United States.

Assess the current state of nanoscience and nanotechnology resulting from the NNI as authorized in 2003, including the current impact of nanotechnology on U.S. economic prosperity and national security.  The committee has identified three important priorities:  Priority 1. The NNI should partner broadly to improve the efficiency of translation of nanoscience/nanotechnology research and development into economic, environmental, and societal benefits.  Priority 2. The NNI should focus on strategically selected environmental and societal challenges with nanoscience and nanotechnology.  Priority 3. The NNI should expand the nation?s nanotechnology ecosystem via increased recruitment and training of future scientists and engineers, with an intentional focus on accelerated technology translation, and with robust investments in next-generation infrastructure to support basic science and commercialization.  And the committee has made the following five key recommendations that if implemented, will provide the actions needed to meet these priorities and carry out this vision.  Key Recommendation 1: The Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology Subcommittee and the NNI agencies should align the efforts of the NNI to deliver responsible and sustainable nanotechnology-based solutions that address the federal research and development priorities, which currently include security, arti&#64257;cial intelligence, quantum information sciences, manufacturing, bio-based materials, water, climate change, space travel, exploration, inhabitation, energy, medical innovations, and food and agriculture.

Key Recommendation 3: New investments by the NNI agencies are required to strengthen and renew the U.S. network of fabrication and characterization facilities to retain international leadership. These investments should make readily available new tools, expertise, techniques, and processes to support fundamental research in existing and emerging areas, as well as prototyping and pilot/scale-up capabilities.
