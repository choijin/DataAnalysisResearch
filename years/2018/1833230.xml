<AbstractNarration>This award supports student attendance at the 59th IEEE Annual Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) in Paris, France from October 7 through October 9, 2018, as well as to support attendance by some qualified postdoctoral fellows who do not have other sources of travel funding. FOCS and its sister conference, the ACM STOC meeting, are the premier broad-based conferences on the Theory of Computing. FOCS has a record of strongly encouraging participation by students, for whom the conference serves as a valuable educational experience, both for the technical content of the talks and for the opportunities for networking that it provides. In recent years, the annual FOCS conference has been attended by eighty to one hundred students who have comprised more than a third of all attendees. This award will provide partial support to about 20 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 2018 was the first year that I was in charge of working with NSF and IEEE FOCS on this travel grant in my role as the Vice Chair of IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Mathematical Foundations of Computing (TCMF). It has been a great learning experience, in which I received a lot of help from Rafail Ostrovsky (a former IEEE TCMF general chair who was in charge of this task) and Tracy Kimbrel (NSF). It has also been a wonderful experience interacting with many talented young researchers in theoretical computer sciences and their advisors in many universities to understand their excitement about the research fields and their needs. I hope these experiences will contribute to future collaboration between NSF and TCS conferences, particular in areas of supporting NSF's goals for recruiting a diverse spectrum of participants.  Intellectual Merit:  With the rise of Internet and Big Data, computer science is now at the center of the many disciplines, from natural sciences to social sciences, from medicine to art, from engineering to policy. As these interactions emerging, the theoretical computer scientists, particularly the younger generation, have taking great strides in advancing algorithmic/computational thinking beyond our traditional field. The NSF travel award have been making direct contribution to this generation.  IEEE FOCS is one of the two premier annual research conferences that covers the breadth of theoretical computer science. It is a conference of very long standing that has continued to played a formative role in the field; it is also at the leading edge of connections made to other fields.  Because many advisors indicated that they would find ways to support their students -- particular those with FOCS 2018 papers &ndash; in case they didn?t receive any travel award, we were able to partly support all students who had papers in FOCS 2018 and wanted to attend the conference. We also partially supported all three postdocs, each made small amounts of requests because they had some start-up grants. We managed to essentially fully supported the travel of two students, whose advisors wrote that they would not support their students' travel because these students' FOCS papers (including one with a solo paper) did not involve the advisors. We were also was able to partly support a few relative senior students without FOCS papers, but with workshop papers.  We believe that the resultant discussions will expose the awardees to a broad set of fundamental questions and ideas. With strong aim to support young research from underrepresented groups and talented students beyond traditional TCS powerhouses, our goal is to broaden the participation to make FOCS an even more robust TCS conference. We expect the research community to benefit in turn, as such junior researchers have contributed substantially to the growth of theoretical computer science over the years.     Broader Impacts:  This year, with FOCS conference in Europe (Paris), we received 30 applications, which included four female applicants.

These awardees included a none-Ph.D. candidate, who was presenting a paper, and would apply for Ph.D. in the coming year. By supporting 22 Ph.D. students and postdocs from 15 universities, the funds were widely distributed among many universities beyond just traditional TCS powerhouses.  Working with NSF and young researchers in this selection process provided us valuable experience to be more proactive in reaching out to TCS women community/organizations to encourage female theoretical computer scientists about future NSF FOCS travel grants.   Many of the Ph.D. students and postdocs supported by this NSF FOCS travel grant will be the future leaders in theoretical computer science. Several have already made breakthrough discovery in algorithm design and computational complexity by solving long-term fundamental open questions.
