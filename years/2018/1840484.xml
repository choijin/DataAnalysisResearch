<AbstractNarration>The Planning Grants for Engineering Research Centers competition was run as a pilot solicitation within the ERC program.  Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research. Driven by transformations in manufacturing and increased need for materials efficiency and efficacy,most engineering structures and components increasingly require complex heterogeneous materials joints. Materials joining makes a substantial contribution to the U.S. economy, being a critical enabling technology for at least one-third of its gross domestic product and influencing the backbone of its defense, infrastructure, and economic well-being. Drawing from that, the vision of the ERC for Transformational Science and Manufacturing Innovation on Heterogeneous Materials Joining is to transform advanced heterogeneous materials joining through a comprehensive approach using fundamental science, process innovation, innovative design, and predictive modeling, coupled with the development of a vibrant and diverse workforce prepared to create and deploy new technologies, this center will propel the U.S. to the top of global manufacturing leadership. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interdisciplinary team, including members from The Ohio State Univ. (lead), North Carolina A&amp;T State Univ. (NCAT), Univ. of Michigan (UM), and IUCRC-Ma2JIC, will develop the science and enable the technological transformations that the U.S. and world manufacturers across key industrial sectors including energy, transportation, biomedical, and defense, need to face present and future challenges on materials joining. This planning grant will allow the proposed team to further develop their center plans for education and workforce development, build a synergistic team, and detail the scientific and technical challenges to tackle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As part of the Planning Grant for Engineering Research Center, the team formed by scientist and engineers from The Ohio State University, North Carolina A&amp;T University and University of Michigan, formed a team named, JOIN-US, which worked to engage stakeholders on the field of materials joining through a large workshop and small group conversations between 2018 and 2020. During the 2018 JOIN-US Workshop, over 50 academic researchers, community education partners, industry members, and economic development partners discussed the landscape of advanced manufacturing from research and development, to technology deployment and training. From this workshop a clear list of needs and existing strengths were developed, providing attendees and the proposal team with a clearer path forward.  The JOIN-US team brought together scientists and professionals from a wide range of disciplines, including several Engineering fields (Welding, Materials, Mechanical, Industrial, Electrical, Software, Biomedical), and Medicine, Economy, Biology, Chemistry, among other, to better understand the challenges that the enabling technology of materials joining faces today and will face tomorrow on the competitive field of advanced manufacturing, which goes beyond conventional materials and technologies.  As result of this exercise, the team develop and presented in 2019 to NSF a pre-proposal for the creation of the JOIN-US Engineering Research Center, which was not called for the submission of a full proposal.  However, the team has created opportunities for new scientific and technical collaborations that go beyond what was previously done on the field, involving areas as bio-fabrication and bio-joining, which could result on the future development of transforming and disrupting technologies.  In addition, a second ERC pre-proposal on advanced manufacturing has been developed and submitted to NSF in 2020 involving members of JOIN-US team, which shows the value added by this grant and the interactions that it enabled to the advanced manufacturing community.
