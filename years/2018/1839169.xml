<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in facilitating innovations in a wide range of industries working on advanced computing-based applications as the result of a reliable neuromorphic chip (where neural networks are etched into silicon). This technology may accelerate the advance of machine learning and ultimately realize a breakthrough in computing architecture by overcoming the Von Neumann bottleneck -- where the intrinsic latency originated from the separation of processor and memory. Empowered by neuromorphic features of this project's technology, machine learning may be carried out with unprecedented speed and efficiency in design and energy consumption. Hence, intensive machine learning based technologies such as face recognition, autonomous driving and other areas of artificial intelligence will be advanced by a significant margin. A successful execution of the project will also facilitate widespread commercialization of emerging applications utilizing artificial intelligence and/or neuromorphic computing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project leverages the recent innovative research related to highly controllable neuromorphic devices. The technology is based on the oxide-based resistive random access memory (ReRAM), a non-volatile memory based upon electrical stimuli-induced resistance changes, mostly by the formation and rupture of so-called nanoscale conducting filaments in each cell. The intrinsic resemblance of ReRAM cells to neuromorphic systems triggered a recent boom in related research. However, there are still considerable technical issues including wide cell-to-cell variations in operation voltage, cell current and operation speed. Unclear understanding of physical switching mechanisms precludes a rationale design of reliable cells for a commercial device. The proposed novel scheme, in which the uncontrollability is significantly minimized, is expected to achieve a breakthrough in realizing commercializable neuromorphic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
