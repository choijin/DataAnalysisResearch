<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the implementation of digital pathology by giving pathologists computational guides to help them achieve higher accuracy and efficiency in making their "calls". Currently biopsy diagnosis is a labor-intensive process that relies upon 19th century microscope technology; pathologists are doctors who use microscopes to make diagnoses. Pathologists examine slides from breast biopsies as part of breast cancer screening programs for more than a million women each year in the US.  This is a highly subjective process and there is evidence that even pathologists may disagree with one another, especially with difficult cases. This is potentially large patient safety issue, as some patients may not be optimally triaged.  It is currently possible to digitize the slides as whole slide images (WSIs), but there are very limited options for computer assisted pathologist review and this is a major reason that the digital pathology market has not developed as rapidly as most experts predicted. This project is a major advance as it addresses a large clinical need ? augmenting pathologists in their ability to make efficient and accurate diagnoses; and it also has great commercial potential as a disruptive, must-have application in the early digital pathology marketplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the issue of accuracy and efficiency of pathologist diagnosis in breast core biopsies, and this should validate our approach as an unmet need in the current digital pathology marketplace. There are other groups applying machine learning to pathology, but this project is a unique approach that addresses practical issues related to expert training of the machine, rapidly displaying targeted images to pathologists, and providing a guiding support while keeping the doctors in control. The project will ask pathologists to label WSIs with their diagnoses; this data will be used to train an AI system; and the AI system performance will be studied. Preliminary studies seem to support that a human and AI system working together will be both more efficient and more accurate than a human working alone. If this expanded project validates this, then there is a tremendous commercial opportunity that can also have a positive impact on patients. Not only access to better diagnoses for patients, but also the possibility for any pathologist to perform at a higher level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The 200-year-old process of manually viewing tissue samples on glass slides under a microscope is highly inefficient and often prone to error. Until recently, pathologists used these manual processes due to a lack of methods that are more efficient, accurate, and worthy of the pathologists'<strong></strong> trust. Pathologists are now adopting whole slide images (WSIs) for diagnosis, thanks to recent FDA approval of WSI systems (Philips' IntelliSite in 2017 and Leica Biosystems' Aperio AT2 DX in 2019). In response to new market forces and recent technology advances outside of pathology, a new field of computational pathology is emerging that applies black-box artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms on WSIs. Even with these new digital tools, however, a challenge remains where pathologists still lack the advanced computational pathology software that can address the unmet clinical needs of improving the efficiency and accuracy of pathology practices.</p> <p>While computational pathology has great potential for augmenting pathologists' accuracy and efficiency, there exists a concern of trust in the application of AI/ML to pathology because of the black-box nature of AI/ML algorithms. Additionally, there is a lack of consensus on how pathologists should incorporate computational pathology systems into their workflow. To address these concerns, <strong>SpIntellx</strong> is driving the development of <strong>Explainable AI (xAI)</strong> software guides as powerful and transparent alternatives to black-box AI/ML solutions in computational pathology. SpIntellx guides provide clear justifications to the clinicians for recommendations made in order to promote safety and reliability.</p> <p>We are developing <strong>HistoMapr<strong>&trade;</strong></strong>, an xAI powered computational pathology platform, based on transmitted light and standard staining. HistoMapr analyzes digitized pathology WSIs and addresses the unmet clinical need to improve the efficiency and accuracy of pathology-based diagnoses. HistoMapr can be applied to any disease area pathology. Currently, we are focused on completing the development of <strong>HistoMapr-Breast&trade; </strong>product, focused on diagnoses of breast lesions including breast cancer and atypia.</p> <p class="Default">HistoMapr's xAI capability addresses pathologists' need for explanations for recommendations made by an AI system. Phase I funding was a catalyst for SpIntellx in (1) identifying the critical role of xAI in the wide-scale adoption of computational pathology tools; (2) identifying the unmet needs of efficiency and accuracy in anatomical pathology practices; (3) studying disagreement and uncertainty in diagnosing benign breast lesions; (4) developing SpIntellx's core technologies, namely spatial analytics and xAI, applicable to any tissue; (5) growing strong intellectual property portfolio around spatial analytics and xAI technologies; and finally (6) exploring the commercial feasibility of, and building collaborative partnerships for, our innovation and our first product for breast core biopsies.</p> <p>In the Phase I project,<strong> </strong>SpIntellx collected 4,865 WSIs of breast core biopsies, from which ~201,000 regions of interest (ROIs) were generated using HistoMapr-Breast's proprietary spatial analytics. SpIntellx designed and implemented a rapid pathologist-centered annotation tool for efficiently collecting ground-truth annotations (~1,000 ROIs per hour per pathologist). SpIntellx engaged 5 pathologists from UPMC Magee Womens Hospital, each completed ~5,600 ROI annotations. We developed and tested spatial statistics and xAI algorithms to differentiate and rank the entire spectrum of diagnostic categories in breast pathology: benign, atypia, ductal carcinoma in-situ, and invasive carcinoma. HistoMapr-Breast's precision is uniformly high in differentiating these diagnostic categories. Our study generated dramatic improvements in both efficiency and concordance amongst pathologists. We have a partnership with a large private practice with over 60 pathologists, to complete the development and then to implement HistoMapr-Breast in their practice.</p> <p>SpIntellx has established the first mover status in the field of spatial intelligence and xAI, with HistoMapr-Breast product having the capability of delivering<strong> safer and higher quality diagnoses for patients</strong> that digital pathology has been waiting for over 20 years. HistoMapr impacts healthcare in three major ways: 1. Patients receive a more accurate diagnosis on their biopsies which enables more accurate clinical management (e.g., surgical resection or not, screening schedule, etc.); 2. Pathologists increase their efficiency and accuracy; and 3. Health care payers save money in avoiding unnecessary surgeries or delayed diagnosis of malignancies. As an xAI platform, HistoMapr provides new scientific insights into mechanisms of disease, improves prognostic and predictive utility of pathology specimens. Finally, HistoMapr's xAI guides can be used to train pathologists.</p> <p>Pathology is often considered to be the gold standard for patient diagnosis, and therefore pathologists have been conservative in adopting digital pathology. We regard xAI as a critical feature that differentiates HistoMapr guide from the tools offered by our competitors.&nbsp;It is critical to emphasize that the purpose of the xAI is not to make a diagnosis independent from the pathologist, but to assist the pathologist in being more accurate and efficient. The goal is to free pathologists to focus on crucial tasks that only they can perform. HistoMapr guides ensure that pathologists have all the necessary information to make the best diagnoses they can make.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/04/2020<br>      Modified by: Akif&nbsp;B&nbsp;Tosun</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1843825/1843825_10591443_1576163226268_Figure1_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1843825/1843825_10591443_1576163226268_Figure1_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SpIntellx's Mission"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1843825/1843825_10591443_1576163226268_Figure1_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SpIntellx's Mission"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SpIntellx�s mission is to be the leading provider of spatial intelligence software products and knowledge from patient pathology samples to enable more cost-effective and accurate patient care</div> <div class="imageCredit">SpIntellx, Inc.</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Akif&nbsp;B&nbsp;Tosun</div> <div class="imageTitle">SpIntellx's Mission</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1843825/1843825_10591443_1576163330899_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1843825/1843825_10591443_1576163330899_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Evolution of Computational Pathology"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1843825/1843825_10591443_1576163330899_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Evolution of Computational Pathology"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">.
