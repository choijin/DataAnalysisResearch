<AbstractNarration>This award supports the 2018 Motor Control in Biomechanics Symposium, which will be held on May 29, 2018, in advance of the American College of Sports Medicine meeting in Minneapolis, MN.  This symposium will bring together researchers to discuss new tools and approaches of motor control and biomechanics that can be applied to advance research in sports medicine.  The theme of the symposium is "Innovative Techniques towards a New Approach to Sports and Exercise."  The symposium will be structured to allow experts in the field of biomechanics and motor control to present the leading edge of research to a broad audience that includes not only engineers but also more clinical researchers in sports medicine and exercise science.  The research that will be discussed, and the integration of biomechanics and motor control, is also directly relevant to studies of pathological motion and rehabilitation for individuals who have sustained an or who have a disability.  Award funds will support travel grants for young investigators and junior faculty to allow them to attend an additional day of the overall conference, as well as partial travel funds for some of the invited speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium will focus on cutting edge research technologies that have been developed in the areas of motion control and biomechanics and how they can be applied to translational research.  Key to the success of this symposium will be the fact that it brings together convergent groups of researchers from engineering, clinical medicine, physical therapy, and exercise science to discuss the latest advances and how different disciplines can work together to address current research questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The symposium successfully brought together students, researchers, professionals and experts in the field to discuss the latest technological developments in the study of motor control and biomechanics, and how new approaches at the intersection of these field can lead to advancements in sports medicine and exercise science.     The symposium received financial supports from NSF and from the De Luca Foundation (MA).     The focus of the event was on "Innovative techniques towards a new approach to sports and exercise". Internationally distinguished researchers in the field of Motor Control presented their perspective during 20-min long talks, including:   &middot;         Dr. Darryl Thelen (University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA) presenting "A noninvasive sensor of tendon loading during dynamic movement" &middot;         Dr. Jo&atilde;o Paulo Vilas-Boas (University of Porto, Portugal) presenting "Assessing and understanding forces in swimming" &middot;         Dr. Ezio Preatoni (University of Bath, UK) presenting "Movement, coordination and their variability in sports skills monitoring: where we are and what is missing" &middot;         Dr. Ross Miller (University of Maryland, USA) presenting "Predictive models are most useful when they are wrong" &middot;         Dr. Angus Hunter (University of Stirling, UK), presenting "Neuromuscular control in clinical and athletic populations: science of past, present and future" &middot;         Dr. Jasper Reenalda (Roessingh Research and Development, University of Twente, The Netherlands) presenting "A novel approach to investigate differences in knee mechanics after ACL reconstruction using inertial sensors"   In addition, a junior researcher selected among abstract submissions from student attendees had the opportunity to present among experts: Mr. Oladipo Eddo (George Mason University, USA) presenting "Effects of gait modification on lower extremity sagittal plane biomechanics".   A panel discussion closed the event and ensured ample opportunities for symposium attendees to interact with expert researchers and colleagues in the field.     Abstracts of the talk contents and more information on the symposium can be found on the Motor Control Group website at http://www.mcg.isbweb.org/download/2018-ACSM.pdf and http://www.mcg.isbweb.org/acsm-2018.html.
