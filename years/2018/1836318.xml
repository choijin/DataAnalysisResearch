<AbstractNarration>This award supports the 2019 NSF-CBMS conference "Mathematical Molecular Bioscience and Biophysics," hosted by University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, during May 13-17, 2019. The conference will feature Professor Guowei Wei of Michigan State University as the Principal Lecturer. Mathematical molecular bioscience and biophysics has been emerging as a promising interdisciplinary research area at the interface of mathematics and biology, driven by the trends of contemporary life sciences that transform biosciences from macroscopic to microscopic or molecular, and from qualitative and phenomenological to quantitative and predictive. The conference will promote biological studies for solving cutting edge problems at molecular level, so that mathematics can play a more important role in addressing fundamental challenges in molecular biosciences and biophysics. This conference consists of ten principal lectures, together with supplemental presentations by other experts and round table discussions. The conference aims to attract many junior mathematicians, including undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and young faculty, to enter this new interdisciplinary field. In addition, the meeting will benefit the hosting university by enhancing its research program and raising its visibility to peer institutes in the southeastern region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Molecular Bioscience and Biophysics (MMBB) concerns the development of mathematical theories, models, methods, schemes, and algorithms for elucidating molecular mechanisms and for solving open problems at the forefront of molecular biosciences and biophysics. The lecture series will provide a thorough overview of the MMBB literature to mathematical and biological societies. Numerous areas of mathematics, including differential equations, functional analysis, harmonic analysis, Lie groups, Lie algebras, geometry, graph theory, topology, combinatorics, multiscale modeling, inverse problems, optimization, machine learning, stochastic analysis, uncertainty quantification, fuzzy logic, statistical inference, and nonparametric regression, have found important applications in MMBB and many successful applications will be illustrated in this conference. Biological open problems at the forefront of the MMBB, such as those associated with drug design and discovery, which will stimulate new research directions in modeling and computation of biomolecular structure, function, dynamics and transport, will be identified. For more information, please refer to the conference webpage: http://cbms.ua.edu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

This NSF-CBMS conference consists of ten lectures given by the Principal Lecturer, Professor Guowei Wei from Michigan State University, together with oral presentations given by invited speakers and contributed poster presentations given by mostly graduate students and postdocs from the greater community in MMBB related area. The lecture series and research talks provide an overview of the recent advances and current status of research on MMBB. The CBMS lecture series are expected to attract more mathematicians, especially pure mathematicians, to enter this new interdisciplinary field, because numerous areas of mathematics, including differential equations, functional analysis, harmonic analysis, Lie group, Lie algebra, geometry, graph theory, topology, combinatorics, multiscale modeling, inverse problems, optimization, machine learning, stochastic analysis, uncertainty quantification, fuzzy logic, statistical inference, and nonparametric regression, have found important applications in MMBB. A total of 61 participants attended this conference. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the MMBB field, many participants are from disciplines other than mathematics, such as biology, physics, chemistry, computer science, and industry. Moreover, this NSF-CBMS conference is quite successful in recruiting underrepresented minorities and women participants, as well as in attracting a broader participation of junior researchers, such as graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and young faculty. As far as the intellectual merit is concerned, this NSF-CBMS conference will have a long-lasting impact to the mathematical and biological disciplines. It is expected that this conference will stimulate new research directions in both pure and applied mathematics to address fundamental challenges in molecular biosciences and biophysics. Moreover, it will promote biological studies for solving cutting edge problems at molecular level, so that mathematics can play more important roles in addressing fundamental challenges in molecular biosciences and biophysics. To maximize the broader impacts of this conference, a webpage has been created at&nbsp;<a href="https://cbms.ua.edu/">https://cbms.ua.edu/</a>. In this place, one can find numerous introduction materials about this NSF-CBMS conference, such as introduction to the conference, conference program and abstracts. The complete notes and YouTube videos of ten lectures are also available. Moreover, to record this important event in the field of mathematical biology, a special issue has been published in the journal, Computational and Mathematical Biophysics (CMB). See&nbsp;<a href="https://www.degruyter.com/page/1923">https://www.degruyter.com/page/1923</a>. Finally, Prof. Wei will reorganize the lecture notes and subsequently prepare an expository monograph based upon these lectures. The monograph will be published by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and can in this way reach a much wider audience.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/06/2020<br>      Modified by: Shan&nbsp;Zhao</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
