<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation for the conference "Recent Advances in Functional Analysis", which will be held at Kent State University, Ohio, USA on October 11-14, 2018.   The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the field of functional analysis.  Presentation and discussion will concentrate on the specific topics of operator theory and geometry of Banach spaces, weighted bounds for Calderon?Zygmund operators, properties of Lipschitz mappings, asymptotic geometry of normed spaces, and probabilistic methods in functional analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.  The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be made available at the conference webpage: http://www.math.kent.edu/RAFA2018/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this project was to organize the conference "Recent Advances in Functional Analysis" which was held during October 11-14, 2018 at Kent State University, Ohio.  In recent years, long-standing problems in Functional Analysis and Geometry of finite dimensional normed spaces are being cast in new terms, using techniques from various branches of analysis, probability and metric geometry. During the conference a number of leading researchers in the field as well as graduate students and Postdoctoral fellows discussed the latest developments in modern Functional Analysis including Operator Theory, Geometry of Banach Spaces theory, Geometry of Finite Dimensional Normed Spaces as well as other related fields.  There were over 100  participants from 18 states and 9 countries with many students, postdoctoral fellows. One of the primary goals of the grant was to foster collaboration between different analysis groups in USA and abroad. In this respect, as we indicated above, the meeting was a great success, the conference showcased a variety of new perspectives and was  venue for early-stage researchers and graduate students to present their results, through talks and a poster session.  The graduate students,  early-stage researchers had an opportunity to  interact with  leading experts in the field, contributing to training of young mathematicians and prospects for future collaboration.    The conference also had the most diverse and a welcoming atmosphere, the organizers were very lucky to be able to attract an outstanding female Mathematicians  to deliver invited talks and to be able to host most diverse, inclusive and friendly group of participant.  More information about the conference can be found on   http://www.math.kent.edu/RAFA2018         Last Modified: 01/27/2020       Submitted by: Artem Zvavitch]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
