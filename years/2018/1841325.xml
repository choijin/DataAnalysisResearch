<AbstractNarration>NON TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Solid-State Chemistry of Inorganic Materials symposium at the 2018 Fall Materials Research Society Meeting in Boston, MA, provides a dynamic venue for scientists at various stages of their career, ranging from undergraduate and graduate students to distinguished professors, to present their scientific findings, ideas, and hypotheses in the area of inorganic materials research and solid-state chemistry. A broad set of 27 invited speakers, including 9 female speakers, and 60 contributed speakers together with multiple poster contributions cover all aspects of the inorganic materials chemistry. The contributors come from all over the world, with multiple contributions from North America, Europe, and Asia. Given the interdisciplinary nature of solid-state chemistry the MRS meeting is an extremely popular venue for such a symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Solid-State Chemistry of Inorganic Materials symposium will be held at the 2018 Fall Materials Research Society Meeting in Boston, MA, it is the tenth in an established series and is in part supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF's Division of Materials Research. The symposium focuses on the presentation and discussion of recent advances in the solid-state chemistry of inorganic materials and their impact on industrial applications. Solid-state chemistry is an interdisciplinary field, which attracts a diverse group of scientists interested in chemistry, condensed-matter physics, materials science and engineering, ceramics, metallurgy, chemical engineering and mineralogy/geology. Solid-state chemistry includes the synthesis of materials, including novel compositions, crystal structures and morphologies (nanocrystalline, thin film, heterostructures, and composites). Investigations of the relationships between composition, structure and properties, as well as the application of state-of-the-art and emergent characterization methods are presented at the symposium as well. Solid-state chemistry encompasses not only the discovery of new materials, but also advancements of techniques for preparing and studying materials, including computational predictions. Knowledge of the diverse properties of solids continues to expand. This symposium is an important event for the international solid-state chemistry community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
