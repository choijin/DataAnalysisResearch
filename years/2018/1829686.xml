<AbstractNarration>This project provides continuing support for the Tudor Hill Marine Atmospheric Observatory in Bermuda. The marine boundary layer, the lower level of the atmosphere over the oceans, plays important roles in the global cycles of many chemical elements and this observatory provides a unique facility for the ocean and atmospheric chemistry research communities. At present, many aspects of atmospheric composition, atmospheric transport, and atmosphere-ocean exchange remain poorly understood. This limits our ability to predict and mitigate the effects of anticipated future environmental change. Central to improving our understanding of these topics is the ability to observe and sample the marine boundary layer. In this regard, oceanic island observatories have played a crucial role. By virtue of its location in the western North Atlantic Ocean, Bermuda has been a key location for numerous field studies of the marine troposphere and is well equipped for such research, with the 23 meter high atmospheric sampling tower and site laboratories at Tudor Hill. Routine facility operations include the collection of continuous meteorological data and weekly bulk aerosol and rainwater samples, which are archived at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences and made freely available to the scientific community. Additionally, samples and data are collected for a variety of external research programs funded by NSF, NOAA, NASA and other agencies. This project is expected to make significant educational contributions at a number of levels, including undergraduate education opportunities through the NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, and through other courses taught at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The continued operation and maintenance of THMAO site will facilitate research topics that are central to international research initiatives such as IGAC, SOLAS and GEOTRACES. The specific objectives of the project are to: 1) Operate and maintain the atmospheric sampling facility at Tudor Hill, Bermuda; 2) Continue collection of continuous meteorological data and weekly bulk-aerosol and rain samples, which will be archived at BIOS and made freely available to other researchers; and 3) Collect additional atmospheric samples and data for external investigators, and provide for the use of the facility by external investigators. The continued operation and maintenance of the Tudor Hill site facilitates research concerning the chemistry and physics of the marine troposphere and ocean-atmosphere exchange processes. In a regional context, the Tudor Hill facility will complement ongoing time-series research in the Sargasso Sea, including Hydrostation S and BATS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
