<AbstractNarration>The ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH) embraces all aspects of software construction and delivery to make it one of the premier conferences at the intersection of programming languages and software engineering. This grant provides travel funds to support student attendance to the conference. The support will focus on students who are attending the several mentoring events that have been planned at SPLASH. The grant will be used for US citizens/residents and other US-based students and will give priority to underrepresented groups, first-time attendees, and those in need of economic support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is intellectual merit in the technical exchange of information and research conversations/collaborations made possible by the conference, as well as advances in the field made possible by these interactions. The proposal also provides education, training and mentoring received by the participants. The international nature of this conference helps develop a globally-aware workforce of research and educators within the US and helps build the community of researchers in the field of Software Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH) is a conference that brings together researchers working on research and 'practice' topics in programming languages and software engineering (PL/SE). The conference organizers created several student mentoring programs with the goal of attracting undergraduates and young graduate students to a research career in programming languages and software engineering. The flagship event was a one-day mentoring workshop called PLMW. Students' travel and registration were provided to the SPLASH 2018 research conference, to become familiar with research careers in academia and industry, and to informally meet senior research mentors and young researchers from across the globe. Specific goals included: (i) to attract a more diverse set of students to research in programming languages and software engineering, the focus of SPLASH research, (ii) to offer practical advice about graduate study, some first-hand from recent Ph.D. graduates as well as mentoring by senior scholars, (iii) to give students an overview of where the field is going, and (iv) to help students navigate the activities at the SPLASH conference itself. Participants were selected for factors consistent with our goals. In total, 41 students at US colleges and universities were funded to attend the meeting. This diverse group consisted of 22 undergraduates and 19 graduate students, of which 20 identified as male, 20 identified as female, and one identified as non-binary; 6 of the students self-identified as being from ethnicities currently underrepresented in computing.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/07/2019<br>      Modified by: Jonathan&nbsp;Bell</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
