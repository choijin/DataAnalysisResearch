<AbstractNarration>The Division of Materials Research, together with the Division of Physics and the Division of Astronomical Sciences contribute funds to this award that provides support for the International Conference on Computational Physics, which will be held at the University of California at Davis from July 29th to August 2nd 2018. This is a highly interdisciplinary meeting that brings together a diverse group of leading researchers from academia, national laboratories, and industry, aiming to broadly share advances in computational physics, to facilitate networking among attendees, and to discuss and further general plans for the community. The topics covered span the topical areas of the Divisions involved. NSF support will enable the participation of 12 early-career scientists, who might not otherwise be able to attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The conference participants and their guests were also treated to a stimulating lecture at the conference banquet by Tony DeRose of PIXAR Animation Studios on Computational Physics at PIXAR.  We extend our thanks to Dr. DeRose.  A conference proceedings of approximately 35 papers has been reviewed, overseen by the Chair and two Vice-chairs  of the conference, and sent to the journal for publication.
