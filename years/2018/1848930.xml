<AbstractNarration>The ability to imitate the actions of others plays a critical role in motor learning throughout life. In many cases, imitation can rely on visual observations of an expert's actions, as when a child learns to use a spoon. Imitation with the voice, used when learning to produce the sounds of an unfamiliar language or when learning to sing a song, poses a different problem because one cannot see many of the movements that are involved. Indeed, many people find vocal imitation difficult. However, because the mechanisms underlying this ability are poorly understood, instructors have few resources with which to help such individuals.  The research program focuses on vocal imitation of pitch, a feature that is central to both music and speech production. The hypothesis guiding these experiments is that formation of a mental image of the to-be-achieved goal mediates and stimulates neural associations between auditory and motor networks that allow the actual production to be accurate. By contrast, a less skilled speaker or singer will not have formed as strong auditory-motor associations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three studies will examine participants imitating pitch patterns associated with song or speech. Spoken pitch samples will be based on English, where pitch is mostly used to convey emphasis, and Mandarin, where pitch is associated with word meanings. Participants in this research will include singers and non-singers, as well as individuals who speak Mandarin and those who do not. Planned studies will 1) assess basic cognitive processes (mental imagery, working memory, and perception) that contribute to imitation accuracy; 2) use electromyography to address whether auditory mental images are associated with sub-vocal muscle movements; and 3) explore the role that specific learning experience has on individuals' capacity to imitate. Results from these studies will be used to improve instruction for learning to speak a tone language and for singing. More effective instructional techniques could enhance the capacity and experience of those learning to speak and sing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
