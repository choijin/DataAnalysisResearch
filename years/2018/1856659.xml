<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The 24th biennial International Conference on the Chemistry of the Organic Solid State (ICCOSS XXIV) is a weeklong conference June 16-21, 2019, on the New York University campus in New York City. Inaugurated in 1968 at Brookhaven National Laboratory, the conference showcases frontier research relating to various aspects of organic solid-state chemistry, assembling both young and experienced scientists from around the world, from academic, industrial and government sectors, for productive discourse and dissemination of groundbreaking research pertaining to the chemistry and physics of organic crystalline materials. Conference topics impact the commercial sector, from pharmaceutical materials to organic electronics. The scientific program includes invited lectures, contributed lectures and poster sessions, a special session on ?Crystals and the Community? designed for graduate students and postdoctoral scientists, a workshop on computational crystallography, and an X-ray diffraction Master Class for student participants. The scope of the conference is international, with forty-five session chairs and invited speakers from five continents. The conference is dedicated to principals of inclusion, with respect to international representation, women, underrepresented minorities, and people with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: The 24th biennial International Conference on the Chemistry of the Organic Solid State (ICCOSS XXIV) consists of eight technical sessions: (1) Crystals that Move, (2) Crystals in Computers, (3) Crystals that Grow, (4) Crystals in Devices, (5) Crystals in Nature and Medicine, (6) Crystals and Light, (7) Crystals in 2D, (8) Crystals with Holes. These topics represent the forefront of research in organic solid-state chemistry, from dynamics in crystals to machine learning for crystal structure prediction to crystals in medicine. The conference also hosts a special session, ?Crystals and the Community,? for young emerging scientists, with presentations on (i) Crystals and Employment, (ii) Crystals and the Law, (iii) The Future of Air Travel, and (iv) The Future of the University. Additionally, several special sessions celebrating the 100th birthday of Gerhard Martin Julius Schmidt (Aug. 21, 1919 - July 12, 1971), and sessions on "Climate Change and Walking the Talk," which will address approaches to reducing the carbon footprint of scientific conferences, and "Organic Solid-State Chemistry in the Commercial Sector", which will address intellectual property as well as industrial-academic interactions. The conference concludes with computational crystallography workshops for crystal structure prediction and solution, as well as an X-ray Diffraction Master Class for student participants. To facilitate a bigger audience and to test the waters for virtual conferencing (in line with carbon footprint reduction session), ICCOSS XXIV will live stream the presentations on a private YouTube channel for distant registrants, using a Twitter feed for questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
