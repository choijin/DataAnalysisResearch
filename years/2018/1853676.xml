<AbstractNarration>This award will support travel for early career researchers in the field of cartography and Geographic Information Science (GIScience) to attend the 29th International Cartographic Conference (ICC). This project targets the professional development of early career scholars that are currently completing a graduate degree, or are in the early stages of their academic, professional career. The ICC provides a scientific venue that covers all aspects of cartographic research, a venue that is ideal for young scholars to present their research and to talk face-to-face with an international community of scientists. Young scholars who have attended previous ICCs have demonstrated productive research programs in cartography and GIScience, as evidenced by their scientific publications and success securing funding to support their research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term impact of this support for students and early career scholars is research innovation and collaboration that promotes future leaders in research in cartography and GIScience in the United States. Participation in the International Cartographic Conference will lead to the development of globally relevant cutting-edge research and will enable U.S. scholars to take a lead in these endeavors. These young scholars develop new research agendas that couple key scientific and societal challenges in collaboration with the international community, and actively disseminate technical and methodological advances in cartography through workshops, seminars, and peer-reviewed publications. These young scholars benefit from exposure to ideas from the international cartographic community, but also share the American experience in this high priority research area for cartography and GIScience. These accomplishments in turn result in the development of a creative and productive workforce conducing innovative research in cartography and geographic information science that serve the Nation's interests regarding spatial information infrastructure. Although the conference is being held in Tokyo, Japan, the event will provide new insights and approaches to cartographic research throughout the world, including the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
