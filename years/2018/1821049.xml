<AbstractNarration>Part 1. The investigators will present scientific information about Arctic change to a broad range of international leaders by establishing a meeting and demonstration area, described as an Arctic Basecamp 2018, in association with the annual World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland. The investigators will hold panel discussions and will provide demonstrations of the instrumentation used to make environmental measurements in the Arctic in an interactive format. The events will emphasize the linkages between long-term measurements and climate models, while also bringing forward the economic considerations of risk and opportunity related to Arctic change.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2. This conference will emphasize scientific outreach to a broad audience of leaders in business, government and other international organizations who are interested in the pace of change in the Arctic. The investigators will establish a meeting and demonstration area, described as the Arctic Basecamp 2018, for a two-day period in Davos, Switzerland concurrently with the World Economic Forum. The outreach materials presented at the Arctic Basecamp 2018 will be widely distributed and will be used by the investigators subsequently for other outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Arctic in a state of accelerated flux; we are witness to drastic environmental, economic, and societal changes that have both regional implications and profound global consequences. The increased global awareness of the region brings opportunities and possibilities, but also brings with it the potential for conflicts and global consequences and risks.    The World Economic Forum (WEF) engages the foremost political, business and other leaders of society to shape global, regional and industry agendas. The WEF is independent, impartial and not tied to any special interests. The Forum strives in all its efforts to demonstrate entrepreneurship in the global public interest while upholding the highest standards of governance.  The Arctic Basecamp event, which was partnered with Mission2020, the UN Global Goals and Project Everyone, was a side-event at WEF’s Annual Meeting.  This project supported contributions by US Arctic scientists in the 2018 and 2019 World Economic Forums. Researchers presented general-audience talks to provide overviews of Arctic science and technology, and the role of the Arctic in global climate. They also staffed the Arctic Basecamp exhibit, interacting with visiting WEF attendees, gave press interviews (internet, radio and television), led evening Fireside Chats on Arctic and climate, and participated in focused briefings and discussion sessions.  Arctic Basecamp had the opportunity to inform a high-level non-scientific audience and to trigger innovative dialogue on opportunities, challenges, and importantly, solutions.  The aim was to foster dialogue with important sectors beyond traditional scientific disciplines. Events at Arctic Basecamp included:   Facebook live with the World Resources Institute  Circular Economy interviews Solutions Evening Global Shapers briefing    Arctic Basecamp events were well attended and organised.  For example, during the Solutions Evening we, and our scientific collaborators, presented the latest scientific results from the Arctic.  This was quickly followed up by Christiana Figueres (former Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC) industry responses which included Alejandro Agag of Formula E, who spoke of his company’s efforts to promote electric vehicles, and Brian Perkins of Budweiser, who outlined the beverage company’s plan to move to 100% renewable energy sources by 2025.
