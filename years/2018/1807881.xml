<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to propel the development of single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) into a mainstream structural biology technique.  The core technology is a research tool that provides a reliable, reproducible, cost-effective method for scientists to prepare their protein samples in the biomedical field.  By studying proteins in their natural environment using cryo-EM, researchers get a better understanding of their structures and thus their functions within the cells.  This new knowledge will potentially facilitate as well as accelerate the development of therapeutic treatments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project explores the commercial potential of a stand-alone cryo-EM sample preparation stage.  The core technology in discussion is based on the application of state-of-the-art microfluidic systems to deposit and vitrify protein solution on EM grids in milliseconds.  Furthermore, it offers scientists the ability to control their sample thickness by adjusting the thickness of the protein solution before it hits the grid.  With this technology, a larger region of the cryo-EM grids will have intact protein molecules and the right thickness of vitrified aqueous layer and is thus usable for structural determination, allowing researchers to save significant time and money in terms of image collection as well as tedious protein extraction and purification.  This way more protein structures can be solved, and thus better therapeutics and drugs can be developed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our initial goal was to explore potential markets outside of the academic market for which we had been servicing. When we entered the NSF National I-Corps Program, our company had already been incorporated for about one year.  At the time, we were selling in the X-ray femtosecond crystallography market (which we estimated it to be a $1M market).  Though our sales volume was small, it was perfect for a small startup with only two people such as ours; and for the most part we were quite satisfied with our company growth (a profit margin of 85-90%).  However, we wanted to learn more about our market and how big we can ever get to be if we keep our current pace.  With that in mind, we went through the Bay Area I-Corps Program to learn more about the mindset of our customers, who were mostly academic researchers at the time.    During National I-Corps, we focused on how to expand beyond a $1M TAM. Based on the first 24 customer interviews, we were convinced that we had a steady market demand for our products.  However, the 25th interview turned out to be the most important one; the scientist we talked to, instead of using X-ray crystallography for his research, was a cryo-EM scientist (cryo-electron microscopy, or cryo-EM, is a complementary technique in structural biology for solving protein structures).  Our conversation with him had since taken our company in a completely different direction as it introduced us to an ancillary market that was growing rapidly by millions each year (which we estimated it to be a total market size of $5B, with about 1% attributed to the sample preparation space).  This turned out to be the biggest unmet need that is solvable by our technology.  After 200 interviews, we are now on a very different path than where we started.  We have secured to Phase I SBIR grants, NSF (June 2018) and DOE (February 2019).  We will continue applying the lessons learned from I-Corps as we grow and scale our company.
