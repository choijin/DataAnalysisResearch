<AbstractNarration>This workshop will occur prior to the 2018 AGU Fall meeting, and will engage researchers active in the fields of natural and experimental deformation and microstructural analysis to provide input on developing data policies and data standards to improve the availability and access of research data. Participants will identify gaps in current capabilities for the community to store and discover scientific results, and ensure that standards are aligned across the field and experimental scientific communities. The workshop will bring together a diverse range of scientists from different scientific fields and from under-represented groups in STEM. A postdoctoral fellow will lead the organization of this community meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is conducted to meet the goals of the EarthCube program. In addition it moves a long-tail scientific community towards Public Access of research outcomes. This work will incorporate an analysis of gaps in infrastructure for integrating microstructural data from two related (but currently largely disparate) communities, those studying naturally deformed rocks and those conducting experiments to produce deformed materials in the lab. This analysis will be focused on understanding what current data resources are currently available within each community, where the fundamental gaps are in terms data availability/discoverability in each community, and how the existing StraboSpot data system might work to provide a unified approach to data storage and discovery that can effectively serve both communities. The workshop adds value to an investment in cyberinfrastructure for a long-tail science community. The workshop will bring together a diverse community to make decisions on standards to directly improve data availability and access. The project coordinates with The European Plate Observatory System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[A digital data system, named StraboSpot, was developed for the recording, storage, and retrieval of scientific information in the field of Structural Geology and Tectonics.  Hence, the data system records information about faults, folds, fractures, and fabrics in rocks, as well as the materials that experienced deformation over geologic time.  This work was the result of an NSF-sponsored community workshop, in which there was a unanimous agreement for the need for a digital database conforming to community standards and allowing scientific data to be reused.   The vocabulary and data standards were built during multiple, small-group meetings and use case field trips with participants from the structural geology and tectonics community.  The user interface was also developed with community feedback, ensuring that the system is compatible with the workflow of the scientists.  As a result, the highly flexible geological information system tracks both time and location.  Because of this flexibility, StraboSpot is being used increasingly by the structural geology and tectonics community.  StraboSpot is available to download free and runs on both iOS and Android devices (phones and tablets). It can be found at the app stores for iOS and Android.  There is also the main website (https://strabospot.org) that is used for storing and sharing data collected. StraboSpot is a combination of the words Spot (data collection method), and Strabo, the name of an ancient geographer who first described some of the aspects of geology and movements of the Earthâ€™s crust. The broader impacts of this work include engagement of structural geology and tectonics practitioners in a community-based activity, and successful developed of community-vetted standards for digital sharing for data.  In the longer term, this achievement will improve communication within the structural geology and tectonics community, and allow new scientific questions to be addressed by facilitating the sharing and reuse of data.  The shared database will also make these data available to be used by other scientific and non-scientific users.  A group of geoscience graduate students and post-doctoral fellows were supported, whose insights and work were essential for the successful completion of this project.  Their involvement increased their awareness of the importance of sharing data and community-based standards, and they were active participants in the efforts to advance data science within the geological sciences.  In the longer term, the availability of structural geology and tectonics data within StraboSpot will allow geologists, and those from other disciplines that require these data, to address scientific questions that need Big Data initiatives.
