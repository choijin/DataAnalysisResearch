<AbstractNarration>Flash-based solid-state drive (SSD) has been the backbone of modern storage systems to support a growing number of data-intensive applications such as graph analytics and databases. For decades, systems software and applications used a generic block interface to access data in SSDs. Today it is feasible to access SSDs in both byte and block granularity through memory mapped input/output interfaces. However, it is still unclear how byte-addressable SSDs will be integrated in today's memory-storage hierarchy, how will they affect the design and implementation of systems software such as file systems, and how applications will benefit from the byte-accessible property of SSDs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to investigate the systems techniques to support and exploit the byte-accessibility of SSDs in modern memory-storage hierarchy. First, the project proposes to rethink the unified memory-storage hierarchy and efficiently use byte-addressable SSD as part of the main memory to ease the management and programmability of the dual byte and block-accessible interfaces. Second, the project proposes adaptive page migration mechanisms to enable applications to gain benefits from both byte-addressable, large-scale SSD and fast dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) concurrently and transparently. Third, the project proposes a new abstraction of fine-grained data persistence which will rethink the design and implementation of data persistency mechanisms and further reduce the associated performance overhead and redundant writes to storage devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As SSDs have been widely deployed in various computing platforms, the proposed research activities will benefit many fields of study with high-performance persistent storage requirements including scientific computing, big data analytics, and financial services. The project will also carve a path for technology transition to practice through  industrial collaborations, as well as facilitate research activities for undergraduate and underrepresented students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will integrate the research developments and results into a new course that centers around memory and storage technologies. The resulting software, dataset, publications, and course materials will be released through an open-source repository on GitHub: https://github.com/sprlab/uniflash and maintained for at least five years beyond the completion of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
