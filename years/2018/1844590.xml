<AbstractNarration>This research activity is an interagency agreement between NSF and the Department of Energy to support the NSF's National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).  The Cooperative Agreement to analyze variability, change and predictability in the earth System (CATALYST)represents a sustained commitment by the Department of Energy and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) to perform foundational research toward advancing a robust understanding of modes of variability and change using models, observations and process studies. Fundamental science themes maintain continuity with the previous cooperative agreements, and include assessment of externally forced changes in the earth system over multiple time and spatial scales, advancing understanding of predictability and variability, and enhancement of fundamental process understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This report represents projects that are funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) and awarded through the National Science Foundation (NSF) Cooperative Agreement to the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) for the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).  The NCAR / Climate and Global Dynamics (CGD) laboratory's Climate Change Prediction (CCP) section has played a leadership role in performing climate change simulations and analyses with the Community Earth System Model (CESM), which resulted in assessments of externally forced changes in the Earth System over multiple scales, advancing understanding of predictability and variability, and identifying processes that characterize high impact events.  Through collaborations with Ben Kirtman (University of Miami) and Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) scientists model simulations have been analyzed and have contributed to the federal USGCRP in several high priority areas. The team has also been involved in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), which is almost finalized. Simulations from CMIP6 will form the basis for ongoing U.S. National Assessment activities, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6).  One of the key project outcomes involves understanding changes in precipitation variability and extremes, which is essential for a complete explanation of the hydrologic cycle response to warming and its impacts. While changes in mean and extreme precipitation have been studied intensively, precipitation variability has received less attention, despite its theoretical and practical importance. NCAR examined single- and multi-model ensembles of climate simulations as well as station records of daily precipitation observations going back to 1950.  The important outcome is that precipitation increases and precipitation variability changes are nonlinear, with implication for understanding how precipitation extremes will change in a warmer climate.  A key outcome related to temperature extremes involved heat extremes over Australia that can be linked to stratospheric circulation anomalies, in particular sudden warmings over Antarctica.  When there is a sudden warming in the stratosphere, the Southern Hemisphere storm tracks contract poleward and pull away from Australia, leaving hot and dry conditions that make it more likely for extreme heat and increased risk of wildfires.  Another significant outcome provided by the project is comprehensive insight into the notable differences in clouds and precipitation simulated by the CESM2 compared to the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) atmosphere model version 0 (EAMv0) and version 1 (EAMv1), particularly with regards to simulation of the Madden-Julien Oscillation (MJO) and in producing high values of equilibrium climate sensitivity in both models. Several sensitivity experiments isolated the impact of changes in model physics, resolution, and parameter choices on these differences.

To avoid this degradation, significantly different parameter settings for the low&#8208;resolution (1 degree) and high&#8208;resolution (0.25 degree) were required to achieve optimal performance in EAMv1.  These changes led in part to a better simulation of the MJO, and a higher equilibrium climate sensitivity in CESM2 compared to CESM1, particularly with regard to cloud-aerosol interactions.
