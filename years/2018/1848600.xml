<AbstractNarration>Since 1992, the International Congress for Arctic Social Sciences (ICASS) has brought together scholars from around the world to share the results from Arctic social science research and explore opportunities for collaboration. The Congress provides an opportunity to discuss research methodologies, strategies, and results, and promotes international collaboration. It provides a venue for the dissemination of knowledge and cross-fertilization of thought in social sciences and humanities, between the social and natural sciences, and increasingly includes Indigenous participation from the Arctic and Sub-Arctic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF funding is a US contribution to planning and organization of ICASS X. Funds will support the development of the scientific agenda, program, and logistics for the Congress and support efforts to recruit a diverse and multidisciplinary group of participants. Specific objectives include: (1) create and select the Organizing Committee; (2) develop ICASS themes, calls for sessions, calls for papers, and selection/review of suitable contributions; (3) develop ICASS X scientific program and logistics; (4) disseminate the information about ICASS X to ensure broad and diverse participation in the Congress with the emphasis to engage early career scientists and Indigenous scholars; (5) design the outreach plan to engage local communities and extend broader impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Northern Iowa, a headquarters of the International Arctic Social Sciences Association (IASSA), was awarded this grant to partially support planning and organization of the 10th International Congress of Arctic Social Sciences (ICASS X). The Congress originally was to be held at the Northern (Arctic) Federal University in Arkhangelsk in June of 2020, but was rescheduled to June 15-20, 2021 and took place in a hybrid/online-mostly format due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The goal of this project was to support a U.S.-led initial planning and organization of 10th International Congress of Arctic Social Science (ICASS X) at the Northern Arctic Federal University in Arkhangelsk, Russia. IASSA organizes an International Congress every three years, bringing together scholars from all over the world to share research in the social sciences and humanities in the Arctic.   NSF funds supported the work of the meeting organizers to develop scientific agenda, program and logistics for the Congress and implemented and informational campaign to recruit a diverse and multidisciplinary groups of participants.

ICASS X was initially scheduled to occur on June 15-19, 2020. The 2020 of the program was developed and contained 638 abstracts and nearly 200 sessions. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the Congress was postponed to June 15-20, 2020. Since April 2020 this project supported the new program preparation and online meetings between the PI and representatives of the host university (NARFU) as well as other program committee members and key stakeholders.   The program for ICASS X (2021) was developed from scratch as the format of the Congress changed to hybrid/mostly online and new abstracts were solicited. The program committee prepared a new program with 833 abstracts placed in 185 sessions covering 30 themes and 117 topics. ICASS X was attended by approximately 140 in-person and 777 online participants from 33 countries and territories. ICASS X took place on June 15-20, 2021 is a mostly online format with a one-day in-person segment in Arkhangelsk, Russia.   Completed objectives (in 2020 and repeated in 2021):  (1) assembled the Organizing Committee;  (2) developed ICASS themes, calls for sessions, and calls for papers   (3) organized the review of suitable contributions and  developed ICASS X scientific program and logistics ;  (4) disseminated the information about ICASS X to ensure broad and diverse participation in the Congress;  Key outcomes:  1. In 2020 and 2021combined, more than 300 session proposals and more than 1,500 paper abstracts were received, reviewed and accepted.  2. Development of the ICASS X website: icass.uni.edu and the science program in 2020 and the new one in 2021 (using an online platform).  Iltelelctual merit:   ICASS X theme was "Arctic Generations: Looking Back and Looking Forward". Research on social sciences and humanities have a great responsibility to address the challenges for sustainable development in the Arctic, with a specific focus on past, present and future generations of Arctic residents. The generational nature of changes and responses have lately become more recognized by many policy makers and researchers.

It also gave a unique opportunity for scientists involved in NSF-supported initiatives such as Navigating the New Arctic, RCN and standard NSF grants to present the results of their activities to international audiences and to establish interdisciplinary connections that may help in advancing research agendas in the Arctic social sciences.  Broader Impacts:   ICASS X brought together social scientists and humanities scholars, health researchers, northern residents and other stakeholders, to share their latest research on all facets of human life in the North. ICASS X had an emphasis on providing participation opportunities to Indigenous scholars and knowledge holders and will hold special sessions on knowledge co-production. The Congress served as a key venue to discuss and critique research results, to be exposed to new ideas, to network with colleagues, and to develop new collaborative ties and projects. Given the multi-disciplinary nature of the Congress many IASSA members hold that ICASS is their most productive and valued academic meeting for the Arctic social sciences and humanities community.
