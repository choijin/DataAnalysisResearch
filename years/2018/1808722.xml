<AbstractNarration>This 1-year project is to enable the participation of young U.S. scientists at the 3rd Workshop on New Opportunities in the AMS Era: Solar Energetic Particles, Solar Modulation, and Space Radiation, which will be held in Washington D.C. in June of 2018.  This third workshop in the series will bring together experts from around the world in the field of cosmic rays, solar energetic particles, and space radiation with an additional focus on their propagation inside the heliosphere and their interaction with the Earth's magnetosphere.  The workshop aims to advance present understanding of the radiation environment in the near-Earth space by combining various observations of energetic particles with theory and numerical modeling.  Therefore, the project supports the goals of the National Space Weather Action Plan.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The workshop have drawn over 60 attendees from around the world. Scientists from the fields of cosmic rays, astroparticle physics, heliophysics, and space radiation presented their most recent results related to:  - Solar Energetic Particle Theory - Solar Energetic Particle Experiment - Solar Observations - Solar Flares and Coronal Mass Ejections - Solar Modulation of Galactic Cosmic Rays - Propagation of Cosmic Rays inside the Heliosphere - Propagation of Particles in the Earth?s Magnetosphere - Geomagnetic Cutoff Space Radiation Environment The latest measurements of space-borne experiments have been shown during the workshop. In addition, new theoretical models and simulation techniques aimed at better understanding and interpretation of the latest experimental results have been discussed in detail by the major experts in the aforementioned fields.  Special attention was given to the discussion of the newest results of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment as it provides the most sensitive measurements of the time variation of Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) at their highest energies (100s of MeV to a few GeV) with excellent energy resolution.  This workshop, and its previous editions, enabled scientists of the traditionally separated fields to build fruitful connections and closer collaborations. The establishment of common research goals will help to focus the scientific efforts towards a deeper understanding of solar modulation, solar energetic particles, cosmic rays and space radiation. In addition, the results of the various experiments presented have been discussed in detail and the attendees are now more aware of the present and future AMS contribution to the fields of heliophysics and space radiation.   The topics discussed during the workshop go well beyond heliophysics. In fact, the space radiation measurements presented at the workshop are necessary for the planning of future human exploration of our solar system. A deep understanding of the SEP production and acceleration mechanisms, as well as the predictive capability of theoretical models, are crucial for space weather predictions.
