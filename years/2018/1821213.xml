<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project addresses the pressing need for providing incarcerated youth and adults with continual systematic and secure personal education and training opportunities, giving inmates the skills they need to productively re-enter society. It will also reduce recidivism rates, and increase their confidence and the potential for contributing to local communities. Every year, more than 700,000 state and federal prisoners are released back into their communities, often with no greater skills than when they went in. The majority of prisoners lack basic high school degrees. The goal of the project is to provide the most effective, secure and flexible offline e-Learning applications for acquiring high school equivalency, the area of greatest need, within the constraints of the prison environment; covering both instructor-led and self-directed learning sessions. At the completion of Phase I, correctional facilities will have an opportunity to utilize a secure, easy-to-administer, offline e-Learning solution for the General Education Development (GED) or for any other education and training in a digital format. A wealth of high-quality instructional programs will be incorporated into the platform that will ultimately lead to a high school equivalency diploma, and additional support to address technical and vocational skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Phase I project innovation is centered around the delivery of a single, highly-flexible, secure learning management platform, where multiple applications can be stored on a single server. It will provide the General Education Development (GED) content and will be expandable to incorporate additional e-Learning applications including those that can address recidivism. The adaptable learning management platform will automate the provisioning and installation of these GED and non-GED educational applications on private servers, either on-site at the correctional facility or on off-site private server networks. Different sets of content would be automatically customized for each prison, with no outside Internet connectivity required. Another key innovation will be the ability to have the e-Learning system follow the inmate as they are moved. They will always have access to their specific content and progress status as their data will be centrally-hosted on the fully secured prison servers. Their individual records can be confirmed and reviewed for parole evaluations. By providing uniform student analytics and continuous monitoring of learning outcomes with different content and educational application vendors, the system will advance the capability of offline learning to be a data-driven endeavor and will deliver a personalized experience comparable to systems in civilian life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

For our Phase 1 SBIR, Nucleos has aimed to increase educational opportunities available to incarcerated Americans by making high-quality scalable educational technology programs available to federal and state penitentiaries. We have evaluated the feasibility of the Nucleos Learning Platform for Corrections at delivering leading e-learning solutions that are both easy-to-administer and easy-to-use on a single system that can operate without any outside Internet connectivity.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>With the completion of our development of the Nucleos Learning Platform for Corrections, and deployment with a juvenile corrections agency, Nucleos has fulfilled our primary objective. As was our highest-priority original goal, this project has produced an innovative e-learning environment for use within prisons.&nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The goals of this project include both specific research and development deliverables, primarily related to the development of the Nucleos Learning Platform for Corrections, as well as goals of intellectual merit and broader societal impact.&nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>In regards to research and development deliverables, the Nucleos Platform has been built to provide three the following overall feature-sets: (1) aggregating education and training programs and integrating them onto one platform, (2) ?correctionalizing? education and training programs to enable them to meet correctional security and monitoring standards, and (3) tracking education and training programs on a transcript to enable analysis of programs usage patterns and their association with post-release outcomes. Our project also produces an electronic learning and vocational certification record, which can be shared with employers. Having a digital learning record is an important advance for prisoners, as it provides an opportunity to match people with employers, and produces a verifiable record. Currently, many formerly incarcerated people receive paper certificates for education programs completed at institutions, which are difficult for people to verify or understand.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>In terms of intellectual merit, Nucleos has looked to increase the capability of online/offline application integration platforms, with a feature set that is customized for corrections, including: application integrations, security filtering, aggregated learner record keeping, usage tracking, and message-logging. The Nucleos platform can be offered both on an offline locally-hosted server for increased security, or online to allow integration of a greater number of learning resources. These expanded capabilities, and the ability to deliver them in offline as well as online environments, offers a technical advance in the learning technology platforms available on the market. This technical advance allows Nucleos to more easily integrate third-party applications onto our platform, and provide a greater range of e-learning opportunities for incarcerated learners at facilities with a wide variation in security restrictions. Nucleos will use this technology to drive more comprehensive education technology solutions for correctional agencies, with higher quality application and content partners, and more custom-integrations with existing partners of corrections agency education programs such as community colleges.&nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Being able to provide broader access to high-quality education technology solutions for correctional agencies is important for broader societal impact. It is generally realized now across the field that correctional education programs are a key component of reducing recidivism. Recent meta-analysis research from RAND have demonstrated that correctional education programs result in significant reductions in recidivism. As a result of fewer former offenders returning to jail or prison, RAND has concluded that every $1 spent on corrections education programs can yield $4-$5 in savings to government agencies. Given that 95% of currently incarcerated individuals in the U.S. will one-day be released, ensuring that everyone who is incarcerated has access to robust education and rehabilitation opportunities is critical for American public safety, stable communities, and workforce development. Given that the prison population is highly representative of the least-educated segments of society, and that there are large racial disparities in incarceration rates, there are also strong equity benefits to society of helping people in prison have access to significant rehabilitative opportunities.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>In conclusion, there is a pressing need for better career skills across our society, and the problem is particularly acute for prisoners. One of the stated goals of the penitentiary system is to rehabilitate prisoners, yet far can be done to provide prisoners with the critical education and training necessary for successful reintegration into society upon their release. Currently, education and training is provided to less than half of people imprisoned in the United States. With the better use of digital solutions, such as Nucleos, correctional agencies can enable their instructional staff to serve a much larger proportion of their population with more-personalized high-quality education and rehabilitation programs covering academics, vocational training, and social and emotional wellness.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/31/2019<br>      Modified by: Noah&nbsp;Freedman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1821213/1821213_10547458_1572512761684_ScreenShot2019-10-31at2.03.46AM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1821213/1821213_10547458_1572512761684_ScreenShot2019-10-31at2.03.46AM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Nucleos screenshot 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1821213/1821213_10547458_1572512761684_ScreenShot2019-10-31at2.03.46AM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Nucleos screenshot 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Access and integrate high-quality e-learning programs</div> <div class="imageCredit">Noah Freedman</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Noah&nbsp;Freedman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Nucleos screenshot 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1821213/1821213_10547458_1572512799410_ScreenShot2019-10-31at2.03.30AM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1821213/1821213_10547458_1572512799410_ScreenShot2019-10-31at2.03.30AM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Nucleos screenshot 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1821213/1821213_10547458_1572512799410_ScreenShot2019-10-31at2.03.30AM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Nucleos screenshot 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Create persistent learning records for parole, transition & employment</div> <div class="imageCredit">Noah Freedman</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Noah&nbsp;Freedman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Nucleos screenshot 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1821213/1821213_10547458_1572512835654_ScreenShot2019-10-31at2.03.37AM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1821213/1821213_10547458_1572512835654_ScreenShot2019-10-31at2.03.37AM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Nucleos screenshot 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1821213/1821213_10547458_1572512835654_ScreenShot2019-10-31at2.03.37AM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Nucleos screenshot 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">View aggregated usage & messages, and track outcomes</div> <div class="imageCredit">Noah Freedman</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Noah&nbsp;Freedman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Nucleos screenshot 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1821213/1821213_10547458_1572512884056_ScreenShot2019-10-31at2.04.08AM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1821213/1821213_10547458_1572512884056_ScreenShot2019-10-31at2.04.08AM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Nucleos screenshot 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1821213/1821213_10547458_1572512884056_ScreenShot2019-10-31at2.04.08AM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Nucleos screenshot 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">?In general, finding a quality, flexible, all-in-one website/platform with good security is one of the biggest challenges I face.
