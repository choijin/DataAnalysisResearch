<AbstractNarration>This proposed research will use experimental methods to study how best to improve government accountability as a way of improving the efficiency of providing public goods.  The focus is on health care services provision and it is intended to find out whether the proposed approach to the research will work.  The project will implement two experiments.  The first experiment will involve a quarterly meeting in which local political leaders report on healthcare delivery at local government healthcare facilities to the general population.  This experiment is designed as a test of how effectively local politicians are playing their supervisory roles in the health sector.  The second experiment involves training of local political leaders on skills in monitoring local government health centers.  The results of this research will help to address widespread management accountability failures that lead to inability to provide public services in many parts of the world.   The results could also help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of US external assistance programs to low income countries.  It will also provide ways of improving the delivery of public goods and democratic governance through sustained citizen engagement in many parts of the world.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a feasibility study and pilot randomized controlled trial of two governance interventions designed to address constraints on health service provision.  The objective of the pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of the intervention and data collection activities.  Centering on the role of politicians' performance in delivering healthcare, the study will implement wo interventions: (a) increased citizen participation through quarterly reporting meetings with local politicians on the quality of health service delivery and (b) local leader skills training in monitoring local government health centers. Data collection will consist of pre- and post-intervention household surveys and health facility audits, along with observational surveys during the citizen-politician meetings.  Despite the attention given to the role of governance in service delivery and development, relatively little rigorous evidence exists on interventions to strengthen local institutions. In contrast to studies that focus on interventions in laboratory settings, this study will evaluate a governance intervention targeting inefficiencies in the political economy.  It also investigates supply-side barriers to healthcare delivery, which are likely another essential side of health care issues in many countries. Altogether, the study will shed light on institutional dynamics in low-resource health systems.  The interventions themselves may spur significant improvements in public services delivery in the target communities.  The project will also generate sustained citizen participation in governance, shifting the nature of political engagement in the involved communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project -- which focused on two governance interventions aimed at making health service provision more accountable and efficient in Uganda -- achieved several key outcomes.  Most of all, as a pilot initiative, the project demonstrated proof of concept for all of its activities.  These activities included (1) data collection, which consisted of several complex surveys, and (2) program implementation, which included (a) citizen-leader accountability meetings on local healthcare delivery and (b) skills training for local leaders on monitoring government health centers.  Both programs were received positively by their target populations, as local political leaders offered encouraging feedback on the training activities, and the community meetings were well attended and produced vibrant discussion.  Local citizens expressed significant appreciation for the activities, indicating that the events gave citizens an uncommon opportunity to voice themselves in their communities. Indeed, the project is likely to make a significant impact on the vulnerable populations served by these programs.  In the project's target communities, the interventions themselves may spur significant improvements in health services.  Rather than looking to external aid programs to improve health outcomes -- so often the approach in countries such as Uganda -- this project has instead embraced the knowledge, power, and agency of people themselves.  By bringing people and their leaders together to address health problems, the project's approach promises to foster meaningful change from the ground up.  Beyond health, the project may also generate sustained citizen participation in governance, shifting the nature of political engagement in the involved communities and ultimately affecting public service delivery more generally. The project also makes a unique contribution to the base of knowledge in economics and public health.  Focusing on the importance of institutional quality, the project interventions offer a model for health systems strengthening, adding key knowledge to the global endeavor to eliminate health inequity.  By directly targeting the accountability relationship between citizens and politicians, as well as the human capital of local political leaders, the approaches employed in this project address structural factors that likely have pervasive incentive effects on service delivery across multiple sectors.  Most of all, these community-centered strategies aim to use existing resources more efficiently and may be an especially promising strategy for sustained development.
