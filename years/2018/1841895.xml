<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project aims to address two conditions that are very prevalent in the aging population, presbyopia and cataract, with a single intraocular lens. Presbyopia, the age dependent loss in the ability of the eye to adjust focus, is expected to affect 1.37 billion people worldwide by 2020. Cataract, the irreversible clouding of the lens that results in blurred vision, is expected to affect 30.1 million Americans by 2020. Despite these ever-increasing numbers, there currently is no single product available that restores both visual acuity and a complete range of spectacle-free vision following cataract refractive surgery. Such a solution would provide a greatly improved quality of life for patients and would inform future scientific developments in human accommodation and cataract formation. Alongside improved quality of life, vision correction has the added benefit of increased productivity in the workforce. The cataract surgical and intraocular lens exchange markets are significant, with 25.5 million IOL implants and $3.3 billion in sales in 2016 worldwide. With the growing and aging population, these numbers are expected to increase at a rapid rate. This device will fill a significant unmet need and has the potential of restoring a range of vision unlike any device currently in the market. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed intraocular lens utilizes a highly sensitive refractive system leveraging large differences in refractive indices and has a mechanism of action unlike any currently in the market. It has the potential of levels of accommodation that are on par with accommodative abilities in a healthy, natural human lens. Forces in the eye are minimal, so this level of sensitivity is critical to any effective accommodating intraocular lens solution. Current devices and those in development do not exhibit the required level of sensitivity and subsequent accommodative amplitude to warrant significant adoption in the industry. Additionally, the proposed device shape mimics the natural lens, which allows for maximum utilization of the minute forces in the eye and prevents posterior capsular opacification. The first goal of this research will be the design and optimization of the lens utilizing a combination of mechanical and optical modeling. Lens prototypes will then be molded in a biocompatible, medical grade silicone. These prototypes will then be assessed for accommodative ability - first in an established opto-mechanical model eye experiment, then in an established human cadaver eye experiment. Finally, the prototypes will be assessed for injectability, to assure smooth integration with standard cataract surgical procedures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of this NSF SBIR Phase I project was to establish the feasibility of a novel intraocular lens that is able to treat both cataracts and presbyopia with a single device.  Current solutions on the market effectively treat cataracts, but do not restore a full range of unaided vision.  Therefore, even after a successful lens replacement procedure, patients must continue to use glasses and presbyopia is not fully addressed.  This is a frustrating outcome, especially after paying a significant amount of money for the cataract procedure and intraocular lens.  The most promising approach to address presbyopia is with accommodating intraocular lenses--designed to move or change shape in response to forces in the eye, changing focus in a manner similar to the natural lens.  The only currently approved accommodating intraocular lens solution provides a limited range of vision restoration and has shown inconsistent surgical and optical performance.  This solution allows for corrected distance vision and some intermediate vision, while still necessitating glasses for near vision.  Alternate approaches to presbyopia correction produce optical artifacts such as halos and glare that reduce quality of life.  Accommodating intraocular technologies in development have overly complex designs, which has been the downfall of many promising innovations.  Additionally, these technologies do not produce adequate accommodative amplitude--the key to restoring a full range of vision from near to far and therefore, treating presbyopia.  The ClearSight accommodating intraocular lens aims to address the shortcomings of current technologies by providing excellent vision at all distances, eliminating the need for glasses, eliminating optical artifacts, and easily integrating with existing surgical procedures.   These aims will be met via a highly sensitive, yet simple design with a novel refractive system unlike any in development or on the market.  This refractive system presents a significant competitive advantage for ClearSight, in a scenario where sensitivity is of utmost importance given the minute forces in the eye.  For this Phase I project, objectives included the design, modeling, manufacturing, and testing of the novel ClearSight accommodating intraocular lens.  In the design and optimization stage, an intraocular lens was conceptualized that matches the shape of the natural lens to harness maximum forces, provides slight stretch to the lens capsule to maintain mobility after implantation, integrates with standard cataract surgical procedures, and allows for restoration of vision from near to far.  This was accomplished with physiological lens data and computer aided design in conjunction with mechanical and optical modeling.  These steps provided confidence in the lens mechanism and accommodative potential moving into the next stage--fabrication of physical intraocular lens prototypes.  During this stage, an iterative approach was used, involving 3D-printing lens molds and fabricating the lenses in-house in a biocompatible silicone.  These early prototypes were evaluated for accommodative potential via custom fixtures that simulate interactions in the eye that occur during accommodation.  This approach allowed the ClearSight team to refine the design in a very efficient manner.  Once the desired accommodative movement was achieved on prototypes, finished molds were fabricated by a trusted manufacturing partner.  Lenses fabricated from these finished molds produce optically clear prototypes that were then brought forward to the formal testing stage.  When these lenses were subjected to accommodative/disaccommodative forces via custom developed fixtures and a simulated lens capsule, significant power change was achieved--similar to levels seen in a young, healthy eye during accommodation.  This translates to the ability to restore youthful vision from near to far in a natural way.  The prototypes were also inserted through 3D-printed injectors that correlate with standard sizes used in cataract procedures to minimize post-operative recovery.  Through these test methods, proof of concept was established for the sensitive lens mechanics, novel optical system, and ability to integrate with standard cataract surgical procedures.  Once realized, the ClearSight accommodating intraocular lens has the potential to be the first device to not only treat cataracts, but also address presbyopia for the millions of people worldwide suffering from these debilitating conditions.  Restoration of a complete range of vision, improved quality of life, increased productivity, and insights into the human eye accommodative mechanism are all potential impacts of this innovation. The NSF SBIR Phase I funding has provided an excellent jump start toward the design, development, and eventual commercialization of the novel ClearSight intraocular lens.
