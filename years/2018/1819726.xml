<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will contribute to development of a novel Balance-Enhancing Footwear Insert for preventing falls in the high risk elderly population. Falls are the leading cause of fatal injuries and the most common reason for trauma-related hospital admissions among older adults. One in every four Americans over age of 65 falls each year, and the financial burden from the falls in the elderly is expected to reach $67B by 2020. Therefore, introduction of a smart insole might significantly reduce the financial burden for the Medical Care System. It will also allow the elderly population to achieve maximum independence in the activities of daily living. The proposed insole will also address the critical needs of the athletic shoe industry to reduce the incidents of ankle sprains. The development of the new smart balance?enhancing insole, which improves balance without irritation and habituation effects will likely lead to new fabrication techniques for manufacturing insoles. This SBIR innovation has the potential to introduce to the market a safe, reliable and cost-effective insole that could be easily manufactured and distributed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel insole to facilitate proper and timely response to a person?s movements in order to maintain good balance while walking or standing. The plantar sole is a ?dynamometric map? of human balance control. The loss of balance occurs when the body weight is shifted too close to the plantar sole boundary. The timely information to the Central Nervous System (CNS) about such movements is critical for balance control. The proposed insert, with a system of microcells containing viscous fluid, triggers instantaneous rise of protrusions around the insole perimeter area in response to the sudden increase of pressure that excites the mechanoreceptors reporting to the CNS.  Such a balance-enhancing solution provides well-timed regional amplification of cutaneous mechanoreceptor sensitivity but without the side effects of the existing textured insoles. The shortcomings include permanent discomfort and irritation in the plantar sole, which results in desensitization of the sole somatosensory system. The main research objectives include: Engineering design of the insert; research of materials to meet the performance goals; identification of the manufacturers for future mass production; creating testing frameworks to insure performance according to the required specifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A unique composite insert/insole designed and validated during this project represents an original and durable bioengineering solution to an intractable problem - how to automatically enhance the sensitivity of plantar mechanoreceptors to improve the lateral stability of an aging population without either discomfort or irritation, and without habituation effect.  The insert is designed to reduce substantially devastating falls, particularly in elderly individuals, which are the leading cause of fatal injuries in this population (Fig.1). The insert that we have created successfully solves this problem by generating appropriately-timed self-augmentation of the plantar sole regional sensitivity.  Furthermore, it will significantly reduce the financial burden for healthcare providers in the context of trauma-related hospital admissions for this group of individuals. One in every four Americans over the age of 65 experiences a fall each year, and the financial burden from falls in the elderly is expected to reach $67B by 2020.  The plantar sole has four major types of encapsulated mechanoreceptors are specialized to provide information to the CNS about touch, pressure, vibration, and cutaneous tension: Meissner's, Pacinian, Ruffini's corpuscles, and Merkel's disks.  They are high-sensitivity mechanoreceptors, due to the fact that even weak mechanical stimulation of the skin can stimulate them to produce action potentials.  As such, humans feel every particle, including the smallest grain of sand in footwear, since the smallest local deformation of skin on the sole immediately activates Meissner's corpuscles.      Design of Proof-of-Concept Prototype   The key point of our novel bioengineering solution is the structure, which will generate a short, well-timed stimulation of cutaneous pressure sensation from the perimeter area of the plantar surface of the foot.  This occurs whenever the Center of Gravity of the wearer shifts critically close to periphery of the plantar foot surface i.e., toward the limit of the base of support. The solution ensures that permanent stimulation of the sole perimeter is avoided, and thus prevents stimulus adaptation of mechanoreceptors of this plantar sole region.                          Our concept exploits the incompressibility of a liquid to create hydraulic forces to temporally elevate the protrusions associated with a special liquid cell embedded inside of the insole in the perimeter area (Fig. 2)     Microcells were created from highly durable elastomer latex with silicone gel filler. The use of the insole construction (Fig.3) ensures that there is no discomfort neither irritation for the wearer, as well as preventing any habituation effects of the textured insole permanent structure.     A pilot study (with and without insoles) on 15 older subjects was concluded on the Bertec Balance Advantage System in the Gait Analysis Movement Evaluation (GAME) laboratory of Department of Physical Therapy, at California State University, Fresno, CA.     Pilot Study Results  Sensory Organization Test:  A functional test of balance specifically looking at the use of the three sensory systems: vision, somatosensory, and vestibular.   While using the insole, the overall mean composite score increased (suggesting improved balance) compared to subjects in the control group.  However only the PREFERENCE score (88 vs 94) was significant suggesting the insoles help with the subjects balance when in a conflicting environment.  Adaptation Test: Represents a test of the persons sway/balance during a "toes up" or "toes down" perturbation. The "toes up" perturbation has been demonstrated to be a predictor of fall risk in older adults. The scores improved for the "toes up" perturbation in the subjects when wearing the insoles (154 vs 121 sway score).  Limits of Stability Test: This is a test of voluntary motor control when moving within the base of support. The reaction time (1.7 vs 1.4 sec), movement velocity (4.9 vs 4.1 deg/sec) and directional control (51 vs 59 percent) all improved with the insoles.  Gait/Walking: The following gait parameters were significantly improved with the insoles: stance and swing time; initial and terminal double limb support, single limb support, and gait velocity. The subjects stance/swing ratios were improved with more time in single limb support (suggesting increased balance) and less time in double limb support. In addition the gait velocity was significantly increased (126 vs 156 cm/sec) when the subjects wore the insoles.  Outcome of this project for medical applications  The described solution represents a novel therapeutic modality to address fall risks in the elderly and disabled populations as well to reduce the incidence of ankle sprains in athletic sport.  The pilot data strongly indicates that new composite insert design provides stability during both dynamic and static balance, without any plantar irritation/ discomfort issues. Besides of improvement in the lateral stability of the aging population, this bioengineering solution will also address to the critical need of the athletic shoe industry to reduce the incidence of ankle sprains. It is going to be a useful amplification of local plantar pressure signals for hypotonic children, as well as compensating for the reduced plantar sensation seen in peripheral neuropathy patients.
