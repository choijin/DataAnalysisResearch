<AbstractNarration>This award supports funding for the participation of US-based participants in the program "Topology of Manifolds: interactions between high and low dimensions" to be held January 7-18, 2019 at the University of Melbourne, Creswick, Australia.  This meeting will bring together students, postdocs, and researchers from all over the world to stimulate research on fundamental questions in manifold theory. It will promote the interaction between researchers in high and low dimensional topology.  The meeting is structured as follows:  mini-courses in the first week by world experts and a conference in the second week. Both weeks focus on open problems and collaborative work. This structure will greatly benefit early career researchers. Another feature of the meeting that will make it accessible is the theme of the program: promoting interactions high and low dimensions will mitigate the tendency of technical talks and problems. There are two main research aims for this meeting.  The first is to identify settings for synergy from the interaction between high and low dimensions and to make progress on problems in these settings. The second is to produce a high-quality problem list to guide future research in manifold topology. It is expected that a well-crafted and publicized problem list arising from the collaboration during the meeting will be of long-term benefit to the mathematical community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An n-manifold is a space which locally resembles n-dimensional Euclidean space. Manifolds of dimension less or equal than 3 are studied using geometric techniques. Manifolds of dimension greater or equal than 5 are studied via surgery theory, which involves a mix of algebraic and differential topology, algebra, and analysis. Dimension 4 is in between; both the high dimensional Whitney Trick and the low-dimensional geometric techniques are only partially successful. The need for the program is that these areas have diverged in the last several decades, to the extent that, often researchers in low/middle/high dimensional topology are not always aware of the current research/techniques in other dimensions. This program is expected to lead to a synergy, benefiting both the experts and the new generation of early career researchers.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Low-dimensional spaces, those of dimension at most four, appear naturally in physics, for example as our space-time universe and exhibit unique phenomena.  Higher-dimensional spaces, those of dimension at least five, arise as the parameter spaces of complex systems.  The areas of low-dimensional topology and high-dimensional topology have developed rather independently since the days of Milnor and Smale, reflecting the differing nature of problems in dimensions 3 and 4 and in higher dimensions.  In dimension 3 Thurston's geometrization program led to the possibility of a complete classification of 3-manifolds. Dimension 4 is marked by the failure of the Whitney trick and is intermediate between high and low dimensions.  Surgery theory and smoothing theory provide powerful tools for analyzing manifolds of dimensions 5 and higher.   The workshop promoted interaction of both the ideas and the practitioners low and high dimensional topology.       Revealing exciting new connections, this two-week workshop held at the MATRIX research institute in Creswick, Australia explored the study of manifolds in low and high dimensions, via the comparison of phenomena and methods across dimensions and analysis of higher dimensional spaces in terms of lower-dimensional subspaces.  The NSF grant enabled participation by US-based graduate students, early career researchers, and distinguished senior mathematicians, who all interacted in the well-designed intense two-week program.       The summer school in the first week featured three lecture series, one by Wolfgang Lueck, one by Andras Stipsicz, and one by Diarmuid Crowley, Jim Davis and Kent Orr. The afternoons were devoted to exercise sessions. This was followed by a week of invited talks and collaborative problem-solving sessions.
