<AbstractNarration>The Symposium on SDN Research (SOSR) is the premier venue for research publications on Software Defined Networking (SDN), building on past years' successful SOSR and HotSDN (Hot Topics in Software Defined Networking) workshops. SOSR 2018 will be held in Los Angeles on March 26- 27, 2018. As in 2017, SOSR will be co-located with the Open Networking Summit (ONS), providing opportunity for industry and academia to jointly explore and debate recent developments related to all aspects of SDN.  This conference will enable interaction among the academic and industrial attendees of these two events focused on research and development of SDN. This award support ten US-based students to participate in the symposium. The conference can provide students with a unique opportunity to interact with senior researchers and expose them to cutting-edge research topics and progress in the field. In addition, SOSR, sponsored by Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), is unique in its emphasis on interactions among networking researchers and industry practitioners from multiple countries.  Attending SOSR presents an excellent opportunity for U.S. students to connect with the thriving international research community. Furthermore, SOSR 2018 will include demo and poster sessions that allow students to present and obtain feedback on their work in progress. The travel support will enable students to attend both the main conference and the demos and posters sessions. These ten students would otherwise be unable to attend the conference. The investigator is the travel grant chair and is committed to encouraging the participation of women and under-represented minorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project integrates research and education of students through exposure to a premier technical meeting in computer networks and communications. The SOSR conference has developed into a top-tier international conference, presenting a tremendous opportunity to students to expand their breadth of ideas, research skills, and technical perspective. Women and other minorities will be encouraged to participate and thus will particularly benefit from the attendance. With National Science Foundation travel grant support, SOSR conference will help bring new blood to the vibrant SDN community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
