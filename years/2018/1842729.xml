<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project is focused on demonstrating the feasibility of an innovative crowdfunding process to effectively support and grow the fourth sector economy at the local community level. This fourth sector economy, a blend of three traditional economic sectors (public, private and nonprofit) is poised to solve many of the world's most difficult and complex social problems; however, this sector cannot work effectively without a supportive ecosystem that enables the creation, funding, and operation of organizations within it. This project proposes an innovative Fourth Sector Ecosystem incubator that brings a coordinated suite of services to local communities to engage them, educate them, and provide financial capital through a crowdfunding platform. This project will engage four communities in a pilot study designed to engage and educate key leaders, energize advocacy for fourth-sector growth, and catalyze fourth-sector social enterprises by offering capital access through crowdfunding. The validation of this grass-roots scalable educational and participatory incubator will enable communities to support local for-benefit businesses who will improve the quality of life in their communities, create jobs, and contribute to the economy, leading to expansion of this model across the nation and globally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The innovation inherent in this educational platform is the synergy between the components of its scalable, turnkey process to provide a catalyst for fourth-sector business growth. Innovative components include a robust, secure crowdfunding platform, educational training for community leaders and businesses in fourth-sector principles, assessment methods to evaluate/provide continuous improvement of the process, gamification that rewards fourth-sector-supporting behaviors; and network-building processes. The goals of this research are to determine the performance, design and educational training specifications that will address the needs of all stakeholders (e.g., entrepreneurs, community leaders, contributors), and demonstrate the feasibility of this platform through a pilot study in four communities. Methods will focus on continuous evaluation and feedback from stakeholders in the four communities to determine best methods to teach communities to manage their incubators, activate their communities to participate, achieve campaign success, demonstrate improved learning outcomes from the training, and increase the density and reciprocity of networks in the pilot communities. Surveys and data will be collected and analyzed to determine the effectiveness of each component in the process, from planning to implementation to assessment, as shown through survey results, expansion of networks, and funding raised by fourth sector enterprises using the crowdfunding tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

It includes a crowdfunding platform, education, and engagement processes.&nbsp;</p> <p class="Normal1">In 2018, TLC was awarded an SBIR Phase I grant to prove the feasibility of 4SE by testing it in multiple communities. Our research was guided by three initial technical objectives: 1. Determine design specifications for 4SE, 2. Implement a pilot study to test the feasibility of 4SE in four communities, and 3. Demonstrate the capacity for 4SE to effectively expand the knowledge of community members, social entrepreneurs and community leaders about the needs of fourth-sector organizations and enhance their capacity to increase the development of the fourth sector in their communities.</p> <p>During the research period, TLC developed fourth sector educational materials, integrated them into the crowdfunding platform and piloted the platform in three communities. We also created a national social enterprise pilot to test the concept among social enterprise managers and owners. We documented the results and found that the TLC 4SE approach was successful in raising capital for local enterprises, building social capital and catalyzing community support of fourth sector enterprises.</p> <p><strong>Institute for Research in the Social Sciences</strong></p> <p>The Institute for Research in the Social Sciences (IRISS) at Colorado State University provided evaluation services for TLC 4SE. IRISS collected data through online surveys distributed to entrepreneurs and community development professionals, and through telephone interviews conducted with a sample of entrepreneurs who completed the 4SE project.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sixty business owners and organizational leaders participated in the 4SE program. Twelve of them launched campaigns during the research period, raising more than $88,000. Twelve more campaigns were in the planning stage when the research period concluded.</p> <p>Results of the IRISS surveys showed that TLC 4SE was successful in increasing the social capital of entrepreneurs and in beginning to weave together networks of community support for the fourth sector. Participants were highly satisfied with their experience with the 4SE program. They reported gaining knowledge about the fourth sector, enhancing their networks, and increasing their crowdfunding preparedness.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Social Network Analysis</strong></p> <p>IRISS also conducted Social Network Analysis studies for the communities of Monadnock, Upper Valley and Omniworks. (See SNA Graphs 1-3) Social network analysis of this nature allows us to measure some important characteristics of the network structure. One aspect of the network structure that we can measure is cohesion, giving us insights into bonding, bridging and linking social capital within the networks. While each campaign may utilize the TLC platform to achieve a higher number of total donors (bonding social capital) and/or a higher total level of donations than they might otherwise have, the cohesion of the whole network begins to help us understand the bridging and linking social capital that is created in the overall network through the online platform where donors can view and access multiple campaigns in their local area.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Research Findings</strong></p> <p>TLC 4SE was successful in increasing entrepreneurs? crowdfunding knowledge and building access to financial and social capital. Through mentoring, education, and network cultivation, entrepreneurs were able to access the immediate capital needed to start or grow their business. They also built relationships that will support their long-term efforts and, subsequently, support the development of a thriving fourth sector that combines economic, social, and environmental benefits. Evaluation results reported by IRISS indicate that the combination of education, mentorship, and capacity-building has the potential to revolutionize community development, particularly in rural areas. This work advances knowledge in the social science topic area of social capital and offers insights into the results of introducing a social capital generating tool into communities. Increasing social capital benefits society in many ways because social capital is recognized as an essential component of successful and resilient communities. &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>COVID-19 Response</strong></p> <p>The economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented opportunity for additional research. We know from existing social science studies that social capital is a key component of community resiliency after disaster. We are currently developing&nbsp;an initiative that can be rapidly deployed within rural communities enabling community members to fund local businesses through online transactions. It is also a place for community development organizations to post vital messaging and support throughout the crisis. Research from past economic downturns tells us that small businesses suffer disproportionate declines during recession. In addition, rural communities are hit harder and recover more slowly than their urban counterparts. We are looking forward to supporting economic recovery with TLC?s proven methodology to bring desperately needed financial and social capital to help our nation?s businesses recover faster and more fully.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/20/2020<br>      Modified by: Diane&nbsp;L&nbsp;Sontum</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1842729/1842729_10588205_1587419885701_SNA1UpperValley--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1842729/1842729_10588205_1587419885701_SNA1UpperValley--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SNA Graph 1 Upper Valley"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1842729/1842729_10588205_1587419885701_SNA1UpperValley--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SNA Graph 1 Upper Valley"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Upper Valley Network shows 258 donors contributed a total of 289 times, for a resulting network density score of 0.224.</div> <div class="imageCredit">IRISS</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Diane&nbsp;L&nbsp;Sontum</div> <div class="imageTitle">SNA Graph 1 Upper Valley</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1842729/1842729_10588205_1587420418464_SNA2Monadnock--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1842729/1842729_10588205_1587420418464_SNA2Monadnock--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SNA Graph 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1842729/1842729_10588205_1587420418464_SNA2Monadnock--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SNA Graph 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Monadnock (NH) Network shows 212 donors contributed a total of 233 times, for a resulting network density score of 0.220.</div> <div class="imageCredit">IRISS</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Diane&nbsp;L&nbsp;Sontum</div> <div class="imageTitle">SNA Graph 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1842729/1842729_10588205_1587420576493_SNA3Omniworks--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1842729/1842729_10588205_1587420576493_SNA3Omniworks--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SNA Graph 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1842729/1842729_10588205_1587420576493_SNA3Omniworks--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SNA Graph 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Omniworks Network shows 68 donors contributed a total of 82 times, for a resulting network density score of 0.618.</div> <div class="imageCredit">IRISS</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Diane&nbsp;L&nbsp;Sontum</div> <div class="imageTitle">SNA Graph 3</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
