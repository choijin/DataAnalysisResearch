<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2018, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Spencer Galen is "Testing the Oscillation Hypothesis of Symbiont Diversification using Parasites Isolated from Host Tissue Collections" The host institution for the fellowship are the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University (ANSDU) and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Jason Weckstein.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to identify the factors that influence the diversification and distribution of symbiotic organisms (organisms that live in close association with a host), a group that is thought to comprise the majority of species on Earth. Symbionts play critically important roles in the function of ecological communities worldwide, though the traits and general rules that have produced modern symbiont diversity are still poorly understood. This project will gain insight into the patterns and processes that have resulted in the incredible diversity of modern symbionts by studying an expansive collection of avian malaria parasites, a symbiont group that is closely related to the deadly human malaria parasites. Specifically, this research will examine how variation in the number of host species that a parasite can infect, known as "host breadth", influences a parasite's potential to diversify or colonize new geographic regions. By analyzing the host breadth of malaria parasites that have been isolated from a large collection of avian tissues sampled across North and South America, this research will improve our understanding of how parasites and symbionts more broadly have come to be so exceptionally diverse and have attained their current distributions. In addition, studying the causes of parasite diversification and distributions will lead to a better understanding of when and where novel disease-causing parasite species originate, a problem of major importance in today's rapidly changing world. Training objectives include sequence capture probe design and implementation, phylogenomic analysis, phylogenetic comparative analysis, and methods used in parasite specimen acquisition, accession, and curation. Broader impacts include outreach importance of symbionts to educational camps at the ANSDU and the mentoring of high school and undergraduate students through the Students Tackling Advanced Research (STAR) Scholars in Natural Sciences programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fellow will use the oscillation hypothesis of symbiont diversification as a framework to test the effect of host breadth on parasite geographic range evolution and diversification. This research will utilize malaria parasites isolated from a geographically and taxonomically expansive collection of avian tissues located at the ANSDU and the Field Museum of Natural History. Malaria parasite genetic data will be collected using a novel exon capture probe design to estimate a robust phylogeny for the group and thousands of avian tissue samples will be tested for malaria infection to estimate parasite host breadth and geographic range size metrics. Data from this project will be analyzed using phylogenetic comparative methods to test for associations between host breadth evolution, geographic range shifts, and malaria diversification. To promote the use of and increase accessibility of project outcomes, all products from this research will be made available on public repositories (GenBank, Dryad, ParaSite, MalAvi). In addition, specimens involved in this research will be vouchered in public research institutions, and the research will be published in open-access journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keywords: Diversification, Host breadth, Malaria parasites, Oscillation Hypothesis, Phylogenomics, Sequence Capture&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Parasitic organisms are believed to make up at least half of all species on earth, and are known to play critical roles in the functioning of earth's ecosystems. Parasites that infect wildlife are abundant and widespread, and are of particular concern as possible sources of emerging infectious diseases in humans and livestock. The study of parasite biodiversity is therefore of high importance with the onset of rapid global change, in which novel interactions between host and parasite are expected to occur with increasing frequency. The research funded by this award made significant contributions to our understanding of the diversity of two groups of abundant parasites of wildlife: the haemosporidians (malaria parasites and their relatives) and trypanosomatids (trypanosomes and their relatives), both of which contain important pathogens of humans and livestock but are broadly understudied worldwide. This project greatly advanced the genetic resources and methods available to study these parasites in wildlife, producing two peer-reviewed studies so far and providing a framework for further research on the biology of these globally important groups of pathogens.</p> <p>This research resulted in several major findings that increased our knowledge of and capacity to study parasite biodiversity. First, a methodological pipeline was developed to isolate genetic data from across the genomes of diverse blood parasites from the genomes and transcriptomes of host organisms. This approach, published in the journal Molecular Ecology Resources (doi: 10.1111/1755-0998.13091), has the potential to greatly expand our knowledge of the genetic diversity of some of the world's least understood parasites. Second, the genome-wide genetic data that was isolated during this project was applied to study the evolutionary relationships of haemosporidian and trypanosomatid parasites. The research fellow developed a new resource for genomic sequence capture that has the potential to allow researchers to generate large quantities of genetic data from any haemosporidian parasite species. The genomic sequence capture tools that were advanced during this period have the potential to be used to study poorly known species of haemosporidians, including those that infect bats and other known reservoirs of zoonotic disease. The fellow also produced the most comprehensive study of trypanosomatid evolutionary relationships that has been completed to date, published in the journal PLoS ONE (doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0240062). This research produced a novel understanding of the relationships between the trypanosomes that infect wildlife and the trypanosomes that are pathogenic in humans and livestock. Lastly, the fellow developed a new molecular approach for studying haemosporidians that will allow researchers to detect when a host is infected with numerous species of parasite simultaneously. Current methods for studying haemosporidians are not sensitive enough to detect all parasites within a single host, but the new approach developed during this fellowship will give researchers a more complete understanding of haemosporidian infection dynamics that will improve our ability to characterize parasite abundance, diversity, and host specificity.</p> <p>The fellow also accomplished several broader impacts goals that extended the scope of this research to students and the public in the Philadelphia region. The research fellow mentored three undergraduate students from Drexel University during the course of this project, including two women from underrepresented groups. Each student learned field research methods, molecular genetic techniques, data analysis, and scientific writing skills from the fellow during this period. Two students were mentored during Drexel Cooperative Education experiences, while one student was mentored during a summer Students Tackling Advanced Research (STAR) research experience. Mentees participated in oral presentations and posters at University research events and national conferences. In addition, the fellow participated in outreach events to the public at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University (ANSDU), as well as to the ANSDU chapter of the Women in Natural Sciences (WINS) group. Lastly, the research produced during this fellowship was disseminated at national and international conferences through oral presentations.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2020<br>      Modified by: Spencer&nbsp;Galen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1811806/1811806_10630234_1606772829250_Image_2066_SCG369copy--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1811806/1811806_10630234_1606772829250_Image_2066_SCG369copy--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Haemosporidian parasites interacting within a host"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1811806/1811806_10630234_1606772829250_Image_2066_SCG369copy--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Haemosporidian parasites interacting within a host"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Haemosporidian parasites from three different genera are seen interacting within a single host.
