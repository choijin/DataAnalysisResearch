<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be the improvement of the quality of lives of both the individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and their caregivers. The prevalence of autism has increased by 15% in 2014. Now, 1 in 59 children born in the US has ASD. This translates to roughly 5.5 million individuals in the US who are less likely to go to college or find a job after high school. Our user-friendly, discreet device can help affected individuals gain independence and create a supportive learning or working environment for them. Pre-emptive meltdown detection and care devices are virtually non-existent in the current marketplace. As the first to enter the market at an affordable price point, we expect to lead and spawn derivative products. Beyond autism, our platform technology can be utilized to push data to a healthcare professional, catalyzing informed and personalized preventive care. Other conceivable application is monitoring compliance and measuring the effectiveness of rehabilitation exercises for muscle engagement of stroke patients. Our innovation also has the potential to reach and assist those affected by other types of anxiety disorders. It can help people become more informed about their own mental health, intervene, and lead healthier lives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project involves wearable technology for predicting, detecting, tracking, and mitigating meltdowns for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We have developed a biometric sensing suite comprising two components: The hardware portion consists of a detachable, water-resistant core unit for biosignal filtering, processing, and transmission as well as machine washable sensors that can be embedded into apparel; The software portion consists of our proprietary machine learning models for determination of when a meltdown is to occur, alerting the parent or caregiver of a high risk of a meltdown, and an assessment of mitigation techniques afterwards. Our innovation will advance autism research, as the technology has the potential to open the doors to a better understanding of behavioral phenotypes. Being able to tell what a non-verbal child is feeling can pave the way for more efficient and productive lessons for social/education development as well as broader phenotypical research. The assessment feature of our product will lead to the improvement of mitigation techniques for meltdowns. gaia's competitive advantage is in its pre-emptive nature of care. Proof-of-concept was demonstrated, and a beta prototype will be complete by the end of Summer 2018.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
