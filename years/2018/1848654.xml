<AbstractNarration>Stratiform chromite deposits hosted in layered mafic intrusions are by far the most economically important source of the element Chromium (Cr).  Chromium is a key ingredient required for the manufacturing of stainless steel alloys, as well as a myriad of other technologically important 'super alloys'. While it is widely accepted that the chromite deposits found in layered mafic intrusions are a crystallization product of a parental magma body, the fundamental geochemical processes that induce the crystallization of chromite in the magma bodies that host these deposits are still poorly understood and the subject of much scientific debate. One of the main objectives of this study is to quantify how variables such as the chemical composition of a silicate melt and the oxidation state of the Cr dissolved in the silicate melt affect the crystallization behavior of chromite. The results generated from this study can be used to deduce the chemical circumstances under which mafic magmas become saturated with and crystallize chromite. In a broader context, the results of this study can also be applied to quantifying the oxidation state of mafic magmas.  Developing new tools to quantify the oxidation state of basaltic magmas is a foundational aspect of understanding the oxidation state of the earth?s mantle and a major step toward understanding the speciation and mobility of volatile elements between the deep earth and surficial reservoirs.   This project will support a masters or doctoral student at the University of New Mexico, as well as an undergraduate student thesis. Both of these students will be trained in state-of-the-art analytical and experimental techniques and assist in research conducted at a U.S. synchrotron facility.&lt;br/&gt;             &lt;br/&gt;Understanding chromite stability is a critical aspect of developing models for the formation mechanisms of stratiform chromite ore deposits associated with layered mafic intrusions. Chromite stability in basaltic magmas is influenced by variables such as temperature, pressure, the chemical composition of the melt, and its oxidation state (i.e. fO2). The primary objective of this study is to produce a quantitative portrait of Cr-redox behavior and chromite stability in mafic magmas and how it relates to the aforementioned variables. This study combines high temperature-pressure petrology experiments conducted at the University of New Mexico with X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) measurements of Cr valence ratios in the experimentally grown olivine crystals and quenched melts.  The XANES measurements will be conducted at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.  The phase equilibria and Cr valence data generated by this study will be used to develop a new geochemical model of chromite crystallization in mafic magmas. Furthermore, the Cr valence measurements in olivine crystals will be used to develop a new tool for assessing the fO2 of basaltic magmas. A preliminary investigation has shown that the Cr-valence in olivine records changes in fO2 that may have occurred during pheoncryst growth. In this way, Cr valence measurements in olivine may be developed into a robust, quantitative redox chronometer for magmatic systems.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Chromium is a minor element that is ubiquitously present in mantle-derived basaltic liquids and their crystallization products, such as Cr-spinel, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and olivine. Under terrestrial oxygen fugacity conditions, Cr, like other transition metals such as Fe and V, is present as a mixed valence cation (as Cr<sup>3+</sup> and Cr<sup>2+</sup>). Developing a rigorous quantitative understanding of the geochemical behavior of multi-valent Cr in basaltic liquids and their crystallization products has many important applications in magmatic petrology. These applications include: 1) development of synchrotron &mu;-XANES measurements of Cr valence in olivine as a spatially-resolved, quantitative oxybarometer, 2) the development of new predictive models of Cr-spinel saturation in basaltic magmas, and 3) the interpretation of Cr stable isotope fractionation in magmatic mineral assemblages. The primary objectives of this project were to perform an experimental petrology investigation and XANES study of Cr valence systematics in synthetic (laboratory-simulated) basaltic magmas and to apply these data to the development of a new Cr valence in olivine oxybarometer. In addition to the applications listed above, the development of a new mineral-based oxybarometer has important applications for improving our understanding of the redox signatures carried by basaltic magmas, and how the oxidation state of their mantle sources controls the cycling of redox sensitive elements between the earth&rsquo;s interior earth and surficial geochemical reservoirs. The Cr valence data from the experiments were used to generate a predictive thermodynamic model of Cr valence in basaltic magmas as a function of oxygen fugacity and liquid composition. This model underpins the Cr valence in olivine oxybarometer and facilitates the extraction of magmatic oxygen fugacity values from measurements of Cr valence ratios in olivine phenocrysts. This newly calibrated model was applied and tested in a case study of the McCarty&rsquo;s flow basalt from the Zuni Bandera volcanic field, NM, USA. This study demonstrated that Cr valence measurements in olivine phenocrysts can be used to accurately assess the oxygen fugacity of basaltic magmas and potentially track dynamic changes in oxygen fugacity that occur during crystallization. This project also produced an empirical model that describes variations in the intensity of the 1s-4s absorption in the Cr-XANES spectra of olivine as a function of the crystallographic orientation of the phenocryst if interest, which in turn impacts its XANES measured Cr<sup>2+</sup>/&sum;Cr value. This model is critical for correcting the distorting effects of anisotropic absorption that plague XANES measurements of Cr<sup>2+</sup>/&sum;Cr in olivine and improving the accuracy of Cr valence in olivine oxybaromenter.
