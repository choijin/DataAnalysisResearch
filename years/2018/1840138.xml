<AbstractNarration>A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the intellectual leadership of TCUP institutions so that they can address scientific or engineering needs or interests, specifically for their tribes or communities, or broadly for the Nation.  The TCU Enterprise Advancement Centers (TEA Centers) strand allows TCUP institutions to capitalize on their investments in STEM instruction and research.  This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will impact the economic strength of the Navajo Nation by fostering new STEM industrial growth and providing the high-skilled workforce required by such industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Navajo Technical University (NTU) will establish the Advanced Manufacturing Center (NTUAMC) with the aim to further pursue additive manufacturing technology through education, research and economic development on the Navajo Nation. Project objectives are to: 1. provide a hands-on, culturally relevant learning environment that results in an educated and highly skilled workforce to support the advanced manufacturing industry; 2. conduct and support leading-edge advanced manufacturing research; 3. provide an ecosystem of services to support the advanced manufacturing industry, specifically, additive manufacturing; and 4. support the Navajo Nation's advanced manufacturing economic development focus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NTUAMC will develop four new degree and certificate training programs in advanced manufacturing technology, including a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering; an associate's degree in metal additive manufacturing technician II; and certificates in quality control inspection and metal additive manufacturing technician I. NTUAMC will provide the infrastructure to establish the additive manufacturing ecosystem, specifically polymer and metal 3-D printing, as the common educational platform for teaching students enrolled in engineering and advanced manufacturing programs. The ecosystem education method comprehensively trains students to enter the workforce, as will the high quality research and internship opportunities accompanying this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
