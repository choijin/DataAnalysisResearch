<AbstractNarration>The study examines how government mandates affect medical responses to substance-using pregnant women.  Federal and state mandates increasingly encourage medical providers to initiate punitive state responses when they suspect perinatal substance use by pregnant women.  This challenges the professional role of medical personnel as providers of care to their patients.  This study uses a variety of qualitative methods to investigate the actions of the different actors in this process, state actors, medical professionals, and pregnant women.  Findings of this research have the potential to influence government policy-making concerning substance-using pregnant women as well as the responses of medical experts and maternal health advocates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study employs a multi-level analysis to assess macro, micro, and intermediate level factors that mutually shape interventions on pregnant women.  To assess macro-level processes, a systems-level analysis informed by interviews with stakeholders such as medical experts and child welfare advocates looks at how policy domains (including drug policy, child welfare policy, and maternal-fetal health policy) shape medical agendas and encourage medico-legal collaborations.  At an intermediate level, a year-long ethnographic study of a Labor and Delivery unit uncovers how day-to-day medical practices are carried out and to what extent the state is invited into or intervenes upon these processes. At the micro level, semi-structured interviews with medical professionals and women directly affected by medically-initiated state sanctions show how medical-state collaborations affect care outcomes and patient well-being.  A key consideration throughout is the role that social class and race play in shaping institutional responses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research examines how multi-institutional collaborations between medical and state systems impact patient care for pregnant substance users. The aims of this project are to 1) explore if system collaboration between healthcare and punitive state systems alters normative clinical interactions and expectations, 2) investigate the broader social implications of the blending of medical and legal forms of social control, and 3) determine how clinic to state patient handoffs are experienced by women as they move through punitive state system like child welfare programs.    Drawing on data from 96 qualitative interviews with maternal addiction experts, child welfare policy makers, substance treatment providers, physicians, social workers, and women who had experienced an intervention at birth due to their substance use, this research reveals that medical and punitive state logics are not distinct or sitting at opposite poles but rather they are complementary, enmeshed, and co-occuring. The findings reveal that in reproductive care settings, principles guiding clinical care and standard patient protections are scaled back in response in suspected substance use. Instead, a forensic approach is adopted whereby interactions are centered around collecting evidence of substance use to be handed over to the state. The findings suggest that marginalized substance using patients are subject to a "hybrid disciplinary form of health governance" in which their medical needs are not central to medical interactions but rather their potential "criminal" status guides clincial decision making.  This dissertation contributes to researchers' and policy makers' understanding of responses to contemporary drug epidemics and reveals the ways in which this hybrid form of health governance expands opportunities for social control and further stigmatizes substance using patients.
