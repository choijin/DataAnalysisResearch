<AbstractNarration>In this project, graduate students from US universities obtain international research experience while working on a scientific problem with real-world implications. Changes in climate cause communities to adapt to enhance resiliency and foster practices that are more appropriate for new conditions. In regions where dry seasons are increasingly longer, shorter rainy seasons experience more severe storms. Rural and agricultural communities are especially vulnerable to new seasonal conditions and their resources for adaptation are limited. The Dry Corridor of Central America (spanning parts of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua) is an important region for agriculture and needs adaptation strategies. The project location is ideal because of its many-decades history of changing climate. Regions of the western United States are also becoming more arid and experience more extreme rainfall events. Effective adaptation and resiliency strategies incorporate combinations of technological and societal changes. The collaborative model in this study consists of experts in hydrology and watershed studies, ethnography and participatory research, agriculture, and community outreach. Researchers and professionals from Michigan Technological University, the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI), and Lutheran World Relief (LWR), a US-based international relief organization that is starting a multiyear project to strengthen communities for disaster mitigation?are filling the needed expertise to achieve the project objectives. The project team and student participants are incorporating hydrometeorological data into forecasting tools to provide data-driven recommendations for rural agricultural communities so they are more resilient to water scarcity and flooding. Students learn new collaborative research methods in an international context to enhance their capabilities for working in socially and culturally diverse settings to address complex problems in land-use management in a changing climate and challenging landscapes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students work with mentors/experts in social and hydrological sciences research and education in agricultural communities in the Dry Corridor of El Salvador. The project participants work with local farmers and agricultural stakeholders to gain experience in adapting to climate change. The interdisciplinary scientists and development professionals work together in participatory research in communities experiencing water scarcity and extreme rainfall events. Students collect hydrometeorological and community data to use in computational tools to understand and forecast the hydrological system in steep-sloped, semi-arid area subject to changing land-use. The increased hydrological understanding along with participatory, community-based research better informs decision-makers about more appropriate agricultural and water management practices in response to observed changes in the regional climate. The research team measures the effectiveness of these strategies on crop yields, water usage, and impacts of precipitation-related hazards. The research aims to inform farmers and other local stakeholders about hydrological factors that influence crop yields in areas with highly variable weather and climate. The research will influence decisions regarding crop selection, planting practices, and irrigation. Each year a new diverse cohort of ten US graduate students with different, but complementary, disciplinary backgrounds work together on issues related to these hazards. The students participate in an 8-week international educational and research experience, working with experts in hydrological modeling, participatory research, agriculture, and hydrological and meteorological monitoring. Professional development activities for the student participants further the broader impacts of this work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
