<AbstractNarration>Nearly one-sixth of the world's population suffer from neurological diseases, including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, autism, Alzheimer's disease, depression, etc., and their life qualities are severely compromised. In order to effectively treat these brain-related diseases with minimal side effects, we need to fully understand the functional networks in the brain. However, this endeavor has been largely hindered by the engineering challenges of making deep brain interface devices that match the functional complexity and mechanical compliance of the brain. There remains an urgent need to create a multifunctional device that can seamlessly interface with the brain without causing significant damage. This research program proposes to develop novel neural interface devices which are highly flexible, biocompatible, scalable, and clinically translatable, with multisite multifunctional capabilities. The developed toolset will also be utilized to address some of the key challenges in biological applications, with a focus on the seizure, tumor, and the visual system. To achieve these goals, the proposed research program will build upon the leading edge research across multiple fields, including nanomaterials, optics, electronics, surface chemistry, microfabrication, and neuroscience, and aims to significantly advance the fundamental understanding in these fields. The proposed research offers many potential benefits to society, including the possibility of improving the lives of patients with neurological disorders. The research will be highly integrated with multilevel educational components towards K12 students and teachers, undergraduate, and graduate students, with a focus on underrepresented student groups. Examples include the Kindergarten-to-College program targeting fifth graders from more than ten title I schools across Virginia, and the Computers and Technology at Virginia Tech program targeting high school girls from Virginia and out of state. The PI will also actively participate in the National Science Foundation's Revolutionizing Engineering Departments grant for transforming undergraduate education in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Virginia Tech. &lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research program is to address a key challenge in developing bio-friendly and multifunctional neural interfaces utilizing a non-conventional fiber drawing and patterning platform. The methods to be employed include nanomaterials processing and modeling, multimaterial multifunctional fiber fabrication and patterning, electrochemical characterization and circuit modeling, optical characterization and modeling, and in vitro and in vivo neural stimulation and recording. This project will enable flexible and biocompatible, nanoelectrodes-integrated, bidirectional, and multisite three-dimensional neural interfaces. It can facilitate the understanding of complex brain functions as well as the treatment of neurological diseases. The specific goals of this program are (1) Scalable fabrication of nano-integrated electrodes. Fundamental understanding of the material properties and charge transfer will be obtained through thorough characterization as well as mechanical and electrical modeling. (2) Multifunctional integration combined with modeling to understand the material and structural limitations. (3) In vitro and in vivo neural stimulation and recording for neuroscience applications including seizure, tumor treatment, and visual circuitry. The intellectual merit of this proposed research includes the understanding of (1) how nanomaterials interface with neurons at the cellular or subcellular level; (2) the fundamental limitations to neural electrode sizes and optical channels; (3) nanomaterials properties under extreme physical conditions. Besides, this developed toolset will enable significant new insights into various neuroscience applications through interdisciplinary research across multiple fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
