<AbstractNarration>Formal methods have made significant advances during the last decade, and now form the backbone of formal assurance across hardware and software industries. Underlying many of these techniques is the capability to effectively reason about system properties, often by describing the properties as constraint satisfaction problems and delegating the reasoning to a constraint solver. Due to their practical effectiveness and robust scalability, the most common constraint reasoning engines in use today are satisfiability (modulo theories) solvers (SAT and SMT). This award will provide travel grants for US-based students to attend the SAT/SMT summer school to be held in Manchester, UK, July 3-6, preceding the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC 2018).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SAT/SMT Summer School allows students to learn about the techniques underlying modern SAT and SMT solvers, and gives them a broad view of the field with many practical applications. Since the school is a separate event, in a less formal setting, the students have the opportunity to discuss the school topics (with lab assignments), discuss their own research ideas, and interact closely both with their peers and the leaders in the field. The summer school ignites the transfer and dissemination of knowledge that will lead to superior technology, better users, and exciting and far-reaching applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
