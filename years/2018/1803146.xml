<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of US-based participants in the meeting ``Conference on the Interplay of Harmonic Analysis and Geometry'' (CIHAG), which will be held at Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa in Cortona, Italy during the week of June 25-29, 2018.  Additional information about the conference can be found on the website http://www.math.wisc.edu/fricci2018&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2018 CIHAG meeting is devoted to recent developments in harmonic analysis and many applications to other disciplines. This week-long conference will bring approximately 25 internationally-recognized analysts to Cortona, Italy. Each of them will give a one-hour talk. The 2018 CIHAG meeting will also provide numerous junior participants with the opportunity to give short talks or present posters about their work. The 2018 CIHAG meeting will include a session for discussions of important open problems in harmonic analysis. Priority for funding will be given to early career mathematicians, women, members of underrepresented groups and those without other means of support. This is an important conference in harmonic analysis and its applications that will offer participants the opportunity to learn of state-of-the-art research in harmonic analysis with applications to engineering and other sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The conference was supported jointly by the Clay Mathematics Institute; the Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica F.

Outcomes are as follows:  (1) Several research talks by mathematicians of world-wide renown, as detailed in the conference website:  Geometric Aspects of Harmonic Analysis | INdAM meeting Geometric Aspects of Harmonic Analysis     (2) Research development through talks, and dedicated time for discussion and feedback to junior participants.    (3) A dedicated poster session for the junior participants.  (4) Publication of a peer-reviewed, conference proceedings volume by the science publisher Springer-Verlag.    It is anticipated that the research talks given at the  ``Conference on the interplay of harmonic analysis and geometry??  will also be published in peer-reviewed professional journals. However in view of the long processing times for journal publications, there is no mechanism in place to keep track of such publications other than the subscription-based, national database ``Mathematical Reviews?? managed by the American Mathematical Society:      MR: Search Authors database             Last Modified: 04/17/2019       Submitted by: Loredana Lanzani]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
