<AbstractNarration>This workshop aims to understand how and why the breakdown of organic material (heterotrophic respiration) varies over time in streams, and how and why this timing differs among streams and rivers of different sizes and in different parts of the world.  Recent development of inexpensive oxygen sensors have allowed the widespread collection of multi-year continuous records of oxygen concentration, which can be used to precisely measure the timing of respiration.  Organic matter may be produced in the stream by algae and other aquatic plants, or may be produced by terrestrial plants, and later be delivered to streams and rivers as falling leaves, as eroded particles of soil, or dissolved in water that flows from hillslopes to channels.  These organic matter sources support the growth of animals higher in the food chain, such as insects and fish, and also provide energy for microorganisms that remove pollutants. The balance of photosynthesis and respiration in streams also influences the production of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide.  Because organic matter can enter streams in many different ways, and because different kinds of organic matter break down at different rates, the timing of energy supply to streams also is likely to differ among streams, and to respond to many different aspects of environmental change.  This award will support strengthen and broaden the scientific workforce by supporting participation of US scientists from different career stages, regions, and backgrounds in an international conference that addresses topics at the leading edge of environmental data science; will strengthen existing connections between US and international scientists and establish new ones; and will increase the use of a newly-developed online portal (StreamPULSE; data.streampulse.org) for storage, sharing, and analysis of stream photosynthesis and respiration data  to an international workshop to develop and test ideas about the connections between the timing of organic matter supply and the timing of its decomposition, and how environmental change may alter these patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this conference is to simultaneously advance the conceptual and technical understanding of respiration and heterotrophy in streams and rivers.  First, this conference will produce a conceptual model of aquatic heterotrophy that links forms, mechanisms, and timing of organic matter input to temporal patterns in respiration, drawing on case studies from intensive study of organic matter and respiration dynamics at diverse sites around the world.  Second, this conference will evaluate statistical methods to improve the estimation and interpretation of respiration dynamics from continuous time series of oxygen and other variables including carbon dioxide. Finally, we will integrate these technical and conceptual advances by empirically linking the dynamics of respiration to remotely-sensed estimates of organic matter supply in forested streams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Our five working groups examined different aspects of these patterns in time, which we refer to as respiration regimes.  Our groups documented the timing and distribution of low oxygen conditions in streams and rivers, showing that hypoxia is more extensive than previously known, and is particularly common in tropical and low-lying rivers.  We assessed how the ratio of organic matter production and decomposition varies over time in different rivers, and showed that covariation between these processes can indicate the dominant processes controlling river metabolism.  We developed a model that assesses how the different potential sources of organic matter shape the timing of respiration, and developed new hypotheses about how respiration is linked to aquatic animal consumer communities. Overall, these distinct contributions have enriched our understanding of the drivers and consequences of the varied patterns of organic matter decomposition in streams and rivers.
