<AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation award supports the acquisition of a FieldSpec 4 Hi-Res spectroradiometer (Analytical Spectral Devices, Inc.) at New Mexico State University (NMSU), a Hispanic-Serving (HSI) and Minority-Serving (MSI) Institution in the heart of southern New Mexico. The spectroradiometer measures the spectral response of a diversity of materials in 2,151 visible, near infrared, and shortwave infrared wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum (350 to 2,500 nm). For example, the instrument can measure how much radiation is reflected from plants, soils, or water in different wavelengths and this information can then be used to assess the nature, status, and composition of these materials across space and through time. The spectroradiometer will support ongoing research and enable new and innovative research of a diversity of users at NMSU and beyond, including but not limited to anthropologists, astronomers, biologists, computer scientists, engineers, geographers, geologists, physicists, and soil scientists. This research has the potential to transform understanding of interactions between matter and electromagnetic radiation, which is indispensable for addressing a range of societal challenges and environmental concerns such as drought and desertification. In addition to expanding the research infrastructure of NMSU, the instrument will enhance research training and teaching activities, thereby promoting the development of a skilled workforce that is diverse in gender, race, ethnicity, and professional background, a critical mission of NMSU. The spectroradiometer will also create new opportunities for extension and outreach as well as collaboration with partners in the private, public, and academic sectors. Finally, the instrument will facilitate the development of robust and cost-effective monitoring and assessment tools that are urgently needed to support the sustainable management of human and natural resources in drylands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spectroradiometer will support the diverse research and research training activities of more than thirty collaborators across more than a dozen academic departments in four colleges as well as partners in two private companies and four public agencies. However, leveraging a location in the Chihuahuan Desert, the planned research will initially focus on characterizing the spectral properties of common materials in drylands (e.g., soils, plants, and biocrusts) and on using this information in conjunction with hyperspectral imagery from unmanned aircraft systems (i.e., drones) to map two important aspects of these environments: woody plants and biocrusts. Worldwide, drylands cover more than forty percent of Earth's land surface and are home to more than two billion people. This research is critical because human well-being and ecosystem services in these environments are currently in decline due to woody plant encroachment and biocrust degradation. Access to long-term ecological data collected across the last thirty years in southern New Mexico will provide invaluable opportunities for calibrating and evaluating research products. Questions to be answered by the research include; which wavelengths are optimal for discriminating between dryland materials, when is the best time to distinguish between dryland materials, how does map accuracy change in response to changes in spectral and spatial resolution, which algorithms are best for mapping woody plants and biocrusts, and what is the spatial and temporal distribution of these materials? Answers to these questions, along with a spectral library that will be made publicly and freely available, will help inform and improve mapping efforts in dryland ecosystems worldwide, ultimately enabling more sustainable management of these important and vulnerable environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
