<AbstractNarration>Substances that make up the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and some interior areas are all seen to rotate.  Scientists also see the same actions in the Sun, the other smaller and larger planets in our Solar System, as well as in other stars and planets found orbiting other stars.  Rotation clearly affects the spread of heat, chemical compositions, and physical processes.  It can drive circulation on the large scales we see from planets to stars.  The "Rotating Convection: from the Lab to the Stars" meeting will bring together an international group of people who study different aspects of rotating convection to review the current state of this field, and plan future studies.  The conference will last five days and have talks and posters mixed with group discussions.  This conference will serve the national interest by promoting the progress of science when plans are made to coordinate future scientific studies of rotating convection to be most productive.  Funding will support the travel of early-career participants from the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rotation directly influences convection by affecting the transport rates of heat, chemical species, and angular momentum.  It can therefore drive large-scale circulations, and large-scale inhomogeneities. The interaction of rotation and convection is complex and takes different forms depending on the parameter regime considered (e.g. high momentum/heat transfer oceanic convection compared to intermediate atmospheric and planetary convection, to low stellar convection).  Understanding the complexity of fluid motions that derive from this interaction is a longstanding problem that can only be studied through a combination of experimental, numerical, mathematical and observational research.  The principal goal of this workshop is to identify fundamental questions to be addressed in rotating convection research, and develop a research agenda for the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award funded travel by early career scientists to the "Rotating Convection: From the Lab to the Stars" workshop that was held at the Lorentz Center in Leiden, Netherlands, May 28 - June 1, 2018.  This meeting brought together geophysicists, astro- and solar physicists, along with applied mathematicians and members of the fluid physics community.  The meeting was well timed as interest in rapidly rotating, strongly turbulent flows, as exist on and in a great number stars and planets, has become a research focus across communities with new multi-meter-scale experimental rotating convection devices now built in the US, the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy.  Further, two new devices are being fabricated in China at this time. Thus, this workshop strived to bring together all these different researchers from different communities to discuss where the field is at and where it should be going.      With the funding provided by this award, it was possible to provide travel support to nine early career US scientists.  Four female scientists were amongst this group (three Ph.D. students at the time of the meeting, and one postdoctoral researcher).  Their travel was fully funded by this grant.  Partial travel support was also provided to five male junior scientists, including 4 assistant professors and one soft money researcher.     The meeting has resulted in a number of new projects and collaborations.  For instance, one of the graduate students at the meeting has taken on a postdoctoral position in Europe that came out of discussions in Leiden.  Another of the graduate students redesigned her thesis experiment based on conversations and discussions at Leiden.  Discussions at this meeting also have lead to a number of new papers submitted (2 known to the PI?s of this award) and manuscripts in preparation (2 again) amongst the scientists whose travel costs were supported by this award.      The outcomes that arise from early career scientists attending such a high level workshop cannot be easily measured.  However, based on prior experience, there are many positives from attending such workshops.  First and foremost, they act to familiarize the junior scientists with the senior members of the community.  This breaks down barriers and acts as a conduit for information to pass between different generations of scientists, as definitely occurred at this workshop.
