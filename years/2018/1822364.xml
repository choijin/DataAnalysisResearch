<AbstractNarration>The 2018 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) International Conference on Communications (ICC) will be held in Kansas City, Missouri from May 20 to May 24, 2018. This preeminent technical conference is one of the flagship conferences of the IEEE Communications Society, and a primary venue for presenting new research results in the area of communications and networking. It is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the field. Attending conferences such as ICC is of paramount importance for the development of graduate students. Participants have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with hundreds of other leading-edge researchers in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This proposal provides travel support for approximately fifteen graduate students in the United States to attend this premiere conference, which will be held in the US after 15 years. The travel awards will target first-time attendees and under-represented minority students, since attending conferences is an important part of their educational experience, and they often have limited travel funds. The research community and the Engineering workforce benefit from the improvement of students in the pipeline, and the introduction of new researcher perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
