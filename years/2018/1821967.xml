<AbstractNarration>Supernovae are linchpins for understanding the chemical and star formation history of the Universe. Despite progress, some of the most basic questions about supernovae persist, and this proposal seeks to answer the question: What are the explosion mechanisms and progenitor star systems of supernovae? In the early hours to days after explosion, supernovae provide clues to how they explode, and what their progenitor star systems were. The PI will carry out a 3-year, one-day-cadence supernova search of nearby galaxies, which is expected to discover about 30 extremely young supernovae within 1 day of explosion.  This will help determine which type of stars explode into particular types of supernovae.  Through this research, a diverse set of undergraduate students will be trained in technical skills and t to take leadership roles in scientific or educational careers. They will be involved in all phases of the research, and they will lead an effort at Texas Tech's Gott Observatory to obtain light curves of SNe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will use the prompt telescope to conduct a nightly survey of galaxies within 40 Mpc.  Discovered supernovae will immediately be observed with the FLOYDS spectrographs at LCOGT.  They expect to discover around 10 type Ia supernovae and  about 20 core collapse supernovae within 1 day of explosion.  For type Ia supernovae, the team will study early light curve signatures related to the distribution of 56Ni and of shocking between the supernova ejecta and any non-degenerate companion star. They will also hunt for the carbon material most likely associated with a companion progenitor white dwarf. For core collapse supernovae, the team will witness the shock breakout from the surface of the progenitor star, and the subsequent cooling in the initial hours to days afterwards, which allows for a measurement of the progenitor star's radius and circumstellar material composition. The results will be used to constrain the progenitor and explosion mechanism of each supernova.  All supernovae discoveries will be made public immediately after discovery to facilitate rapid follow-up observations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  In the hours after explosion, supernovae (SNe) provide clues about their progenitor star systems and their explosion mechanisms, including signatures of shock cooling, flash spectroscopy, and companion shocking which may reveal the progenitors of the supernovae, companions, and/or the recent mass loss history of the system.  Motivated by this need to discover SNe soon after explosion, we conducted a targeted, one day cadence SN survey of nearby galaxies (D&lt;40 Mpc; the DLT40 Survey) using telescopes in Chile and Australia.  DLT40 is not trying to discover many SNe, but a few very nearby examples within a day of explosion per year so as to collect the intense data sets necessary (high cadence light curves, early and persistent spectroscopy) to glean hints about the progenitor star system.  This program has been very successful, discovering ~25 young SNe since the survey began in late 2016.  Here we mention two high impact results.  We believe that type Ia SNe result from the explosion of accreting white dwarfs near the so-called Chandrasekhar mass, but we are not sure how the white dwarfs gain in mass to the point where they explode.  One model suggests that if a normal star is 'feeding' the white dwarf, we may see an early 'bump' in the light curve of the supernova.  DLT40 may have witnessed such a bump for the first time with the disovery and intense followup of SN2017cbv (see figure).  This object is still being studied, but the SN2017cbv is still the best example of such an early 'bump' and the consequences are still begin debated in the literature.  The second high impact result is associated with  one of the most important scientific discoveries of the decade: the gravitational wave detection of a binary neutron star merger, and the subsequent detection of an associated 'kilonovae', signaling the subsequent r-process driven explosion.  The DLT40 team was the second to image the kilonova, and we collected an intense light curve of the event, and participated in many of the discovery papers (and press conference) associated with this exciting discovery.  We hope this discovery kicks off a decade of similar gravitational wave astronomy discoveries.  Broader Impact: PI Sand, while still at Texas Tech, regularly visited high school astronomy students at Frenship High School near Lubbock. The emphasis was on the scientific method and how we learn things in science.     Also, since the discovery of the kilonova associated with GW170817, PI Sand has given six public lectures, an NPR radio interview and an interview on a local television station all on the topic of gravitational wave and multi-messenger astronomy.
