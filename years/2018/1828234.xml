<AbstractNarration>This award is to purchase an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) with Laser Ablation and Liquid Chromatography capabilities. This ICP-MS system will measure the concentration of nearly all elements and their isotopes present in single mammalian cells, as well as complex liquid and solid samples. Research efforts will address core concerns of the south-central Plains region: healthcare technology, environment/population interactions, renewable energy, and water quality. This instrument will enable the collaborations among the University of Oklahoma (OU), Oklahoma State University (OSU) and the University of Tulsa (TU).  Coordination with Oklahoma Tribal Nations will occur via research projects related to water quality issues pertinent to the Quapaw Tribal Environmental Office through the Tar Creek Superfund Site, and the Miami, Ottawa, Wyandotte, Shawnee, Eastern Shawnee, Modoc, Quapaw, Peoria and Seneca-Cayuga Nations through the Grand Lake Watershed Council.  Oklahoma high school teachers will be engaged through the NSF-RET program "Rural Educators Engaged in Bioanalytical Engineering Research and Teaching" which targets rural students and teachers who are considered an underserved group in Oklahoma.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ICP-MS instrument to be funded is a PerkinElmer NexION2000 ICP-MS with various analytical capabilities. Single mammalian cells will be analyzed by being introduced individually into the ICP-MS using an Asperon Spray Chamber. The ICP-MS will be located at the OU Mass Spectrometry Core Facility, Stephenson Life Science Research Center, Norman, OK. The specific research topics to be addressed are: 1) Interactions of nanomaterials and drugs with individual cells, as well as assessment of cellular-metal metabolic behavior; 2) Reconstruction of population dynamics, mobility, and connectivity of organisms in prehistoric and current ecosystems; 3) Enhancement of renewable energy material performance as well as improvement of hydrocarbon systems; and 4) Characterization of organism-metal interactions within dynamic ecosystems to protect human health and improve water quality.  a&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

This complex instrumental system has allowed MSPM to develop a more diverse user base and implement elemental MS of both dissolved and solid materials.  The ICP-MS has supported leading research in biomedical engineering, specifically applying ICP-MS to quantify trace metals inside cells with single cell resolution. Overall, this biomedical engineering research allows us to gain fundamental understanding of nanoscale interactions that inform the development of nanoparticles for applications in biomedicine, bioanalysis, and biophotonics.  A second area of research is in microbial influenced corrosion (MIC) of carbon steel infrastructure.  Using the ICP-MS, we conclusively demonstrated direct electron uptake by anaerobic microbes from the carbon steel.  Although it has been hypothesized for nearly a decade that direct electron uptake is a viable mechanism, this is the first study to definitively demonstrate its occurrence.  Junior faculty have benefited from the ICP-MS by being awarded over 8 research grants including one NSF CAREER award and a OCAST Health Research Grant.  Likewise, over 13 peer-reviewed publications have been accepted or are in review or progress.  Two Ph.D. graduate students have extensively utilized the ICP-MS for their Ph.D. dissertation.  Moving forward, we are working to implement a long-range business plan that integrates ensuring full access of the instrument to research faculty and graduate students from OU and other academic institutions at a lower cost, with providing external customers (i.e., industry and commercial) analytical services at a higher cost.  We've aligned our cost structure with similar research institutions in western and central US regions.  We are now working to convince the OU administration the value of providing support to start this staff position because it will increase and enhance the analytical potential of the OU Mass Spectrometry, Proteomics &amp; Metabolomics (MSPM) Core Facility.  COVID and extensive turnover in administration from the university president, provost, VPR, and departmental chairperson has delayed progress on this staff position.  However, now that these upper administrative positions have been filled, we are relaunching our efforts to establish a full-time ICP-MS staff position.
