<AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding for undergraduate students to conduct experimental, observational, theoretical, and computational research activities in earth science, planetary science, and astronomy at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York City. Eight students per year will be selected to perform research into topics ranging from meteoritics, to volcanology, to experimental and theoretical astrophysics. The participants will be rigorously trained and well-educated in the fundamentals of the scientific enterprise, and will receive valuable research experience in an active, immersive, integrated research and education environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it recruits from a nationwide pool, this Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site particularly leverages longstanding collaborations between scientists in the City University of New York (CUNY) system and at AMNH. CUNY is a 269,000-student urban public university network whose students primarily come from communities underrepresented in science. The CUNY/AMNH partnership will therefore enhance the REU Site's ability to recruit students in urban, traditionally underserved populations. Aside from their primary research activities, REU interns will also participate in Museum programs; attend field trips, colloquia, and conferences to present research; and present their work in a scientific symposium open to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project produced cutting-edge research experiences for undergraduates (REUs) in the areas of astronomy and astrophysics, meteoritics, and earth and planetary sciences.  Scientists and faculty at the American Museum of Natural History - one of the best-known museums in the world - and the City University of New York - the largest urban university system in America, with two dozen colleges and more than 200,000 students - worked together at the Museum during the summer to mentor undergraduates from all over the country, helping them make exciting discoveries about everything from the world's oceans, mountains, and minerals to stones from outer space, planets inside and outside our solar system, stars, galaxies, black holes, and even the universe itself.  The students came from all over the United States, from Oregon to Kansas to Puerto Rico, from Minnesota to Alabama to Arizona - and from schools ranging from big state universities to small liberal arts colleges, from rural areas to the nation's most populous city.  These wonderful students made scientific discoveries through their research, and they also learned how to be professional scientists.  Bringing their newfound knowledge and skills back to their home institutions, the students are prepared now to lead us all into the future, pushing the frontiers of tneir scientific disciplines while broadening the reach of science and technology to all kinds of communities all across America.
