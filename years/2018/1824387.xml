<AbstractNarration>This award will support graduate student and postdoctoral researcher attendance at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) meeting at Steamboat Springs, CO on July 15 - 20, 2018. This meeting focuses on Yeast Chromosome Biology and Cell Cycle and is co-organized by Jennifer Gerton (Stowers Institute) and Mosur Raghuraman (University of Washington). The format of the meeting is a combination of invited talks, talks selected from submitted abstracts and poster sessions. A keynote lecture by a leading researcher in cell cycle studies will begin the meeting. Cutting-edge research will also be highlighted in short 15-minute talks chosen from the abstracts. Ten to twelve graduate students and postdocs will also give 5-minute flash talks of their work. There is also a dedicated 2-hour session for trainees to interact with all the scientific speakers present at the meeting and three separate poster sessions. The meeting affords many opportunities (both formal and informal) for sharing recent research findings and exploring collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fields of chromosome biology and cell cycle are quite diverse. This meeting is one of the few that focuses on fungal model systems from which numerous fundamental discoveries on this topic have emerged and continue to emerge. Recent advances in chromosome biology will be highlighted in this conference, which will bring together diverse scientists from across the country. The session topics include mitotic processes, meiosis, recombination, DNA replication, telomere structure and replication, chromosome structure, chromatin and nuclear organization, as well as kinetochore structure, spindle dynamics and cell cycle progression. The conference primarily highlights unpublished research findings and provides many experiences for young researchers to learn about the field and devise future goals for research on chromosome biology.  The meeting will encourage career development of a new generation of researchers, including those who are underrepresented in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The community of yeast chromosome researchers has been gathering around this topic for many years now to exchange ideas and train the next generation of yeast chromosome biologists.

Scientists from 9 different countries attended the meeting, and 40% of the speakers were women. The poster and general sessions were very well attended.

There were two special sessions in 2018, a &ldquo;meet the experts&rdquo; lunch, at which trainees can network with senior scientists, and a science advocacy session run by the Director of Public Affairs from ASBMB. The reviews of the meeting were very positive, with 77% of respondents saying they would attend the conference again and 91% responding they would recommend the conference to others.
