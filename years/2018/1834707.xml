<AbstractNarration>The grant supports travel for graduate students to attend the 2018 Empirical Software Engineering International Week, an international event, which this year will take place during October 2018 in Finland. It consists of several co-located events:  Annual meeting of the International Software Engineering Research Network (ISERN); International Doctoral Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering (IDoESE); International Advanced School on Empirical Software Engineering (IASESE); the International Conference on Predictive Models and Data Analytics in Software Engineering (PROMISE).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity advances the field of Software Engineering through the exchange of information and collaborations.  The field is growing rapidly due to the emergence of big data code repositories, which enables empirical research.  The goal is to enable the research that will improve software engineering productivity and quality, while encouraging students to pursue a research career. The international dimension of the conference helps develop a globally-aware workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project provided funding for six (6) graduate students and one (1) early career researcher to defray travel costs (transportation, lodging, registration fees) of attending events during the 2018 Empirical Software Engineering International Week (ESEIW) in Oulu, Finland occurring October 10-12, 2018. This annual event brings together researchers from academia and industry to present their work. Attendees have the opportunity to discuss empirical research design, empirical research techniques. In addition, attendees have informal opportunities to learn from each other as they share their experiences "in the trenches" of conducting empirical research in various environments.   The grant recipients participated in some of the following events associated with ESEIW.  The International Doctoral Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering (IDoESE) - provides a supportive setting for PhD students to present their own research and obtain feedback from an internationally recognized panel of senior experts in empirical software engineering. The International Advanced School on Empirical Software Engineering (IASESE) - provides in-depth training on the topic of Empirical Software Engineering and Data Science: Old Wine in a New Bottle. The growth of data science makes this topic particularly relevant for grant recipients. The International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering (ESEM) - is the premier international conference on empirical software engineering research. The conference provides attendees the opportunity to interact with researchers from universities and companies around the world to discuss research ideas.  Following are quotes from recipients on the benefits they gained from attending ESEIW:  "From attending IASESE, I gained a better understanding of the relationship between empirical software engineering and data science, as well as a valuable overview of data science techniques being used in empirical software engineering. From attending the ESEM main conference, I gained interesting perspectives and discussion on a number of topics in empirical software engineering." "First, I talked to a couple of researchers who I met at ICSE we had a chat during lunch to catch up with our research interests and discuss issues on our phd programs. Second, I also talked other professors and researchers who also worked on mining software repositories and user review analysis. I asked them a couple of questions on how to solve the problems i am currently facing with my research. Second, Many presentations were interesting.
