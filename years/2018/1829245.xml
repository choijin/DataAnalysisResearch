<AbstractNarration>Enhancement of Research and Education Infrastructure in Nano biomaterials, Biophysics, Biochemistry, and Environmental Science and Engineering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Research Infrastructure for Science and Engineering (HBCU-RISE) program supports the development of research capability at Historically Black Colleges and Universities that offer doctoral degrees in science and engineering disciplines. Supported projects have a unifying research focus in one of the research areas supported by the National Science Foundation, a direct connection to the long-term plans of the host department, institutional strategic plan and mission, and plans for expanding institutional research capacity, as well as increasing the production of doctoral students, especially those underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With National Science Foundation support, North Carolina Central University will conduct a project entitled "Enhancement of Research and Education Infrastructure in Nano biomaterials, Biophysics, Biochemistry, and Environmental Science and Engineering".  The project will elevate the current doctoral program at North Carolina Central University to a leading research and education program focused on development of advanced nanomaterials for biological applications.  The project will: a) establish additional doctoral concentrations in biophysics, biochemistry, and environmental science; b) introduce new courses in Nano biomaterials, bioinstrumentation, and interactions between nanostructures and biological materials; and c) provide financial and research support to doctoral students and research faculty involved in these new concentrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will expand the scope of the Integrated Biosciences doctoral program at North Carolina Central University through the addition of new research and educational programs focused on the intersection between nanoscale materials and biosciences. Project activities include studies on applications of nanoscale materials in the life sciences and medicine, specifically: 1) development of a new generation of biochemical sensors based on  quantum confinement and tunneling between nanostructures; 2) development of plasmonic nanostructured devices to improve selectivity and sensitivity in optical skin cancer screening and treatment; 3) design and development of novel multifunctional quantum dots for biological applications; 4) imaging of exosomes using colocalized Raman-scanning force microscopy and reduced graphene based fluorescence imaging marker materials for biological applications; 5) development of smart  hybrid nanostructures for biochemical filters, adsorption and isolation of substances and piezoelectric hybrid materials for pressure, temperature and optical sensing devices; 6) quantum calculations to improve understanding of charge transfer and interactions between nanostructures, nanostructures and biological molecules, and between diverse biological molecules; and 7) interaction of nanomaterials and biomaterials, and the impact of nanomaterial on the environment and human health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vision of this project is to leverage existing resources to provide new pathways for North Carolina Central University students to participate in high impact research as part of the Integrated Bioscience doctoral degree program. This project will broaden the scope of the program, making it accessible to students from a wider range of disciplines, and transform the program into a more comprehensive multidisciplinary research program that will prepare students for an increasingly competitive domestic and international research environment. This project will have a substantial impact on the research and education infrastructure at North Carolina Central University through support for faculty and student researchers and extensive curriculum development across STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
