<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. Through this one-year project, Tougaloo College seeks to increase student engagement and retention in the Biology sciences by engaging both faculty and students. The proposed project will strengthen curriculum in the first year General Biology laboratory course with more research based activities. Biology faculty members will work with students to create a learning community in the biological sciences to strengthen retention in core classes. The overall outcome will be to strengthen the STEM pipeline by providing undergraduates with a strong foundation in Biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tougaloo College Biology department will undergo an intensive review of programs to strengthen curricular and co-curricular activities. An important component of this process will be to develop a new introductory Biology laboratory, using research based activities. Assessments of this program will include perception surveys and academic standing to ensure program effectiveness. With a focus on increasing scientific understanding, instructors of the General Biology laboratories will adopt strategies to increase retention rates. Faculty will be supported with developmental opportunities that enhance teaching and research. Students will be provided mentoring and support to increase academic success in critical classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Tougaloo Biology Department has implemented numerous programs to strengthen student retention. The Catalyst efforts focused on working with the lower level students to ensure students complete the degree requirements within 4 years or less.

The Biology faculty redesigned the general laboratory course that incorporated more writing opportunities and research based activities. Students gained valuable insight into scientific inquiry, with each laboratory resulting in the submission of a laboratory report. This provided faculty with an opportunity to review scientific writing, which is critical for advanced STEM training. These activities ensured that students were exposed to research earlier in the undergraduate education, with several students applying and being accepted in first year research programs. The faculty worked with the Office of Career Services/Career Pathways to infuse career readiness in designated classes. Tougaloo College&rsquo;s Quality Enhancement Plan is based on critical skills identified by the National Association of Colleges and Employers. Using these guidelines, Faculty identified skills that are important for not only the workforce, but graduate education. Faculty have infused communication and written skills activities into Biology courses. This afforded faculty the opportunity to infuse career readiness activities into curriculum, providing additional support for the skills students need to be competitive in STEM fields. In addition, students were provided professional development opportunities in the forms of seminars and workshops that enhanced their competitiveness in receiving research opportunities, career opportunities and graduate school entrance. The results of these efforts are the creation of a biological sciences bridge that begins in high school and continues into the STEM workforce.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/31/2020<br>      Modified by: Scharri&nbsp;Walker</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
