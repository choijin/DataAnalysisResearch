<AbstractNarration>This is funding to support a Doctoral Consortium (workshop) of approximately 10 promising graduate students from U.S. institutions of higher learning, along with at least 3 distinguished research faculty as mentors, to be held in conjunction with the Eleventh International Conference on Pervasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments (PETRA 2018), which will take place June 26-29 on the island of Corfu, Greece.  The PETRA mission is to promote interdisciplinary research on ways to use pervasive ambient intelligent environments to improve the quality of life and enhance human performance with greater capabilities.  It is the only annual conference that brings together theoreticians and practitioners from a wide variety of disciplines to focus on the application of pervasive technologies to assistive environments.  Outcomes of this conference have a broad impact in diverse application areas such as manufacturing, transportation, energy systems, security and safety, robotics, healthcare, biomedicine, environment and conservation.  PETRA brings together very different types of technologies to also address important social and healthcare issues for sensitive populations, such as the elderly, or persons suffering from chronic conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Cerebral Palsy and other disabilities or traumas.  The PETRA proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library, and the authors of the best papers are invited to submit to special journal issues after the end of the conference.  More information about the conference may be found online at http://www.petrae.org.  The PETRA 2018 Doctoral Consortium will afford student authors of papers accepted for presentation at the conference a unique opportunity to gain additional exposure for their innovative ideas while also receiving reinforcement for the importance and value of conducting research with societal impact.  The workshop will allow the junior participants to create a social network both among themselves and with senior colleagues. The organizing committee will make a concerted effort to attract participants who are women, members of under-represented minorities, and persons with disabilities; to further assure diversity, NSF funds will be used to support no more than 2 student participants from any one institution, and if 2 students are supported, one of them must be a minority or person with disability.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the Doctoral Consortium, which will consist of special sessions at the beginning, during, and at the end of the conference, are to increase the exposure and visibility of the participants' work within the community, to help establish a sense of community among this next generation of researchers, and to help foster their research efforts by providing substantive feedback and guidance in a supportive and interactive environment from a group of senior researchers.  The special program organized for the students includes sessions between the doctoral students and the faculty mentors, in which the students will discuss their work and ask questions; the faculty mentors will provide constructive comments on the students' work and address their questions.  Students will participate in small group breakout sessions to discuss their work, and the faculty mentors will provide guidance on how to proceed for further journal publication.  Students will also have the option to submit a poster paper and to attend conference workshops on special topics.  Short papers on the participants' work will be published in the conference proceedings, and a summary report on the event will be posted on the conference website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

It focuses on applying pervasive technologies to assistive environments and merging expertise and tools from many disciplines such as, human computer interaction (HCI), machine learning, human robot interaction (HRI), robotics, computer vision, user interface design, networks, computer based rehabilitation, vocational training, psychology, neuroscience, multi-sensing, and applications such as intelligent manufacturing, healthcare, and others.  The results presented at the Petra conferences impact different types of environments and applications, at home, in the workplace and in public spaces. Many innovations and inventions have resulted from this conference, as well as many publications. The mission of the PETRA conference is to stimulate interdisciplinary research on Assistive Technologies (AT) that improve the quality of life and overcome physical, cognitive and operational obstacles that prevent a human from reaching his/her full potential and achieve best performance. The findings also aim at improving the functional capabilities of people with disabilities, as well as enhancing the productivity of well-bodied people.  Petra has been successful in developing and applying advanced AI computational methods to solve problems found in other disciplines such as psychology, and provide technical solutions and insights to emerging social and ethical issues. Examples of application areas include, smart healthcare, personalized vocational assessment and training, intelligent manufacturing, energy tracking and conservation, public and personal safety, transportation, robot-based training, virtual and augmented reality, wearables, safety in smart homes, robot-based rehabilitation, physiological monitoring, multimodal assessment of mental health through gaming, gait analysis for persons with motor disabilities, executive function disorders, and others. Findings were presented that addressed the needs of sensitive populations including, seniors and persons with special needs, such as those suffering from traumatic brain injury, Multiple Sclerosis, and others. It also addresses ways to enhance the lives and performance of healthy individuals. New algorithms and computational methods were presented on how to identify factors involving a particular condition (such as vision impairment) that affects the quality of daily life.        In 2018, PETRA attracted 130 submissions from 29 countries, and 134 registered participants. There were 31 Full Papers accepted, 10 Short Papers, 10 posters, and 43 workshop papers in 6 workshops. There were 4 distinguished keynotes from 3 countries, covering a range of topics.  The Doctoral Consortium (DC) and Student Author Travel Award for PETRA 2018 supported 15 student authors from 10 different US universities, who presented their work during the conference. Additional support was provided by the Univ. of Texas Arlington and REU NSF funding, enabling 7 more students to attend the conference and present their work.  During the conference, several sessions were especially designed for the NSF DC scholars to allow them to describe their work, meet each other, exchange ideas and discuss challenges and opportunities in doing interdisciplinary research and receive feedback from participating faculty mentors. The discussions included issues related to making good progress with their Ph.D. thesis, how to best design experiments to collect data, and do team work.  Major findings of this project include:    PETRA DC students interacted with the doctoral consortium faculty mentors, who provided them with useful comments and ideas on how to best continue and advance their Ph.D. research.    The students learned how to improve their presentation style and built confidence from this experience.    The DC students had the opportunity to network with students from other universities and other countries and shared ideas and approaches for a successful career in computing and applications.    The students' scientific contributions were publicized widely through the PETRA conference ACM Digital Library proceedings that gave their work visibility and several of them had their paper invited for journal publication.    The DC funding gave visibility to the respective departments and institutions in the US where the students came from.    Conclusions: The 2018 PETRA Conference had a broad and significant technological, as well as social, economic and societal impact. It continued to strengthen its community of researchers and was successful in attracting researchers doing groundbreaking research in human centered computing with significant contributions in their respective areas. The project was very successful and beneficial to the DC students. The aims of the project were achieved and the scope of the proposed work has been completed. The PI does not anticipate any further action on this award.             Last Modified: 06/25/2019       Submitted by: Fillia S Makedon]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
