<AbstractNarration>The funds will partially support student, post-doc, and early-career participants related to the IUTAM Symposium entitled "Stochastic approaches to transitions in fluid flows" to be held at Cornell University during September 12-14 2018. Stochastic flows and flow regime transitions are central to dynamical phenomena broadly important across engineering, geophysics and climate contexts. Approaches to understanding stochastic systems have tended to develop independently in the various communities. Various communities have begun to use models of stochastic flow transitions, often resulting in differing approaches. The aim is to bring together the different groups, those working on method development as well as on applications. These groups are spread over (applied) mathematics, engineering and physics departments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Community benefits of cross pollination of ideas/approaches/techniques. Early careers support will focus on PhD students, post-docs and early-career participants, to the extent possible. Societal benefits from jump in progress that is known to come from cross-community pollination of ideas and techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[IUTAM symposium 2018 Stochastic Approaches to Transitions in Fluid Flows Ithaca, 12-14 September 2018  During the symposium, about 25 scientists gathered at La Tourelle and Cornell University (Ithaca, NY) to present work on the topic of the Symposium, with a good mix of people working on problems in (geophysical) fluid mechanics and on climate dynamics. There was an excellent exchange of ideas and methodology, and great discussions on specific issues.  Two of the sessions (one on `Engineering applications (at CBE)' and one on Challenges (at CAM)') were held on Cornell University Campus to involve more of the Cornell University students and faculty. During these sessions more people (at least 10 from CBE and 20 from CAM, additionally) attended the talks, in particular the ones by Screenivasan (CBE) and Kevrekidis (CAM).  The Final report includes the final program and a photo of the participants.  The sponsors of the symposium were acknowledged at the opening and closing of the symposium.  We thank NSF for sponsoring this successful meeting and the program director Ron Joslin for his support.  The scientific committee consisted of the following:  Detlef Lohse, Michael Ghil, Valerio Lucarini, Adam Monahan, Themis Sapsis, Paul Steen, Bruno Eckhardt and Henk Dijkstra (Chair).
