<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the Mid-Atlantic Analysis Meeting that will be held on November 9-11, 2018, on the campus of Virginia Polytechnic and State University in Blacksburg, VA. Additional information about this meeting can be found at the website:  http://www.math.vt.edu/MAAM/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific program of this conference is on the interactions of geometric measure theory, geometric functional analysis, harmonic analysis, operator algebras, probability theory and PDE. The meeting offers a strong program that includes plenary lectures by leading experts, short talks by early career mathematicians, poster sessions, and a career development panel. The conference activities are aimed at broadening participation in several of the most active areas of analysis. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Mid-Atlantic Analysis Meeting, held at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg VA, successfully brought together nearly 60 participants from early career analysts to established researchers in analysis. More than 50% of participants were early career and over 70% were from the greater mid-Atlantic region.

The organizers placed an emphasis on inviting a diverse set of plenary speakers, featuring both traditionally under-represented groups in mathematics as well as various career stages.&nbsp;The plenary speakers were Philip Gressman (University of Pennsylvania), Alex Iosevich (University of Rochester), Galyna Livshyts (Georgia Institute of Technology), Anna Mazzucato (Pennsylvania State University), Malabika Pramanik (University of British Columbia) and Anna Skripka (University of New Mexico). A highlight for many young career participants was the career panel, which provided professional development through the opportunity to ask questions and hear others&rsquo; experiences and advice.
