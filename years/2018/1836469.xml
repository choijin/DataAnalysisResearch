<AbstractNarration>This grant provides international travel support for approximately sixteen U.S. based graduate student participants to attend the 2018 International Conference on Data Mining, to be held in Singapore, November 17-20, 2018. ICDM is the world's premier research conference in data mining. It provides an international forum for presentation of original research results, as well as exchange and dissemination of innovative and practical development experiences. The total number of ICDM participants in the past has been in excess of 500, with a majority of the participants from the U.S., then Europe and Asia. Besides the technical program, ICDM 2018 features workshops, tutorials, panels, demos, data challenge competition, and a Ph.D. forum. The conference recognizes the importance of recruiting and engaging students in data mining research in early stage of their graduate study. The Ph.D. forum is designed to provide an interactive environment in which Ph.D. students can meet, exchange their ideas and experiences both with peers and with senior researchers from the data mining community in an international scope. The supported students will advance their skills and knowledge, learn about the latest research, and develop their research networks in data mining. A strong representation of U.S. researchers at the conference is useful in maintaining U.S. competitiveness in this important area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ICDM conference series promotes novel, high-quality research findings, and innovative solutions to challenging data mining problems, and seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in data mining. The conference covers all aspects of data mining, including algorithms, software, systems, and applications. ICDM draws researchers, application developers, and practitioners from a wide range of data mining related areas such as statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, databases, data warehousing, data visualization, knowledge-based systems, and high-performance computing. The conference proceedings are published by IEEE. The recipients of the NSF travel support will be listed at the ICDM 2018 conference website, together with additional ICDM 2018 information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
