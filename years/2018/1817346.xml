<AbstractNarration>Advances in wireless communication technologies have enabled communications among vehicles, and between vehicles and the associated infrastructure. These technologies can be significantly leveraged to enhance the safety and performance of current roadway transportation systems. This study seeks to understand how traffic information spreads among vehicles and between vehicles and the roadside infrastructure, and how that data can be efficiently collected and used to develop real-time traffic management strategies, so as to improve safety, mobility, and sustainability. Further, through the education programs at Illinois Institute of Technology and Purdue University, this study will aid the development of new skills for the workforce that can leverage these emerging technologies for innovative applications, and broaden research and educational opportunities for under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study seeks to develop real-time coordinated traffic management strategies built upon dynamic information propagation and aggregation in connected vehicle systems. To achieve this goal, it investigates three interrelated research challenges: (i) information propagation dynamics, (ii) distributed information aggregation, and (iii) coordinated real-time traffic management. These methods bridge advanced scientific knowledge in computer science, transportation science, and operations research. Further, they adapt well-known and/or emerging concepts in traffic flow theory, network modeling, wireless communication, optimization theory, stochastic modeling, and algorithm design. The novelty of this research is highlighted through the holistic consideration of the unique features of a connected vehicle system: a distributed system with dynamic information propagating therein. At a fundamental level, the study outcomes will contribute to scientific knowledge and technologies for connected vehicle systems in the following aspects: (i) a better understanding of the interactions between information dynamics and traffic flow dynamics; (ii) the opening of a new research venue related to distributed information processing methods; and (iii) the understanding of real-time traffic management through the coordination of individual vehicle knowledge and centralized traffic control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

To achieve this, we address the research challenges in a rigorous and analytical fashion so that CVSTM can be successfully implemented and operated. The research goals are achieved through the following research objectives.</p> <p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Derive analytical formulations to characterize traffic information propagation dynamics built upon traffic flow dynamics (e.g. cell transmission models) as well as comprehensive wireless communication constraints; provide a better understanding of time delay and network coverage of dynamic information propagation in CVS.</p> <p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop distributed information aggregation/fusion mechanisms incorporating traffic flow and information propagation dynamics, unique characteristics of transportation events and wireless communication constraints in CVS; enable correct, current, and accurate traffic information to disseminate efficiently, accurately and securely.</p> <p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop in vehicle traffic knowledge tracking capability and coordinated real time traffic management strategies under CVS; establish coordination between central traffic control objectives and individual vehicles' routing decisions so that system-level goals related to traffic mobility, sustainability and information propagation can be achieved.</p> <p>The project generated 13+ journal papers, many conference papers and presentations for scholars, professontionals, graduate, undergraduate and K-12 students; partially supported 3 Ph.D. and 2 master students. The important findings are highlighted below.</p> <p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developed approximation formulations to measure the interference of V2V communication on road segments and at traffic intersections. We found that both road/intersection geometric features (i.e., the size, the angle and the number of the branches at an intersection and the number of lanes, the capacity on a road) and traffic congestion levels significantly influence the levels of interference, which further affects the information connectivity and propagation via V2V. Figure 1 shows one of the results.</p> <p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developed mathematical formulations to estimate the information propagation delay via V2V on a road segment. The numerical experiments based on NGSIM data illustrate that our analytical formulations are able to precisely estimate the time delay of information propagation on a one-way or two-way road segment under various traffic conditions; the connectivity and delay of V2V communication network is significantly affected by the traffic congestion levels on a road segment.</p> <p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Built upon our results in items 1) and (2), we established a mathematical simulation model named as IT-CTM to track information spreading on a road segment, integrating existing cell transmission model (CTM) to capture temporal-spatial traffic flow dynamics. Numerical experiments based on simulation and field data indicate that the IT-CTM can accurately track the dynamical movements and coverage of information wave as a single or multiple piece(s) of information propagating via V2V on a one-way or two-way road segment. Figure 2 shows one of the results.</p> <p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Built upon our results in items 1)-3), we further developed a network-wide mathematical simulation model named as INFM-CTM to capture network wide information dissemination via V2V. Mainly, the INFM-CTM is able to track information propagating on a road segment by IT-CTM, at intersection by INFM, and further capture information wave front dissemination over a roadway network by integrating IT-CTM and INFM. Our study found strong correlation between information spreading dynamics and traffic congestion evolution. This strong correlation recommends using information coverage to sense network-wide traffic congestion.&nbsp; Figures 3 and 4 show some of the results.</p> <p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developed a shock wave analysis based deep learning approach to predict the occurrence of public events in real time, according to their impacts on nearby traffic. The experiments based on field data demonstrated that our approach presents satisfactory prediction performance under the conditions with or without a traffic accidence interference. This approach will help individual travelers to make smart trip plans and avoid traffic congestions. Moreover, it promotes smart city development by providing a strong capability to monitor transportation system and conduct real-time traffic management intelligently. Figure 5 shows one of the results.</p> <p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investigated innovative strategies to perturb information provision in either scope (i.e. a local information provision strategy) or in accuracy (biased information provision), given travelers make selfish route choices. Both the theoretical analysis and the simulation results indicate that our local (or biased) information provision strategy outperforms global (or perfect) information provision strategy for improving system level network performance under medium or high network traffic loads. The merits are more significant as the penetration of smart vehicles increases over the network. Figure 6 shows the some results regarding biased information provision. It is noticed that small ratio of information perturbation is preferred.</p> <p>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project also investigated the protocol to protect privacy of individual vehicles when they opt in the V2V communication. One of our work designs a privacy-preserving protocol for an aggregator to compute corrected aggregated statistics over users' data that can both preserve user's privacy and verify the semantic validity of the data. We evaluated our protocol on real-world dataset and demonstrated the efficiency of our protocol.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/04/2019<br>      Modified by: Lili&nbsp;Du</p> </div>
