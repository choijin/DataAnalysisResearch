<AbstractNarration>This grant partially supports the participation of students from US institutions in the Doctoral Consortium at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2018 in Salt Lake City, UT. CVPR is the premier annual conference in computer vision with over 5000 senior, junior and student participants from all the world. The broader impacts of this project include supporting the career development of some of the brightest junior researchers in computer vision, contributing to the research community in general by drawing attention to an important aspect of graduate student development, potentially increasing the number of active researchers and educators in STEM, and ensuring that the computer vision community, through its recent graduates, makes fast advances in solving problems that will benefit society as a whole. The Doctoral Consortium aims to have representation from a diverse group of participants in terms of gender, ethnic background, academic institution, and geographic location. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF support covers some of the costs for 19 selected US-based graduate students to attend the Doctoral Consortium and CVPR conference. The Doctoral Consortium is to highlight the work of senior PhD students who are within six months of receiving their degrees (including recent graduates), and to give these students an opportunity to discuss their research and career options with faculty and researchers who have relevant expertise and experience. The opportunity to receive advice on their research work and career plans from experts from different institutions, and with potentially different perspectives, is often not available internally at one's own institution. Participants and recipients of travel support are selected by the 2018 CVPR Doctoral Consortium co-chairs. Travel awards partially cover any admissible conference-related costs such as registration, airfare, lodging, and board. This year's Doctoral Consortium features a poster session, one-on-one mentoring, and panel discussion. The last of these components was introduced in last two year's event and was well received.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
