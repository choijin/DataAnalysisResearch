<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is based on a new material that has the capability to reduce skin morbidity in amputees. Skin morbidity is an especially critical concern for patients with decreased wound healing capability because of vascular diseases such as diabetes and endovascular disease. Most current commercially available wound liners intended to avoid decreased wound healing have additions or modifications to base materials that target skin health. These include medicated coatings, cooling systems, and vacuum attachments. However, they do not correct the root of the problem - they aim to treat the secondary problems caused by those materials: heat, sweat, pistoning, and potential of microbial growth. Thus, more preventative technologies are called for than those that will only treat already developed skin wear or infection. This project's technology will not only transform the prosthetic liner industry, but also offer a new approach for other situations that might lead to skin infection issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project combines multiple materials with favorable properties into a single polymeric system that retains a liner's mechanical robustness while wicking away heat and sweat from limb-prosthesis interfaces.  While similar polymeric structures have been used as membranes as well as drug delivery systems, they could be incorporated to the liner materials to improve the liner functioning. This project produces a breathable sleeve with minimal skin irritation, essential for amputees. The in situ production of these liners enables prosthetist and physicians to customize the shape of liners in real time to best meet the need of individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This opportunity allowed us to explore the market in which our technology could thrive, and educated our team on how to approach business practices such as customer discovery, market research, and market validation. Through this program, we were able to get out of the building and interview over 100 individuals across the country related to the prosthetic field, who gave us their expert opinions on the issues within their field related to our technology. From this experience we determined that our technology is a very desirable material that can be integrated into prosthetics and other medical devices. However, from our market research, we learned that starting a business solely with prosthetics would not be economically viable for a startup. We instead pivoted towards licensing options with existing companies. This program helped us validate and refute our preconceptions about our product that would have been extremely problematic for our team if we had decided to start a company with this material outright. Our previous belief was that we would sell directly our liner to hospitals, doctors, and physical therapists, but rather we discovered that we would need to market our product to prosthetists and the amputees themselves. From I-Corps instructors, we also learned how to map out the distribution flow of a product within a market?s ecosystem, and how influencers can shape these paths. Without I-Corps mentors we would still be in the dark about the business aspect of taking intellectual property to market. We also spent a portion of the grant for further developing our material to the minimal viable product stage. The business canvas model at the end of I-Corps program is shown in Fig. 1.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/02/2019<br>      Modified by: Reza&nbsp;Foudazi</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1838509/1838509_10550966_1572713957465_CanvasBusinessModel7_11-8_24_rev--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1838509/1838509_10550966_1572713957465_CanvasBusinessModel7_11-8_24_rev--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1838509/1838509_10550966_1572713957465_CanvasBusinessModel7_11-8_24_rev--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Final business canvas model</div> <div class="imageCredit">Authors</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Reza&nbsp;Foudazi</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig. 1</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
