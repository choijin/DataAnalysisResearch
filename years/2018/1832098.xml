<AbstractNarration>Professor Peter Chen's research team at Spelman College is developing a new high resolution spectroscopic technique to study molecules in gaseous mixtures in real time.  The new spectroscopic method Professor Chen works on monitors very small signal shifts caused by the change in a gas mixture.  It could be useful in many different areas, such as studying combustion systems, materials synthesis processes, and catalysis.  The resulting information could be used to discover and identify new species produced during chemical reactions and provide information needed to understand reaction mechanisms.  Consequently, it can lead to improved ways to reduce pollution, improve efficiency, and lower costs for manufacturing, automobile transportation, energy production, etc.  Professor Chen works closely with a group of undergraduate students at Spelman College and prepares them for graduate studies in the STEM fields.  He in particular encourages African American women students in research by providing them with a stimulating, cutting-edge undergraduate research experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technique that is being developed is based upon a new high resolution form of coherent multidimensional spectroscopy that uses rovibrational resonances and nonparametric four wave mixing processes. The shift from electronic enhancements to vibrational enhancements makes it easier to detect all species present in the sample.  Advantages for using new nonparametric techniques are explored.  New methods are also being developed that use the resulting multidimensional patterns to distinguish among signals from different species while also providing information on their structures.  Professor Chen has established a strong record of recruiting and involving undergraduate students, many from underrepresented minority groups, on his project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
