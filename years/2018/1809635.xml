<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the 13th Brauer Group Meeting which will be held Monday - Friday, June 18 - 22, 2018 at the Mountain Campus of Colorado State University. The purpose of the meeting is to gather mathematicians whose research focuses on the Brauer Group and related areas. The conference will include talks given by both senior and junior researchers as well as time and space for collaboration. The organizers will do their best to ensure that the conference participants represent a diverse spectrum from across the mathematics community. Funds for this meeting will be used to pay for conference facilities and travel for junior participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brauer Group is a "group" in the mathematical sense and researchers from many areas of mathematics, including algebra, number theory, algebraic geometry and topology have related interests in understanding the objects that this group parametrizes.  Low dimensional geometers study the existence of Brauer classes on components of so-called character varieties and their ramification patterns to discern attributes of knot complements. Classical algebraists study the Brauer group in its role as a directory of division algebras over a field. There are many open and difficult questions in this classic view of the Brauer Group; are all division algebras of prime degree cyclic? Do there exist non-crossed product division algebras of prime exponent? Is the n-torsion subgroup generated by the classes of cyclic algebras of degree dividing n? Algebraic geometers study the Brauer group as an important invariant of a scheme arising from Ã©tale cohomology. This point of view goes back to the 1960's and Grothendieck, who suggested problems that are still actively being investigated. The primary goal of the 13th Brauer Group Meeting is to bring these perspectives together so that colleagues may share insights on problems of interest involving the Brauer group in its many forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The study of the Brauer group is a subject that has continued to broaden and deepen over the years, and the Brauer group conferences has reflected an increasingly mathematically diverse group of researchers together. The major goal of the project, was to hold a conference on the Brauer group June 18-22, 2018 at the Pingree Park campus of Colorado State University.   Some of the areas represented this year were division algebras, Galois theory and differential Galois theory, quadratic forms, noncommutative geometry, K-theory and algebraic topology, and arithmetic and algebraic geometry including algebraic cycles, and rational points.   The conference featured formal talks to be given by senior level researchers as well as by young researchers, including graduate students, post-docs and young faculty, and in addition provided informal settings outside of talks in which participants could collaborate on new ideas. The Brauer group conferences have a strong tradition of inclusiveness to younger researchers, and a commitment towards making an environment which is supportive of women as well as of researchers with families.   The conference this year was highly successful, featuring a high proportion of younger participants (graduate students and postdoctoral researchers), as well as some senior faculty. The group was enthusiastic and the participants made many valuable connections to other researchers and peers. The structure of the conference left the mornings open for study or collaboration and this was extremely successful.  The conference facility was nearly always filled, from early morning to late at night, with participants making new collaborations or working on established ones.
