<AbstractNarration>This award funds participation of researchers in a 2-day workshop to be held in Washington, D.C. entitled "Bridging the Gap: An NSF Workshop on Conversational Agents and Human-Robot Interaction". Recent technical advances have led to increased development and adoption of robots and embodied conversational agents in a variety of domains and contexts. As these agents and robots become increasingly ubiquitous in everyday life, it will become essential for researchers and designers of both robots and agents to understand the common challenges and opportunities for collaboration between humans and nonhuman agents. This award funds the attendance of researchers in the fields of embodied conversational agents and human-robot interaction for a workshop to lay the groundwork for a shared research agenda across both fields.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The workshop involves keynote speakers commenting on the state of each field with panelists from the other, breakout sessions for discussion of crosscutting themes of common interest, and the development of a shared research agenda to identify current grand challenges and opportunities for productive collaboration between the fields of embodied conversational agents and human-robot interaction. The broad themes discussed include the challenges of embodiment (physical or virtual), coordination in mixed human-agent teams, social and affective dynamics of human-agent collaboration, control systems and learning, and the ethical implications of human-agent collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Imagine a world where social robots and embodied conversational agent characters are pervasive in society, helping humans achieve a variety of their goals including learning, integrating in society despite physical, mental, and cultural differences, and enhancing work and play. Your personal robot learns how you like to interact and adapts to help you. It can virtually go with you when you travel and communicate with you in a variety of physical and virtual environments, taking on new forms as needed to best help you.

Many such capabilities have already been developed that can play an essential role in accomplishing this vision. There is also much still to achieve, and this effort is not without risks to individuals and society. Different research communities have taken on different aspects of this work, and the time is ripe to bring them closer together, share methodologies and resources, and forge a new synergistic path forward to create technologies that substantially benefit society.    To date, the social robot and embodied conversational agent research communities have largely been comprised of separate groups of people, who are funded by separate research programs, go to different conferences, and publish in different venues. Bringing these communities together is a major opportunity for both fields to leverage the strengths of each community, learn from the successes and failures in each community, and even take on new research questions and applications that could only be enabled by creating hybrid agent technologies. Just a few of the many strengths to draw from include character design, verbal and nonverbal expressiveness in ECAs, and rich dialogue as well as capabilities of SRs in recognizing, maintaining awareness of, and interacting with the physical environment. By bringing these communities together, there are opportunities to share knowledge, tools, and research methods for moving toward the many shared goals that cut across both fields (e.g., richer and more dynamic human engagement).   This was the goal of this workshop, which lasted 2 days, and brought together 25 rhigh-visibility successful esearchers from the two fields (or who work in both) from around the world. The workshop was successful in laying out a number of research goals that had not been identified before across these two communities, and in beginning to explore the paths that would need to be taken in order for these research goals to be reached. The research goals identified were: 1. Identity projection and instantiation - which form to use when 2. Creating and evaluating hybrid systems that include both forms 3. Designing agent technologies for situated interaction in the real world 4. Operationalizing ethics to guide research 5. Virtual centers for shareable data/methodology to maximize success  In sum, the workshop laid out a road map for the future of research in this area, to ensure that future agents are designed ethically, with the forms that best suit the task, in the context of the real world, and that the methods and data collected from this research is shared among researchers for success.
