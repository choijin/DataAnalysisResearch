<AbstractNarration>To succeed and prosper in a global economy and interconnected world, university graduates need international knowledge, intercultural communication skills, and global perspectives. However, students who are members of underrepresented groups are often the least likely to have an international research experience. This award provides support for a two-day workshop that is will bring together Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) experts who are involved in providing underrepresented minority students with international research experiences. At the workshop these experts will identify the main barriers to underrepresented group participation in international research, develop a set of best practices for increasing inclusion, explore methods for project evaluation, and discuss the types of institutional support needed to establish, maintain and promote such experiences to a more diverse set of American undergraduate students. This workshop aims to assemble a network of experts to explore the dynamics of international engagement by minority students, distill their findings into a report, and disseminate effective practices to various groups, including higher education institutions, professional societies, NGOs, and the private sector, that can broaden participation and enable a more diverse set of undergraduate students to undertake research abroad opportunities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-day workshop will bring together a set of STEM faculty that have been successful in developing sustainable research abroad programs with a focus on recruiting underrepresented undergraduate students. The workshop will explore how to increase the number of URMs undertaking international STEM research opportunities, recognizing the complexity of this effort.  A more diverse set of U.S. students doing international research will result when we successfully navigate complex interactions between, for example, the educational and cultural perspectives of different U.S. minority groups, the ways that different scientific disciplines engage internationally, the variation in support structures for diversity and international engagement across different educational institutions, and the cultural and scientific landscapes of the many countries where the students might conduct research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The materials produced by the workshop will be broadly disseminated through various means such as academic networks, professional societies, and networks and PI meetings of various NSF programs focused on diversity and international research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop has the potential to deliver many positive outcomes, including 1) increased awareness of the national need both for U.S. STEM students to be globally engaged, and for greater diversity in that population of students; 2) increased opportunities for URM students to participate in research abroad; 3) enhanced ability both of minority-serving institutions to participate in STEM research abroad programs, as well as of majority institutions to diversify the range of students who participate in STEM research abroad; and 4) strengthened relationships among a broad range of organizations that can help implement such programs, e.g., scientific societies, educational organizations, funding agencies, and international counterpart organizations of all of these groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The workshop participants developed multiple recommendations that can help increase and enhance URM participation in STEM research abroad. Their suggestions were grouped in the next four sets of recommendations:  Institutional Recommendations - Top Administration Perspectives -  Institutional Commitment - Internationalization plans should be part of the institutional strategic plan. Commitment to education abroad should be reflected in the institution’s mission and vision statements.  Education abroad should be central to the University’s vision of excellence. An international enrollment plan and an international recruitment strategy need to be developed to reflect international education as an institutional priority. Proper staffing of the Office of International Programs is a critical factor in the internationalization process to provide the best support and services to faculty and students. Universities should develop truly competitive and efficient International travel policies and improve communication between the Office of International Programs and the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs to simplify the travel approval process for faculty and students. Campus-wide infrastructure: Invest in campus-wide strong infrastructure to support international programs and services. Embolden and promote integration of global perspectives across the length and breadth of the curriculum. The institution should recognize global education as one of the many available High Impact Practices that allows students to excel academically and personally. Facilitat signing of Memorandums of Understanding and Cooperative Agreements with partner institutions. The institution should have in place a strong incentive infrastructure to encourage faculty to participate and develop research abroad programs (travel funds, seed funds, student support, etc.) Institutions should recognize faculty participation in education abroad programs and implement flexible requirements for their participating faculty members in these programs, especially for those working towards tenure and promotion. Institutions should make the most benefit from foreign born faculty to provide authentic orientation to students going to those countries of origin of the faculty.   Recommendations - Faculty Perspectives -  Eliminate barriers- Create incentives and eliminate barriers for faculty to incorporate international research activities in their teaching, research, and service assignments. Rebalance faculty workload allocations - Administrators (Deans, chairs) should allocate value and specific time for research abroad activities and balance the workload of those professors engaged in these activities. Establish a reward system &ndash; promote &amp; incentivize faculty participation in research abroad and exchange programs. Institutionalize pre-travel logistics and planning - Organize pre-trip orientation meetings to inform students of anticipated trip itineraries; passport, visa, insurance and immunization requirements, as well as curricular requirements and costs.  Reward Internationalization in Tenure &amp; Promotion - Assign appropriate value, in appointment, tenure and promotion dossiers, to internationally oriented work (consider time dedicated to study &amp; research abroad towards tenure and promotion and include these activities in the tenure portfolio) Share success stories &ndash; Tell others about your experience to ignite interest in other faculty members to participate and expand research &amp; study abroad opportunities to students. Find the right partners abroad - Visit potential partners abroad well in advance, get to know them and seek synergy, establish collaborations with local industry and research centers. Measure impacts - Develop a mechanism to measure impact (e.g., a journal focused on STEM research abroad, a center which can collect and disseminate information related to STEM research abroad) and share best practices.   Recommendations - Students Perspectives -  Recommendations from STUDENTS to Faculty  Study &amp; Research abroad programs can be introduced early as part of the students’ orientation and advising process - Make study &amp; research abroad programs part of the students’ advising and orientation processes to provide students with guidance on choosing the best program abroad that will help them enhance their academic careers. Past program participants are the best ambassadors - Allow returning students to talk to other students to describe the hard and soft skills learned in their research abroad experience. Provide resources such as resume samples - Provide resume samples (i.e. from past participants) on how to highlight international experiences in resumes, cover letters and job/graduate school interviews.   Capture program impact through surveys - Include surveys that allow students to not only provide hard data but also to self-reflect and write about the skills learned in research abroad.    Benefits of Study &amp; Research Abroad as seen by the students:  Gaining important global competencies such as language, cross-cultural communications, empathy, adaptability, team-working abilities, leadership and problem solving skills. Increasing the likelihood of exploring graduate school study possibilities. Gaining exposure to interdisciplinary research and global perspectives. Working with top faculty and professionals from around the world.   Industry &amp; NGOs’ Input to Universities and Faculty  There is a need to expand the number of opportunities from federal agencies to support STEM related research abroad. Reach out to alumni and corporate partners to support international research. Institutions should improve communication with the industry/private sector to underscore the skills that students gain while abroad and will ultimately impact the workforce.
