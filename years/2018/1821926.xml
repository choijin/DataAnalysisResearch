<AbstractNarration>Data provenance is the ability to track data history including things such as where the data resided, who handled it, and what systems stored, forwarded and processed it. This research builds on the architecture of the digital currency Bitcoin. It develops distributed data ledgers - similar to bookkeeping ledgers - that maintain data history so it can't be manipulated by hackers trying to hide their activities. Data consistency guarantees  that everyone gets the right answers about where, who, and what regardless of which ledger is read.  This software advances the security of computing systems by making data accountable, especially for online commerce and big data ("the cloud'').  It secures forensic information taken from compromised computers  for further analysis. It validates whether privacy requirements are being met for medical records.  The key outcome is a software prototype that implements the complete system and illustrates the ability to store, maintain, and update provenance information for real data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A data provenance framework will be designed, prototyped, evaluated and then delivered as an Application Programmer Interface, software library, and distributed service. This work will produce a reusable distributed service architecture achieving scalability by using distributed services that maintain ledger information. The system leverages Bitcoin cryptocurrency by building on Bitcoin's block-chain architecture to maintain provenance metadata securely. It leverages existing tools for provenance data exploration and visualization.  Digital signatures from both the server/system as well as the user creates dual information about possession, while distributed ledgers remove control and maintenance of metadata from the user who creates it. The prototype enables research into long-term provenance creation, maintenance, and utilization for workflows in the area of cybersecurity as well  studies of how to integrate and secure provenance into existing file systems and network services.  Opt-in and passive (involuntary) provenance systems will be enabled using the API, library, and distributed ledgers prototyped, enabling data provenance for systems where needed, notably high assurance cloud computing and scientific workflow systems. The tool can be used  to enable reproducibility of published results from archived data and artifacts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Clemson University, Auburn University, and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC) set out to create an alternative to Bitcoin that would be suitable for the creation of secure data provenance without the overheads of Bitcoin involving the expensive proof of work.  The PI for this effort at Clemson was Dr. Richard Brooks; Dr. Anthony Skjellum started as the co-PI at Auburn, and latera transitioned to UTC.   This CICI grant was the first or among the first NSF-funded projects related to blockchains.  While blockchains have become a household name in the past years and are overhyped for many applications, our work remained grounded on provable, practical, and valid applications of blockchains for secure provenance.  During this five-year plus journey, significant results regarding blockchains for data provenance were developed, with a number of publications, graduate MS theses, and PhD dissertations.  Both practical results (e.g., working blockchain software), and theoretical results (taxonomies and methodologies for determining blockchain security under threat) were developed. Because of the totality of the work, the state of understanding on low-cost blockchains for data provenance has been significantly advanced including theoretical results.  The Scrybe blockchain was designed, prototyped, tested, and revised as part of this effort. Scrybe is a living, continuing protocol stored on Github that PIs Brooks and Skjellum expect to revise further in future.  Interesting related and spin-off concepts have been derived. Recently, for instance, application of the concepts for consensus for blockchains designed by one of our students, Amani Altarawneh, has been applied to fault tolerance in High Performance Computing.   Work to extend the robustness of blockchains under attack continues both at Clemson and UTC as on-going R&amp;D in this space.  Other work devised primarily at UTC includes work on 1) crypto accumulators, to compare and contrast with blockchains, which involves mutable data, vs. blockchains which emphasize immutable data; 2) A solution for the X.509 certificate revocation problem has been devised that uses blockchains and resolves many concerns related to issues with detecting unrevoked certificaties; certificates used to make secure websites have been a growing concern in cyber crime, since HTTPS sites tends to be trusted by browser users; 3) lossless cascade approaches to cuckoo filters have been created for efficient data compression structures for use cases involving membership---suitable for blocklists in secure revocation; this work has shown the ability to use cuckoof filters more efficiently than cascading Bloom filters, and earlier, ubiquitous technology for compressing information on lists of data hashes; 4) significant applications and new uses of Scrybe for distributed system trust have been developed at UTC as well.  Our project was significant in its human resource development because of the diversity of the participating students, including nearly 50% women, who are often underrepresented in computer science and engineering R&amp;D. Our PhD graduates at Clemson and UTC have gone on to industry and academic appointments. Other students at UTC and Auburn are still completing their PhD work.
