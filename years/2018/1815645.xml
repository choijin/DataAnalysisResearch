<AbstractNarration>Part 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shining brighter than a trillion suns, quasars are the most luminous persistent&lt;br/&gt;sources in the universe. These cosmic powerhouses form when gas is funneled&lt;br/&gt;toward giant black holes at the centers of galaxies. Since quasars are thought&lt;br/&gt;to shape the growth of their galaxies, better understanding these sources is one&lt;br/&gt;of modern astronomy's major goals. This project makes new telescopic&lt;br/&gt;observations over several years to improve estimates of the most basic&lt;br/&gt;properties of quasars, enhancing a wide range of astronomical studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some 350 hours of infrared observations of 400 distant quasars with the&lt;br/&gt;Gemini-North telescope in Hawaii will produce the best and largest data set of&lt;br/&gt;its kind. Studying the infrared light will lead to better estimates of the&lt;br/&gt;masses of the quasars' black holes, their fueling rates, and their distances&lt;br/&gt;from Earth. These results will, in turn, help to develop improved equations for&lt;br/&gt;these properties in the larger quasar population. Comparison with nearby quasars&lt;br/&gt;will also show how these sources change over time, indicating how the galaxies&lt;br/&gt;surrounding such quasars change as well. This project represents a stepping&lt;br/&gt;stone in understanding quasars which, in turn, will enable more in-depth projects&lt;br/&gt;at the forefront of modern astronomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quasars are the most powerful objects in the universe. They greatly outshine all&lt;br/&gt;the stars in the galaxies in which they reside. They consist of growing black&lt;br/&gt;holes, millions to billions of times more massive than the sun. Better&lt;br/&gt;understanding these most energetic of objects, their properties, their effects&lt;br/&gt;on the galaxies that surround them, and how they grow over time are important&lt;br/&gt;questions in modern astronomy. This project will use one of the world's largest&lt;br/&gt;telescopes to better understand some of the most powerful and distant quasars in&lt;br/&gt;order to help answer these questions. Additional related areas at the forefront&lt;br/&gt;of modern astronomy will benefit as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this project is to substantially improve how we measure the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental properties of distant quasars. These properties include the black&lt;br/&gt;hole mass, fueling rate, and distance. Another goal is to see how these&lt;br/&gt;properties have changed over time. To achieve these goals, the investigators&lt;br/&gt;will use the Gemini-North telescope in Hawaii to observe the infrared light from&lt;br/&gt;more than 400 distant quasars, thereby creating the largest and best such data&lt;br/&gt;set to date. This effort will take 350 hours of telescope time over several&lt;br/&gt;years. Analysis of certain features in the light of these sources will provide&lt;br/&gt;the best measurements yet of key quasar properties. The results of this project&lt;br/&gt;will yield new calibrations for quasars in general, and enable a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;follow-up studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
