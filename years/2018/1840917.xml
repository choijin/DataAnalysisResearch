<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical paragraph:&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project presents an opportunity to develop and test an educational platform designed to improve motivation levels in students with respect to the STEM disciplines, especially Mathematics. The core activity of the proposed platform consists of live academic competition, students answering questions in a game-based, online arena. The platform will, in essence, borrow the features and structures found in popular athletic sports, from points, scoreboards and rankings to leagues, tournaments and championships, and reproduce them online so that students can compete academically in the classroom just like they compete athletically on the sports field, with similar performance gains and improvements to peer dynamics expected to follow. Leveraging classic game mechanics in an exciting online format, the platform has the potential to motivate students across the skill and demographic spectrums where offline academic competitions have historically failed. In past attempts to improve learning outcomes and close the achievement gap, the U.S. has focused on inputs, e.g., class-size, book counts, etc., and more recently, outputs, e.g., standardized test scores. This project offers the chance to approach learning improvement from a new angle or perspective. By focusing directly on student motivation with a structure only recently made possible by the advent of the internet age, this project leverages the power of competition in an effort to advance the stated NSF missions of developing a globally competitive STEM workforce and increasing economic competitiveness in the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical paragraph:&lt;br/&gt;This project entails the development of a web and mobile platform with the ability to host and engage every student across the U.S. in robust, online competition activity. As such, the proposed activity is expansive in its breadth and scope and therefore presents an immense challenge, both from a technical and a design perspective. In the U.S., the vast majority of students are educated in a school district setting. Therefore, the platform must be designed in such a way as to fit neatly within the parameters of school district scheduling, processes and structures. It must be comprehensive in its design, seamlessly blending together the experiences of very different users. Three distinct roles are imagined: an administrator of the platform will have the ability to create leagues, tournaments, and championships, team-based and individual-based, for students across the school district/network; a teacher on the platform will be able to arrange matches for a team/class of students by dividing them into multiple teams that play against each other or challenging another team in the same school district/network to a match; a student on the platform will be able to arrange individual-based matches with other students in the same school district/network or play against a personal best avatar. Bringing all such activity together into a single platform, one that can be integrated with existing online education platforms and replicated from school district to school district across the U.S., satisfies NSF?s objective of supporting projects of high technical risk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive online academic competition platform based on the most popular features and structures of professional sports, primarily intended for math but adaptable to other subjects, one that will motivate students in their learning efforts and drive subsequent performance gains unlike any other tool on the market. The platform will facilitate competition activity between and within schools of the same school district/network, similar to the athletic sports formats already in place throughout K-12 education. It will be accessible by three main customer users. An administrator of the platform will have the ability to create leagues, tournaments, and championships for students across the school district/network. These events might be team-based, individual-based or collaboration-based. A teacher on the platform will be able to arrange matches for a team/class of students by dividing them into multiple teams that play against each other or challenging another team in the same school district/network to a match. A student on the platform will be able arrange individual-based matches with other students in the same school district/network or play against a personal best avatar. All matches on the platform will be fueled by MC and fill-in-the-blank test item content and all will be aided by an algorithm that helps assure competitors are evenly matched. The core activity of the main user, the student, is answering those questions in a thrilling Match Arena which features real time score, pace-setter, personal best marker, and other motivating characteristics. The key design principle is to maximize match-scheduling flexibility and simplicity, allowing both teachers and students to arrange matches for any convenient time to them, with minimal effort required.</p> <p>During Phase I, the technical foundation for this platform was developed. The Tech Stack - those technology services used to build and run the proposed platform - has been completed. All the back end processes have been put into place to run the various competition formats (e.g., team-based) and structures (e.g., scrimmage series). Accounts for the three main users have been created, including a separate account for the Superadministrator. The only two areas where the back end engineering has not commenced and neared completion are the Results pages and the Match Arena. These are the two main tasks left to Phase II as well as much of the front end design/engineering for the various pages of each user account type. The firm has progressed far enough in Phase I to guarantee that the proposed platform, briefly delineated here, will be complete by the end of Phase II. The taxpayers of the United States will have a completed product in exchange for the tax dollars assigned. That product will generate sales in the market and will, therefore, ultimately result in the return of those tax dollars to the federal government for other uses.&nbsp;</p> <p>Indeed, given the scale of activity that the platform can facilitate where almost every single U.S. K-12 student might potentially participate, and given that the platform will mirror the most successful game mechanics of all time, those found in sports, this proposal offers a remarkable, socially-conscious business opportunity.&nbsp;<span>If online academic competition is</span>&nbsp;objectively proved to enhance motivation and drive performance gains, and if, as a result, the proposed platform becomes the tool of first choice to engage student audiences throughout the U.S. education landscape, the resulting revenue stream would compare with the largest companies in ed tech. Beyond profit objectives, this concept can support the galvanizing purpose of narrowing the achievement gap. As to this, while genetics-based studies have failed to demonstrate that minority students possess less innate intellectual ability than whites, minorities continue to fare less well on achievement tests than their white counterparts. Although minority students consistently underperform in the academic arena, curiously, they consistently outperform in the athletic arena, especially in professional sports where they are disproportionately represented. Many reasons might explain this disparity, but if innate intelligence differences do not, perhaps game affinities do. One hypothesis would be that minority populations respond differently, more positively, to game-mechanics than whites. In education, this may translate to increased performance for minority students relative to their peers, thus, narrowing the achievement gap. Phase II funding will make testing this hypothesis possible. Thus, this product offers the government/taxpayer an opportunity not only to generate significant tax revenue, but also achieve a critical social good.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/23/2019<br>      Modified by: Timothy&nbsp;Kelley</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1840917/1840917_10588780_1577124919010_NSFMatchArenaforOutcomes--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1840917/1840917_10588780_1577124919010_NSFMatchArenaforOutcomes--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Match Arena"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1840917/1840917_10588780_1577124919010_NSFMatchArenaforOutcomes--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Match Arena"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This image represents the core experience of the student user.
