<AbstractNarration>This travel grant provides partial support for U.S. participation in the "Young Topologists Meeting 2018", held in Copenhagen, Denmark by Copenhagen University, July 9th-13th, 2018. The "Young Topologists Meeting" (YTM) is an annual European conference focused on the work of graduate students and early career researchers in topology, that brings in participants from all over the world. At the YTM, junior topologists present their work to a large international audience, and also attend mini-courses taught by senior topologists. The conference provides opportunities for the participants to meet new colleagues and mentors, and to form research collaborations. Its open and supportive atmosphere encourages early career mathematicians, including those from underrepresented groups, to pursue research careers in topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The YTM is an annual event, first started in 2007, which traditionally alternates between Copenhagen, Denmark and Lausanne, Switzerland (except in 2017 when it was held in Stockholm). The conference features parallel sessions of contributed talks by graduate students and early career researchers, covering a broad spectrum of topics in topology. In addition to these talks, there will be mini-courses by two senior topologists, discussing the connections between algebraic topology and other fields, and focusing on open problems and new directions. This year Michael Hill (UCLA, US) will give a course on equivariant stable homotopy theory and Kathryn Mann (Brown University, US) will give a course on foliated fiber bundles and their applications. The conference web page is available at http://www.math.ku.dk/english/research/conferences/2018/ytm2018.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
