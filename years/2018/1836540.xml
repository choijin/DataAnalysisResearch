<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Mengyan Shen at University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML) is testing the hypothesis that chain hydrocarbons are quantum mechanically synthesized on a cobalt/cobalt oxide surface from carbon dioxide, water, and light.  This reaction mimics photosynthesis and is important in reducing carbon dioxide and increasing the energy supply.  The goals of this research are to exploit the characteristics of an unusual isotope distribution that is completely different from conventional expectation.  The project provides great opportunities for training students including those underrepresented in sciences.  It also helps to develop a workforce on quantum computing.  Outreach activities involving K-12 students will also be part of the funded project.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;A cobalt oxide photo-catalyst, discovered in Professor Shen's lab at UML, is physically activated by sunlight and has been proven to directly convert carbon dioxide and water to long-chain hydrocarbons (C5 to C15). When a mixture of isotopic C-12 and C-13 carbon dioxide was used, a highly unusual isotope distribution was observed.  Particular objectives of this proposal are (1) To confirm the observation that pure C-12 hydrocarbons and pure C-13 hydrocarbons tend to form easily on some catalysts' surfaces, which cannot be explained with the current chemical theories, (2) To understand and create a predictive model for the mechanism of the formation of chain hydrocarbons based on experimental results using isotopic carbon dioxide and isotopic water.  It is hoped that this would explain the observation of pure C-13 and pure C-12 having the tendency to group together in forming chain hydrocarbons, and (3) To find controlling parameters with light wavelength, temperature, and pressures as well as study the influence of the catalyst surface structures on the quantum formation of hydrocarbons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) were converted into hydrocarbons, ranging from pentane (C5H12) to octadecane (C18H38), through an artificial photosynthesis reaction catalyzed by nanostructured Co/CoO.  The isotope effect of carbon is studied by conducting the 13C/12C competition experiments using an equal molar ratio of 13CO2 and 12CO2 as the reagents. Two anomalous isotope effects were found: 1) the dissociation of 12CO2 is easier than that of 13CO2 and 2) the same carbon isotope atoms have a relatively higher probability to bond together to form the hydrocarbon chain than  different ones do. Hot-electrons in the conduction band of CoO  quantum mechanically tunnel to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of adsorbed CO2 molecules, which explains the first carbon isotope effect. A quantum resonant tunneling model explains the second carbon isotope effect. Since the same carbon isotopes have the same energy levels, the probability of quantum tunneling of the electrons between the same carbon isotopes is higher than the probability of quantum tunneling of electrons between different carbon isotopes.
