<AbstractNarration>This grant provides support for 80 students to participate in the Twenty-Ninth Annual International Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) Symposium, An Additive Manufacturing Conference to be held August 13-15, 2018, in Austin, Texas.  The SFF Symposium is widely considered one of the premier academic conference on additive manufacturing (AM) related research in the world.  In 2017, it brought together 654 researchers from universities, national laboratories, and companies from 20 countries around the world, who together presented 473 technical presentations and posters during the 3-day event. Students will have the opportunity to engage in 3 days of technical sessions focused on the latest advances in AM applications, process development, materials, modeling, and design. All student awardees will be expected to present a paper and/or poster during the symposium and to attend all 3 days of the event. The funding opportunity will be announced broadly and early enough to provide ample time for students to apply. Awardees will be selected by committee and the awards will cover the cost of student registration.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By attending and presenting their work in the symposium, students will gain extensive knowledge and understanding of the state of cutting-edge research in AM.  They will also have the opportunity for professional development by delivering a technical presentation to a highly knowledgeable audience.  Furthermore, they will have the opportunity to network with other professional and student researchers in the AM field and thereby build their personal network of future collaborators and colleagues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported student participation in the Twenty-Ninth International Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) Symposium, an additive manufacturing conference.  The symposium took place August 13-15, 2018, in Austin, Texas at The University of Texas at Austin.      Funds offset student registrations which enabled students to attend and participate.  There were 289 students at the meeting, which represented approximately 40% of the entire meeting participation.  There were 87 NSF travel award winners selected from 132 applicants.      The meeting had 529 oral presentations and posters.  Of these, 200 papers were included in the 2888-page proceedings.  Authors had an option to have their papers peer reviewed prior to publication.  Eighteen additional conference manuscripts were published in special issues of JOM, Virtual and Physical Prototyping, and International Journal of Bioprinting.     Intellectual Merit  The Twenty-Ninth International Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium was attended by 683 national and international researchers. The Symposium was organized in a manner to allow the multidisciplinary nature of the additive manufacturing research to be presented coherently, with various sessions emphasizing computer interfacing and modeling, machine and process development, and materials and materials processing for additive manufacturing.  The three-day event was completely composed of individual oral presentations to accommodate the demand for this dissemination format.  The parallel sessions were split into twelve sessions to meet demand, and a poster session allowed researchers to present in this format.  We believe that documenting the changing state of additive manufacturing, as represented by the meeting proceedings, serves both the people presently involved in this fruitful technical area as well as the flux of new researchers and users entering the field.     Funds offset student registrations which enabled students to attend and participate.  There were 87 NSF travel award winners from 132 total applicants.  Of these, 81 students attended the full meeting and thus qualified for the award.  All of these students? registration fees were covered using the 2018 NSF conference grant (CMMI-1826959).      Information on the SFF Symposium was made available through the worldwide web at http://sffsymposium.engr.utexas.edu/archive.  The website includes on-line registration forms, hotel information, general information, and a database of all previous proceedings articles available free of charge to anyone.     Broader Impacts  In addition to the benefits of direct meeting participation, students were able to network with the international additive manufacturing research community.  Wider dissemination was accomplished through the proceedings.  A total of 200 papers were included in the proceedings volume with an additional 18 conference papers included in special issues of 3 journals.  Authors contributed either unreviewed or reviewed manuscripts to allow authors the option of presenting their work in a refereed format.     The SFF Symposium serves as a primary forum for networking and dissemination of information dealing with research issues in freeform fabrication.  According to Ian Campbell, senior editor of the Rapid Prototyping Journal, "The SFF Symposium is to be regarded as the foremost international conference for rapid prototyping research (RPJ, 2003)."  In a recent tally by additive manufacturing (AM) experts on the most significant milestones in the history of AM, excepting the invention of specific AM processes, the inauguration of the SFF Symposium ranks highest [1].  When asked which publications had greatest influence on the AM field, the Proceedings of the SFF Symposium tied with the only refereed archival journal dedicated solely to the AM field at the time, the British-based Rapid Prototyping Journal [1].  This same group ranked the SFF Symposium highest by over 50% to the next conference when asked what meeting contributed most to the development of the AM field [1]. The SFF Symposium Conference Proceedings are heavily cited in the archival literature, and it is anticipated that the 2015 Proceedings will be as well.     Additive Manufacturing is an extremely broad and interdisciplinary field, encompassing mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, aerospace engineering, biomedical engineering, computer science and engineering, biology, design, materials science and engineering, and manufacturing science.  The topics covered at the SFF symposium impact the automotive, aerospace, orthopedics, dentistry, gaming, surgical planning, implants, marine, architecture, furniture, and art industries, among others.  The 2018 conference served as a forum for this diverse interdisciplinary group of researchers to gather for the purpose of synergistic interaction and sharing of ideas and progress.     This conference serves as a meeting opportunity for researchers, a number of whom are involved to varying degrees in entrepreneurial activities.  The networking aspect of the conference is strong and includes students who are able to meet and discuss research with world-class leading experts in the field.     [1] Christopher L.
