<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for the OceanObs' 19 Conference in Honolulu, Hawaii, on September 16 - 20, 2019. OceanObs' 19 is the next in the series that started in 1999 and is held every 10 years. This conference will provide an important platform for the international ocean community to coordinate and exchange information and plan for future efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for the OceanObs' 19 Conference in Honolulu, Hawaii, on September 16 - 20, 2019. OceanObs' 19 is the next in the series that started in 1999 and is held every 10 years. The OceanObs' 99 conference in St. Raphael, France resulted in an internationally coordinated system for physical climate and ocean carbon observations. The OceanObs' 09 conference held in Venice, Italy expanded the range of communities working together to undertake more comprehensive and sustain ocean observations and led to the Framework for Ocean Observing. The OceanObs' 19 conference encompasses the potential to build on the success generated by the Framework for Ocean Observing and will seek to better connect observers with end user communities. The Framework for Ocean Observing is meant to guide the ocean observing community as a whole to establish an integrated and sustained global observing system. The conference program highlights seven vital societal benefit themes: Discovery, Ecosystem Health and Biodiversity, Climate Variability and Change, Water Food and Energy Security, Pollution and Human Health, Hazards and Maritime Safety, and Blue Economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The OceanObs’19 conference was held in Honolulu, Hawaii, on September 16 &ndash; 20, 2019.  UCAR Cooperative Programs for the Advance of Earth System Science (CPAESS) provides project leadership for the conference.  While the content of the workshop is designed by and for the scientists and user communities involved, UCAR’s CPAESS program contributes administrative, planning and logistical support, efficient on-line registration mechanisms, on-site support while the conference is in session, and travel management.  The main goal was to further develop effective strategies for a sustained, multidisciplinary, and integrated ocean observing system, and to better connect user communities and observers.  The conference engaged operational users, national and local authorities as well as researchers in both the public and private sectors in all aspects of ocean observing.  It was predicted that twelve hundred conference participants will connect with a wide range of user communities to improve data flows and governance arrangements.  This allows for international engagement to create closer interaction to improve governance arrangements, support observing networks, data flows and derived products and their use in ocean affairs.  The OceanObs'19 conference was a community-driven conference that brought people from all over the planet together to communicate the decadal progress of ocean observing networks and to chart innovative solutions to society's growning needs for ocean information in the coming decade. Teh OceanObs'19 conference obejectives strove to improved the governance of a global ocena observing system, included advacacy, funding, and alignment with the best practices and to designage reponsibility for producet definintion, including production and timely delivery at the appropriate scales (global, basin, regional, national) to server user needs.   Bringing together this extensive community resulted in multiple key outcomes including:    A Living Action Plan,    A RCN Workshop Report,    Community White Papers.
