<AbstractNarration>When a laser pulse is fired into a liquid crystal, causing an unstable region to grow from where the pulse makes contact, or when the stain of an ink blot spreads on paper, interfaces grow in the presence of a locally disordered environment. A central task of the rigorous theory of statistical mechanics is to analyze which features of physical systems are universal, shared by many models with apparently very different microscopic specifications. Understanding of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, which concerns many surfaces growing with local randomness, has been greatly advanced by many mathematicians and physicists over the last forty years. Often these advances have been aided by the use of integrable techniques, in which sometimes rather special models are analyzed via algebraic tools or exact formulas. The Principal Investigator will analyze certain important universality classes, including the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang class, by using probabilistic proof methods in unison with limited but crucial integrable inputs. The structure of certain random fractal  geometries arising in scaling limits of dynamics on random media will thus be explicated.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed probabilistic investigation of fractal geometries has three principal components. The first concerns anomalous transport in disordered random media. Namely, when a particle with a uniform tendency to move in a preferred direction does so in a milieu that is random and strongly disordered,  trapping is a vital phenomenon that interrupts and sometimes eliminates linear progress. The phenomenon will be elucidated by a detailed inquiry into biased motion on the infinite cluster of supercritical percolation in the integer lattice of dimensions at least two. The second direction concerns scaled last passage percolation. Rich aspects of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality will be explored by studying the scaled random geometry of extremal paths moving through random fields using probabilistic modes of proof such as resampling of random energy profiles and surgery on paths. The final principal component will address noise sensitivity and last passage percolation. The stability and sensitivity of last passage percolation paths under perturbation by noise of the random environment will be studied, strengthening the bridge between two key theories: Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality and discrete harmonic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
