<AbstractNarration>The manipulation of language and voice in constructing narratives is a well-established media practice. Linguistic choices affect the experience of the viewing audience and the sale of commercial media products.  Attention to language is especially crucial, commercially and politically, for transnational companies that wish to localize their media products for wider distribution. The research supported by this award asks how different agents involved in this process negotiate their choices and what this can tell us about political relationships that cannot be otherwise understood.  Successful localization requires collaboration between translators, voice actors, directors, sound engineers, and distributors, all of whom possess their own beliefs about language representation.  How do these professionals negotiate their different stances about language? What are the decision-making and interactional processes behind the scenes? And what do these decision-making processes reveal about the political contexts in which they take place? To answer these questions, University of California, Los Angeles anthropology doctoral candidate Spencer C. Chen, supervised by Dr. Paul V. Kroskrity, will conduct a close anthropological and linguistic investigation of the role of media translation in localizing imported cultural products. Attention to this highly-specialized industry provides a unique research opportunity to understand how creators construct media representations through language and voice, and the larger political and economic effects of those constructions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will be carried out in Taipei, Taiwan, one of the cultural production centers for Chinese arts and Mandarin media in the Greater China Region. This site is uniquely situated to provide a linguistic anthropological understanding of how sound translation professionals make ideological moves with language to navigate sociolinguistic boundaries, commercial markets, and geopolitical uncertainties. The researcher will conduct a focal-following mobile ethnography to closely track this process. He will record their behind-the-scenes discussions and collect more in-depth information through semi-structured interviews and sociolinguistic analysis of Mandarin-dubbed products. This research design will allow the researcher to document "outspoken" linguistic stereotypes but also reveal "unspoken" language ideologies. Findings from this study will permit a new perspective on how politicized and socially-encoded messages are crafted and transmitted across different media markets. Also, this research will contribute to linguistic and media anthropological theories on how lingua-cultural identities are created, maintained, and circulated in the mass media in relation to cultural producers' political-economic interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Rapid integration into the globalized market has brought many Asian creative industries to reconceptualize language variations in and beyond their own contexts. Variations become a powerful resource to navigate the pushes and pulls of glocalization?the stressed tension between local authenticities and global cosmopolitanism. A particular linguistic choice that is dearly cherished in the local community could otherwise be perceived as a sign of ruralness in the global marketplace. In the context of Mandarin-dominant Taiwan where this research is conducted, creative workers sweat to make fictional characters and cinematic narratives in both locally-made and imported foreign media more plausible, convincing, and enjoyable. A large portion of their labor is thus invested in scripting and voicing dialogues with the right balance of different Sinitic varieties and other foreign languages. In order to understand their creative efforts, I designed a dissertation project to research the media practice locally known as&nbsp;<em>peiyin</em>&nbsp;?to add voice,? a combination of voice acting and dubbing commonly practiced in the Western and Japanese creative industries. My research is driven to answer the question: how do these peiyin professionals utilize language to advertently and creatively navigate the sociolinguistic boundaries, commercial markets, and geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and Mainland China where different Mandarin varieties are preferred?&nbsp;</p> <p>Thanks to the generous support from the National Science Foundation, I carried out long-term ethnographic and linguistic anthropological fieldwork in Taipei, Taiwan. From 2018 to 2019, I traced the production of peiyin media from the start to the end, a multiparty collaboration that involves key players including scripters, translators, voice actors, directors, sound engineers, and distributors. During this period, I implemented a mixture of methodologies to&nbsp;document&nbsp;the happenings behind the scenes where these professionals meta-linguistically handled and negotiated cultural politics of representation. These included: 1)&nbsp;focal-following mobile ethnography, through which I closely followed key informants and attended the recording sessions and other meetings on a daily basis; 2) interview activities, including 85 formal interviews (54 voice actors, 16 voice-acting apprentices, 9 voice directors, 2 script translators, 3 studio managers, 1 distributor) and several dozens of informal impromptu interviews with other professionals including sound engineers, studio staff members, and subtitlists; 3) audio recording of studio interactions, which captured behind-the-scenes conversations in studios, including debates, negotiations, and casual chats regarding language use during and after recording sessions; and 4) archival research, which generated a corpus of over four thousand entries of peiyin related documents published between 1949 and August 2019.</p> <p>My execution of this research has benefited from this rare access to observe and participate in transnational media production, as well as the permission to conduct microanalyses of the often-inaccessible behind-the-scenes decision making process.

First, with its focus on a specialized media practice that heavily relies on language, my research helps bridge the gap between sociocultural and linguistic anthropology. It offers the analytic tools and conceptual frameworks linguistic anthropologists have developed for language to the study of creative industries. I show how cultural producers utilize language stylistically to construct conversations and animate characters in ways that (re)invent preconceived, well-recognized notions of class, gender, ethnicity, etc., that are associated with larger social constructs. Secondly, this research engages with a recent anthropological interest in translation. Contrary to the traditional treatment of dubbing merely as a localization practice known as ?audiovisual translation? in translation studies, this project critically engages peiyin as a social action for position-makings and -takings. My analysis shows the role of linguistic microculture in (re)producing a larger political-economic pattern in and through media production. Such scholarly intervention is particularly relevant in the contemporary globalizing world, where the drives for globalization are often confronted by the needs for localization. This attention to the peiyin helps us understand the mediating role of language ideologies in cultural production viewed against a background of cultural contestation and globalization. Lastly, this project also contributes to Chinese studies where work continues to focus on documenting globalization of entertainment industries in Mainland China. Grounded in Taiwan, one of the Mandarin-dominant Chinese peripheries, my research provides a good counter example of the way languages are used in both media localization and globalization whose target markets can no longer be easily described as ?international? or ?local?.
