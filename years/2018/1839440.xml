<AbstractNarration>The meeting `Advances in Asymptotic Probability' will take place in Stanford University, on December 13-17, 2018.&lt;br/&gt;It is expected to gather about 25 talks given by some of the world leaders in probability theory and stochastic processes, and more than&lt;br/&gt;one hundred participants. The workshop will focus on asymptotic properties of large random structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within probability theory and statistical physics one common goal is to understand behavior at macroscopic (and mesoscopic) scales in systems governed by relatively simple local interactions. In recent years there have been numerous significant developments on questions relating to this general theme. Topics represented at the conference will include: integrable probability, interacting particle systems, stochastic partial differential equations; conformal probability, random planar maps; spin glasses, random matrices, Markov chains, random graphs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A conference webpage can be found at the URL https://sites.google.com/view/amirdembo60/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
