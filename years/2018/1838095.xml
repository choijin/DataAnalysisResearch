<AbstractNarration>Faculty from five different institutions will organize and manage a workshop for undergraduates that will provide an opportunity to learn how to conduct meteorological research in Greenland. Students who participate in this experience will learn how to make measurements of energy fluxes and upper air radiosonde measurements at or near the Greenland ice sheet. They will also learn about the history of weather and climate measurements in Greenland and get the opportunity to share cultures with faculty and college students from Greenland. The workshop will be held in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland and potentially include training at Summit Station, high (11,000 ft.) on the Greenland Ice Sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications for participation in the workshop will be available in early 2019. Selection of the workshop attendees will be made by a committee of faculty from five different institutions, including the University of Michigan, Virginia Tech University, Hampton University, Pennsylvania State University College Park and the University of Albany. Students who attend the workshop will benefit from an exceptional experiential learning opportunity for undergraduates. The group will include students and faculty from Greenland, providing an opportunity for international collaborations. The workshop contributes to NSF's Strategic Objective 2.2 "STEM Workforce: Foster the growth of a more capable and diverse research workforce and advance the scientific and innovation skills of the Nation." (NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2018-2022)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In May of 2019 a team of undergraduate students from the University of Michigan, Virginia Tech University and the University at Albany were invited to join four faculty members on an expedition to Greenland. The goal was to offer&nbsp; an experiential learning opportunity wherein participants were to learn how to make measurements of energy fluxes and upper air radiosonde measurements in a region of significant interest to climate science. The thirteen students who participated were assigned specific teams and expected to lead experiments in Greenland on upper-air meteorology, radiative transfer measurements, stream-flow measurements, drone mapping, and air quality. Data was collected and analyzed to provide training in authentic climate science measurements. <br /><br />Students were selected based on their skill sets in atmospheric science, engineering, computer science and cultural studies. Preference was made for students who had little prior experience with field work in the climate sciences. The team was assembled at the University at Albany for three days of training with the instruments to be deployed and for team building exercises. The expedition flew to Kangerlussuaq, Greenland aboard an Air National Guard aircraft and were housed at the Kangerlussuaq International Science Support (KISS) facilities. The team deployed from there to conduct experiments in air quality, upper-air, radiative fluxes, and stream flow measurements as well as to conduct drone photometry.<br /><br />In addition to the scientific measurements that were conducted, the team also met with representatives of the Greenland UNESCO world heritage site where they learned of the local culture and heritage. Additionally, the team travelled to the location on Mount Evans where a University of Michigan team, led by William Hobbs in 1926, had made some of the first measurements of the katabatic winds in Greenland.<br /><br />Outcomes of the expedition have included: p</p> <ul> <li>Presentation at the AGU Annual Meeting (https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/webprogrampreliminary/Paper516255.html)</li> <li>Presentation at the AMS Annual Meeting, </li> <li>An article in EOS led by the student team (https://eos.org/science-updates/seeing-the-greenland-ice-sheet-through-students-eyes), </li>
