<AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative three year IRES project for 18 US students to gain international research experience in earth, life and data sciences as applied to the coastal region of Northern Central Java, Indonesia. The collaborative activities will be performed in partnership between Boston University (BU), Tufts University (TU) and the University of Diponegoro (UNDIP), Semarang, Indonesia. A cohort of six students per year will gain hands-on laboratory and field experience in coastal zone research during a six-week stay at the foreign institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coastal cities worldwide are facing the enormous task to become resilient against physical, social and economic challenges, in addition to challenges due to climate variations. Semarang (Indonesia) is one of the cities that exemplifies the multiple threats affecting society, economy, environment, and infrastructure. Assessing the impacts of present and future coastal hazards requires an understanding of the complex interactions between geological, hydrological, biophysical and socioeconomic systems. This can be best achieved by an integrated approach that includes research on both land and sea dynamics to identify natural and anthropogenic factors, their relative influences and related consequences. This project seeks to undertake effective, innovative, and transformative research to understand how coastal environments respond to natural and anthropogenic factors. Geospatial technology combined with big data analytics will be applied to assessing and monitoring the effects of coastal hazards with the goal to enable the sustainable adaptation of coastal areas to global environmental change. Students will learn data acquisition techniques and the ability to analyze and interpret scientific information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will combine field experience with cutting edge geospatial technology and data analytics to investigate the following research questions:&lt;br/&gt;1. Is land subsidence in Semarang coastal area mainly caused by natural or anthropogenic processes? Or both? How can we determine the prevailing factors; whether it is due to groundwater abstraction, tectonic movement, volcanic activities or a combination of factors? &lt;br/&gt;2. To what extent is the marine productivity of coastal waters near Semarang city affected by changing climatologic conditions of oceanic and atmospheric parameters in Java Sea? How is climate variations impacting fisheries resources and the economic productivity of coastal communities? How can we build models that show the linkages? &lt;br/&gt;3. How can we effectively monitor and assess coastal marine ecosystems health and productivity? Are artificial patch reefs and mangrove reforestation efforts in Semarang coastal region effective solutions for protecting and rehabilitating coastal ecosystems? &lt;br/&gt;4. How can geospatial technology and big data analytics help in revealing crucial interactions between ecological, economic and policy aspects to assess and manage the environmental risks? How can we measure and assess the changes in food intake pattern and food safety in relation to extreme weather and coastal hazards?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will establish a long term collaborative research and training program between US and Indonesian faculty and students. US students majoring in STEM fields will have an opportunity to conduct research and field work in an international and multi-disciplinary setting by engaging in problem solving research activities. They will be mentored by foreign collaborators and US PIs through web video conferencing and workshops jointly taught at the collaborating institution. The IRES experience is expected to a) broaden and leverage partnerships with overseas institutions, b) enhance US-student global awareness and perspectives, and c) develop multi-disciplinary themes that improve understanding of global change such as coral bleaching, habitat diversity, and coastal hazards. Research findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at conferences. In partnership with UNDIP and relevant agencies in Northern Central Java region, decision support products resulting from this project will be distributed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
