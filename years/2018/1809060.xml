<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project advances our understanding of Carbon dots (C-dots) physical and chemical properties for their application in biological systems.  Size, morphology, surface chemistry and method of preparation govern how C-dots interact with biological tissues.  C-dots derived from carbon powder are unique in that they bind to mineralized bones with high affinity and specificity.  By characterizing the physical and chemical properties that confer these C-dots their unique bone-binding properties, this project will advance our understanding of the interactions between C-dots and mineralized tissues.  This is an essential step towards developing C-dots as tools for bone imaging and diagnostic tools, and for the treatment and repair of bone fractures and degenerative diseases (e.g., osteoporosis) that would impact US health.  Additionally, this work will support the training of graduate and undergraduate students, fostering inquiry-based research and scientific collaboration essential to develop the skills needed in a thriving US scientific workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this work is to understand the physical and chemical properties of Carbon nanoparticles (C-dots) for their development as bone-specific drug carriers.  C-dots are a new emerging class of nanomaterials whose biological applications in imaging, diagnostics and therapeutics critically depend on their size, molecular structure and material of origin.  One particular class of C-dots synthesized from carbon powder have the unique property of binding to mineralized bones in vivo.  To advance our understanding of the interactions between C-dots and mineralized tissues this project will (1) determine the intrinsic chemical and physical properties of C-dots that are related to their high affinity and specificity towards mineralized bones, (2) determine how different surface functionalities influence the interactions between C-dots and mineralized bones, and (3) functionally test the ability of C-dots to deliver drugs to bones. By characterizing C-dots' unique bone binding properties, this work will not only uncover the physicochemical principles that allow C-dots binding to bones, but will also discern the molecular principles need to target new nanomaterials to mineralized tissue at the exclusion of other tissues. Thus, the findings of this work will have broad intellectual implications for nanomaterial chemistry and engineering, as well as advancing the development of bone imaging and diagnostic tools for the repair and treatment of bone fractures and degenerative diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
