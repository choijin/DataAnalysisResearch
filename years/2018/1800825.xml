<AbstractNarration>Scientists continue to weigh the net impact of hurricanes on wetlands. These events may be considered beneficial because of net sedimentation that occurs during surge inundation, or detrimental due to erosion of the marsh edge and surface excavation by storm waves. This study will exploit the new sedimentologic record left by Hurricane Irma to examine these paradigms in the salt marshes of the South Atlantic Bight. Sites range from Florida to South Carolina along a latitudinal gradient of increasing spring tidal range (1.7-2.4 m), backbarrier marsh width (5?7 km), and flow-weighted average suspended sediment concentrations in nearby rivers (13?27 mg/l). They exhibit variations in physical characteristics, proximity to fluvial source, and sediment availability that will help constrain the relative role of these factors in contributing sediment to marshes during storms. Understanding marsh sedimentation is of interest to all stewards of low-lying vegetated coastal zones. Quantifying how coastal wetlands accrete in response to relative sea-level rise, and the contributions that storms may play, is paramount to modeling future wetland evolution and long-term resilience to storm impacts. This study has broad societal implications given the recognized importance of the ecosystem services provided by salt marshes, including reducing storm surge height and related socioeconomic costs, and providing nurseries for fish stocks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While Hurricane Irma tracked over the west coast of Florida, the wind patterns and size of the storm created strong onshore winds along the southeast coast, producing a large storm&lt;br/&gt;surge up into South Carolina. Tide gauge data indicate that marshes from northern FL to central SC were flooded to a depth of 1 m, and remained so for ~7 to &gt; 17 hrs. Associated storm surge deposits are likely to be significant; their source may be local (marshes or lagoon floor) or from the inner shelf. The project will investigate the nature (lateral extent, thickness, and provenance) of Irma storm deposits (compared to ?background? sedimentation) through the analysis of (1) shallow trenches (~20 cm); (2) surface samples (of identified Irma deposits); and (3) double short cores (each 50-cm long, 8 cm in diameter) collected along two transects at each site from the backbarrier to mainland (5?6 cores/transect; ~45 sampling stations total). We will also map new erosional features, wrack lines, and vegetation damage or burial, related to Irma. Two cores from each transect containing a clear, representative Irma deposit will be sampled for short-lived radioisotope (210Pb, 137Cs) to provide multi-decadal accretion rates for comparison with event-sedimentation thicknesses. Surface (Irma) deposits and ?background? samples from depth in the two accretion cores, will also be used to examine event-sediment provenance signatures through analysis of bulk biogeochemical characteristics (%TOC, C:N, ä13CTOC, ä15NTN), and assemblages of diatoms and organic biomarkers adsorbed to/co-deposited with these sediments to determine source differences (marine, marsh/lagoon, fluvial) between storm and non-storm periods.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The net impact of hurricanes on wetlands is still a topic of debate; they may be beneficial because of sediment deposition during storm surge inundation, or detrimental due to erosion of the marsh edge and surface excavation by storm waves. Hurricane Irma created strong onshore winds along the southeast coast of the US, producing a large storm surge from Florida to South Carolina. We used our funding collect samples across the region impacted by this storm surge by visiting backbarrier marshes at four sites: Amelia Island, FL; Sapelo Island, GA; Hilton Head Island, SC; Cape Romain, SC. These sites were selected based on their varying physical settings and conditions during Irma; for example, each experienced different maximum sustained wind speeds and storm surge heights and lengths. At each site we used shallow trenches (~20 cm) to identify any surface layer associated with the storm, collected surface samples (of mud deposits identified as originating from Hurricane Irma); and took double short cores (each 50-cm long, 8 cm in diameter) for later geotechnical analysis. The samples were collected along two transects at geographic location, from the backbarrier to mainland (4-5 cores per transect) (Figure 1). At two of the sampling locations on each transect we also took a large (20 cm diameter, 70 cm depth) core for isotopic analyses to provide estimates of long term accretion rates. We made note of any new erosional features, wrack lines, and vegetation damage related to Irma, although we found little evidence of erosional damage at any of the backbarrier sites. Full analysis of the cores will be undertaken once further funding is secured. However, we determined that a visible storm deposit was detectable at all sites. These were commonly 2-5-cm thick, and characterized by oxidized, laminated, organic-poor (lack of rootlets), low-density (&ldquo;fluffy&rdquo;) mud. The Irma-associated deposits typically have bulk density values of 0.4-0.8 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and loss-on-ignition (LOI) values of 15-25%. These are approximately double and half, respectively, of those from the peat units immediately below the storm deposit (the &ldquo;background&rdquo; marsh sedimentation). A general-interest scientific paper detailing these results is presently in preparation.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/31/2018<br>      Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;J&nbsp;Hein</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1800825/1800825_10524205_1533068628533_Figure4(IrmaSedimentExample)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1800825/1800825_10524205_1533068628533_Figure4(IrmaSedimentExample)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Hurricane Irma Sediment Core Sample"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1800825/1800825_10524205_1533068628533_Figure4(IrmaSedimentExample)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Hurricane Irma Sediment Core Sample"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Example of a short core where the Hurricane Irma deposit is clearly seen.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Duncan FitzGerald, Boston University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christopher&nbsp;J&nbsp;Hein</div> <div class="imageTitle">Hurricane Irma Sediment Core Sample</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1800825/1800825_10524205_1533068711832_StudySites-01--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1800825/1800825_10524205_1533068711832_StudySites-01--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Hurricane Irma Sampling Sites"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1800825/1800825_10524205_1533068711832_StudySites-01--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Hurricane Irma Sampling Sites"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Map showing locations of field sites, transects, and sample types collected.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Christopher Hein, VIMS</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christopher&nbsp;J&nbsp;Hein</div> <div class="imageTitle">Hurricane Irma Sampling Sites</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1800825/1800825_10524205_1533068860226_SampleIrmaDataFigureJuly2018--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1800825/1800825_10524205_1533068860226_SampleIrmaDataFigureJuly2018--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sample down-core marsh data"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1800825/1800825_10524205_1533068860226_SampleIrmaDataFigureJuly2018--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sample down-core marsh data"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Down-core data from cores collected from the marshes behind each Amelia and Sapelo islands.
