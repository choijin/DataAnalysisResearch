<AbstractNarration>With support from the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce), this Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project aims to serve the national for highly-qualified secondary school mathematics teachers. Specifically, this project aims to recruit and support 34 students to become secondary mathematics teachers in high-need school districts.  The project includes a partnership between the University of Iowa and the Des Moines Area Community College, in collaboration with schools in Iowa City, Des Moines, and Cedar Rapids. To recruit scholars, the project will develop and implement new coordinated recruitment strategies to encourage students enrolled mathematics courses at Des Moines Area Community College and University of Iowa to consider careers in secondary mathematics teaching. Through a comprehensive teacher preparation program, the project aims to help Noyce Scholars develop their mathematical content knowledge, as well as their general and culturally responsive teaching skills. As a result, the project expects to produce skilled, credentialed teacher who will decrease the shortage of secondary mathematics teachers in high-need districts in Iowa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with academic, social support, and financial support as they pursue their mathematics teaching licensure.  Students pursuing a baccalaureate degree in mathematics with teacher certification will receive scholarships in their junior and senior years.  Students with baccalaureate degrees in mathematics or who are in the University of Iowa 4+1 program will receive one-year stipends as they pursue a Master of Arts in Mathematics teaching.  Noyce Scholars will work with and observe teachers and students in high-need classrooms, be matched with mentors, have opportunities to teach, and participate in summer workshops and internship opportunities.  These experiences are intended to help the Scholars develop a durable foundation in pedagogical and mathematics content knowledge. The program will also provide Scholars with training in culturally responsive pedagogical knowledge and skills. The project aims to prepare the Scholars to work in high-need schools through a culturally responsive adaptation of the Lesson Study approach. Additionally, Noyce Scholars will attend state and national mathematics education meetings (such as the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics) to be exposed to current teaching practices in mathematics. A rigorous project evaluation seeks to determine which factors best: (1) prepare Scholars to provide culturally responsive teaching; (2) increase proficiency among pre-service mathematics teachers; and (3) attract individuals of diverse backgrounds that are underrepresented in mathematics and among mathematics teachers to work in high-needs schools. Findings from the project will be shared broadly through publications and conference presentations. The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts, and supports experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
