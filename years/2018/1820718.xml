<AbstractNarration>This project studies the relationship between the families of algebraic curves, a central topic in algebraic geometry, and related notions arising in mathematical physics. In algebraic geometry, families of curves are studied by the use of moduli spaces, which parametrize the different curves in the family. Besides providing deep insights about curves, moduli spaces exhibit important behaviors which help shape our understanding of how geometric objects may be parametrized, and therein serve as envoys of a larger mathematical world, giving valuable insights into the development of higher dimensional theory. Recent work has revealed that certain aspects of moduli spaces of curves reflect underlying geometric structures. This research project investigates open questions related to these discoveries. Graduate students are involved in the project, and the investigator co-organizes the Mathematics Department's MathCamp high-school program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The projects are organized along four general themes. For smooth curves, conformal blocks are identified with global sections of certain ample line bundles on a projective variety.  Project One aims to study to what extent this description may or may not hold for non-smooth curves. Project Two proposes birational models of the moduli space as configurations of weighted points supported on curves embedded in homogeneous varieties, generalizing those given by pointed rational normal curves in projective space.  To answer open problems about the multiplicative eigenpolyhedra from representation theory, and cones spanned by certain sets of first Chern classes of vector bundles of conformal blocks, the goal of Project Three is to leverage information gathered from maps between subsets of the two. Project Four aims to understand positive cycles of higher codimension given by vector bundles of conformal blocks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The moduli space of stable n-pointed curves of genus g has played an important role in our developing understanding of mathematics: as a means of learning  about smooth curves and their degenerations, as a model for moduli spaces generally, and as a test variety for developing theories in algebraic geometry.      There are vector bundles  on the moduli space of curves constructed from  integrable modules at a fixed level k over a simple affine Lie algebra.  Fibers of such bundles are vector spaces of coinvariants, and their duals are vector spaces of conformal blocks.  Chern characters of the bundles give rise to cohomological field theories, and  Chern classes lie in the tautological ring. These are sometimes called Verlinde bundles since their ranks are determined by the well-known Verlinde formulas.  In genus zero the bundles are known to be globally generated, and so their sections give rise to morphisms. New birational models   of the moduli space in genus zero have been found using first Chern classes of these vector bundles of coinvariants, and all previous models have been shown to be given by them.   Intellectual Merit:  The  work funded by this grant was concerned with the interplay between  the moduli space of curves and  vector bundles of such coinvariants. Such connections highlight deep and nontrivial links between the geometry of moduli spaces of curves and questions concerning vector bundles and representations theory.       As a first example, in  ``Finite generation of the determinate of cohomology line bundle", with Belkale, we revisited a very old problem about finite generation of the sections of the determinant of cohomology line bundle, and as an application, we use Verlinde bundles to give a new solution of an equally old problem about families of vector bundles on the moduli space of curves.   In  ``Geometric interpretations at points on the boundary'', with Belkale, we showed that in prescribed circumstances, as is true at smooth curves, conformal blocks  correspond to generalized theta functions, and in another paper with Belkale and Kazanova we show that this does not hold in all situations.     Characteristic classes of Verlinde bundles are subject to a number of types of identities. In work with Belkale and Mukhopdyay, new rank and level identities were found at the critical level, and Chern classes were shown to be trivial above the critical level.   Moreover, inspired by unexpected examples of trivial divisors, we introduced the problem of finding necessary and sufficient conditions to determine when the first Chern class  is nontrivial, and we show under certain hypothesis, first Chern classes are subject to additive identities.  In the paper ``Basepoint free Gromov-Witten loci on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}$'', with Belkale, we discover new basepoint free loci on  $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}$ using Gromov-Witten invariants of smooth projective homogeneous spaces  X, giving intersection formulas to find classes, with examples for quadrics and projective space.   When X is projective space, loci of codimension one are shown equivalent to first Chern classes of  Verlinde bundles at level one for Lie algebras in type A.  I have participated in a number of activities with broader impacts including some of the following:  Highschool mathcamp: With Danny Krashen, I have designed and helped to run a series of week-long "math camps" for regional highschool students consisting of lectures and enrichment activities held at the University of Georgia.  These events were free with a very small charge for snacks and tee-shirts.   Workshop and conference co-organization: While funded by this grant,  I have been active as a co-organizer of a number of workshops and conferences including the Algebraic Geometry Northeast Sectional meeting, the Georgial Algebraic Geometry Symposium,  Combinatorial Moduli Spaces and Intersection Theory at the Fields Institute (2016), and the Georgia Summer Workshop in Algebraic Geometry.  I have given a number of lectures  at schools for graduate students including: School on the Geometry of Moduli Spaces of Curves, Trieste, ITALIA (5 lectures, 2018); and  GAeL, Bath University, (4 lectures, 2017).  I have given a number of talks aimed primarily for women in math including at the  Strength In Numbers, workshop, Queen's Univ., CA (2018); Graduate workshop in Alg Geom for Women and Mathematicians of Minority Genders, Harvard/MIT (2018); FEW Speaker at the University of Pennsylvania (2017).
