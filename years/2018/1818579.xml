<AbstractNarration>This award will fund continued development of methods to process huge volumes of seismic waveform data. This will lead to a great increase in the number of located and characterized seismic events of various kinds and will potentially identify patterns in earthquake occurrence that could inform hazard and near-term rupture forecasting. The initial "Mining Seismic Wavefields" NSF Geoinformatics grant has led to significant progress dealing with data volumes that would have been impossible to process when the project began. This award will fund an additional year of that effort and will maintain this momentum in technique development to complete the analysis of proof-of-concept projects on vast waveform data sets, and to deploy the cyberinfrastructure for wider use by the seismological community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The premise of the research is that continuous and/or densely recorded data coupled with high performance computing and scalable algorithms can enable a network-based approach to earthquake detection that greatly improves the detection of weak and unusual events that would be difficult or impossible to detect using traditional approaches. Numerous seismological observations confirm that proximal earthquake sources generate similar signals. Exploiting the discriminative power of this similarity has led to many fundamental discoveries; however, most similarity-based detection methods require prior knowledge of the source waveform, or template. Blind/uninformed search for signals having unknown signatures based on pair-wise or multiple matches has seen some success, but na√Øve implementations of this approach suffer from quadratic scaling of computation with time such that problems of interest are inaccessible  even for the most capable computers. Similarly, for dense networks, the availability of continuous waveform data motivates alternative detection schemes based on waveform similarity at adjacent stations. This project will further develop efficient data-mining techniques to enable scalable similarity search of seismic wavefields. Technical challenges to be addressed as part of the research for spatially sparse recording are to develop improved similarity-preserving compression for repeating signals detected over a network, and to improve post-processing of search output that will both isolate signals of seismological interest and minimize false detections. For spatially dense recording, this would extend recently developed wavefield matching techniques to similarity across adjacent stations, which would enable similarity search across unaliased elastic wavefields in four dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Mining Seismic Wavefields project was a collaboration among SCEC seismologists at Stanford, USC, Caltech, and Georgia Tech funded under the NSF Geoinformatics program.  The research team developed and demonstrated new methods for seismological data mining of continuous waveforms to detect small earthquakes within massive data volumes.  The premise of the project is that continuous and/or densely recorded data, coupled with high-performance computing and scalable algorithms can greatly improve the detection of weak events that would go undetected using traditional methods. The project is based on seismic waveform (seismogram) similarity. Similarity may arise because different earthquakes occur near one another so that waves from them bear the same signature of interaction with the complex crust of the Earth.  Waveform similarity may also arise because seismic sources are recorded at instruments close to one another.  The MSW project exploits both of these situations.   To extend similarity search to less well-studied areas we developed an uninformed search algorithm called FAST (Fingerprinting and Similarity Thresholding) that performs computationally efficient similarity search by adapting technologies originally developed for other purposes, such as audio clip identification.  We developed a new association algorithm to isolate earthquakes within the FAST output and explored different fingerprinting schemes to characterize earthquake waveforms.  Applying FAST to 3 months of the Guy-Greenbrier, Arkansas sequence increased the number of cataloged earthquakes from 75 to over 14,000, and illuminated the relationship between microearthquakes and hydraulic stimulation for unconventional hydrocarbon development, as shown in the first image. We improved the performance of the FAST algorithm such that we could apply it to over a decade of continuous seismic data.  Doing so allowed us to detect over 200 previously undetected microearthquakes near the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant as shown in the image, and have the potential to improve constraints on the geometry of the West Edna Fault.  We also applied it to the foreshock sequence of the 1999 Hector Mine earthquake to explore how that sequence unfolded.  The FAST algorithm is now being used to detect small earthquakes in diverse settings around the world.  It is freely available as Open Source software and has been downloaded for use by at least 97 individuals/organizations.  Finally, developed machine-learning based methods for detecting earthquake wave arrivals in seismograms and for separating earthquake signals from background noise.  We are pursuing several research directions using machine learning techniques to generalize and extend the work carried out under this grant.  Data-intensive computing approaches, such as the ones we have developed, are poised to have a dramatic effect on earthquake monitoring as low-cost, capable sensor technology provides unparalleled spatial resolution of seismic wavefields. The work carried out under the mining seismic wavefields project will help realize the full potential of seismic networks of the future, and in doing so will provide a much clearer view into earthquake processes.
