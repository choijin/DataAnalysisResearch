<AbstractNarration>Locally elected officials are quietly exercising more control over how residents are treated by the criminal justice system. For example, city councils and county sheriffs are deciding whether local law enforcement agents check immigration status in the course of regular policing; whether and for how long people are detained in custody for suspected immigration violations; and who enters the federal deportation pipeline. This research examines how local officials wield their authority. Do partisan politics play a role in their decision-making? Do the specific policy preferences of their constituencies? These questions are studied by collecting the first comprehensive dataset on sheriff electoral returns and on the institutional rules that constrain sheriffs, which vary dramatically across the nation and over time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work advances several research agendas in political science, law, sociology, criminology, and public policy. First, variation in local immigration enforcement is only recently being documented and explained, and the electoral motivations behind it have yet to be studied at all. Second, the project is relevant to a large academic literature on local politics and representation. For a long time, scholars in this field have argued that there is a limited role for partisan or issue-specific responsiveness in the local electoral context, though recent empirical work has produced new evidence that voters' ideological positions affect municipal governments' fiscal policy decisions. The study is the first of its kind to examine both policy preferences and partisanship in the same framework; and by doing so in a domain that is simultaneously politically charged at the national level and under jurisdictions' immediate control, it will help resolve ongoing debates about the degree and type of responsiveness that prevails in local government. Finally, the project speaks to important normative questions raised by contemporary American federalism, namely how much cross-jurisdictional variation, democratic responsiveness, and partisan politics operate in the enforcement of national laws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span>NSF funding allowed me to collect a nationwide dataset on county sheriffs that includes election returns; the scope of the sheriff's rights and responsibilities in every jurisdiction; the requirements for running for office; and institutional constraints on their autonomy. The resulting dataset will generate important insights into how electoral incentives and political institutions --- which vary dramatically across U.S. jurisdictions --- affect how sheriffs exercise their expansive authority over law enforcement, immigration policing, and incarceration. Preliminary analysis of this data has already yielded significant findings. Sheriffs' immigration enforcement policies are more responsive to their constituencies' preferences in election years than during the rest of their time in office: their rate of cooperation with ICE detainer requests declines the more Democratic voters there are in the county, and this relationship is more pronounced in election years than other years. This election-year responsiveness effect is driven by sheriffs who seek reelection: among sheriffs that do not run for another term, there is no relationship between their cooperation rate and the partisanship of their county, or between their behavior in election years and other years. Furthermore, I find that the differential in responsiveness between election and non-election years is reduced when sheriff elections are on the presidential election calendar as opposed to off-cycle. In counties with on-cycle elections, non-election years also exhibit some degree of responsiveness, though still less than in election years. This suggests a simple mechanism for increasing democratic control over sheriffs: behavior in office. In ongoing work, I consider additional institutional features: the requirements candidates for sheriff must meet in order to run for office, whether sheriff elections are partisan or nonpartisan, and the level of oversight that other governing bodies --- the county board of supervisors, the state legislature --- exercise over the sheriff.</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/01/2021<br>      Modified by: Jonathan&nbsp;Mummolo</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
