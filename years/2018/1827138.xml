<AbstractNarration>The CC* Networking Infrastructure project at the University of Delaware (UD) is constructing a high-bandwidth, low-latency Internet2 connection to support the university's research and education initiatives by fulfilling the need for efficient and timely data transfer to collaborating institutions, national high-performance computing resources, and service for the global research community. This project enables the sharing of large and time-sensitive data sets without impediment. It provides the necessary infrastructure to support major initiatives for the Delaware Biotechnology Institute, department of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry, department of Mechanical Engineering, Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Bartol Research Institute, department of Chemical &amp; Biomolecular Engineering, Entomology and Wildlife Ecology, and many more data intensive programs across the university. This is a transformational grant which enables DNA sequence, energy flux, molecule property, molecular dynamics trajectory, protein, solid particle, visualization, weather, and other data to be transferred between HPC clusters and scientists for immediate use with shorter delays between successive simulations and resulting in faster overall research schedule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides two enhancements to the University of Delaware network infrastructure: (1) creation of a 100Gbps capable network for connectivity to the Internet2 network community, and (2) creation of a ScienceDMZ to enable researchers to take full advantage of the new high-bandwidth capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Overview In 2009, the University of Delaware (UD) was awarded an Academic Research Infrastructure - Recovery and Reinvestment (ARI-R2) grant to modernize the University?s cyberinfrastructure. One component of the ARI grant was to implement a 4 channel DWDM network supporting 10Gb/s transport to Internet2 via MAGPI and the commodity Internet.    This project, CC* Networking Infrastructure: CyberInfrastructure Technology Advancement,  upgraded 2 channels of the 4 channel system to 100Gb/s to support 100Gb/s networking between UD and Internet2 via a NYSERNet connection in Philadelphia. Additional router interfaces were added to enable the creation of a new Science DMZ to support connections up to campus connections 100Gb/s without transiting a firewall. UD also implemented a Data Transport Node, and a PerfSONAR node to monitor capacity and QOS.      Intellectual merit             This project has dramatically increased UD cyberinfrastructure capabilities and has been utilized throughout the UD research and research training landscape. Astronomy and space physics, catalysis and energy research, critical zone studies in oceanography, marine biology, bioinformatics, genomics, and protein modeling have all been advanced by more effective collaboration. Advanced cyberinfrastructure is critical to UD?s effective participation in the national research community and that community?s success is, in turn, essential for the US.      For example the University of Delaware currently has 3 active NRP Pilot projects which utilize our connectivity with NYSERNet/NRP/PRP at 100Gb/s.    (1) Edge Optimization: Distributed Machine Learning for Internet of Things will allow clients with handheld devices with a camera, utilizing streaming video to Kubernetes nodes to analyze video to recognize objects and do ML to provide response in real-time (e.g. like Tesla cars) with deep learning as the most important part of the project.    (2a) DE EPSCoR Big Data Infrastructure providing open source big data science infrastructure storage/processing software, statewide/regional environmental remotely sensed raster data, utilized for machine learning algorithms and near real-time analysis and data distribution in collaboration with 4 main Delaware higher education institutions (DTCC, DSU, Wesley, and UD). (2b) Satellite Receiving Station Distribution based on THREDDS/ERDDAP satellite data distribution in collaboration with Rutgers, MARACOOS, MARCO.    (3) Graph Convolutional Networks for Quantum Chemical Properties Prediction based on running deep graph convolutional networks possibly in an ensemble setting with the primary requirement of the project running the models with TensorFlow on GPUs and close proximity to storage.
