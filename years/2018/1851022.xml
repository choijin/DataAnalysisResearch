<AbstractNarration>The ice of the polar ice sheets is among the purest substances on Earth, yet the small amount of impurities --such as acids-- are important to how the ice flows and what can be learned from ice cores about past climate. The goal of this project is to understand the role of such acids on the deformation of polycrystalline ice by comparing the deformation behavior of pure and sulfuric acid-doped samples. Sulfuric acid was chosen both because of its importance for interpreting past climate and because it can lead to water veins in ice at low temperatures. This work will focus on the location, movement, and impact of acids in polycrystalline ice that are more complex than in single crystals of ice. By deforming samples and performing microstructural characterization, the role of acids on deformation rate, grain evolution, and the movement of the acids themselves, will be assessed. The work will lead to the education of a Ph.D. student at Dartmouth College, introduce undergraduate students to research at both the University of Washington and Dartmouth College. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the ubiquitous use of the constitutive relation for ice commonly referred to as "Glen's Flow Law", significant uncertainty exists particularly with regard to the role of impurities and the development of oriented fabrics. The aim of this project is to improve the constitutive relationship for ice by performing deformation tests and microstructural characterization of pure and sulfuric acid-doped ice. The project will focus on sulfuric acid's impact on ice viscosity, fabric evolution, and diffusivity. Sulfuric acid can have both direct and indirect effects on the mechanical properties of polycrystalline ice.  The direct effects change the dislocation velocity and/or density, and the indirect effects change the grain size and fabric. The complexity and interaction of these effects means that it is not possible to understand the effects of sulfuric acid by simply examining ice core specimens. In this project, the team will deform four types of ice: lab-grown ice samples doped with similar-to-natural concentrations of sulfuric acid, lab-grown high-purity ice, layered doped and pure ice, and natural ice from Antarctic ice cores. Deformation will be performed in both uniaxial compression and simple shear. The addition of simple shear tests is critical for relating the laboratory-observed deformation behavior to the behavior of polar ice sheets where the shear strain dominates ice motion in basal ice. After deformation to strains from 5 percent up to 25 percent, the microstructural development will be assessed with methods including a variety of scanning electron microscope techniques, Raman microscopy, synchrotron-based Nano-X-ray fluorescence, and ion chromatography. These analysis techniques will allow the determination of 1) the segregation and movement of impurities, 2) the rate of grain-boundary migration, 3) the number of recrystallized grains; and 4) the full orientation of the ice crystals. The results will enable both microstructural modeling of the effects of sulfuric acid and numerical modeling of diffusion in ice cores. The net result will be a better understanding of ice deformation that improves ice-core interpretation and ice-sheet modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
