<AbstractNarration>The American Geoscience Institute and the U.S. Bureau of Labor project a shortfall of 90,000 geoscientists by 2024 and that by 2020, Nevada (NV)  will need 260 more geoscientists, 50 more atmospheric and space scientists, 340 more environmental scientists, 70 more hydrologists, and 210 environmental science technicians. The Yale Project on Climate Change concluded that the majority of Clark County residents, 70% of NV's population, has a poor understanding of climate change issues. Increasing student exposure to geoscience education and increasing the number of geoscience prepared graduates entering the workforce in NV and the U.S. is the primary program goal. Field-based, experiential learning and research experiences are two high-impact practices generating deeper learning and higher retention. The merit of the proposed project rests on integrating practices that increase student interest and engagement in geoscience-related degrees and careers. The GeoGateway Program (GGP) has the broadest impact in increasing introductory students' scientific literacy and access to geoscience education through lesson plans based in real-world environmental change data and other experiential, field-based opportunities.  The number of students transferring from the College of Southern Nevada (CSN), NV's largest community college will increase because the colleges' articulation agreement includes mentoring and enhanced advising for students majoring in Environmental and Resource Sciences (ERS), a major including high geoscience content.  Gender demographics at both colleges demonstrate growing numbers of underrepresented minority females, especially Hispanic females, entering science fields. Students majoring in ERS will complete a significant research project or internship in collaboration with the Desert Research Institute (DRI), a specialized environmental research arm of the Nevada System of Higher Education, or other local organizations to further scientific knowledge of living sustainably in the dry southwestern U.S. This knowledge is critical for the communities in the region because as millions relocated here, climate change exacerbated the severity of droughts, fires, and other arid climates features. GGP graduates will be job-ready for geoscience jobs or to enroll in related graduate programs created to support state and national geoscience goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GeoGateway Program (GGP), a structured pathway linking academic and research institutions in southern NV to train the region's new generation of geoscientists, will recruit and engage students taking geoscience-related coursework. Two-year Associate of Science (AS) graduates will channel into NSC's four-year ERS program. The GGP leverages commitments and staff from CSN and the DRI by accessing infrastructure already supported by NSF, the Nevada Climate-ecohydrology Assessment Network (NevCAN). Within four years, the GGP will reach more than 530 CSN and 680 NSC students through jointly-programmed introductory curriculum, guest lectures, field trips, and film screenings designed to generate 25% growth in ERS majors and a 25% increase in ERS graduates. CSN students graduating with an AS degree will directly transfer all relevant coursework into the NSC ERS degree, enter the GGP and participate in a Special Topics research project, receiving critical supplemental advising and mentorship from faculty and a near-peer GGP Ambassador. The large pool of potential undeclared NSC ERS majors will be recruited into ERS. By the end of the GGP, program partners will have strengthened the community college pipeline into a four-year degree program to help meet the nation's need for geoscientists. Other outcomes include the effectiveness assessment of the jointly-coordinated programming and participation in research or internships, by measuring geoscience knowledge gained and level of participant interest in pursuing geoscience-related degrees/careers, and the impacts of increased faculty advising and use of peer mentors, especially on recruiting and retaining underrepresented minorities and female students in science programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
