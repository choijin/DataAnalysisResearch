<AbstractNarration>The "Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) Symposium on Integrative Biology of Sensory Hair Cells" will take place January 6, 2018 at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis Hotel in San Francisco, California. This meeting will focus on hair cells, which are found in invertebrate aquatic animals, in the grooves in the skin (called the lateral line system) of fish and larval amphibians, and in the inner ear of adult amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. These small cells respond to water vibration and sound, and are also vital for orientation relative to gravity, acceleration, and fluid motion detection. In humans, they are necessary for hearing and for vestibular function, and developmental defects or later loss of function in these cells are the major cause of deafness, impairments of postural stability, and of the ability to stand or walk. Despite much recent research progress on hair cell biology in invertebrate animals and in the auditory, vestibular, and lateral line systems of vertebrate animals, hair cell researchers working in those different systems tend not interact with each other, and therefore  overlook major new research developments. This meeting is both timely and important, and two expected outcomes are (1) the broad dissemination of new information to biology teaching faculty and their graduate and undergraduate students, all of whom are the main attendees of the SICB conference, and (2) the formation of new scientific collaborations that will lead to novel approaches to the fundamental questions of hair cell evolution, development, physiology, and regeneration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hair cells are responsible for mechano-transduction, hearing and vestibular function in a variety of invertebrate and vertebrate animals. This symposium brings together researchers who study hair cells in a variety of organ systems (invertebrate outer body, cochlear, vestibular, and lateral line systems) and who utilize a variety of experimental approaches (including molecular developmental analysis, perturbation of gene expression, and electrophysiology, to name a few), with the goal of initiating a major interdisciplinary conversation and exchange of ideas about hair cell function, development and evolution. For example, the discovery of sensory hair cells in ascidian tunicates, a non-vertebrate chordate, has fostered important evolutionary-developmental studies that have illuminated common features with the development hair cells in cranial placodes in vertebrates. In vertebrate animals, cochlear and vestibular hair cells are derived from the otic placode, while hair cells of the lateral line system are derived from lateral line placodes. Molecular analysis of the genes required for hair cell development and differentiation in these different contexts is ongoing, as are efforts to identify the ion channel or channels responsible for mechano-electrical transduction by hair cells in the inner ear. It is thus a highly opportune time to bring researchers from these different communities together with the joint purposes of broadly disseminating new information about hair cells to biology teaching faculty and their graduate and undergraduate students, all of whom are the main attendees of the SICB conference, and fostering new scientific collaborations that will lead to novel approaches to the fundamental questions of hair cell evolution, development, physiology, and regeneration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary objective of this symposium on the Integrative Biology of Hair Cells was to bring together a multi-disciplinary group of experts to exchange their recent research results, and through that exchange to generate ideas that may lead in novel directions for future research on the biology of sensory hair cells.  Sensory hair cells are responsible for  mechano-electrical transduction in the vertebrate sense of hearing and for the senses of balance, acceleration, and orientation that are mediated through the vestibular system.  In addition, primitive vertebrates such as fish and salamanders use sensory hair cells to mediate sensitivity to water movement and pressure waves in the aquatic environment, through clusters of hair cells in the lateral line system of the integument.    By promoting cross-disciplinary communication among investigators who study different aspects of sensory hair cell biology, this conference will enhance the breadth and depth of scientific effort applied toward alleviation of the human suffering caused by disorders of hearing and vestibular function that are associated with loss, insufficiency, or developmental disorders of sensory hair cells.   The symposium was held succesfully on January 6th, 2018, at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology in San Francisco, California. Attendance at the meeting was about 100 people, which was what we had expected. The presentations were well-organized and thorough and generated lively and productive discussion between the speakers and the audience, and also among the speakers.   Subsequent to the symposium, six of the ten speakers submitted manuscripts to the Integrative and Comparative Biology journal, and all of those manuscripts were accepted after peer review and appropriate revision. As of April 30, 2019, those manuscripts have been viewed more than 1,800 times, collectively (including Page Views and PDF Downloads). We consider that a highly favorable outcome and are highly satisfied with the results of this project. We are grateful to the National Science Foundation for its support of the project, without which it would not have been possible.
