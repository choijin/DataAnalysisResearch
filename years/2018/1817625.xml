<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students from historically underrepresented minority populations (African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians or Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders) to successfully complete high quality degree programs in STEM.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Puget Sound Alliance (PSAlliance) project will establish a partnership between three community colleges in the western part of Washington State, namely North Seattle College, Olympic College and Pierce College, to create a long-term plan to increase STEM degrees for traditionally underrepresented minority students.  The outcome of the 18-month planning activity is submission of a full proposal for LSAMP Bridge-to-the-Baccalaureate (B2B)funding to further support community college student success and transfer to four-year STEM programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;North Seattle College will leverage knowledge generated in prior NSF funded projects to bring expertise to the design and implementation of a range of high impact practices that will serve to transform PSAlliance STEM programs. Early Undergraduate Research Experiences (UREs) will be a central theme, as well as the design of innovative recruitment and retention strategies. The planning project will increase knowledge about what is known about how early research experiences and supplemental supports impact student STEM identity, persistence and engagement in underrepresented student populations. Project outcomes will be disseminated locally and nationally through conferences and on-line STEM education journals. Findings from the planning project will benefit educational institutions and the STEM community nationally in broadening participation efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The PSAlliance colleges adopted an overarching theme for the future B2B Alliance?s activities: to expand student engagement in Undergraduate Research Experiences (UREs) to significantly enhance their academic success. In order to develop a comprehensive, responsive vision for their alliance, the three colleges addressed specific objectives for this planning project:  Objective #1: Develop B2B Alliance Implementation Plans  Objective #2: Review and Refine B2B Alliance Implementation Plans  Objective #3: Secure Approval and Commitment to B2B Alliance Plans  The primary activities under the planning grant focused on three areas:  Convening a series of meetings and workshops with stakeholders to solidify the vision of the alliance, identify strengths and resources to leverage, and develop evidence-based plans to increase the recruitment, retention, and transfer of under-represented students in STEM. Conducting institutional self-assessments around current efforts and areas for growth in undergraduate research. Soliciting input and advice from experienced LSAMP programs and from key identified partners to help our Puget Sound Alliance design a thoughtful, sustainable, holistic network of supports for our students.   The principle investigators from each institution met several times before hosting large cross-institution meetings at each college about the emerging vision for their LSAMP alliance. PI Owens, Co-PI Murkowski, and the project evaluator, Dr. Lia Wetzstein from the University of Washington?s Community College Research Initiatives Office, designed and facilitated three half-day workshops at each college in the Alliance.
