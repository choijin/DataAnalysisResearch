<AbstractNarration>Societies change and grow due to a variety of different reasons. In certain locations, it seems that this process is due to a local shift and intensification in specific resources and technologies. In others, an outside influence, potentially through migration, can catalyze growth and change. Clear shifts in material culture can be identified in the archaeological record, but the reasoning behind them may not be quite as obvious. The archaeological site of Paquim, in Chihuahua, Mexico, is a site that underwent a dramatic fluorescence around 1200 A.D. The reasons for this change have been suggested to be an aggregation of local populations into the city center, or perhaps due to an influx of migrants from the southern civilizations in Mexico. Using ancient DNA studies, this research will contribute to understanding the role of migration in the Greater Southwest and specifically in the Casas Grandes area, which can be extended to other regions where migration potentially influenced the development of social complexity and worked as a catalyst for significant changes in established cultural fabrics. Outreach will include the introduction of methods related to the STEM sciences to K-12 students. Also, a summer program will allow for hands-on training for interested university students. A doctoral student will also be funded to aid in their degree completion. Migration is a fundamental human act. How it may influence populations, and in particular spur creative and economic growth, is something one can better understand by looking at human history. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will utilize some of the most recent technologies to collect genetic data from different time periods to detect changes in the occupancy of the Paquim region. In particular, does genetic data suggest that migration was a potential reason for the significant shift in the Casas Grandes region? Or does genetic homogeneity between populations during different time periods suggest a local impetus for the cultural fluorescence?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

What led to this shift in population density, and changes in cultural trends, has been the subject of many debates. The central goal of this research, "The Role of Population Movement in the Origin of Complex Society," has been to determine how ancient DNA can contribute to understanding change in population dynamics. The question of whether immigration was at the heart of this change at Paquim&eacute; was addressed, drawing on larger questions of how migration influences societal change in the past, as well as today. By looking at the mitogenomes, and therefore maternal lineages, of the occupants of the site of Paquim&eacute;, it was possible to gain a better understanding of just who the individuals were that began living in the region and later built an impressive city, and whether or not they were genetically related. Based on the primary findings, there are direct genetic links between the earlier and later occupants, suggesting that the main growth the city experienced was not the result of large-scale population movement into the site from elsewhere in the U.S. Southwest or Mexico, as has been suggested by other researchers. Instead, it's possible to see that those individuals who lived in the region had descendants who lived in the city's massive adobe structures and farmed along the nearby river. While this does not exclude entirely the possibility for smaller migration events, and there certainly was movement of individuals across the landscape, it does solidly suggest that there was not a major influx of females that altered the mitochondrial landscape of the region.</p> <p>What does this genetic continuity say about population change and growth over time? For the site of Paquim&eacute;, it means that contact with other populations allowed for the exchange of ideas and change that did not require large groups of people coming from outside the population to create change. Instead, the population of the region had a great deal of outside contacts, with trade and smaller-scale population movement, allowing for the population to successfully adapt and adopt diverse cultural traditions. It also demonstrates that no population in the Southwest, and indeed anywhere, exists in a vacuum. There has always been movement of individuals and ideas, and from this we can better understand the factors that influence our populations today and celebrate their cultural differences, allowing for cultural "melting pots" to be successful, as they were at Paquim&eacute;.</p> <p>Beyond these findings, this research has led to many opportunities for students at several universities, outreach to interested parties through conferences and planned public discussions (delayed due to the pandemic), as well as teaching many students from a host of different backgrounds about molecular anthropology, archaeology, and the rich history of the US Southwest/NW Mexico.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/03/2021<br>      Modified by: Meradeth&nbsp;Snow</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1821483/1821483_10555771_1628008292964_MapofSite--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1821483/1821483_10555771_1628008292964_MapofSite--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Map of the site of Paquime"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1821483/1821483_10555771_1628008292964_MapofSite--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Map of the site of Paquime"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Map of site, with burial locations noted.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Michael Searcy</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Meradeth&nbsp;Snow</div> <div class="imageTitle">Map of the site of Paquime</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1821483/1821483_10555771_1628007979464_StudentworkingwithDNAinSnowaDNALaboratory--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1821483/1821483_10555771_1628007979464_StudentworkingwithDNAinSnowaDNALaboratory--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student working with pipette in laboratory"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1821483/1821483_10555771_1628007979464_StudentworkingwithDNAinSnowaDNALaboratory--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student working with pipette in laboratory"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student working with aDNA from Paquime individuals in the Snow clean-room laboratory.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Meradeth H.
