<AbstractNarration>Computational simulations are rapidly emerging as a co-equal branch of inquiry with experiment and theory. In parallel, automated instruments store massive amounts of measurements. However, computational science will only fulfill its full potential if advances in undergraduate and graduate education accompany the advances in hardware. The 30 undergraduate students participating in this Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program are engaged with varied computational science projects, learn how to use state-of-the-art cyberinfrastructure tools, manage large amounts of data, experience activities that characterize research careers, and work in interdisciplinary research teams. The Center for Computation &amp; Technology (CCT) at Louisiana State University provides an ideal setting for the REU student to become familiar with interdisciplinary research. For ten weeks in the summer, the students work collaboratively with their mentors on a wide variety of computational science projects. With research groups exploring gravitational waves, complex emergent phenomena in material science, or computational music and arts, the participants work on cutting edge research in computational sciences. By preparing the next generation of students in the computational sciences, this project serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission: to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; or to secure the national defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a clear need for training the workforce on computing and computational science. But, currently, the majority of students learn little, if any, Computational Science (CSci) in the classroom and are not prepared for CSci research or data science. This proposal provides an evidence-based approach to address these issues and prepare the next generation of students. One of the current barriers in CSci education is that while CSci is intrinsically multidisciplinary, traditional academic departments set rigid boundaries between disciplines. Because LSU Center for Computation &amp; Technology is not an academic unit, it provides an ideal setting for the REU student to become familiar with interdisciplinary research by participating in a multidisciplinary research team. During ten weeks the participants experience activities that characterize research careers, such as presenting their research in scholarly forums, and working on the soft- and hard-skills needed in interdisciplinary research. Faculty mentors work with the students in individual and group meetings, and they provide activities that help students appreciate the nature of multidisciplinary research and the value of working as a team. At the conclusion of the REU, students are encouraged to continue their CSci research and present their work at their home institution, informing others about computational science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
