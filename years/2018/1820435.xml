<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to transform 2-way, mobile satellite communications from a niche service (affordable to less than 0.1% of the world?s people), to a broadly accessible mass market product (at costs well under $1/month).  Communications devices (that could be as small as vehicle key fobs) will communicate modest volumes of data to and from virtually anywhere on Earth.   The number of potential applications is large, with the following being a few examples:  every lifejacket on every commercial aircraft and cruise ship could transmit its location and status (in the event of a mishap); children and the elderly could be tracked globally; and drivers could be assured of assistance wherever they travel.   Secondary impacts would include an increase in average fuel efficiency when, for example, more vehicles are sold without spare tires (as drivers have more peace-of-mind regarding the possibility of being stranded).   The United States will benefit in terms of improved safety, conserved resources, stimulus to the satellite and related industries, and increased export revenues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project centers around a combination of innovations that exploit inherent (but previously unutilized) capabilities of existing satellites.  Currently operational Mobile Satellite Systems have communications architectures that do not lend themselves to low-cost transmission of small volumes of data.  By starting with a blank sheet of paper and rethinking the architecture, costs can be reduced by orders of magnitude (for both the communications devices and the data service).  The cost reduction of the terminal devices is primarily driven by lower data rates (with associated lower power and size).  While most technical aspects of communications links improve with lower data rates, one characteristic emerges as a constraint on the extent to which data rate can be reduced.  The purpose of this research is to study this characteristic, called phase noise, and its impact on the communications performance at low data rates when using real satellite links.  The results of this research will be quantitative conclusions regarding the trades between data rates, the cost impact of lowering phase noise in the communication elements, transmission performance, and the modem architectural options.  This study will enable optimization of this trade when developing the follow-on commercial products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Satellite-based communications systems are poised to provide a revolutionary class of service: low-cost, narrow-band, two-way, ubiquitous connectivity which is often called Satellite IoT.  Affordable pricing will attract a broad new consumer base, expanding accessibility from a privileged minority to entire populations. 'Low-cost' in this context means total-costs-of-ownership in the range up to, say, $1/month. That is, device costs will match those of terrestrial IoT (a few dollars), and data cost will be pennies per month.  eSAT Global is unique among the many companies targeting low-cost satellite IoT.  The uniqueness arises in the use of Geosynchronous-Earth-Orbit Mobile Satellite System (GEO MSS) satellites.  All the other systems use Low-Earth-Orbit small satellites, typically CubeSats.  eSAT Global believes the advantages of GEO satellites are significant, and has published an article comparing the approaches: 'IoT + Geosatellites... A Perfect Match' (in http://www.satmagazine.com/story.php?number=1830210392 ).  The benefits include lower costs per bit, smaller terminals with longer battery life, two-way connectivity (some LEO systems are one-way only), and higher capacity and spectral efficiency.  In the Phase I work eSAT Global showed that existing GEO MSS satellites have characteristics that enable robust communication using eSAT's unique signaling waveforms.  Early design reviews of the eSAT system identified phase noise as a central potential risk area.  That is, as data rates become lower the impact of phase noise becomes higher, and eSAT uses bit rates that are lower than any existing services over GEO MSS satellites.  The activities during Phase I culminated in direct measurement of the end-to-end phase noise when communicating through real satellites, as well as transmission and reception of eSAT waveforms via the satellite links.  In all cases the performance was robust and consistent with (or better than) the expectations derived from simulation. (The margin beyond expectations most likely results from conservative specifications from the satellite manufacturers.)  The phase noise results in minimal degradation to the communications links.  eSAT Global now looks forward to commercialization of the system.
