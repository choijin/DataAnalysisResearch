<AbstractNarration>The eleventh North American Paleontological Convention (NAPC) is being held at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) from June 23 to June 27, 2019. NAPC is a large, international meeting attended every five years by scientists, students, and amateurs who study the history of life in the universe. During NAPC, attendees are presenting and discussing scientific findings, defining directions for future research and outreach, and are mentoring/being mentored by professionals and peers. Symposia, workshops, and field trips are being held throughout the conference. Funds are going towards the travel and housing costs for 100 students to attend NAPC. NAPC activities are advancing discovery and understanding, broadening participation of under-represented groups, and broadening dissemination to enhance scientific and technological understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NAPC is a forum where hundreds of scientists from around the world can formally and informally exchange information, mentor, and create contacts. Topical sessions, workshops, and field trips on a wide range of research areas, including astrobiology, paleogenomics, paleoclimatology, and conservation paleobiology, are being convened. A plenary session emphasizes the importance of deep time studies among the public. UCR is a Hispanic Serving Institution, and several activities were designed to promote diversity and inclusion within the paleontological subdisciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

This scientific meeting is an international conference that brings together all branches of paleontology and fields related to the history of life on Earth: everything from the earliest life on our planet, through trilobites, dinosaurs and walking whales, to the new field of astrobiology that is possible life on other planets. It is held every 4 to 5 years. The meeting attracted more than 675 participants from throughout North America and the rest of the world, including students and professionals, amateurs, and interested members of the public. Attendees came from 34 countries. At the meeting new research findings were presented, future directions were defined, and extended and relaxed interactions among all the attendees and, most particularly graduate and undergraduate students and amateurs were encouraged. Like previous NAPC meetings, NAPC11 was less formal than most scientific meetings, and allowed time and space for extended interactions among participants at different career stages and in different disciplines. Public outreach activities included public lectures, workshops and fieldtrips. Fieldtrips associated with the meeting provided opportunity to explore the spectacular regional fossil resources, and various workshops and panel discussions provided participants with hands-on experience. We were delighted in the participation of amateur paleontologists, including school students, at the meeting. Several symposia focused on effective geoscience outreach, including to members of communities generally under-represented in the field, and in creative ways of scientific story-telling. The meeting was widely hailed as a success.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/05/2019<br>      Modified by: Nigel&nbsp;C&nbsp;Hughes</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
