<AbstractNarration>Trust, dependability, cohesion, and capability are integral to an effective team.  These attributes are the same for teams of collaborating robots and humans as well as all-robot teams.  For a team to remain effective in the presence of faults, failures, and errors from nature or intent, team members must have sufficient perception and understanding of the problem and possible solutions to make appropriate adjustments in their operations.  When multiple teams with competing incentives are tasked, a strategy, if available, may be to weaken, influence or sway the attributes of other teams and limit their understanding of their full range of options.  Such strategies are widely found, for example, in nature, sporting contests, and military operations, where strategies such as feints and misdirection often appear.  This project focuses on one class of higher-level strategies for multi-robots: namely, to misdirect and where feasible to counter misdirection.  As multi-robot systems become more autonomous, distributed, networked, numerous, and with more capability to make critical decisions, the prospect for intentional and unintentional misdirection must be anticipated.  This project will support robust multi-robotic operations in important strategic domains such as security and military operations.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project studies strategies to enable co-robots, multi-robots and teams of multi-robots to model, generate, and cope with misdirection in various situations.  This research direction in robotic control offers a novel approach to resilience in and among these teams to these forms of possible disruption. Computational models, drawn particularly from studies of human endeavors and group behaviors, provide a general framework for understanding, producing, and countering misdirection in robotic systems. A framework of computational models will be designed using recursive schema-theoretic models of behaviors at the individual and team levels, building on decentralized methods of control and communication, to provide robustness in the presence of noisy and chaotic environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project contributed knowledge regarding the ability of robots to deliberately relocate groups of unsuspecting agents ("marks") from one location to another without their knowledge or intention. This approach has potential application for hazardous operations, such as natural disasters, fires, crowd control, and military operations, among others.  Studies were undertaken that utilized cognitve models of human group behavior, notably Granovetter's threshold model of crowds, as a basis for developing the underlying robotic behaviors for the the misdirection agents.  We explored the role of confederates ("shills") associated with the lead deceiver to understand the relationship of crowd size with the required number of confederates to achieve effective and efficient misdirection.  Once the misdirection behaviors were developed and tested, counter-misdirection agents (CMAs) were developed to show that there are techniques that can be applied to reduce the likelihood of misdirection when used in an adversarial relationship. As before, quantitative analysis with respect to the numbers of CMAs needed to break up the misdirection effort was undertaken and described in the writings associated with this effort.  The quantitative results for both misdirection and counter-misdirection were obtained both in simulation and on real world robots, using the NSF-funded Georgia Tech Robotarium. These results are detailed in the numerous publications produced under this project.  Limits on the effectiveness of this approach were also considered including methods that could potentially defeat counter-misdirection. For example,  insights were obtained regarding the technical challenges of preventing misdirection in a group, particularly with respect to a misdirection leader who is cognizant of the defensive activity and uses random motion (zig-zags) to undermine the effort.  Ethical considerations on the implications of this research were considered and disseminated from the outset of the project, to help ensure that these results are applied in a socially responsible way. To achieve this, numerous presentations and discussions were held with the larger community apart from traditional technologists, but included social scientists, policy makers, and ethicists.
