<AbstractNarration>Columbia University will host a three-day conference on Statistical Learning and Data Science/Nonparametric Statistics, June 4-6, 2018 in New York City. The objective of the conference is to bring together researchers in statistical learning, data science and nonparametric statistics from academia, industry, and government. Statistical machine learning is widely recognized as a very active area of interdisciplinary research, closely related to statistics, optimization, and computer science. In addition, it also plays an essential role in the new important areas of data science and big data. Due to advances in technology, massive and complex data in the "big data era" are prevalent in almost every aspect of modern scientific research. It is critical to manage such huge amounts of data, and make reliable prediction and inference. Statistical machine learning techniques have developed substantial flexibility in handling such data, with a wide range of applications in diverse scientific disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is expected to (1) bring together researchers from different disciplines, including statistics, computer science, machine learning, engineering, and biomedical and other related research fields, to address recent development and emerging issues in statistical learning, data science and nonparametric statistics, (2) promote interactions and collaborations among researchers, (3) discuss new ideas and future research directions for statistical learning and data science, with a focus towards knowledge discovery in sciences and engineering, (4) provide an excellent opportunity for junior researchers to interact and learn from leading scientists in the field. The conference will consist of three plenary sessions, 55 invited sessions and poster sessions. Conference topics include unsupervised, semi-supervised and supervised learning, with applications in rankings, text and web mining, network analysis, bioinformatics, high-dimensional data, functional data, genomics, drug discovery, intrusion and fraud detection. NSF funding will provide travel support to students, post-doctoral scholars, and early-career researchers to encourage their participation in this event. The conference website is https://publish.illinois.edu/sldsc2018/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

There was a total of 300 participants, 48 invited sessions, 22 contributed posters, 3 keynote speakers (Michael Jordan of UC Berkley, David Madigan of Columbia U., Liza Levina of U. of Michigan) and a banquet speech by Cathy O?Neil of ORCAA.      This year?s keynote lectures were very popular and the conference rooms were packed. The lectures were "On Gradient-Based Optimization: Accelerated, Stochastic and Nonconvex" byMichael Jordan, "Matrix Completion in Network Analysis" by Liza Levina and "Honest Learning for the Healthcare System: Large-scale Evidence from Real-world Data" by David Madigan.        The conference attracted people from all areas of the statistics community: corporate, governmental and academic.  This year?s technical sessions were particular strong, combining many outstanding and cutting-edge talks from statistical learning, nonparametric and data science.
