<AbstractNarration>Approximately 95% of all land, sea and air vehicles in the world today rely on petroleum to move passengers and freight both locally and internationally. This transportation fuel mix produces ~25% of all greenhouse gas emissions and is projected to grow in the future with modernization of developing countries. International energy agencies note that if transport is to contribute to CO2 reductions to meet the 2 degree C global average temperature target, use of technologies such as hybrid electric and all electric transportation will have to increase in the future. Thus, advances in transportation technologies are clearly a national and international issue, and require globally-minded engineers and scientists to advance interdisciplinary technologies to develop cleaner regional and global transportation systems. Virginia Tech (VT) proposes to expand upon the Future Electric Transportation Systems ( FETS) IRES partnership with the University of Nottingham (UoN), with a broadened scope and stronger engagement with industry and the UK government to establish the Energy, Environment, and Future Electric Transportation Systems (E-FETS) IRES program. E-FETS cohorts of ~9 per year will investigate next generation electrical power systems for environmentally-friendly fuels and extraction methods; energy-efficient, hybridized power train vehicles and systems; light-weighting of vehicle structures; and the human factors issues that accompany their use and adoption. Among the broader impacts of this IRES program are the promotion of international research collaborations that foster innovative technical leaders capable of creating and effectively integrating electric transportation systems into our society as a means to address efficient energy use.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;E-FETS will provide an intensive ten-week research experience to undergraduates and graduate students with five of the University of Nottingham's internationally recognized research groups. These include power electronics, human factors, geo-energy, composites and manufacturing, and aerospace propulsion and advanced diagnostics. The program will consist of two phases. The first phase includes three pre-departure workshops plus three weeks of mentorship and research preparation at VT to orient students to the experience and the project scope. This pre-departure preparation aims to build the E-FETS student cohort team in preparation for their work individually and together. The second phase consists of 7 weeks at the UoN engaged in concentrated research with UoN faculty mentors and facilities. In addition to supervision from a VT and UoN faculty member, students will work collaboratively as part of a large research team including faculty, Ph.D. students and postdoctoral research fellows. To facilitate additional professional development, students will also be matched with an industry mentor who will meet with the student before, during and after their research experience. These mentors will enhance the students? experience with international career exploration, professional development, and networking in their field and industry. Seminars focused on the scope of E-FETS research goals are planned during each phase of the program, providing students with the opportunity to connect their individual research projects with the unified research theme of E-FETS, and present and get feedback on their IRES experience. By engaging industry partners with IRES projects, the E-FETS IRES seeks to leverage industry and UK government to grow the IRES program and develop a basis for sustainability beyond the grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
