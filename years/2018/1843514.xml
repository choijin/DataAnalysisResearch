<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to drive hypertension awareness and control rates around the world, through the availability of low-cost, portable blood pressure monitoring. High blood pressure (BP) is a major cardiovascular risk factor that affects up to 1 billion people worldwide. It is treatable, yet hypertension awareness and control rates are low. Ubiquitous BP monitoring technology could improve hypertension management, but existing devices require an inflatable cuff and therefore do not afford anytime, anywhere measurement of BP. The market for a portable, cuff-less blood pressure monitor is estimated in the tens of billions of dollars. Successful completion of this project via demonstration of measurement accuracy across a broad range of blood pressures will provide the company with a strong position in this large market. Ultimately, the success of this project could translate to much greater awareness and control of hypertension, helping reduce the incidence and burden of cardiovascular disease around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop a technology for cuff-less and calibration-free measurement of blood pressure via a button on a smartphone. Existing automated cuff-based monitors are bulky and do not enable anytime, anywhere measurement of BP. The 'oscillometric finger pressing method'is an emerging approach that uses the same measurement principle that is employed by most automatic cuff devices, but instead of inflating a cuff, the user presses his or her finger (and the underlying artery) against a combination of optical and pressure sensors to determine the blood pressure. The objectives of this program are to shrink the current prototype design and validate its accuracy. The proposed R&amp;D plan includes miniaturization of the circuit components to mount them on a single board and optimization of the sensing technology and algorithm to work in a broad range of normotensive and hypertensive individuals. This work will be followed up by a clinical test of the monitor. The resulting device is expected to be small and thin enough to mount to the back of a smartphone and demonstrate clinical-grade accuracy for the measurement of blood pressure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since the Phase I award in 2019, significant progress was made towards demonstrating the feasibility of the TouchBP? monitor.  The original Phase I objectives called for miniaturizing the sensor, integrating it into a cell phone case form factor, and confirming accuracy of the new design.  However, based on early feedback from potential customers and customer influencers that was gathered prior to and after the Phase I Boot Camp, it was clear that demonstrating accuracy in low, normotensive, and hypertensive patients was more important for de-risking the technology than miniaturizing the hardware and fitting it into a phone case.  In consultation with our NSF Program Director, the Phase I objectives were modified to deemphasize the miniaturization activities and emphasize the clinical activities.   With the Phase I award and private investment, these revised objectives were met and exceeded.  A clinical prototype system was designed and tested.  This system was more sensitive, accurate, and reliable than early proof of concept prototypes.  This is extremely important when dealing with a diverse population with varying degrees of perfusion.  This clinical device was designed for easy replication to support bench experiments and multiple formal clinical studies.  A clinical study was completed at a contract research organization generating at least 4 paired TouchBP? scans and reference BP measurements in 102 subjects.  This data was used to improve the algorithm for predicting blood pressure (BP) and to demonstrate performance over a wider population and extended blood pressure range.  Using the data and experience obtained with the clinical prototype as well as insights gained from customer research, a miniaturized and reliable keychain or key fob sized commercial prototype was designed and built with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection to a companion App running on iOS.  In summary, the major Phase I accomplishments were:  Four clinical prototype instruments were created for gathering data at three clinical trial sites and support laboratory optimization of the device performance. We developed clinical study procedures that were approved by independent Institutional Review Boards at 3 institutions.   Hundreds of device oscillometric data sets paired with manual BP reference measurements were collected to build the baseline algorithm and evaluate the hardware and finger/device interface. Over 100 subjects were tested in formal clinical studies with at least 4 paired measurements per subject.  This data is being used to drive algorithm and hardware optimization.   4 commercial prototype devices including a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connected iPhone application with prototype gamification were built for RF testing, concept demonstration, and customer insight/usability studies. Digitouch also completed over 200 interviews with potential customers, clinicians, and individual users, which were used to guide the choice of product design, features, and go-to-market strategy.  This included direct observation of users/clinicians interacting with the prototype devices, guided interviews with anonymous feedback, one-on-one interviews, and an American Heart Association-led Advisory Board meeting with 16 key opinion leaders in blood pressure monitoring and management of hypertension.  A provisional patent application was filed to extend our patent coverage to cover improvements.            Last Modified: 10/07/2020       Submitted by: Marc Zemel]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
