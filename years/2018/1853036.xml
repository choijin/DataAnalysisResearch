<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation research improvement project will examine the use of narrative forms to better communicate about the environment among Native American and rural communities in the US. These communities are likely to be among the most vulnerable to the social and ecological impacts of climate variability and environmental change. Understanding how environmental knowledge is perceived and communicated by different groups can lead to the development of stronger, more culturally appropriate, communication tools for at risk populations. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent research career. The student will contribute to the advancement of geographical science by developing novel methods for better communicating and translating complex science problems to different cultural groups. The findings of this project will have implications for public policy, public health, and sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The doctoral student will use a mixed methods approach to examine how environmental knowledge is disseminated, perceived, and communicated in distinct ways. Specifically, this research examines (1) how culture shapes environmental perception; and (2) how and whether narrative forms can be used as an effective science communication tool in Native American and traditional rural communities. Through collaborations with local Appalachian and Alaskan cultural and scientific organizations, the doctoral student will collect data through a multi-faceted approach including participant observation at local cultural events, key informant interviews, archival research including historic environmental data and oral history collections, as well as experimental participatory workshops. This research will provide new insights regarding the communication of environmental science to different cultural groups, with implications for improving human health and well-being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
