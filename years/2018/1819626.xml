<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project uses novel technologies to produce an attractive, affordable and commercial product and service, RestEaZe translating to the home the sleep lab evaluations of restless sleep for millions of adults with insomnia and children with ADHD and RLS. An analysis of significant sleep features that should be evaluated for at-home sleep monitoring indicated that at least these should include total sleep time, brief arousals, wake during sleep, sleep efficiency, periodic leg movements in sleep and sleep position. Moreover these need to be developed and validated for adults as well as children. The analyses indicate that sleep monitoring should be based on leg and not arm movement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RestEaZe, for the first time ever, both phenotypes and also measures the leg movements of sleep (LMS) and using logistic regression and advanced machine learning identifies LMS characteristics that accurately predict these significant sleep measures. RestEaZe translates advanced sleep science from the lab to the home. The user gets an immediate scientifically accurate view of quiet vs. restless sleep and changes in sleep over several nights in relation to user entered sleep behavior. RestEaZe also provides professionally developed interactive guides for improving sleep based on RestEaZe results. The doctor gets advanced movement and sleep analyses with interactive graphic and numeric summaries of the patient's sleep over several days. The analyses will reveal both sleep quality, circadian pattern and PLMS. The PLMS reveal possible medical conditions such as sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome (RLS), cardiac morbidity and REM behavior disorder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Sleep loss and disruption have almost epidemic proportions in our society affecting 70% of the adult population and 8-10% of school-aged children (5-10% with ADHD and 3-5% with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)) impairing health, learning, social functioning and sometimes leading to excessive or un-needed drug treatments. Adults and parents are already looking for help and are buying wearable sleep tracking products, a 1.1-billion-dollar market in 2016. These are mostly wrist-worn units that are not effective, accurate, or scientifically grounded. No available consumer products measure leg movements (LM) and, therefore, cannot detect the important cortical arousals leading to sleep fragmentation or periodic leg movements of sleep (PLMS). There is a critical need to develop a low-cost sleep aid that provides beneficial information for sleep improvement, assesses leg movements, arousals, and sleep quality and is an aid for diagnosis of sleep disorders in adults and children. RestEaze addresses this need by combining sleep science with advanced analytics. RestEaze uniquely analyzes leg movements (LM) to assess basic sleep measures, arousals, and sleep-related disorders.</p> <p>RestEaze consists of an ankle-worn textile band, mobile application, and backend server for the collection, storage, and analysis of sleep movement data. In our Phase I project, we have shown designed and implemented RestEaze and shown its feasibility for in-home sleep monitoring using leg movement characterization and analyses for basic sleep measures and micro-arousals detection. We have shown that our algorithms have sensitivity and specificity approximating the clinical inter-rater agreement compared to overnight polysomnography studies. Through in-home studies with quantitative surveys, we have shown that the RestEaze system is easy to wear and use.
