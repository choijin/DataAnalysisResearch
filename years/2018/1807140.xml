<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support to US-based students and post-doctoral fellows and junior scientists to attend the 2018 Gordon Research Conference on Development, Function and Dysfunction of Thalamocortical Networks. This five-day meeting and the associated Research Seminar brings together researchers to present results and engage in discussions on the cell and circuit properties of thalamocortical interactions, and build on these to explore their roles in cognition and behavior and how their dysfunction manifests in disease. This conference represents a rare opportunity for neuroscientists interested in thalamocortical interactions to exchange new results, hypotheses, and ideas at many levels, from cellular through systems to cognitive and clinical. With respect to broader impacts, this meeting will benefit the larger community in multiple ways. First, it will help train and inspire the next generation of scientists by exposing students and postdoctoral fellows to exciting science and scientists. Second, special emphasis will be given to junior faculty. Finally, a concerted effort will be made to recruit scientists from under-represented groups and targeted mentoring sessions will help the junior scientists in their career paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this meeting derives from its small size, which promotes interactions between participants, and the assembly of many top scientists whose research spans thalamocortical interactions across multiple sensory modalities, emphasizing the commonalities. This combination leads to fruitful comparative analyses, raises new questions about underlying mechanisms and often leads to new collaborations. By maximizing both formal discussion and informal interactions, the Gordon Conference and Research Seminar will highlight exciting new developments that have implications both for a basic understanding of the emergent properties of neural circuits as well as pathologies that involve thalamocortical disruptions. This is especially timely because this field has been expanding significantly with the recent appreciation that the thalamus plays an ongoing and critical role in cortical functioning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2018 Thalamocortical Interactions conference brought together experimentalists and theoreticians at all career stages, from pre- and postdoctoral fellows to assistant and full professors, to present and discuss the latest advances in our understanding of the organization, development, function, and plasticity of thalamocortical networks, and the impact of disease on thalamocortical interactions. A particular strength of the conference was the cross talk and discussion that was emphasized and generated between basic-science and clinical researchers studying thalamocortical interactions at different spatial and temporal scales as well as across different sensory, motor and cognitive modalities.    The Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Thalamocortical Interactions was a unique forum for graduate students, post-docs, and other scientists with comparable levels of experience and education to present and exchange new data and cutting edge ideas.  This inaugural GRS meeting focused on recent advances in our understanding of thalamocortical interactions with an emphasis on how these interactions play key roles in both sensory and motor processes and the development of the brain.     The GRS provided junior scientists a venue to further their knowledge of recent advances in the field as well as present, discuss, and receive feedback on their research. This meeting was designed to foster interactions and constructive networking with peers and established scientists and will include a career development seminar with advice from academic scientists at different career stages.
