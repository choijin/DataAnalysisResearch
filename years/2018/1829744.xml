<AbstractNarration>Studies of water and environmental systems are becoming increasingly complex and require integration of knowledge across multiple domains. At the same time, technological advances have enabled the collection of massive quantities of data for studying earth system changes. Fully leveraging these datasets and software tools requires fundamentally new approaches in the way researchers store, access and process data. The project serves the national interest by motivating a culture shift within the hydrologic and more broadly earth science communities toward open and reproducible software practices that will enhance interdisciplinary collaboration and increase capacity for addressing complex science challenges around the availability, risks and use of water. Project's CyberTraining approach provides virtual learning experiences throughout an academic year, with online learning modules oriented around a one-week in-person workshop (WaterHackWeek) that will focus on hands-on real-world research projects. These research projects are designed to serve the national interest by preparing for natural hazards such as floods, hurricanes and climate change, and to advance the nation's health by making tools and data accessible to health researchers, local governments, and citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New cyberinfrastructure that emphasizes data sharing and open, reproducible software practices is currently in development, but requires a mode of knowledge transfer, or CyberTraining, that extends beyond currently available university curriculum.  Project's aim is to ensure successful use of community cyberinfrastructure to 1) publish large datasets, 2) run numerical models, 3) organize collaborative research projects, and 4) meet journal requirements to follow open data standards. The activities take advantage of HydroShare, a National Science Foundation funded cyberinfrastructure platform, operated by the Consortium of Universities Allied for Hydrologic Sciences (CUAHSI), for sharing hydrologic data and models.  The short-term goals are to develop new CyberTraining modules; the long-term goals are to have an annually recurring WaterHackWeek, to distribute curriculum CUAHSI to more than 130 member universities, and advance cyberinfrastructure education for the broader geoscience community. The use of the hackweek educational model extends the use of cyberinfrastructure to promote the progress of science by including a specific emphasis on graduate student training as instructors, training coordinators, and building research networks with data providers who are stakeholders outside of academia. For example, case studies include data and resource management by Native American tribal governments, Hurricane Maria data archive for research in Puerto Rico, improving flood forecasting, and tool-building using complex numerical models such as the National Water Model.  This project allows to test the educational model in the water research community, in addition to connecting team's research and curriculum to annually recurring hackweeks in neuro, astro, ocean, and geo sciences. The team of researchers is actively engaged in experimenting with this new model, and in testing its efficacy through robust evaluation metrics. The proposed activities encourage collaboration and support for use of cyberinfrastructure at all stages of the educational pipeline and provides participants with opportunities for networking, career development, community building and design of open-source software tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
