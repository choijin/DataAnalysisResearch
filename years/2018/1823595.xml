<AbstractNarration>Genome engineering and editing technologies using CRISPR-Cas9 and other programmable nucleases are rapidly entering mainstream molecular biology research.  The emergence of these technologies presents a significant challenge to biological science instructors to provide engaging and effective ways to introduce these technologies into their classrooms. This workshop aims at introducing CRISPR-Cas9 technology to instructors in the context of information flow and the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, allowing integration of these new technologies into the biological sciences framework. Workshop participants will develop hands-on skills for designing and using genome engineering and editing, and methods for incorporating these technologies into classroom discussions at their institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a 3-day workshop from June 16-18, 2018 at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio on the development and implementation of CRISPR-Cas9 technology for undergraduate instructors from different types of institutions as a prelude to the Association of Biology Laboratory Educators (ABLE). Faculty will be recruited from all types of undergraduate institutions, including minority-serving institutions and two-year institutions. Faculty participants will work together to (a) become conversant with background knowledge and lab skills relating to CRISPR-Cas9 technology, (b) bring different aspects of the technology into their classrooms/labs, (c) discuss and create pedagogical modules suitable to different types of classrooms/labs, and (d) foster and provide support to undergraduate educators who will disseminate gene engineering/editing technologies and make innovations in their classrooms/labs. Specifically, the meeting will encourage the teaching of CRISPR-Cas9 technologies to undergraduates in the context of biological information flow and the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology.  Dissemination plans include posting workshop materials on CURE net (https://curenet.cnsutexas.edu), a repository of course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     This award supported a workshop that was run in June 2018 in conjunction with the Association of Biology Laboratory Educators (ABLE) meeting at the The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.  The workshop brought together 24 instructors from across the country from undergraduate institutions of all types and missions (research universitities, liberal arts colleges, community colleges, etc.) to develop strategies for teaching CRISPR-Cas9 technology in the undergraduate classroom.  Using a workflow based on undergraduate CRISPR-Cas9 instruction with zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model system, workshop partitipants worked with organizers, undergraduates who helped develop and test the workflow, and Ohio State CRISPR-Cas9 experts to become familiar with the dynamics of CRISPR-Cas9.        The wet lab portion of the workshop focused on getting participants comfortable with the workflow and developing the skills and confidence necessary to implement part or all of its techniques in their classrooms.  The organizers emphasized the in vitro nature of most of the workflow and how the experiments students could develop and implement do not rely on a working zebrafish facility to complete.  Another point of emphasis was the modular nature of the workflow and how instructors could pick and choose which sections (bioinformatics, experimental design, molecular manipulation, genotyping, phenotyping) would be most appropriate for the content and time parameters of a given class.       In addition to the experimental procedures described above, the organizers devoted multiple sections of the workshop to discussions of pedagogy and to how CRISPR-Cas9 experimentation could be effectively integrated into the undergraduate classroom.  These discussions focused on the different levels of coursework and prior student preparation that would influence how instructors would ultimately design CRISPR-Cas9 based experimnental work.  Specifically, these sessions considered how to develop course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) that would be course and student preparation level-appropriate while providing students with an engaging and memorable authentic research experience as part of their STEM education.      The group prepared a meeting report for publication in The Journal of Microbiology and Biology Education (in press) that described the highlights of the workshop and provided all relevant protocols for implementing CRISPR-Cas9 experimentation in the undergraduate classroom.
