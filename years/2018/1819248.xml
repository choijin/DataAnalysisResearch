<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will save billions of dollars by anticipating construction delays and streamlining coordination to prevent them. Lower costs will help upgrade our nation's infrastructure, which is a critical national priority. Many construction companies strongly want a solution to indoor progress monitoring. Laser scanning is too expensive and slow, and photography services can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for large projects and introduce logistical challenges. The proposed research would simplify the workflow for progress monitoring of interiors by automatically registering 360 degree photos and video and aligning them to building information models (BIM), providing a cheap, quick, and effective solution for daily progress monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to localize images, reconstruct 3D models, align them to floorplans or 3D BIM, and use the aligned models to provide actionable data to construction managers. A main challenge is to robustly solve for camera pose using structure-from-motion in indoor scenes that are unfinished and contain textureless and reflective surfaces. A second challenge is to automatically or semi-automatically register the models to 2D or 3D plans, made more difficult by the fact that the site is incomplete and constantly changing. A third challenge is to create interfaces that project personnel can use to perform visual inspection, progress monitoring, requests for information, and other supervision and coordination tasks. The project will investigate the use of tags (i.e., markers) to improve robustness of 3D reconstruction and to perform registration without requiring the 3D positions of tags to be known in advance. Thus, the project addresses major unsolved problems in computer vision, robotics, and their application to construction management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Most construction projects are behind schedule and over budget, and studies show that 35% of total costs are due to failures in coordination. The best way that to improve efficiency in construction is to provide timely feedback of progress and how it relates to plans. Previously, Reconstruct built a visual production management platform that overlays as-built models (images and point clouds) with as-planned models (BIM, schedule) for outdoor scenes. However, these capabilities were limited to to exterior construction on sites where drones can be used to capture images.  This SBIR Phase I grant supported the following activities to expand applicability to interior scenes and construction sites where drones cannot fly:  (1)  Developed a solution for interior photo capture and 3d reconstruction using 360 photos.  We developed improved methods for registering the photos and for creating 3D point clouds based on the registered photos and also experimentally developed guidelines for equipment and capture methodology.    (2)  Developed and deployed iphone app for reporting progress with photos and text.  In early customer discovery, we realized that a task-focused way of capturing images would provide immediate value to customers in obtaining real-time progress updates with visual documentation.    (3)  Developed and deployed a crane camera solution for automated progress monitoring of exteriors.  In customer discovery, we learned that the photo acquisition process is a big pain point for customers. We collaborated with a company that offers solar-powered cameras to offer a solution to automatically take photos and create 3d models using a camera that is mounted on the jib of a crane.
