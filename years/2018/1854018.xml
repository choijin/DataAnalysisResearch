<AbstractNarration>Science outreach represents a strategy that helps to connect scientists with non-specialized audiences in culturally relevant ways, with the overarching goal of bridging science and society. The concept of science outreach dates back to the beginning of modern science research, but in more recent times, science outreach is increasingly seen as a necessary component of the scientific enterprise, particularly in the context of promoting access, equity, and inclusivity. Yet, challenges exist with regard to scaling and sustaining science outreach efforts. As the field of science outreach moves towards professionalization, it is important to understand how science outreach programs and activities are currently viewed among members of the scientific community. The goal of this project is uncover how science outreach is valued among scientific researchers, learn what motivates scientists to participate in science outreach related initiatives, and examine how gender and race influences participation. The results of this project have the potential to raise awareness about the importance of science outreach and ultimately support increased, effective, and sustainable public engagement with science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aims of this project will be accomplished through the creation, dissemination, and analysis of a nationwide survey instrument which will be developed with collaborative input from representative members of the growing national science outreach community. The survey instrument will be tailored to query three distinct groups of respondents that exist within the scientific community: 1) Respondents who do not conduct science outreach; 2) Respondents who participate in science outreach with varying frequency; 3) Respondents who practice science outreach as their profession. A large-scale survey will be conducted and the responses will be analyzed and shared with the broad scientific community through peer-reviewed publication, alongside complementary write-ups and future recommendations, which will be shared on free and publicly accessible web platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
