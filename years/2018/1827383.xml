<AbstractNarration>Overview:&lt;br/&gt;Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) proposes to continue operating the research vessel Robert&lt;br/&gt;Gordon Sproul to support NSF-funded scientific research for the five-year period 2018 -2022. Robert&lt;br/&gt;Gordon Sproul is a capable, well-equipped general-purpose Coastal Class research vessel that is owned&lt;br/&gt;by the University of California and has been operated by SIO since the ship's introduction into the US&lt;br/&gt;Academic Research Fleet in 1985. As a large shared-use facility scheduled within the collaborative&lt;br/&gt;framework of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), Robert Gordon&lt;br/&gt;Sproul will host scientists from across the United States to undertake research in a variety of disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;The ship will be operated in a manner that promotes safety, capability and efficiency in order to&lt;br/&gt;maximize NSF's investment in the ship and in programs that are conducted on board. SIO employs a&lt;br/&gt;disciplined approach to vessel maintenance, regulatory compliance, foreign clearance, crewing and&lt;br/&gt;logistics so that scientific missions can be completed successfully and on schedule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The observation, measurement, and collection of samples and data are accomplished on the US West&lt;br/&gt;Coast by scientific missions aboard Robert Gordon Sproul. SIO-operated ships have played a critical role&lt;br/&gt;in the exploration of our planet since 1907, and continue to contribute significantly to the U.S. ocean&lt;br/&gt;research effort. SIO's ship operations department supports NSF core values of scientific excellence,&lt;br/&gt;organizational excellence, learning, inclusiveness and accountability. The vessel management and&lt;br/&gt;operations proposed here enable transformative scientific research in physical and biological processes in&lt;br/&gt;the natural environment upon which human well-being depends. The intellectual merit of this proposal is&lt;br/&gt;amplified by the combined merit of research projects undertaken by scientists on board. Robert Gordon&lt;br/&gt;Sproul is currently scheduled to conduct three different NSF-sponsored programs in 2018 in benthic&lt;br/&gt;ecology, ocean chemistry, paleoceanography, marine ecology, and ocean instrument research and&lt;br/&gt;development. Each scientific program contributes its own distinctive intellectual merit. NSF-sponsored&lt;br/&gt;projects as currently scheduled will account for 20% (10 days) of Robert Gordon Sproul's work this year.&lt;br/&gt;The remainder of the work will be supported by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (28 days, 54%),&lt;br/&gt;the Navy (12 days, 24 %), and NOAA (1 day, 2%).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SIO's management of Robert Gordon Sproul enables research, education and training that advance&lt;br/&gt;discovery and understanding while achieving far-reaching broader impacts. The proposed management&lt;br/&gt;supports strongly collaborative, multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional use of the vessel. Through&lt;br/&gt;UNOLS, SIO coordinates the shared use of Robert Gordon Sproul with scientists and funding agencies so&lt;br/&gt;shipboard capabilities meet the current and anticipated needs of the community. SIO is committed to&lt;br/&gt;promoting a climate of fairness, cooperation, and professionalism on board that embraces diversity,&lt;br/&gt;equity, and inclusion as essential ingredients of discovery, technical development, and learning. SIO's&lt;br/&gt;operation of Robert Gordon Sproul leverages institutional programs that complement NSF's mission to&lt;br/&gt;promote achievement and progress in science, engineering and education for the benefit of the nation. For&lt;br/&gt;example, SIO's UC Ship Funds Program enables graduate and undergraduate students, postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;researchers and early career faculty to pursue independent research and instruction aboard Robert Gordon&lt;br/&gt;Sproul via an internal peer-reviewed competitive process for ship time. The vessel is integral to SIO's K-&lt;br/&gt;12 education program.  In the Footsteps of Robert Gordon Sproul, which uses oceanography to teach&lt;br/&gt;physical science to economically disadvantaged seventh- and eighth-grade students. As a broadly subscribed&lt;br/&gt;shared-use facility, Robert Gordon Sproul similarly contributes to the education, training and&lt;br/&gt;outreach missions of scientists from institutions across America who conduct their research and&lt;br/&gt;educational programs on board. As proposed here, Robert Gordon Sproul will continue to serve NSF by&lt;br/&gt;safely, capably and efficiently facilitating multi-disciplinary scientific research to advance our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of our oceans and Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Statement of Merit Review&lt;br/&gt; This proposal supports peer-reviewed science through NSF evaluation process.  The renewal of this cooperative agreement included an external review panel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
