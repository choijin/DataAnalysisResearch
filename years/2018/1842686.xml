<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to bring to the market a faster and cheaper means of gathering highly accurate local air quality.  This will be done through the use of miniaturization of chemical sensors that are carried by UAVs.  Not only will there be technical hurdles that will be overcome through the implementation of this means of gathering data, the use of UAVs in this manner pushes the boundaries of their use in urban areas in a way that has not been done before.  The societal and commercial impact will be to reduce cost and time in obtaining air quality at a point in time and space, thereby making air quality measurements less of a financial and technical burden to governments, organizations and corporations.  This progress will help ensure that communities can address air quality concerns through the data gathered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase I project proposes to implement a novel means to couple a low-cost technology to detect when chemical components reach a given threshold in the air with the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles as a means of delivering the sensors to a specified location.  The sensor technology utilizes colorimetric detection of chemicals.  Off-the-shelf colorimetric sensors, combined with a unique algorithm, produce color difference maps for toxic industrial chemicals at their permissible exposure level (PEL) concentrations.  The objective of the research is to determine if the proposed approach will allow for accurate chemical sensing for a precise location.  It is anticipated that the technology to be utilized will allow for an accurate capture of a broad range of pollutants and chemical compounds along with concentration levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Kaizen Technologies? Phase I goal was to utilize unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for monitoring air quality in urban area. Through multiple conversations with stakeholders from cities, ports, and other air quality organizations we learned of the IMO 2020 initiative.  The IMO 2020 regulation requires that starting 1 January 2020, the limit for sulphur in fuel oil used on ocean going vessels operating outside designated emission control areas is reduced to 0.50% m/m (mass by mass) from the current 3.5% m/m and an even stricter limit of 0.10% m/m in emission control areas.  Based on multiple working sessions with members of the US Coast Guard (USCG) tasked with monitoring of incoming vessels and with members of the US Department of Justice (DOJ) tasked with the prosecution of offenders, we determined that there is an unmet market need to determine the sulphur content in the fuel being used by ships.  This means there is no way to effectively enforce IMO 2020 and deter or penalize companies that use these higher sulfur fuels that can contribute to greater levels of pollution and potential health issues.     Kaizen worked with multiple industry leading sensor and UAV practitioners to define a UAV based system that would enable the USCG or other organizations to effectively monitor and establish probable cause to prosecute the violators.  We conducted extensive research of other mobile air quality pilot projects, speaking with industry experts and reviewing reports from work in the US and abroad.  The team executed field tests to develop an effective sensor package to quickly and cost effectively measure sulfur fuel content, determining that the combination of CO2 and SO2 sensors with various additional hardware would be an optimal solution to deploy on a UAV.  Kaizen conducted field trials, using customized UAVs and a sensor package, monitoring emissions from ships at the Port of LA/Long Beach; the USCG, USDOJ, USEPA and California Air Resources Board participated or observed these trials.     Our Phase 1 work identified a compelling market need and made significant initial progress in defining a UAV based air quality monitoring solution for IMO 2020.  Some of the key focus areas of Phase 1 were: determining sulphur fuel content by analyzing and testing multiple sensors and approaches; defining when the sensor package is within the ship?s plume, and analyzing how different air flows would impact sensor reading.  There are many opportunities to improve our initial UAV monitoring prototype through a Phase 2: improve the response times for sensor data readings, transmission of real-time data for viewing, develop semi-autonomous UAV flights using AI to assist with plume detection, and increased UAV capabilities.  These advancements would help to enable effective enforcement of IMO 2020 as well as monitoring of multiple other dispersed air quality use cases in the future.     The broader impact of assisting with the compliance of IMO 2020 is significant from an air quality and ultimately, health perspective of the millions of people affected by air pollution from ocean going vehicles arriving and departing from ports. The compliance of IMO 2020 will result in an annual reduction of approximately 8.5 million tons of SOx. A study on the human health impacts of SOx emissions from ships, submitted to IMO?s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) in 2016 by Finland, estimated that by not reducing the SOx limit for ships from 2020, the air pollution from ships would contribute to more than 570,000 additional premature deaths worldwide between 2020-2025.     Therefore, the innovative approach that we at Kaizen Technologies are working on, by using UAVs to take a large role in the monitoring of compliance of IMO 2020, will assist in benefiting communities at risk from airborne pollution from ocean going vessels and reducing the cost of ensuring that compliance.
