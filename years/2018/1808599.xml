<AbstractNarration>Professor Nathan S. Lewis of California Institute of Technology is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program of the Division of Chemistry to study the changes in the reactivity of technologically important semiconductor surfaces that accompany the transition from small molecules to nanocrystals and two-dimensional materials, as well as from nanocrystals and two-dimensional materials to bulk crystalline solids.  The aim is to gain fundamental insight into the transition in behavior from materials comprised of individual bonds to materials formed by extended one-, two-, and ultimately three-dimensional bonding.  The project promotes the progress of science by developing novel reaction pathways that exploit the size-dependent changes in surface reactivity.  Si surfaces, small-molecule models of Si surfaces, and Si nanocrystals are selected as a critical example to provide insight into the chemical continuum from the nanoscale to the macroscale.  The novel reaction pathways being developed may enable a new generation of solar cells, new interfaces for sensors and electronic devices and new approaches to other related Si device constructs.  Graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds are involved in the project.  In addition, the research results are incorporated into Freshmen chemistry course material, integrated in outreach program towards high schools, such as Juice from Juice and Project SEAL hands-on science modules, and communicated to non-professional audiences at all levels and through multiple media outlets.       &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, new classes of reactions that are enabled by changes in the electronic structure of semiconductors that result from changes in the size and dimensionality of the material are explored.    The project is focused on determining: 1) which classes of reactions are influenced by the underlying electronic structure of the solid, 2) whether such reactions can be used to systematically achieve beneficial electronic coupling between nanoparticles, and, 3) whether such reactions can be used to covalently link three-dimensional materials, such as bulk crystals, to two-dimensional materials while also providing control over the electronic coupling of the structurally dissimilar materials.  The scope of the project includes reactions on Si surfaces, small-molecule models of Si surfaces, and Si nanocrystals.  The project also includes reactions on two-dimensional materials such as graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition-metal chalcogenides anchored to Si surfaces.  This project is also developing methods to covalently functionalize two-dimensional materials, such as graphene, to allow robust electronic connections and strong interactions between layers and in heterojunction stacks.  Functionalized two-dimensional materials are being attached to linkers covalently bonded to the Si surface, and more layers are being added to the stack using sequential addition of layers and linkers until the behavior approximates that of the bulk material on Si, as determined by XPS and optical characterization methods.  This work is developing an understanding of the point at which stacks of two-dimensional materials begin to behave in the same was as bulk materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
