<AbstractNarration>The Phenome 2018 Conference will be held February 14-17, 2018 in Tucson, Arizona.  The conference aims to accelerate U.S. research activity in the emerging field of plant phenomics, which is an approach that allows for the rapid analysis of plant traits at a massive scale.  The conference will highlight cutting-edge engineering, sensing and robotic technologies that help plant scientists understand how genome sequences and environmental influences interact to give rise to plant traits of interest. The four-day meeting will feature plenary talks, technical and networking sessions, and it will provide opportunities for meaningful engagement among plant and crop scientists, engineers and computational scientists. The interdisciplinary meeting is a joint effort of the National Plant Science Council (NPSC), the American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB) and the North American Plant Phenotyping Network (NAPPN). With NSF support, the conference will continue to attract early career researchers and participants from groups underrepresented in science. These efforts build a critical interdisciplinary community around a research area that increases U.S. agricultural competitiveness and ensures food security now and into the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Funds supported attendance and research presentations by students, postdocs and junior scientists, as well as meeting organizational functions.  The most important outcome of this support was an extremely high level of enthusiasm from attendees about the quality of the meeting, including increased buy-in from engineering and computer science disciplines, leading us to great excitement about future annual meetings.
