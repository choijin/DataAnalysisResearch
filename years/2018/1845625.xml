<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a shift towards both accuracy and affordability within the world of energy sub-metering.  This metering system will have a dramatic impact on the market for submetering commercial real estate. By drastically reducing the cost and knowledge hurdles associated with accurate submetering and bringing the costs of submetering in line with value, this technology opens the door for a mass-market approach to circuit-level energy use data. The market for this commercial submetering is expected to reach $2.5 billion annually within six years, but could grow substantially larger with the introduction of low-cost, high-accuracy technologies. Additionally, it is estimated that access to metering data alone can reduce energy consumption within a building between 5% and 15%, meaning a wide deployment of these technologies could have wide-reaching environmental and energy security benefits.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will advance the state-of-the-art in true power metering by providing revenue quality AC power submetering using an energy-harvesting, as opposed to plug-in, design. Doing so requires fundamental improvements in circuit design, embedded software architecture and signal analysis. The result is a self-contained system that drastically reduces deployment and installation costs. This project will simplify the system implementation and reduce the cost of production, and the ability for Triumvi meters to share data and, more importantly, energy harvested. Specific key technical objectives include creating a daisy-chain framework through which individual nodes within a metering system can share energy and data, improving accuracy in the myriad of potential field conditions, and creating a system of runtime-diagnostics to identify, and fix, human error in real time. Study and pursuit of these objectives will take place both in the lab, as well is in the field, where installation and accuracy can be benchmarked against conventional hardwired metering solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Triumvi real power meter project aims to develop non-contact power sensors with installed cost below $100 per submeter, and accuracy to within 1% error in real power measurement across all types of buildings, loads, and service types.  While the initial impetus for the research was the Wireless Metering Challenge issued by the Department of Energy in 2016, the decision to pursue SBIR funding was driven by real-world market opportunity.  The development of this technology will substantially advance the state-of-the-art in electricity metering, opening a substantial market for circuit-level submetering that remains untapped due to a lack of accurate and affordable solutions.   The initial research objectives stated in the Phase I application were determined by the academic research that preceded them, and some preliminary market research.  Subsequent market research, starting with the "Beat the Odds Bootcamp" and continuing throughout the research period, changed those objectives somewhat.  In certain cases, we learned that our initial objectives were not critical to commercialization, which led to their deprecation in favor of improvements more highly valued by the market. In other cases, we found that objectives had simple and effective solutions, causing us to shift our research efforts.  Over the course of the work funded by the Phase I grant, we overcame several hurdles standing in the critical path of obtaining revenue-grade true power measurements in deployments across all types of electrical panels.   As a result of our work in the Phase I process, we were able to make several substantial technical improvements, including:  the abiltiy to capture an absolute voltage signal with an accuracy rating of &lt;1%;  The ability to filter phase interference in the signals being read (i.e. improved system accuracy in 3-phase environments); and  improved system performance in low-energy environments.   The exact nature and methodology of these improvements are proprietary intellectual property, and cannot be disclosed at this time.   Intellectual merit: The Triumvi meter advances the state-of-the-art in true power metering by providing similar quality AC power submetering using an energy-harvesting, as opposed to plug-in, design. Doing so requires fundamental improvements in circuit design, embedded software architecture, and signal analysis. The result is a self-contained system that drastically reduces deployment and installation costs. This project will simplify the system implementation and reduce the cost of production, and the ability for Triumvi meters to share data and, more importantly, energy harvested.   Broader impacts: The Triumvi Meter represents a substantial shift in the state-of-the-market when it comes to energy metering and building health sensing. These devices can be installed in a matter of seconds per unit, without the need for expensive specialized labor, and yet generate the same level of accuracy ahs significantly more expensive, hardwired meters. This opens the door for near ubiquitous energy metering. We beleive that substantial energy and monetary savings will emerge, if commercial and industrial building occupants are easily and affordably able to identify where waste is occuring.
