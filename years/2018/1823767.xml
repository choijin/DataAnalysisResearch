<AbstractNarration>Nature parks often harbor both indigenous people with historic land claims and plants and animals also considered native to those spaces. The relationship between the two is usually complementary. However, biologists charged with protecting natural areas may find that globally developed policies and approaches to conservation conflict with those of the traditional local residents. The research supported by this award investigates the underlying processes that define indigeneity of plants and people, the reasons for divergences between local and global preservation approaches, and how the two might be sustainably reconciled. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out by University of Virginia anthropology doctoral student, Johnathan P. Favini, with the oversight of Dr. James J. Igoe. The researcher has chosen to conduct the research among Jamaica's Maroon population, descendants of fugitive Taino and African people who built communities in the jungled interior. In the 2000s, the forests adjacent to these communities were opened to bauxite mining, This has brought Maroons into increasing engagement with conservationists. This situation provides an excellent research opportunity to investigate how Maroons and conservationists negotiate their different approaches to ecosystem protection. The researcher will undertake 12 months of ethnographic research with local and international scientists, as well as in four Maroon communities. He will collect data through interviews, participant observation, and analysis of policy reports and media accounts. Findings from this research will inform policy makers who must find ways to negotiate with divergent indigenous and scientific groups. The research will also help anthropologists and biologists improve theoretical understanding of indigeneity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ John Favini completed research for his dissertation, "Flourishing in the Plantation?s Ruins: Jamaican Maroons, Conservation, and More-Than-Human Community" with support from the NSF Cultural Anthropology Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant. During his funding period, Favini spent roughly 11 months working with Maroons and conservationists as they sought to collaborate on various projects: including especially a movement to arrest mining in Jamaica?s interior and the collaborative management of a recently inscribed World Heritage Site.    Favini was interested in how conservationists and Maroons convince other Jamaicans that, a) Jamaica has landscapes worthy of (conservationist) protection, and b) that the Maroons are an indigenous community with long term, and culturally important attachments to Jamaican landscapes. Historically, many (Jamaicans and otherwise) have rejected both of these premises based on a sense that plantation society so thoroughly disrupted pre-Columbian ecology and society in Jamaica that no untouched nature or indigenous communities survive to the present. Favini attended to the discursive strategies Maroons and conservationists undertook to alter these rejections at various levels of removal: making pitches to local communities, national politicians, and UN representatives, among others. As part of this, he observed, Maroons and conservationists alter the significance of both "nature" and "indigenous" as concepts, opening up the possibility for both a more capacious kind of conservation and indigenous politics.  Beyond this, Favini research sought to help Maroons and conservation negotiate, or at least properly identify their differences. He also hoped and hopes to support Maroon communities in their efforts to protect their land rights.  To be completed by 2021, Favini?s dissertation will make contributions to literatures on Global Indigenous politics, nature conservation, science and technology studies, and political ecology.
