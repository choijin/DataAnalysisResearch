<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of a unique cloud computing platform with a novel database and bioinformatic software package to address the strong demand for transformative foundational resources crucial to interpret the biological function of DNA variation sequestered within and between genomes. The goal is to target a broad scope of laboratories investigating human genomics and disease, comparative and evolutionary genomics, systems biology, animal health and veterinary sciences, and wildlife biodiversity and conservation. The product will offer opportunities to advance cross-disciplinary research to keep pace with the accelerating rate of DNA sequence variant discoveries driving the extraordinary growth of the genomics industry.  This vision is founded on the continued rapid growth projections (in billions of dollars) for the genomics market and the concomitant increase in the need for integrative tools and services.  The technology will allow customers to save time and research costs, experience substantial increases in efficiency and accuracy, and explore, in precise detail, complex gene networks and pathways.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to resolve a critical impasse in genomic workflow where inconsistent or unreliable identification of DNA variant function prevents actionable discoveries. Using the customized suite of bioinformatic tools provided by this technology development, the customer will be able to interrogate the database for any gene or gene system of interest, determine the normal range of DNA changes tolerated by the gene within functional space, and screen their own data against this baseline to identify variants causative in altered biological function and phenotypic traits. The research objectives include: Compiling proprietary and novel DNA sequences from thousands of genes, establishing and confirming the precise arrangement of these gene sequences guided by shared common ancestry to create the database framework, establishing a plan for product software and content to guide the user through proper use of the database and interpret variant function, and developing strategies to ensure product security and cloud-computing service data visualization and display to protect the processing of user data when passed within the software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Supported by the NSF SBIR award, we have completed our Phase I objectives in development of a unique cloud platform product for genomic researchers consisting of a novel database and bioinformatic software package, and accessed by the user through a yearly subscription.  The product will transform research applications in targeted genomics through the rapid, accurate assessment of the impact of gene variants on biological function, phenotypic trait or disease from the millions of neutral mutations that recur over time.   We accomplished our technical goals of the SBIR Phase I project to demonstrate proof of concept for three crucial elements of the product.  The elements include: A) protocols and analytical workflows to establish and validate the central DNA sequence database; B) software tools and analytical resources to assist the end-user in interpreting variant function; and C) a detailed outline of a cloud computing platform for the product including all front and back end functions for subsequent software engineering and development; and flowcharts of how user queries will be stored, protected and processed. Our analyses with preliminary DNA sequence data offered crucial insights on the wealth of information present and we used this knowledge to expand the content and structure of product that will be available for the user.  We have organized these achievements to construct a detailed blueprint for the successful completion of product development during Phase II. Our Phase I project outcomes affirm that this product will be a powerful foundational research and development tool for diagnosis and cures in biomedicine and animal health and basic research using targeted genomics of biological function.
