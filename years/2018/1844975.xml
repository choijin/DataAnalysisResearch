<AbstractNarration>Funding from this award will support the workshop "Graduate Statistics Education at a Crossroads", to be held November 2-3, 2018 in Alexandria, VA.  The workshop will identify challenges and barriers that limit graduate statisticians from fully participating in the new era of big data.  To address these challenges and barriers, workshop attendees will craft realizable recommendations for academic departments and institutions. It is expected that these recommendations will promote model curricula, pedagogical approaches, and innovative approaches that have the potential to foster broader engagement with data science and to promote success of future statisticians in data science research and the workforce more broadly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop aligns with the training aspects of Harnessing the Data Revolution, one of ten big ideas for future NSF investment. More specifically, the workshop aims to identify an array of data-science related training activities that would support the statistics community in order that statisticians fully participate in cutting-edge interdisciplinary data science research. Additional details may be found at https://hub.ki/groups/statisticsgraduateeducation/overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This project brought together a broad group of leading educators in statistics to discuss: ?Crossroads in Statistics Doctoral Education?. This workshop took place on Friday and Saturday, November 2 &amp; 3, 2018. The aim was to develop a 10-20 year vision for PhD education in the field of Statistics, reflecting the tremendous growth in the emerging field of data science. The six-member steering committee consisted of Deborah Nolan (chair), Jennifer Hill, Nicholas Horton, David Madigan, and Daniela Witten. The webinar and the workshop were  facilitated by Donnalyn Roxey, KnowInnovation. Additionally, one pre-workshop webinar took place on October 26, 2018. At the pre-workshop webinar, ideas were sought from researchers in industry, computer science, and business. Speakers at the pre-workshop webinar were Julie Novak Beckley, Netflix, Michael Rappa, Institute for Advanced Analytics, NCSU, Renata Rawlings-Goss, South Big Data Innovation Hub,  and Padhraic Smyth, School of Information and Computer Science, UC Irvine.  The workshop outlined a roadmap for a dramatic revisioning of PhD training in Statistics. A set of six recommendations emerged from the workshop and have been summarized in a report, ?Crossroads in Statistics Doctoral Education: Re-envisioning PhD Training.? These are:   1. Holistically integrate theory and practice 2. Build a village of advisors 3. Elevate computational and algorithmic thinking 4. Forge newer forms of industry relations 5. Deprecate the classroom 6. Broaden creative work in the professoriate    Underlying these recommendations is the consideration that fundamentally the PhD is a research degree. As research scientists, our graduates should be able to contribute to the solution of real-world data-centric problems through the creation of novel statistical objects (e.g., models, methods, visualizations) or the analyses of such objects. Moreover, our graduates must have the ability to envision and conduct data-enabled research in a broad array of fields.  The recommendations outlined in the report primarily focus on post-coursework research training; in fact, the report states that the precise coursework that students undertake can and should vary from program to program and should tailor itself to the intended research topic.   These guidelines aim for a holistic integration in training, inspired by a cycle fundamental to the statistics discipline: theory informs principles, principles inform practice, and practice in turn informs theory.  For example, formal asymptotic results, like central limit theorems and strong laws, inform our notions of the behavior of averages, which in turn inform our interpretation of and modeling of aggregate measurements in practice.  Similarly, various notions of data-splitting popular in machine learning applications, necessitated by the practical need to calibrate sometimes large numbers of smoothing parameters, are informed by formal results characterizing specific versions, such as cross-validation.
