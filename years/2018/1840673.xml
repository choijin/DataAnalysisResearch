<AbstractNarration>Part 1: Nontechnical description&lt;br/&gt;Thermal radiation impacts every aspect of our daily life. Two of the best-known examples are the light emitted from the sun and from incandescent light bulbs. In both cases, the light is classified as blackbody radiation. It is random and broad spectrum, difficult to harness but easy to produce. In contrast, laser light is coherent and directional but difficult to create. In this program, we propose to study a new type of thermal radiation - in between the two extremes of blackbody radiation and conventional laser light-that could contribute to a cheaper, easier solution for generating coherent light. This study is important for fundamental understanding of a new mechanism for coherent light generation. Also, a new type of infrared emitter has important implications for DOD missions such as infrared targeting, tracking and locating applications. It could also lead to high efficiency optical sources driven by waste heat or local heaters for heat energy recycling and re-utilization purposes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the proposed research will significantly enhance optics and photonics education by engaging undergraduate students under a NSF-REU program at RPIs Physics department. Our emphasis is the interdisciplinary nature of Physics-related research. Our student target group has been and will continue to be colleges with little or no graduate research. Recruiting has been focused on under-represented groups in Physics, including women and minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2: Technical description of the project &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to explore a new class of thermal emitter based on metallic photonic crystal (PC) filament architectures. The filament will emit radiation at a 1.7 micron wavelength and exhibit laser-like input-output characteristics, i.e. "thermal laser". The scope of this proposal is to demonstrate (1) a narrow thermal emission linewidth of 10-40 nm at a peak wavelength of 1.7 micron, (2) an emission intensity exceeding the blackbody limit by 20 times and (3) a laser-like input pumping-to-output intensity characteristic. Our approach is to build thermal laser devices based on a metallic PC and an integrated resonant cavity for optical feedback. Once the experimental result is observed, it will be compared to those predicted by a quantum mechanical formulation of a thermally excited filament. The theory has two important features: (a) the optical gain is provided by incoherent pumping of localized surface plasmons inside the PC; (b) the multi-directional feedback mechanism for lasing is provided by the underlining PC. In addition, we will perform Atomic-force-microscopy and absorption spectroscopy study of a rough tungsten surface that supports the dipole-active surface plasmon resonance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the best of our knowledge, the proposed concept and realization of a "thermal laser" is the first of its kind. The successful illustration of a super-Planckian emission is important for scientific understanding. The successful development of the laser is also important for thermal photovoltaic application and for waste heat re-utilization. Since thermal radiation is broadband by nature, the thermal laser may be tailored to cover UV, visible and infrared frequencies. Finally, the PC thermal emission can be very efficient with a power conversion efficiency of &gt; 60%.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
