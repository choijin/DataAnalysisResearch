<AbstractNarration>The broader impacts/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to use a more efficient powertrain system to extend the current flight durations of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) by 3 to 4 times the currently technological capabilities. UAVs with this capability will be able to accomplish a much wider range of missions than current systems. These missions could include, but are not limited to, search and rescue, large scale industry inspection (pipelines), land survey, and high-quality photography. This powertrain also has potential applications in small scale power generation out in the field for portable electronic devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is a UAV powertrain system using a gasoline two-stroke engine with a coupled starter/generator able to produce power for flight and other onboard components. The system itself is an optimization of many components and new technologies to produce power more efficiently than anything else currently available. Research on this system has included using a state of the art test stand to optimize engine performance and development of technologies that allow a coupled starter/generator system capable of producing varied output of power independent of input shaft work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The key outcome for our I-Corps project was a final Business Model Canvas which had gone through several iterations during the program.  We interviewed over 100 indivuduals and companies to learn more about the unmanned aerial vehicle marketplace.    We learned the true value of having drones stay aloft for longer durations.  Specifically, the benefits were for the industries of solar array inspection, wind turbine inspection, electric wire inspection, volumetric monitoring for mines, geospatial mapping, surveying, pipeline monitoring, etc.  More specifically, assuming flight times of at least 4 hours, our drone would reduce their down time by at least 33% and up to 50%. At $200 an hour for labor costs alone, this makes financial sense for pilots who fly more than 10 missions a year.  We entered the 2018 Bend Venture Conference business competition and made it to the second round.  During our competition pitches, we talked about our I-Corps experience and our product market fit. I also served on an I-Corps panel for the fall 2018 Portland Cohort. We have also started a company, Rogue Approach, Inc. based on the outcome of the I-Corps training.  Rogue Approach Inc. has secured grants from the State of Oregon, as well as the Department of Defense.       Last Modified: 03/06/2020       Submitted by: Christopher L Hagen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
