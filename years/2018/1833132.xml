<AbstractNarration>This grant supports student attendance to the IEEE Cyber Security Development (SecDev) conference. Research on software security usually focuses on detecting vulnerabilities in software and attacks on resources. However, there is not much attention to how programmers can develop secure software by construction. This new conference series on Secure Development (SecDev) focuses on this problem area. The support for the conference is important for educating/training the workforce in this area, and to help provide a pathway to research careers. The technical advances presented and nurtured by the conference are important to development of secure software, which is important to society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The IEEE Secure Development Conference (IEEE SecDev) is a venue for presenting research, discussing ideas, and engaging with industry on developing secure systems.  The conference brings together researchers working on theory, techniques, and tools to "build security in" to both existing and new computing systems, not just discover insecurity in existing systems.  The 2018 SecDev conference was held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, September 30 through October 2, 2018, and featured keynotes by Dr. Dawn Song and Dr. Kathleen Fisher.  NSF grant (1833132) was awarded in early 2018 to support attendance by students enrolled in U.S. institutions. Of the 25 applications received from 17 different universities, ten students were selected to receive support, of which three were women.  These students are pursuing undergraduate and graduate degrees at Universities across the United States, including the University of California, the University of Maryland, Iowa State, Texas Tech University, and Tennessee Technological University.  The travel grant enabled these students to meet other students engaged in research, interact with leaders in the field of computer security, attend any of the seven tutorials held at SecDev this year, discuss any of the 14 papers presented, or attend the ten PSA talks presented.
