<AbstractNarration>This project will examine the value of a fully integrated service-learning-oriented chemistry curriculum.  Specifically, this project will focus on students' gains as they engage in service-learning throughout their undergraduate chemistry curriculum.  Service-learning provides students with opportunities for authentic engagement with their communities, and there is evidence that it can lead to increased student confidence and competence in the sciences.  Project objectives include: 1) developing and implementing a fully integrated, service-learning-oriented chemistry curriculum at Saint Joseph's College; 2) evaluating the specific benefits of this curriculum as students build on their evolving roles as community-engaged scientists; and 3) creating and disseminating a new service-learning-oriented chemistry instructional model called "Chemistry for the Community."  The project not only has the potential to enhance the chemistry curriculum at Saint Joseph's College, but could also provide benefits to community partners involved in the project.  These partners include younger students in K-12 classes who will have increased opportunities to actively engage in STEM activities that may foster interest and self-confidence in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop and disseminate the Chemistry for the Community model based on information gained through the implementation of the multi-year curriculum at Saint Joseph's College.  Toward this end, the project will generate new knowledge about service learning and its advantages using the following methodologies.  First, the implementation will include a control vs. treatment group assessment in the first year.  Second, multi-year implementation will enable rigorous quantification of the accrued benefits across multiple semesters.  Third, the use of SPIRES (Self-determination, Purpose, Identity, and Engagement in Science) as an assessment tool will provide new knowledge regarding scientific identity and professional disposition in the service learning modality.  Finally, a focused, sequential series of dissemination platforms (online social networks, symposium, and workshop) will help other institutions implement Chemistry for the Community, while materials developed through this project will be made available via a dedicated project website to reach institutions beyond those directly participating in the dissemination activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
