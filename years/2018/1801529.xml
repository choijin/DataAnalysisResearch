<AbstractNarration>The University of Hawaii GP-IMPACT project seeks to address the challenges of securing the future geoscience workforce in the U.S. by investigating geoscience student pathways, especially for diverse student participants. This project introduces and develops a Geoscience, Earth/Environmental Science, Ocean Science (GEO) Pathway at the University of Hawaii, that provides students with a clear academic goal and support services as they navigate their way to their intended Baccalaureate STEM major. The GEO STEM Pathway incorporates specifically designed student learning outcomes at all critical junctures of the students' progress. The pathway is designed for stop-out/move-in, so that students facing external, unanticipated challenges can leave the program with an academic credential and an established set of skills attractive to industry and rejoin the path later, once they are ready.  This pathway is more than a recommended progression of required and elective coursework and academic curriculum. The pathway employs selected high impact practices in education aimed at native Hawaiian and other STEM students at critical junctures in the pathway to support student retention and persistence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Primary goal of the University of Hawaii (UH) GP-IMPACT project is to increase the number and diversity of undergraduate students who enroll, persist, and complete a degree program in the Geology, Environmental/Earth, and Ocean (GEO) Sciences at the University of Hawaii. To accomplish this goal the UH will create a formal GEO academic pathway and college collaboration between UH Manoa School of Ocean, Earth and Science Technology (SOESTS) and the two largest community colleges in the State. This partnership will: 1. Develop engaging and sustained academic and career pathways in Geosciences from K-12 to higher education and between 2- and 4-year colleges. 2. Build capacity for career relevant geoscience programs in Hawaii; 3. Broaden participation in GEO Sciences by leveraging high impact practices for engagement of underrepresented groups, particularly native Hawaiians. 4. Provide opportunities for UH GEO students, faculty, and staff to engage in effective strategies that ensure learning, support teaching and strengthen undergraduate research experiences. The Hawaii GEO Pathway consortium envisions sustained inter-campus and UH system partnerships, a collaboratively developed and rigorous geoscience curriculum, effective recruitment, retention, and cohort experiences with strong support services and engaged learning opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
