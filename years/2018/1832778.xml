<AbstractNarration>This award is to support student travel to the International School for Space Simulations (ISSS). It was first held in 1982 in Japan as a joint collaboration between leading scientists from the US, Asia and Europe, in order to teach basic simulation techniques to students going into this growing field. The first meeting was a great success and since that time ISSS has been held on average every 2 to 3 years rotating locations between Europe, Asia, and the US. The next ISSS meeting will be the 13th in the series and following the tradition of rotating between Asia, Europe and the US will be held in the United States at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) from September 6-14, 2018. This project is for support for (non-UCLA) students to be able to attend ISSS-13. The ISSS meeting has provided new generations of students with a basic understanding of the numerical simulation techniques and is for many their first exposure to cutting edge space science research. Feedback from students over the years who have attended ISSS meetings has been overwhelmingly positive, with some saying it was their favorite meeting they attended as a student. Scores of previous ISSS students have gone on to careers in space plasma simulations as researchers, professors and civil servants at NSF and NASA. Since space science is an international endeavor, the international aspect of this meeting opens future space scientists and simulators to the world at large and initiates contacts and collaborations among scientists, researchers and students that last a lifetime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first four days of the ISSS meeting comprise the school portion and include intensive hands-on training with experts in the field such that when finished students will learn how different types of codes work, including particle in cell (PIC), hybrid and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD), and will have run the codes themselves to produce output and graph the results. Basic simulation codes are given to the students, which are theirs to keep after the meeting for further use and study. The symposium portion of the meeting is held immediately after the school portion and allows the students who have just learned the basics of the various codes to interact with world experts who conduct cutting edge research in space science. The environment of the symposium is maintained to be student friendly whereby students can feel free to ask basic questions and interact with top scientists in smaller groups or one on one sessions, either at the science presentations, poster sessions or social events meant to foster teaching and collaboration. This school and symposium approach has proven over the years to be very effective for students to maximize their knowledge gain from the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant provided funding for 26 graduate students from all over the world to attend the 13th International School/Symposium for Space Simulations (ISSS-13) held September 6-14, 2018 at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA).  Conference registration fees as well as local room and board was covered for all 26 students.  All of the students attended a very  intense week and a half of ISSS-13 with the schedule including several hands-on  tutorials in space simulation techniques and also presentations by top  scientists illustrating the use of these simulations in ongoing  cutting-edge research.  Some of the student attendees  presented posters with their own research and were able to gain valuable  feedback on their work from experts in the field.   In general the students' experience at ISSS-13 was very positive.  Most of the  students enjoyed the meeting and felt they had gained knowledge not only  in basic plasma simulation techniques, but also benefited from seeing how  these simulations are used in a practical sense by space scientists in  active research projects.  The students also found the interactions with  other international students to be invaluable both socially and as  future potential contacts.  One of the main outcomes is that the  experience of attending ISSS-13 has resulted in many of the students  becoming interested in pursuing graduate studies in space plasma  physics and careers in space science.  As with previous ISSS meetings,  ISSS-13 has fulfilled its goal of training the next generation of space  scientists in the use of plasma simulations and some will become leaders  in the field.  The funding from this NSF grant has allowed this  process, which has been going on for over 30 years now, to continue  successfully into the future, enhancing and improving the space science  community.
