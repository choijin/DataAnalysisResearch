<AbstractNarration>The proposed project seeks financial support for enhancing graduate student participation, especially those who will attend their first national meeting and those who belong to the underrepresented groups at a Conference to be held from July 7 to 12, 2019 at Bellevue Washington. The "13th International Conference on Nitride Semiconductors" will focus on a variety of III-Nitride semiconductor materials and devices. The Conference will host world-renowned experts from leading institutions around the world. An exhibition of industrial expertise related to nitride semiconductor research will also take place at the conference. The conference will foster advances in the leading research of electronic, photonic and magnetic devices. Examples of them include Light Emitting Devices (LEDs, LEDs, Laser Diodes, UV, VIS, IR); Electronic Devices (RF, THz and Power Devices); Photovoltaics, Energy Harvesting and Photo Detectors Sensors; Actuators and Acoustic Devices.  Processing, Fabrication and Thermal Management; Bulk Growth; Epitaxial Growth; Nanostructures and Nano-Devices; Optical and Electronic Properties; Defect Characterization and Engineering; Structural Analysis; Theory and Simulation; and New Materials and Device Concepts will also be addressed. In addition to technical talks, the organizers have also planned several plenary talks as well as 20 invited talks and two poster sessions. There will be short 4-hour courses focused on important topics of III-N research, including X-ray diffraction of GaN-related materials and simulation and modeling of GaN LEDs and HEMTs. The conference is expected to play a key role in identifying new directions for research. Exposing the next generation of researchers to these important disciplines is critical for learning how the new science and technology of semiconductors are developing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 13th International Conference on Nitride Semiconductors 2019 (ICNS-13) was hosted in Bellevue, Washington, Seattleâ€™s Eastside on July 7-12th 2019.   ICNS is one of two alternating premier biennial-held meetings covering all aspects of III-Nitride Semiconductor science, engineering and industry.  The workshop was very well attended, with 706 participants from 29 countries.  A total of 779 abstracts were submitted, resulting in 370 oral and 353 poster presentations. ICNS-13 offered the most direct access to researchers from around the world who are seeking technical solutions to their challenges.  Vibrant and lively debate was provided on the hottest topics in the field via Rump Session discussions on the topics of: Micro-LED Visible Emitters; Power Electronic Devices and UV Emitters.  The workshop organizers are grateful to the plenary and invited speakers, rump sessions chairs and panelists, and short-course presenters for their excellent contributions to a stimulating workshop. We would also like to acknowledge the industrial sponsors, as well as the Office of Naval Research, the National Science Foundation and the Army Research Office for their financial support, and the program committee for their tireless work in soliciting and reviewing abstracts.  NSF support allowed the conference to offer a reduced registration fee for student participants, who gained exposure to the new advances in semiconductor growth, fabrication technology, device physics, and entrepreneurship in electronics and optoelectronics. The timing of this workshop was perfect for this generation of students to learn how the new science and technology of semiconductors is developing.
