<AbstractNarration>This award supports student travel for between 10 - 20 participants to the Conference on Foundations of Nanoscience, Snowbird, Utah in April 2019. The 16th Conference on Foundations of Nanoscience will have a mixture of invited talks by distinguished speakers as well as contributed posters and open discussion periods to enhance attendee interaction with the goal of creating vibrant intellectual community in the area of self-assembly. This project will provide a substantial multidisciplinary impact to nanoscience, biochemistry and chemistry, which will profit from the introduction of key methodologies derived from mainstream computer science, such as mathematical modeling, software engineering, algorithms and modular design methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Foundations of Nanoscience meeting (FNANO) was established by the International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation, and Engineering in 2004 as a venue for the wide range of researchers interested in various aspects of self-assembly as it relates to computer science, nanoscience and nanotechnology. The meeting features multiple tracks covering recent work in different types of self-assembled architectures and devices, at scales ranging from nano-scale to meso-scale. Methodologies include both experimental as well as theoretical approaches. The conference spans traditional disciplines including chemistry, biochemistry, physics, computer science, mathematics, and various engineering disciplines. The emphasis is on basic, rather than applied research. The FNANO 2019 meeting is projected to attract 150 registered participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
