<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to allow new hardware platforms to be more quickly deployed and useful software products to be more readily made available on a wide variety of hardware to satisfy the needs of their users.  Additionally, researchers in science and engineering can reduce the runtime of their applications by hours or days on the machines inside high performance computing or data centers, enabling more scientific modeling and simulations to be completed within these centers, while allowing each individual scientist to concentrate more on his/her research, which in turn may more quickly benefit society.  For example, in the defense industry, many contracting companies develop Monte Carlo simulation software to predict outcomes from disasters. Increasing the throughput of these simulations would allow for more simulation results to be analyzed and tested, thereby resulting in better predictions and handling of disastrous situations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is unique in its automated connection between existing performance modeling and prediction tools, and pattern-driven compiler optimization. Novel runtime monitoring and modeling techniques will be developed to automatically map performance bottlenecks discovered by existing performance analysis tools to potential opportunities of source code optimizations. Such opportunities again will be used to guide pattern-driven compiler optimizations, particularly to enhance the performance of finite element methods on both GPGPUs and multi-core/many-core CPUs. Deep learning neural networks will be used to automate the runtime behavior classification of computations. The new pattern-driven specialization of compiler optimizations will enable general-purpose compiler techniques to be aware of the higher-level semantics of library abstractions (e.g., data structures and algorithm abstractions) and allow them to be collectively customized and coordinated to attain the best performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Its phase I effort focuses on creating a viable business model through market research, product design, and product validation.     Through market research and customer discovery interviews, this SBIR team has identified that their immediate customers are small to medium sized firms who conduct finite element analysis to model the quality of their product designs. The pain point of these firms is the long wait time for the existing industrial FEA packages to finish simulating their product design and the high purchasing cost if they were to try and shorten this wait time.    To fit in this market, a product has been designed to allow small and medium sized engineering companies to incorporate high performance computing into their workflow, at prices that are within their budget. A collection of open-source finite element analysis packages are identified to significantly reduce the cost of product development, and key issues are addressed to make these open-source software easy to use by industrial customers. A small group of early adapters have been identified for this product design.   A minimal viable prototype of the product has been developed to support a common use case in finite element analysis. An application case study is conducted, by using finite element analysis to solve elasticity problems, which are commonly used in structural and material analysis to understand the physical properties of products.
