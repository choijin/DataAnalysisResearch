<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for planning the long-term impact of the Dordt College agriculture stewardship center (DC-ASC) on basic research and education related to ecological sustainability in the rural Midwest.  The center is strategically located in the heart of some of the most highly productive and valued agricultural land and livestock production in the nation. The center is undergoing major change with land acquisition, building changes, and the construction of a new $4.8 million teaching and outreach center.  There is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to direct and substantially increase the long-term development and impact of the DC-ASC on basic research and education related to ecological sustainability in the rural Midwest that will serve needs of the 4-state region of Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, and Nebraska.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will bring together regional area leaders in agriculture, education, governments of states and municipalities, university extension, and businesses to develop a strategic plan for long-term direction and development of the DC-ASC to best serve the needs of the region in a responsible and sustainable manner.  The project will address regional ecological issues, future education endeavors, direction for future research of high priority in the region and will provide direction for future infrastructure development of the DC-ASC as a regional service center in service to the needs developed in the planning process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      Dordt University completed a year-long strategic planning and visioning process for its Agriculture Stewardship Center (ASC). Dordt-ASC leaders met with five key constituencies to develop a plan that maximized research and training and maximized the impact of the ASC on the broader community.  Teams of participants were challenged to creatively conceive of ideas, facilities, education, training, guiding principles, research, extension, and collaborations to drive the mission and outreach of the Dordt-ASC.  The resulting Dordt University Agriculture Stewardship Center Strategic Plan aligns with the Dordt University Strategic Plan Themes - 2020 and prioritizes the following four initiatives:   Strategic Priority 1 - Create and sustain local, regional, and international partnerships that promote research and coummuity outreach.   Based on this priority, Dordt University will continue its partnerships with Iowa State Extension, Sioux County Soil and Water Conservation District, the Land Institute and regional seed dealerships to promote stewardship, sustainablility, and water quality. On-campus faculty and staff are currently meeting with these partners and planning for the ASC's annual September field day showcasing research including alternative crops, ground covers, groundwater and surface water nitrate remediation, and pest management.  An new constituency was consulted through visits with regional and national aquaponics research groups and the Iowa DNR.  As a consequence, an aquaponics advisory board was created, a technician was hired, and a trial aquaponics system is being installed. To further expand the research and scale of an aquaponics system, grant proposals are being developed to pursue additional outside funding.  Strategic Priority 2 - Develop infrastructure to support research priorities at the ASC. In particular emphasis was placed on promoting stewardship and on modernizing research facilities and equipment.   In conjunction with this priorty, Dordt University partnered with the City of Sioux Center and with the Sioux County Fair Board to develop an infrastructure and facilities plan at the ASC. The plan envisions Dordt University facilities, shared facilities, and Sioux County Youth Fair facilities located at a common site. With this plan, the joint use facilities and youth fair facilities, which are intensively used for only a few weeks a year, can serve Dordt for the remainder of the year.  Based on the strategic plan and relationships with regional livestock producers, a facility plan has been developed for a Dordt Cattle monoslope building. This facility is designed to enhance student educational opportunities as well as to develop capabilities for on-site research.   Strategic Priority 3 - Become a regional agricultural hub for education, community training, and outreach. Developing this priority continues to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Strategic Priority 4 - Develop and promote opportunities for agriculture and pro-tech students to engage in value-added learning opportunities.   The inclusion a monoslope cattle facility and an aquaponics system will provide students experiential, year-round, entrepreneurial, management, and research experiences in beef and dairy heifer production and in fish and vegetable production.  These strategic priorities will focus Dordt-ASC research, education, and outreach efforts in the area of water quality and its relationships to integrated systems of land, soils, crops, and livestock. These efforts will be cognizant of and include research and activities to address short-term, mid-term, and long-term needs.
