<AbstractNarration>Advances in quantum information science can lead to transformative real-world applications such as quantum cryptography, which could enable ultra-secure communications that are impossible to compromise. However, such breakthroughs require overcoming difficult fundamental and technological challenges to create systems that strongly couple together light and matter, resulting in new physical properties that resemble both waves and particles. In this project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Todd Krauss and Professor Nick Vamivakas of the University of Rochester are using sophisticated laser techniques to study the unexplored physical and chemical properties of coupled light-matter systems. The discoveries from this project could have broad implications for secure communication and information technology, and other areas of national, medical, economic and security interest. The project is also providing training opportunities for the next generation of scientists in interdisciplinary research at the intersection of optical science and nanomaterials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microcavity polaritons, hybrid excitations of excitons and cavity confined photons, have been shown to exhibit unique optical and electronic properties that result in precise optical control over electron spin and/or crystal momentum. Recently, microcavity polaritons have been realized in devices that combine atomically thin semiconductor materials, and their van der Waals bonded heterostructures. This project is using ultrafast optical spectroscopy to characterize the fundamental excited state photophysics that governs light emission from microcavity polaritons (and associated excitons) and thus provide a unique window into the many-body interactions present in the coupled cavity-exciton system. Fluorescence microscopy techniques are being used to image individual photochemical reactions involving microcavity polaritons with single-reaction resolution.  By controlling the potential energy surfaces of molecules inside an optical cavity, new chemical reaction mechanisms could result via photoexcitation of cavity polaritons that will open up new reaction pathways and thus enable chemistries currently not possible using classical approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ When molecules or materials are placed inside an optical cavity, there exists the possibility for interactions between the electronic states of matter and the quantum states of light inside an optical cavity (See Figure).

Forming polaritons from purely molecular systems is generally very difficult for several fundamental reasons, while bulk crystalline semiconductors generally lack the inexpensive solution processing and facile large-scale processability required for more than proof-of-principle demonstrations.      Taking advantage of the best of both the molecular and the solid-state crystalline worlds, we were able to achieve strong coupling between the electronic states of colloidal CdSe nanocrystalline particles and the quantum-light states of a simple, vertically aligned optical cavity, forming electron-polaritons.  The formation of a polariton is verified by angle-resolved reflectance spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements. Importantly, the measured light-matter coupling strength is 20% larger than that which has been achieved to date for alternative cavity-nanoparticle designs, showcasing the strong intellectual merit of our straightforward approach to cavity and nanocrystal integration. In addition to these fundamental breakthroughs in physical chemistry and quantum optics, we have devised important protocols that can be applied more generally for the fabrication of cavity-nanoparticle integrated nanosystems. Finally, working with theoretical collaborators, we showed that the measured coupling strength of our cavity-nanoparticle integrated system is large enough to open up the possibility to use the cavity to tune the rate of an electron-transfer chemical reaction by over a factor of 10, which would be a transformative breakthrough.
