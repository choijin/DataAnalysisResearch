<AbstractNarration>The need for a robust STEM workforce is heavily discussed in policy circles. In particular there has been a multiyear decline (followed by a small rise) in the number of electrical and computer engineering (ECE) degrees awarded in the United States (National Science Board, 2016). Although the need for a growing and capable ECE workforce is well documented, how to impact college enrollments is still a matter of considerable debate. One way to potentially impact college enrollments is to support ECE-focused Making and Makerspaces. Makerspaces attract many with strong interest in ECE-related topics, including embedded systems, robotics, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and electronics manufacturing, and many Makers self-identify as having interests related to electrical and computer engineering (Dougherty, 2016). However, the facilities of most makerspaces both on and off of university campuses focus primarily on mechanical fabrication tools such as laser cutters and 3-D printers. Making is more than the creation of plastic 3-D parts, but rather has the potential to stimulate truly innovative functional solutions to problems that people care about. While Mechanical Engineering has connected strongly with the Maker Movement with advanced manufacturing, ECE programs have to date done little to leverage the strong disciplinary connections with the Maker Movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will explore how Making and Makerspaces can be used to attract students to and retain students in ECE, and the resultant changes in student learning that result from exposure to makerspaces. This activity will help advance understanding of the role Makerspaces and Making play in increasing the number and quality of ECE undergraduates. The workshop has transformative potential since it will lay the groundwork for future projects that elucidate the role Making plays in recruiting students into ECE. The plan for the workshop builds on existing meetings to reach the target audiences and enables NSF resources to be focused on under-resourced programs. The team has significant experience with both the Maker Movement and Making in engineering, and close relationships with ECEDHA and ASEE. The broader impacts of this work are significant, as Makerspaces and the Maker movement are a growing phenomenon in communities, libraries, and schools and are contributors to the United States' innovation ecosystem (Deloitte Center for the Edge and Maker Media, 2015). The plan for the workshop engages both established ECE Makerspaces while integrating participants from under-resourced schools to establish a diverse network. "Makerspace in a Box" electronic-focused giveaways will be given to participants coming from HBCUs, HSIs, and TCUs. Dissemination activities will be integrated with ongoing branding efforts by ECEDHA which will multiply the impact of the initial workshop. Follow-on workshops at ASEE, Engineering Dean's Council, Maker Faires, and NAMEPA are aimed to disseminate to critical audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
