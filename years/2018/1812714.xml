<AbstractNarration>Working in collaboration with the National GEM Consortium, the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) is hosting the GEM-ASEE Doctoral Engineering Research Showcase from January 22-23, 2018 in Washington, DC.  The target audiences include 200 doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and new faculty within fourteen months of their first appointment. Participants are engaging in a full day of interactive breakout sessions devoted to (a) advancing a research program and managing the research enterprise, (b) innovations in teaching and the promotion of learning, (c) professional service opportunities, and (d) maintaining a work-life balance. Participants are presenting their engineering, computing, and interdisciplinary research in a poster session categorized based on division names within the NSF Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) directorates. Combined with the poster session will be an "Agency/University Fair" that features representatives from federal research agencies who might wish to support continuation or extension of the participants' research as well as representatives from universities that are seeking faculty hires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the showcase, participants will be queried about the impact of the showcase on their knowledge and proficiency with various faculty tasks as well as the impact of the Agency/University Fair on their professional employment and research support prospects. In addition, participating agencies/universities will be queried as to the effectiveness of the showcase in advancing their objectives for participating.  A summary impact report will be distributed to engineering and engineering technology deans and chairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project exposes engineering doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and new faculty to the training and resources required for successful performance of academic duties. Furthermore, this project will assist participants in building networks for professional success and personal support, introducing them to sources of research support, and, for the doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows, potential avenues of academic employment. The immediate impact of this project is that up to 200 future and current engineering faculty, representing twelve percent of the current number of underrepresented minority engineering faculty, will be better prepared for their roles in the professoriate. Moreover, participants will gain a jumpstart on securing the research support that will sustain a career of intellectual contributions to their fields. The potential broader impacts of this activity include the enhanced retention and research competitiveness of new engineering faculty, particularly those drawn from underrepresented minority populations. The resultant increase in more diverse role models for engineering undergraduates and more diverse viewpoints in engineering faculty is expected to increase undergraduate persistence.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PROJECT OUTCOMES REPORT  Summary  The American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE) in collaboration with the National GEM Consortium (GEM) hosted a one and a half day Doctoral Engineering Research Showcase (DRS) in Washington, DC on January 22-23, 2018.    The Showcase brought together doctoral student, postdocs, and new faculty in engineering and computing to address some barriers and challenges for those that are in an underrepresented minority (URM)group as well offer information for attendees that were not in an URM group.   The goal of the collaboration between ASEE and GEM was to provide a platform for attendees to present their research and meet potential research sponsors and university employers while also combatting the issue of recruitment and retention of minority engineering faculty.  At the showcase over 125 doctoral students, postdocs, and new faculty were afforded the opportunity to rotate among 4 workshops geared towards helping current and future faculty become more successful in academe. These expert led workshops were interactive and were set-up to leave the attendees with tangible take-aways for better preparation for a faculty career.  Workshops included:  Building and Administering a Competitive Research Program in Engineering Strategies to Implement Innovative Teaching  Faculty Service  Maintaining Balance When Passionate Work Becomes Your Life   These workshops were led by:  current engineering professors,  a former dean of a top engineering school,  a former vice provost for faculty affairs a current chair of an engineering department   In addition, attendees heard from four dynamic plenary speakers who touched on topics such as mentoring and challenges of a faculty career.   The event also provided networking opportunities outside of sessions for attendees to interact with workshop leaders and speakers offering keen insight into how to lead a successful career in academe.  Also valuable was the networking opportunities between the students and postdocs.  Impact  The intended impact would be to increase the number of minorities that enter academe with engineering and computing disciplines and stay in the profession while helping faculty keep a healthy work-life balance.  The immediate impact of this project is that over 125 future and current engineering and computing faculty will be better prepared for their roles and provided with a jumpstart on securing the research support that will sustain a career of intellectual contributions to their fields. The potential broader impacts of this activity include the enhanced retention and research competitiveness of new engineering faculty, particularly those drawn from underrepresented minority populations, and the resultant increase in diverse viewpoints in engineering faculty, and more diverse role models for engineering undergraduates resulting in increased undergraduate persistence (Johnson and Sheppard, 2004).   Anticipated Outputs  The following anticipated outputs have been identified:  Potential increased number of underrepresented minorities going into academe Identification of research sponsors for participants? research Retention of faculty already in academe Identification of diversity and inclusion efforts that universities and agencies can employ to attract more underrepresented minorities. Build a network of peer mentors as well as career mentors A continuation of an annual event convening the same audience to provide additional resources and career support Continued collaborative efforts between minority serving organizations and engineering organizations   Post Event  Post event surveys were distributed to attendees, exhibitors, and speakers one week after the showcase to assess the relevance of the showcase to their overall goal.  Results of the surveys are available for attendees and those in the engineering and computing community.  Presentations from the showcase have also been made available on the event website to be used as reference for attendees.  Survey Results  Based on post event survey that were distributed to poster presenters, 97% were satisfied with the showcase.   When asked to compare their interest, confidence, and ability in becoming faculty before the showcase to after, the percentages in these areas increased for participants after the showcase.  This is the first showcase so baseline data on impact prior is not available.    Students and exhibitors have requested that this showcase be held annually.
