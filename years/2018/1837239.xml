<AbstractNarration>This grant supports travel of a diverse group of approximately 25 dissertation-stage students at U.S. institutions to participate in an international doctoral consortium with distinguished research faculty. The Organizational Communication and Information Systems (OCIS) doctoral consortium at the 2018 Academy of Management (AoM) convention in Chicago, Illinois, will consist of one and a half days of talks and interactions among OCIS students and researchers. The doctoral consortium provides students with feedback on their work from other students and faculty members, allowing them to enhance their own dissertation research proposals. Additionally, because of the diversity of the business sub-disciplines and communities involved in the AoM conference, the consortium will allow students to establish research connections beyond their own disciplines. Consequently, participation will allow students to develop a better understanding of the different research communities, which will facilitate their participation in future interdisciplinary research. In the past, the OCIS doctoral consortium has been a successful venue at which students can take major steps toward becoming professional researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OCIS division at the annual AoM meeting provides a leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research and practical issues related to the use and impact of information and communication technologies in organizations and society. The intellectual merit of this travel grant is that it provides a forum for doctoral students to exchange insights and receive feedback and guidance in order to enhance the quality of their dissertation research, and its broader impact lies in facilitating the establishment of new research collaborations and professional networks, as well as developing a greater awareness of ongoing cutting-edge research in the field of organizational communication and information systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

We admitted a total of 21 doctoral students and invited 7 faculty mentors. The morning session consisted of introductions followed by two roundtable sessions in which faculty mentors led discussion groups on research and methods. Groups were assigned in advance in order to match students up with faculty mentors with shared research interests and methodological expertise. For the research roundtable, all group members were asked to read each others' dissertation papers (submitted as part of the consortium application process) and come prepared to discuss them. Feedback was given by the faculty mentor, as well as by the other student participants, and students were given a chance to discuss specific challenges they were facing. For the methods roundtable, students and mentors were grouped according to broader methodological expertise and given the opportunity to discuss methodological issues related to research design, data collection, data analysis, and trends in the field. A joint lunch with the Junior Faculty Consortium provided opportunities for networking and exchange between these groups of promising new scholars. During lunch, a senior scholar in Information Systems gave a keynote to both groups. The afternoon sessions consisted of a joint talk on the publishing process by Jay Barney, the Editor-in-Chief of <em>Academy of Management Review</em> (one of the top management journals), followed by mentor stories and a panel on academic careers that included discussion of professional development topics such as developing a research program, job search, the publication process, and managing one's academic career. During these consortium events, the feedback of consortium mentors and other OCIS faculty were geared toward helping student participants understand and articulate how their work was positioned relative to other OCIS research, whether their topics were adequately focused for dissertation research projects, whether their methods were correctly chosen and applied, whether their results were being appropriately analyzed and presented, and so on. This daylong meeting was followed by a group dinner during which these discussions continued more informally. Students were encouraged to attend Professional Development Workshops sponsored by the OCIS division on Saturday, August 11 (included with their conference registration fee). A reception for the OCIS doctoral students on Saturday, 6:30 to 8:00 pm, was held to introduce students to the broader membership of OCIS and to encourage social networking among this group. At the reception, the Doctoral Consortium participants presented posters of their research and received feedback from the broader OCIS membership. With this schedule, the doctoral students were first conducted through a cohort-based and mentor-based program, then given the opportunity to network more broadly with the OCIS research community, and finally, brought together in the OCIS doctoral consortium reception focusing on our new generation of OCIS researchers. Doctoral Consortium participants were also encouraged to attend the scholarly program of the AOM conference and participate in scheduled OCIS division activities on August 12-14. Our evaluations of the OCIS Doctoral Consortium showed that participants were highly satisfied with the event, with average agreement (out of 5, where 5 = strongly agree and 1 = strongly disagree) ranging from 4.36 to 4.64 on the following statements that: the event motivated them to complete their PhD studies, helped them established a social network of peers, helped them improve the quality of their dissertation, and that they would recommend the event to other students. These ratings are in line with evaluations of the OCIS Doctoral Consortium in prior years.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/04/2019<br>      Modified by: Jennifer&nbsp;L&nbsp;Gibbs</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
