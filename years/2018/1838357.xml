<AbstractNarration>This proposal describes repairs activities to the St. Croix Very Large Baseline Array (VLBA) station on St. Croix Island.  The St. Croix station was damaged by Hurricane Maria in September 2017, and, subsequently, Congress provided funding to perform repairs via the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-123) signed into law by the President on 9 February 2018. The proposal outlines the planned activities in detail, all of which are in support of returning the site to a world-class working science observatory, and reinstating the full capabilities of the VLBA.  Observations obtained by the VLBA with St. Croix contribute to the fulfillment of scientific goals set out by astronomy communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Background: In September 2017 the island of St Croix was hit by two category-5 hurricanes: Irma on September 6 and Maria on September 20. On December 18, 2017, the US House of Representatives introduced HR Bill 4667 to fund hurricane and wildfire disaster relief.  The St. Croix Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) antenna and site infrastructure were damaged by the Hurricanes in September 2017. This project includes elements that will allow recommissioning of the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) antenna on the island of St Croix and improves the site infrastructure to make it more robust and self-reliant in the event of future severe weather.  The project was in support of returning the site to a world-class working science observatory, and reinstating the full capabilities of the VLBA.This project included elements that will allow recommissioning of the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) antenna on the island of St Croix and improves the site infrastructure to make it more robust and self-reliant in the event of future severe weather.  Outcomes: All infrastructure repairs and improvements are successfully completed, and the result was the station returned to service for conducting research as well as bringing the results of its research to the general public.  Repair of Station Antenna Infrastructure: The VLBA station completed needed repairs including welding, rust abatement and painting of the structure. These repairs enable the station to return to service and improve reliability.  Site Station infrastructure: Station infrastructure work completed including the replacement of damaged equipment, repair of damaged buildings and fences that were in need of repair.  Fiber Data Transport: Fiber data transportation was installed to improve internet reliability to support the VLBA mission.
