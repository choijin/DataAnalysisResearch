<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) /Machine Learning (ML) driven solution to automate the process of giving qualitative feedback on student reflections. The automated reading of student reflections for quality and content is a new and innovative technology that is currently not available in the market, as all applications in this realm focus on grammar and writing structures. The innovation will understand the specific actions and strategies students are using (many of which are unique to an individual learner), and help students get the support they need to improve in those techniques or try new ones. This process would build learning skills and growth-oriented belief systems in students, both of which lead to significantly improved academic and career outcomes. Fundamentally, the proposed project will help students learn how to learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project will build the first phase of personalized insights for impactful student goal-setting and reflection. The company will leverage natural language processing (NLP) and ML algorithms to 1) parse, process, and analyze reflections written by students, 2) return a score for each reflection based on a research-based rubric, and 3) notify teachers when a student has a low score and needs support. At the end of Phase I, the company will examine whether the prototype functions as intended with 90%+ accuracy, if teachers can integrate the prototype into their classroom practice, and if it shows early promise of improving the quality of student reflections and learning. With a proprietary dataset of 400K+ written student reflections and data points, the company is uniquely positioned to develop and scale this product vision. Phase II research will develop personalized feedback, strategies and suggestions to help students and teachers find the best strategies faster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Sown To Grow (STG) is developing an online platform that empowers learners through goal-setting, reflection, and strategies to improve. In the software, students set learning goals, track their own progress, and write reflections on the learning strategies that work best (or new ones to try).  In the process, students develop critical Social Emotional Learning (SEL) skills including self awareness, self regulation/management, self efficacy, and perseverance. Metacognition, the capacity to understand and evaluate ones own learning process, and learning strategies are critical drivers of these skills. Students learn how to self-monitor, connect specific actions with improvements, and develop a plan when they struggle. With feedback from teachers and insights from the software, students get better at the process of learning and have significantly stronger academic outcomes.  With the support of an NSF award, SBIR Phase I: A K12 Goal-Setting And Reflection Platform That Builds Student Learning Skills And Mindset, STG sought to build advanced technology to power the platform and amplify impact. The core algorithm uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to read student reflections, assess quality against a research-based rubric, and help teachers identify where gaps existed and how they could be improved. STG was able to develop an algorithm that replicated human raters with 83% accuracy, and incorporating the outcome of this algorithm into a prototype used by teachers. In a post-prototype survey, 86% of teachers said that the reflection quality functionality improved the reflection experience for their students.    Broader Societal Impacts Extensive learning science research demonstrates that SEL skill development has a strong connection to academic achievement. Gaps in academic mindset - a leading indicator of SEL capacity - disproportionately affect students from low-income communities (Claro, 2016). A 2015 bipartisan report from the AEI / Brookings Working Group identified developing SEL skills in concert with academic skills as a crucial component of helping children on the bottom rungs of the economic ladder to improve their educational achievement and attainment and thereby reduce the income gap. Initial evidence from pilot classrooms showed the potential impact of STG's reflection quality functionality. At an Austin ISD middle school serving majority low-income students, an algebra teacher had her students use STG to track and reflect on their performance on classroom exit tickets, quizzes, and exams in each unit during the 2018-'19 school year. In an informal study that compared the studentsperformance to her students from the previous school year, Her students showed a 34% increase in percentage of students who exceeded expectations on the STAR test (end of year standardized test). In discussions with the STG team, the teacher stated that if she asked her students, they would point directly to reflecting as the reason for this increase, and that she would agree. The data reinforces this; her students showed significant improvement in the quality of their reflections over the course of the semester. In addition to making the reflection quality measurement functionality widely available to teachers around the country, STG is also exploring opportunities to partner with several forward thinking districts and education organizations to build out a more comprehensive protocol for building SEL skills, with the reflection quality measurement as an integral part of the protocol.    Intellectual Merits While the practice of reflecting on your work is not necessarily new, STG is not aware of any previous attempts to categorize and measure the quality of student reflections.
