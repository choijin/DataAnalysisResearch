<AbstractNarration>This renewal Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site: Developing entrepreneurs in energy storage, catalysis and biofuels, at Louisiana State University (LSU), will annually engage undergraduate students traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields in energy related research with a focus on innovation and a special emphasis on entrepreneurship.  The goal is to expose future scientists and engineers to the mechanisms whereby advances in basic science are transitioned to practice via academic labs, industry and technology start-ups. The research focus of the REU program will be structured around a common energy theme with sub-topics including energy storage, catalysis, and biofuels. LSU has a strong history in energy research, from early work in oil and gas processing to current work in catalysis, biofuels, and energy storage. LSU is located in the heart of petrochemical country and has developed relationships with many of the top petroleum and chemical companies in the world. PhD engineers from several of these companies will mentor the REU students on the importance of high quality research in industry and the types of careers available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 10-week summer program will provide REU participants with experience in world-class hands-on energy related research and will prepare them to pursue graduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees. In addition to enabling students to become independent researchers in the fields of energy storage, catalysis, and biofuels, the most unique aspect of this REU will be the training of students in the fundamentals of entrepreneurship and industrial technology development. Weekly seminars, field trips, and workshops provide students with research skill development and professional development topics such as ethics, patents, and intellectual property. Students will also receive direct mentoring on entrepreneurship from faculty who have successfully launched start-up companies and mentors from the LSU Innovation Park. Additionally, LSU is home to the Louisiana Business and Technology Center (LBTC), a world class technology and small business incubator. The LBTC currently has 36 companies founded by LSU students and collectively those companies employ 150+ people and have over $5,000,000 in capital raised to date. The LBTC will host a workshop to train the REU students on the keys to successful entrepreneurship and what it takes to get an idea into practice. These excellent training opportunities along with the chance to work on cutting edge energy research projects will certainly inspire more students to attend graduate school to have the tools necessary for a career in innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
