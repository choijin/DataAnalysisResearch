<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercialization potential of this SBIR project is an electrochemical water treatment technology which has the potential for minimizing cost, requiring little to no maintenance, and comprehensively treating harmful contaminants such as pathogens, toxic organics, and metals in drinking water.  About 80M U.S. homeowners are seeking a water purification solution for fear of their water quality. They are unsatisfied with the high maintenance, long-term costs, and lack of comprehensive treatment capabilities of existing systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to optimize, demonstrate, and scale an electrochemical water purification system for residential point-of-entry application. Existing water purification systems are largely ineffective in comprehensively treating contaminants such as pathogens, toxic organics, and metals, and also require frequent maintenance which contributes to high costs and waste generation. To address these concerns, the treatment effectiveness, cost, and feasibility of treating water contaminated with pathogens and toxic organic compounds by the proposed electrochemical technology will be studied in laboratory and pilot scale applications. Design parameters will be optimized for highest treatment capability and lowest costs and maintenance needs. Prototypes will be scaled for pilot evaluation at flow rates for residential point-of-entry application and evaluated for robustness. The laboratory and pilot units will be evaluated for perfluorinated compound (PFC) removal consistent with NSF/ANSI P473 and for pathogen disinfection following EPA Purifier Standard Certification. PFC removal and disinfection are keys to proving a comprehensive water purification solution for decentralized treatment. The end result will be a small product automated by sensors that connects directly in-line with a building's plumbing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The NSF Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Grant was awarded to Aclarity, LLC for the performance and feasibility evaluation of electrochemical advanced oxidation technology for water purification. The main objectives of this grant were for optimizing, demonstrating, and scaling an electrochemical water purification system for residential drinking water applications. The Aclarity team accomplished these goals, creating two devices: a point-of-use (POU) product that was designed to handle between 0.5 and 3 GPM and a point-of-entry (POE) product design to handle between 5 and 10 GPM.  Aclarity currently offers both of these devices for sale.  The most difficult challenge was optimizing treatment effectiveness while ensuring that other features important to the homeowner were remained, such as low maintenance, low cost, and ease of use.  The Aclarity team evaluated several parameters to accomplish this goal, including the electrode configuration, gap, size, surface area, and flow rate.  After finding an effective design, the devices were then scaled up for pilot use at higher flow rates, then adjusted and evaluated for robustness, and subsequently tested successfully against other contaminants such as perfluorinated compounds (PFC).  This grant allowed Aclarity to accelerate the design and commercialization of their water purification devices, setting it up to be a market leader in electrochemistry.
