<AbstractNarration>With more than two million airline passengers daily, it is critical that the nation has skilled technicians to build and maintain safe, reliable aircraft. To meet the acute need in the aeronautical industry for well-trained technicians, Trident Technical College will enhance its hands-on training and create course materials that other institutions can adopt. In this project, at least nine new avionics labs and 29 modified aeronautical labs will be developed to improve courses that lead to certificates and associate degrees. The project will work closely with industry partners while developing the curriculum, to ensure the relevance of this training. As a result, the quality of the courses will increase, with the potential to increase employment opportunities for students completing the program. The project aims to help students master the technician skill sets needed in the aeronautical industry, and to prepare students to pursue the necessary Federal Aviation Administration certification for employment. Outreach activities will serve a broad and diverse population of students, with the goal of promoting their interest in aeronautics and technician careers. This project will strengthen the training of technicians in a field critical to national aviation safety, as well as engage students in aeronautical and STEM fields of study to support a diverse STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to enhance the preparation and abilities of students in aeronautical programs at Trident Technical College. It will offer courses and hands-on training with state-of-the-art, industry-standard equipment and a simulation-based maintenance training tool. The project aims to develop rigorous curriculum materials that foster an environment of student learning and success through hands-on experiences. Students will be able to interact with, test, and troubleshoot actual aircraft components and avionics systems to fully understand the requirements of working on a flight deck. Partnerships with industry will be strengthened through collaboration on developing and reviewing the student learning objectives, curriculum, and laboratories. The curriculum and hands-on labs will be shared on the ATE Central online repository. Outreach efforts will include promoting the interest of K-12 students in learning about aeronautical and STEM careers. The broad dissemination of the curriculum and lab activities developed in this project will potentially benefit technical education at postsecondary institutions nationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
