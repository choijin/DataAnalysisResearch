<AbstractNarration>The Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security (GameSec), established in 2010, aims to bring together researchers who aim to establish a theoretical foundation for making resource allocation decisions that balance available capabilities and perceived security risks in a principled manner. GameSec 2018 presents a valuable opportunity for researchers to share their results and learn about the state of the art in the application of decision and game theory in security.  It will also offer PhD and MS research students a unique platform to learn the recent advances in this area and encourage them to take initiatives in research and produce more results. This award is for travel grants to students to support their participation in this important event. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference focuses on analytical models based on game, information, communication, optimization, decision, and control theories that are applied to diverse security topics. The connection between theoretical models and real world security problems help establish a feedback loop between theory and practice. The conference helps to promote a "science of security" with a theoretical foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
