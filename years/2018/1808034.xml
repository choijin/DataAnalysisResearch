<AbstractNarration>In early October 2017, multiple wildfires ignited across Northern California's (CA) premier winegrowing region, incinerating vineyards and neighboring communities, with as yet unknown consequences for hydrology, biogeochemical cycling, water quality, and human and ecosystem health. This is a particularly important region to study the impacts of wildfire, as changes to soils and hydrology will likely affect the fate of the large reactive sulfur (S) loads applied to vineyards each year for powdery mildew control. Widespread S use may have consequences for adjacent ecosystems similar to those of inadvertent atmospheric S deposition (i.e., 'acid rain'), such as stimulating production of methylmercury, a potent neurotoxin. Given that wildfire may accelerate mobilization of S and other materials to adjacent aquatic ecosystems, the need to pursue this research has now become urgent. The study will address the immediate effects of wildfire on hydrological flow paths and mobilization of S from vineyards to streams. The project team will instrument a burned and unburned vineyard catchment with subsurface soil water and surface water (runoff and stream) collectors. They will conduct field observations of hydrologic flows during the first large rain events of the wet season to quantify mobilized S, C, and sediment, perform a laboratory experiment to determine chemical losses from burned and unburned soils over time, and develop methods to trace S in the environment. This study will provide a dataset critical for proceeding with longer-term efforts to develop field studies, experiments, and models to elucidate the ultimate fates and consequences of agricultural S use at the basin scale - a new area of research to understand human manipulation of the S cycle. This one-year project will be led by a female assistant professor, train a female graduate student, and provide data that will be important for farmers and other stakeholders. The research group will communicate their findings broadly in multiple workshops within the study region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this one-year field- and laboratory-based study is to provide an important dataset detailing the effects of recent, widespread wildfire on mobilization of agricultural sulfur (S) from vineyards to streams in the North Coast California winegrowing region. These data are a critical baseline to capture prior to initiating a new wave of research: determining the unintended consequences of high S applications in regional agricultural systems. The biogeochemical and ecological effects of high S use may be similar to those of inadvertent atmospheric S deposition (i.e., "acid rain"), but they have not yet been studied in vineyards or other crop systems. In particular, agriculturally-derived S may stimulate production of methylmercury in aquatic ecosystems downgradient of source areas, threatening the health of humans and wildlife. This study will make the first measurements of S, carbon (C), and sediment mobilized from burned vineyards to streams during the onset of the rainy season, and develop new geochemical and isotopic methods for tracing agriculturally-derived S species in the environment. To this end, the project team will instrument a burned and an unburned vineyard catchment with runoff collectors, ISCO stream samplers, soil water samplers, and soil moisture sensors to quantify hydrological flow paths and assess their chemical composition. They will also conduct burned and unburned soil core leaching experiments to determine the evolution of chemical losses over the course of a simulated wet season. These activities will test two hypotheses: (1) If the heat input from fire has dramatically changed surface soil properties relative to unburned vineyards, moderate-to-high intensity rain events will cause surface runoff that rapidly (minutes to hours) transports S, C, and sediment from burned vineyards to streams, and (2) If surface runoff dominates the hydrologic response in burned vineyards, then mobilized S species will have a light isotopic value, reflecting minimal interaction with the soil matrix.</AbstractNarration>
