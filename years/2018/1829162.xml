<AbstractNarration>The NSF IUCRC Center for Disruptive Musculoskeletal Innovations (CDMI) is hosting a public workshop in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  entitled "Orthopedic Sensing, Measuring, and Advanced Reporting Technology (SMART) Devices". The goal of the workshop is to: 1) to gain better understanding of current state and future possibilities of Orthopedic SMART device technology; and 2) begin to identify/establish appropriate regulatory framework to promote use of the technology and protect public health.  Public input and feedback gained through this workshop may aid in the efficient development of innovative, safe and effective, orthopaedic SMART devices, for better patient care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
