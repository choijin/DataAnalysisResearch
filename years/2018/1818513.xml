<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Karen I. Goldberg of the University of Washington to improve the general mechanistic understanding of key reactions needed to design catalysts that enable an energy efficient, environmentally benign and cost-effective transformation of hydrocarbons. New catalytic methods that selectively convert the carbon-hydrogen bonds of hydrocarbons to yield higher value products have the potential to impact large-scale chemical production.  New processes may eventually permit industrial chemists to achieve more sustainable processes by employing available and underappreciated carbon feedstocks, and abundant, non-toxic reagents in production.  Within this project, the mechanisms of specific reaction steps involved in hydrocarbon functionalization, such as carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage and incorporation of oxygen from air, are being carefully investigated for their optimal application in selective catalysis. A diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students is being trained in modern methods for studying catalysis and mechanism.  Students are encouraged to pursue careers in science, with emphasis on the need for a strong workforce of effective independent scientists.  Outreach to high school students and the general public is being planned to communicate the vital role of catalysis research in finding new energy efficient and environmentally benign methods for making many everyday products from plastics, to paints, to pharmaceuticals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Goldberg is developing a detailed mechanistic understanding of fundamental organometallic reactions with potential applications in the functionalization of carbon-hydrogen bonds of hydrocarbons, including selective methane oxidation. New strategies for activating carbon-hydrogen bonds, for selectively activating and incorporating oxygen into metal-alkyl bonds, and for regioselective olefin hydroarylation transformations are being investigated.  Key model reactions are being studied, and through investigations of these stoichiometric and catalytic reactions, critical variables for promoting these transformations are being determined.  Insights concerning specific coordination environments, metal and ligand options, substrate requirements and reaction conditions that favor particular reaction steps are envisaged.  The mechanistic information gleaned from these studies may have a distinctly broader impact on catalysis research, in both academic and industrial settings.</AbstractNarration>
