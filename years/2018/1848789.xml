<AbstractNarration>STEM undergraduate education research has developed over the past decades to include numerous frameworks that support rigorous evaluation and dissemination of undergraduate science education approaches. By contrast, STEM graduate education research has not yet developed sufficient frameworks (e.g., journals, conferences). This has led to inefficient dissemination of evidence-based approaches and challenges for implementation of effective practices. This National Science Foundation award to the University of Massachusetts Medical School will support a workshop that will seed action to develop resources and frameworks for disseminating evidence-based educational approaches for doctoral STEM education, with a particular focus on effective practices for PhD career development, a rapidly growing field within graduate education that has urgent dissemination needs. The workshop will serve to cultivate a multi-stakeholder community with shared concerns, a passion for graduate education, and a desire to advance educational practices that enhance the career preparedness of PhD scientists. The priorities and next steps identified through this workshop will seed future initiatives and enable STEM doctoral programs to more effectively and efficiently address the training needs for the next generation of scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The one-and-a-half-day workshop will focus on an area that is consistently highlighted as a need in national reports on STEM graduate education, but which has received little attention: the lack of a national infrastructure for coordinating and curating dissemination of materials supporting innovative doctoral educational models. The workshop will bring together stakeholders with expertise spanning dissemination, evaluation, career development, and graduate education, to define actionable next steps for enhancing the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based educational approaches for PhD career development. This workshop will use panel presentations, stakeholder-focused group discussions, mixed-expertise small group discussions, and full group report-outs to define the most critical issues and recommended actions for dissemination of evidence-based practices. The workshop will generate a list of the needs, challenges, and barriers to dissemination and implementation of educational models, informed by the diverse viewpoints of key stakeholder groups, and will identify a list of recommended next steps, including how each stakeholder group can contribute to enhancing evaluation and dissemination of approaches. The workshop will result in a report synthesizing findings, including actionable next steps focused on individual, stakeholder group, and national efforts. This report will help stakeholders take informed action in a coordinated manner to avoid redundancy and amplify investments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is funded by the NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program.  The NRT Program (17-585/18-507) is designed to encourage the development and implementation of new, potentially transformative models or approaches for STEM graduate education training that address changing workforce and research needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Sustainability of the scientific enterprise requires being able to recruit, retain, and prepare generations of PhD-trained scientists ready to adapt with the evolving needs of the scientific workforce and society. The need for scientists in a variety of roles both within and beyond academe necessitates a broadened, trainee-centered view on training--including a focus on career planning, science across sectors, and development of professional skills. Although there is energy and movement among players in the higher education landscape to enhance graduate and postdoctoral training, actions remain disparate, leading to inefficiencies in implementation and lack of systemic change.     To address this challenge, Professional Development Hub (pd|hub) hosted a stakeholder workshop, Enhancing Dissemination of Evidence-Based Models for STEM PhD Career Development (NSF 1848789), on July 11-12, 2019 at the Janelia Research Campus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Through this workshop, organizations and individuals came together across stakeholder groups to hear new perspectives, see challenges through different lenses, and work together to define actionable next steps for enhancing the development, dissemination, and widespread implementation of evidence-based practices for STEM graduate and postdoctoral education, with specific emphasis on career and professional development for PhD scientists. The workshop brought together fifty participants representing stakeholders including career development practitioners, scientific societies, disseminators, education researchers and evaluators, employers of PhD scientists, funders, professional associations, trainees, and university leaders and faculty. The workshop was structured with design thinking strategies and organizational change theories in mind, to move the conversation from understanding needs and challenges to defining and moving forward critical actions and solutions.     INTELLECTUAL MERIT     Participants at the workshop identified the following key challenges to enhancing evidence-based STEM PhD career development:  The need for a trainee-centered perspective in PhD training; The challenge of undervaluation of PhD career and professional development; The challenge of misaligned incentive and reward structures for enacting change in graduate and postdoctoral education; and The need for cross-stakeholder communication and collaboration.   Participants also defined five critical actions to address these challenges:  Incentivizing change at institutions and programs, and establishing accountability; Curating and disseminating resources for evidence-based career and professional development models in a way that supports widespread implementation; Broadening and deepening evidence for effective career and professional development training and mentoring; Improving communication within and across stakeholders in STEM PhD education; and Creating definitions and expectations for STEM PhD career and professional development.      These outcomes are further described in the workshop report, publicly available at http://pdhub.org or https://doi.org/10.13028/79a5-ym66 .      Workshop participants' reflections indicated that they deeply valued being able to connect with diverse individuals across multiple stakeholder groups and to see challenges and actions from new perspectives. An evaluation conducted one year post-workshop revealed that participants have advanced multiple proposed actions through collaborations, ongoing discussions, or active involvement with working groups formed at the workshop.     BROADER IMPACTS     This workshop defined and catalyzed actions that will support the transformation of doctoral and postdoctoral scientific training to better address the diverse professional roles in which scientists are needed to conquer society's greatest challenges. Several actions have moved forward--many facilitated or supported by pd|hub--in the months following the workshop:  Disseminating--and supporting implementation of--peer-reviewed Collections of evidence-based educational approaches for graduate and postdoctoral career and professional development. This pd|hub project was recently awarded funding from the National Institute for General Medical Sciences. Establishing a pd|hub Coalition of Higher Education Organizations, a cohort of nine national organizations with a commitment to advancing career and professional development as a core component of doctoral and postdoctoral training. Formed at the workshop, the Coalition has continued to meet regularly to share resources and maximize synergy amongst complementary national efforts. Supporting a group of scientific societies, formed as a result of the stakeholder workshop and now meeting regularly, to share resources and identify joint projects for advancing PhD and postdoctoral career and professional development in areas of cross-disciplinary relevance. Organizing a cross-stakeholder team of individuals to move forward actions to build capacity for evaluation and research in PhD career development. Expanding engagement with broader communities to continue defining next-step actions through workshops, listening sessions, and gatherings at conferences.      By bringing cross-disciplinary actors together to jointly identify challenges and goals, the workshop successfully seeded efforts to build capacity for disseminating evidence-based practices in STEM doctoral and postdoctoral education. These projects will enable universities to efficiently access, implement, and evaluate evidence-based educational approaches to identify best practices and clear the way for catalyzing further innovation. Collectively, these actions will support modernization and ongoing evolution of doctoral and postdoctoral education, ensuring that national investment in training early-career scientists leads to development of a diverse, highly skilled, and competitive STEM workforce ready to address the challenges of the 21st century.
