<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)&lt;br/&gt;Phase I project is to save lives through the proliferation of miniaturized automated external&lt;br/&gt;defibrillators that attach to smartphones. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) will kill more than 325,000&lt;br/&gt;Americans this year outside of the hospital. An SCA can cause death if it is not treated in&lt;br/&gt;minutes. If an AED is available, it can save a person's life; some estimates suggest a 27% increase&lt;br/&gt;in the number of people who could be saved if AEDs are available and used when needed. A&lt;br/&gt;miniaturized AED embedded in a smartphone case could save lives by making AEDs more&lt;br/&gt;available and ensuring those who carry them are reachable by emergency medical services. The&lt;br/&gt;strategy is to equip law enforcement, firefighters, EMS personnel, and potential citizen first responders&lt;br/&gt;with this device and use smartphone technology to ensure they are reachable when&lt;br/&gt;in proximity to someone experiencing an SCA. It provides an opportunity for a new paradigm in&lt;br/&gt;first response: AED carriers that can be located during the first critical moments of an SCA.&lt;br/&gt;Through this research, hundreds of thousands of lives can be saved each year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will prove out the concept of a&lt;br/&gt;regulatory-compliant miniaturized AED that integrates with a smartphone. The work includes&lt;br/&gt;researching and designing components and electronics that will enable creation of this critical&lt;br/&gt;medical device and accomplish three overarching goals: (1) design and develop the miniaturized&lt;br/&gt;components, interconnects, firmware and software necessary to implement the hand-held AED&lt;br/&gt;Smartphone case in Phase Two by evaluating high voltage power supply and switching&lt;br/&gt;electronics and completing a power converter and switching design capable of generating the&lt;br/&gt;required energy from an on-board lithium-ion battery and supporting a bi-phasic waveform; (2)&lt;br/&gt;develop the smartphone software and firmware necessary to implement the device itself, guide&lt;br/&gt;a user through the emergency protocol, and send GPS information to EMS to allow them to&lt;br/&gt;locate proximal first responders; (3) integrate the hardware and software into a prototype that&lt;br/&gt;demonstrates a path to a form factor function unit in Phase 2. Research and designs of&lt;br/&gt;interconnects and encapsulation methods developed as part of this effort will offer insight into&lt;br/&gt;the miniaturization of myriad electronics both within and outside the medical domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
