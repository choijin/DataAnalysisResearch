<AbstractNarration>The SPARC program promotes the use of spatial analysis, 3D modeling, aerial and geophysical remote sensing technologies in archaeological research projects around the world. The increasing availability and sophistication of these technologies and methods profoundly affects how archaeologists and other scholars work. The things archaeologists study - from artifacts to sites to landscapes - almost always have a spatial component and for many decades space has been viewed as one of the central dimensions of archaeological study. The capabilities of geospatial technologies to enhance the discovery and interpretation not only offers new data, but also creates entirely novel means of engaging with the archaeological record. Through the SPARC Program high-impact projects seeking to explore and implement geospatial technologies and methods are selected based on peer reviewed applications. Their work is supported through close collaborations with experts in spatial archaeometry at The University of Arkansas' Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies (CAST), the University of Glasgow and Dartmouth University. Together, the teams at these institutions form a center for innovative geospatial research and methods in archaeology. Technical experts and research staff at CAST, Dartmouth and Glasgow actively promote geospatial technologies in archaeology, and collaborate with the selected projects, providing access to equipment, methodological and domain expertise, and intensive training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Program's goals are to: enhance the research productivity of archaeological projects by making geospatial technologies available to researchers who would not otherwise have access to the tools or skills needed to collect and analyze these data; directly generate high value archaeological data by participating in fieldwork and analytical projects to efficiently collect and analyze geospatial data; provide training opportunities for students and professionals seeking to use geospatial techniques in their own research; promote the development of new geospatial methods and applications in archaeology and the visibility of these innovations in the broader archaeological community; and support good practice and promote innovation in archiving and publication of digital geospatial data. The new support from the NSF Archaeometry program will allow SPARC to continue building a program that is increasingly visible - attracting top research projects; efficient - as project staff build on their experience; high impact - as pilot projects build skills in research teams around the world; and innovative - with broader collaborations leading to significant methodological advancements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
