<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to provide partial support for the 2019 Dynamics Days conference to be held January 4-6, 2019, on the campus of Northwestern University and at the Hilton Orrington Hotel in Evanston, Illinois. Dynamics Days is an annual conference on nonlinear dynamics and its applications.  It has established itself as a premier conference for promoting new collaborations in applied math and nonlinear science; it has been hosted at rotating sites in the US for nearly 40 years (since 1982).  Due to the broad applicability of nonlinear dynamics, the conference is highly interdisciplinary, including areas such as physics, engineering, mathematics, biology, and computer science.  This year, the focus of the conference will be on six themes: neuroscience, complex fluids, data-driven &amp; machine learning methods, nonlinear materials, complex networks, and human/biological systems. The main goals of the conference are to gather leading researchers with young investigators and students to promote cross fertilization and dissemination of ideas, and to engage students. The conference webpage is http://ddays2019.northwestern.edu/. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference will have 16 invited speakers and a similar number of contributed talks, as well as short "flash" presentations and poster sessions.  No parallel sessions will take place; all attendees are expected to attend all talks in order to promote discussion across application fields.  Support provided by the NSF will be used primarily to offer scholarships to allow participation of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars.  Participants from underrepresented groups will be especially encouraged to attend the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Dynamics Days is an annual conference on nonlinear dynamics and its applications.  It has established itself as a premier conference for promoting new collaborations in applied math and nonlinear science, and has been hosted at rotating sites in the US for nearly 40 years (since 1982).  Due to the broad applicability of nonlinear dynamics, the conference is highly interdisciplinary, including areas such as physics, engineering, mathematics, biology, and computer science.  This year, particular focus was on six themes: neuroscience, complex fluids, data-driven &amp; machine learning methods, nonlinear materials, complex networks, and human/biological systems.  The conference has a single session format that enables researchers in different application areas to share methods and ideas.  It includes a mix of students, early-career faculty, and senior researchers, as well as a diverse set of invited speakers and attendees. For the students who attend, the conference serves as a chance to learn about applications of dynamical systems to real-world problems across the scientific spectrum.  It also gives many of them the opportunity to present their own research, either via a talk or poster.  Because of NSF funding, this year we were able to provide free or near-free attendance for all students who requested support.  Similarly, researchers who attend also learned about exciting new work being done, often in fields adjacent to their own.  Since all researchers see the same talks and spend several days together in an intensive scientific environment, "cross-fertilization" often occurs and new research projects/collaborations are often begun.   As a taste of the wide range of applications, the following were talks given by this year's invited speakers:  Sculptures      formed by fluidic erosion and dissolving (Leif Ristroph, NYU Courant) Systems      analysis of wall turbulence: Characterizing natural and synthetic      self-sustaining and self-similar processes (Beverley McKeon, Caltech) The      plumber's nightmare: modeling sugar export from a leaf (Thomas Bohr,      Danish Technical University) Using      machine learning to analyze chaotic systems (Ed Ott, U. Maryland) An      approach to locating interesting structures in flows (Jonathan Rubin, U.      Pittsburgh) Controlling      populations of neural oscillators (Jeff Moehlis, UC Santa Barbara) Data-driven      dynamic models in neuroscience (Bing Brunton, U. Washington) Data      driven machine learning approaches to monitor and predict events in      healthcare. From population-level disease outbreaks to patient-level      monitoring (Mauricio Santillana, Harvard) Spatio-temporal      dynamics of swarm robotic systems (Andrea Bertozzi, UCLA) The      dynamics of malaria infection (Lauren Childs, Virginia Tech) Stable      chimeras and independently synchronizable clusters in coupled oscillator      networks (Takashi Nishikawa, Northwestern) Earth's      excitable carbon cycle (Dan Rothman, MIT) Complexity      science to study macroscopic dynamics in traffic and behavioral patterns      (Marta Gonzalez, UC Berkeley) The      dynamics of acoustically levitated granular matter (Heinrich Jaeger, U.
