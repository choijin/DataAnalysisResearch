<AbstractNarration>The award will support participant travel costs for the 2018 Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES)-Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering (CMBE) Conference being held at the Leows Coronado Resort, CA from January 2-5, 2019. The CMBE field is experiencing exponential growth, with the subfield of mechanobiology being a significant driver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference program includes podium sessions with keynote and topical invited speakers, including both women and members of underrepresented groups. The primary objective of the meeting is to broaden the boundaries of current capabilities in cell and molecular bioengineering through pursuit of fundamental research, development of novel techniques and biological models, and translation of these discoveries into real-world technology and medical applications. The conference will introduce and integrate a diverse group of engineers and basic scientists possessing clinical and/or entrepreneurial experience. Invited speakers and keynotes will discuss how they bridge the gap between fundamental research and translation in their specific fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal and intellectual merit of this grant was to foster collaboration and intellectual exchanges between biologists, engineers, and medical researchers through attendance of the annual Cell and Molecular Engineering conference.  The 2019 conference, which was held at the Loews Coronado Bay Resort Coronado in "San Diego" , California focused on "Engineering Biological Complexity".  This conference brought together a diverse group of pathbreaking scientists and engineers whose research is opening new frontiers in understanding and designing biological systems with complex biological functions (intellectual merit). Systems addressed ranged from single, disordered proteins to complex, multi-cellular assemblies that model human organs in a dish. The intellectual merit of the program and conference was both the emphasis on biological complexity. We further highlighted the pathbreaking approaches to both understanding and engineering complex biological systems, as distinct from studies of single proteins or cells.  The broader impact of the program was the support that enable the attendance by both gender and ethnically diverse researchers, who are recognized leaders in their fields. This support made it possible to highlight a diverse group of speakers from across the US  (broader impact). Our keynote speakers included leading experts, and comprised three males, three females, and two speakers from underrepresented groups. In addition, this grant supported the attendance of 14 invited speakers. The diverse invited speakers included 7 males and 7 females, with two of the speakers from underrepresented groups.   This grant also supported travel awards for junior faculty recognized as rising stars in their fields. At the 2019 conference, we recognized a diverse group of 6 Rising Stars, consisting of 4 males and 2 females. These Rising Star Awards thus promoted the young leaders in the field, and highlighted the outstanding achievements of these early career scientists. These prestigious, competitive awards provide important recognition and encouragement for these accomplished young scientists (broader impact).   In addition, the project also supported six "Shooting Star" awards to recognize outstanding achievements of postdocs and graduate students. This recognition provides an important boost to the careers of these talented young scientists, providing incentive and recognition to continue careers in science and engineering (broader impact). In 2019, three of the recipients were women and three were men. We thus recognized a diverse group of  outstanding young scientists (broader impact).    Overall, the project support enabled the conference to highlighted cutting-edge research in this interdisciplinary field (intellectual merit) The keynote and invited speakers, as well as awardees represented the ethnic and gender diversity of the field (broader impact).  The conference attendees also represented a range of age groups, and included attendees from academia, industry (1%) , government (1%), and nonprofit organizations (2%).  Several early career scientists also attended, including postdocs (5%), doctoral students (14%), graduate students (11%), and undergraduates (3%). The survey results indicated that the conference met the expectations of the attendees.           Last Modified: 02/27/2020       Submitted by: Deborah Leckband]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
