<AbstractNarration>Soil is essential for human survival. Soil provides food, fiber, and ecosystem services. Understanding how soil functions therefore helps human society. In recognition of the importance of soils to all of humanity, the year 2015 was named the International Year of Soils. To further advance the understanding of soil and the services it provides, soil scientists have organized a meeting to discuss recent advances in knowledge. Students and early career researchers would benefit from attending this meeting. Additionally, scientists at this early career stage often have new ideas to contribute. Intensive training and mentoring in an early career stage will strengthen the U.S. workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide support for ten graduate students and early career scientists from the United States to present their research results at the 21st World Congress of Soil Science. This international meeting has the theme "Soil Science: Beyond Food and Fuel." It is expected to attract more than 5,000 scientists from all over the world. This project builds on a long tradition of supporting students and early career scientists in the field of soil science. This award will provide U.S. students and early career scientists a unique opportunity to showcase their research at the international level. The students and early career researchers will also receive high quality training. They will interact with leading soil scientists, hear about the latest scientific developments, and make valuable research connections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The U.S. National Committee for the International Union of Soil Sciences of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine?s Board on International Scientific Organizations offered travel fellowships to U.S. students and early career scientists to present their research at the 21st World Congress of Soil Science in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in August 2018.  Most of the funding for the Wilford Gardner IUSS Travel Fellowship Program was provided by the National Science Foundation (award #1839437), with additional support from the Soil Science Society of America (SSSA).   The U.S. National Committee for the International Union of Soil Sciences competitively awarded travel fellowships to 18 U.S. graduate students and early career scientists. These funds allowed them to attend the Congress by defraying part of their travel costs and provided them with opportunities to present their research and further develop their U.S. and international scientific networks. The program included two mentoring activities that allowed participants to get advice and guidance from experienced scientists and to build a cohort among the awardees. This was the first World Congress of Soil Sciences any of the awardees had ever attended.   Intellectual merit:  All Gardner Fellowship awardees presented their original research in various soil science subdisciplines and many of them remarked on the quality of the feedback they received, which inspired some of them to consider different ways to direct their research. This program allowed this cohort of U.S. graduate students and early career scientists to learn about the latest research at a premier international soil science meeting. Regarding collaborations, 74% met a new or potential collaborator, and 74% established relationships with members of their Gardner cohort. Sixty-eight percent stated that they discussed or found a career opportunity at the WCSS. The program mentoring activities were rated very highly and contributed to the success of the Gardner program.   Broader impact:  Awardees mentioned a number of benefits derived from attending the 21st World Congress of Soil Science, such as gaining important experience on how to present research, receiving valuable scientific feedback, learning how to communicate their scientific message more effectively to other scientists and to a broader audience, enjoying the collaborative culture of soil scientists, receiving substantial mentorship guidance, and developing a global perspective of the soil science community, which will allow them to contribute to the further advancement of soil sciences in the United States.   The Gardner fellowship recipients were very satisfied with the award program and grateful to the National Science Foundation and the Soil Science Society of America for providing the funding for this program, which was organized by the U.S. National Committee for the International Union of Soil Sciences.
