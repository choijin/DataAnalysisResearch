<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks support for the participation of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the 2018 Gordon Conference on Correlated Electron Systems: Entanglement and Coherence in Quantum Materials, which will take place June 24-June 29, 2018 at Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, MA. Supported participants shall also have the opportunity to attend the associated Gordon Research Seminar, to take place June 23-June 24 in the same location. The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Correlated Electron Systems is a long-running series whose objective is to explore and understand the physics of strongly correlated electron systems (SCES). This GRC meets biennially and covers the most active research topics in this profoundly important subfield of Condensed Matter Physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As the electron waves in Quantum materials correlate and entangle their motion at low temperatures, new forms of coherent behavior develop which profoundly transform their properties. The Correlated Electron Systems Gordon Research Conference (GRC) brought together new developments in correlated electron systems, bringing together new experimental and theoretical developments in our understanding of entangled and interacting quantum materials.  The GRC included a Power Hour on Thursday afternoon organized by Meigan Aronson (Texas A&amp;M University) which was an optional informal gathering open to all meeting participants. It was designed to help address the challenges women face in science and support the professional growth of women in our communities by providing an open forum for discussion and mentoring.   The Gordon Research Seminar on Correlated Electron Systems is a unique forum for graduate students, post-docs, and other scientists with comparable levels of experience and education to present and exchange new data and cutting-edge ideas.  The seminar was held immediately before the GRC and focused on theoretical and experimental developments in the understanding of emergent phases, long-range entanglement and many-electron physics in strongly correlated quantum materials. Through presentations selected from abstracts and two poster sessions, the seminar immersed attendees in the conversation that continued with the Correlated Electron Systems Gordon Conference. Topics were determined by the range of submissions received, and included: topological and Weyl systems, spin ice and spin liquid materials, low dimensional magnetism and frustration, complex oxides, interfaces and monolayers, quantum criticality, heavy fermion materials, ultrafast behavior and control, and many body localization.
