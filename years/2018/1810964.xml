<AbstractNarration>This grant supports a workshop for graduate students interested in the use of models of varying levels of complexity to understand the climate system.  The workshop is named in honor of Carl-Gustaf Rossby, an early pioneer of atmospheric science and department chair at the University of Chicago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in computing technology have enabled development of comprehensive climate models which use high resolution and include sophisticated representations of a large number of climate processes.  Such models can achieve a high degree of realism but only at the expense of great complexity, which limits their use for understanding climate system behaviors. Simple models are of course easier to understand, but such models can fundamentally misrepresent the system if they are simplified in ways that remove or disable key processes.  The task of choosing or developing models at the right level of complexity, or at appropriately varying levels of complexity, is thus a key challenge in climate research.  Climate scientists grapple with this challenge on a daily basis, yet it is not systematically addressed in the standard graduate school curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop gives students an opportunity to learn modeling strategies involving simple and intermediate complexity models, choosing configurations appropriate for specific problems and applications.  The workshop is conducted through a combination of classroom lectures showcasing classical models and configurations that have led to important insights into the climate system, and hands-on research in a small group setting.  The workshop has intellectual merit as it addresses the important question of how one uses a model to arrive at understanding.  It has broader impacts by training the next generation of scientists in a key methodology of the discipline.  This grant covers the participation of 19 graduate students (out of a total of 30) selected through a competitive process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Rossbypalooza was a two-week long, project-oriented summer school organized by the graduate students of the Department of the Geophysical Sciences, University of Chicago.  It was held June 11-22, 2018, on the UChicago campus.  This was a second such meeting following the inaugural 2016 event, which the organizers named Rossbypalooza after the famous meteorologist and the music festival that Chicago is known for.  The purpose of Rossbypalooza 2018 was to provide a platform for interactions among graduate students, postdocs and faculty to understand the climate of Earth and other planets through simplified models.     We had over 120 international applications for 30 seats.  Selected participants, together with 12 UChicago students and postdocs, were organized into 14 groups and matched with 8 faculty advisers, including two invited non-UChicago advisers.  Each group consisted of participants with different background and affiliations and was assigned a project, not directly related to their dissertation topics.  During the first week, the faculty advisers gave introductory lectures in the morning, followed by group activities centered around the projects.  The faculty advisers were on the standby during the two weeks to meet with the participants for guidance.  Thursday of the second week, Dr. Isaac Held of NOAA GFDL/Princeton University gave a plenary presentation on the climate modeling hierarchy.  On the last day of the summer school the participants celebrated with a series of presentations the results of their projects.     The majority of the NSF grant for this summer school was spent for the subsistence (on-campus housing) and travel support for the participants and invited advisers.  UChicago provided the dorm rooms for the participants to stay and the computational resources for the participants during the summer school.  While the PI served in an advisory capacity, the student organizers took care of all aspects of the summer school - from deciding on the theme, inviting faculty advisers, publicizing, applicant selection, financial aid, group assignments, boarding, social activities to negotiations with the campus computer center.   The responses from the participants were overwhelmingly positive; the vast majority appreciated the collaborative experience with their peers and faculty advisors.  These are the next-generation climate dynamicists and the level of interactions among them was an encouragement to the organizers.  Some of the results from this summer school have been (and are planned to be) presented at professional meetings (e.g. American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting 2018, American Meteorological Society Atmosphere Ocean Fluid Dynamics Meeting 2019) and published in a professional journal (Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences).
