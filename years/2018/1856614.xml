<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division supports Professor Peter Dowben of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Nebraska and Professor Ruihua Cheng of the Physics Department at Indiana University Purdue University-Indianapolis working together on a research project described here.  This project focuses on combining molecules, whose dominant characteristic is a large magnetic moment, with molecules with large electric dipoles.  The research could enable the fabrication of lightweight, high-speed, low-power non-volatile electronic devices for a broad range of applications.  This project brings together investigations of fundamental interface chemistry, dipole coupling at heteromolecular interfaces, the modeling of frontier orbitals, the fabrication of defined high-quality organic multilayers, and characterization of magnetic induction with an applied electric field.  Student training includes international experience in science. Other activities involve both undergraduate and graduate students, including visiting undergraduates, in cutting edge research at the interface of chemistry and physics and outreach activities where the students learn how to communicate cutting edge research to a nontechnical audience.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on the interface between organic ferroelectric layers and spin crossover molecule adsorbates, with a general goal of understanding the mechanisms that dominate the voltage manipulation of the spin state of these metal organic complexes. More specifically, the emphasis is on the investigation of heteromolecular interactions, with spin-crossover molecules, to exploit the molecule-to-molecule interface to create novel and better molecular multiferroic devices. To accomplish this goal, research will center around several important research objectives: (1) identify what determines the changes in spin crossover phenomenology with molecular film thickness; (2) better understand the energy barriers to molecular spin state switching; (3) learn how a heteromolecular system, where the spin state of the molecular overlayer is controlled by an applied electric field, reacts to competing processes; (4) identify the smallest controllable domain size within a continuous film; and (5) identify whether or not a spin orientation anisotropy barrier exists in a molecular spin crossover thin film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
