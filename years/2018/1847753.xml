<AbstractNarration>The Network Embedded Storage and Compute (NESCO) project is motivated by a premise that future Research and Education networks should include "embedded compute and storage" functions as a mechanism to provide advanced services for domain science application workflows. This is a natural follow-on to the current cyberinfrastructure evolution revolving around "Cloud" and "Edge" computing.  The NESCO project is developing the next important trend based on a distributed ecosystem of compute and storage facilities which are embedded deeply within networks.  These will be similar in function to on-premise edge cloud deployments but will be customized for placement within networks.  Application workflow developers will have access to a new class of services which can be rapidly tailored to specific flows and use cases.  One result anticipated is the "democratization of middlebox" functions in a manner where application workflow developers can customize their workflows and data processing on real-time basis with flow level granularity.  This project includes a climate science workflow as a prototype use case.  It is anticipated that these new services will be of interest to a broad range of domain science applications.  Individual and small research groups who cannot afford access to dedicated resources may find these services of particular value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A NESCO facility is defined which can be placed inside of Wide Area Networks, Regional Networks, and Exchange Points.  These facilities will contain advanced programmable hardware-based network functions, compute and storage resources, and be architected to provide services on a highly customizable per flow basis.  An open source orchestration system known as StackV is being modified to develop a new class of realtime "Flow Management" services.  The StackV system includes a realtime modeling framework to "datafy" infrastructure, modular pluggable computation elements, and intelligent workflow processes to build on-demand topologies across heterogeneous resource types and service providers.  This system also includes a user facing application programming interface which allows workflow agents to request resource topologies which span network, compute, and storage resources via a single integrated request.  This project is developing a NESCO reference implementation which will be deployed for testing and experimentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Network Embedded Storage and Compute (NESCO) project conducted early research into advanced network flow management for "embedded compute and storage" systems that can be placed inside of Wide Area Networks, Regional Networks, Science DMZs, and Exchange Points.  The functional objectives were to enable custom traffic engineering and processing of data flow in response to science application workflow requirements.  These functions are motivated by a belief that an important emerging trend will be distributed ecosystem of compute and storage facilities which are embedded deeply within networks.  These will be similar in capability to on-premise edge cloud deployments but will be tailored for placement within networks.  This will provide application workflow developers access to a new class of services which can be rapidly tailored to specific use cases, instances, and customers.  NESCO facilities with advanced programmable network functions, compute and storage resources are designed to enable customizable services on a per flow basis.  The NESCO project deployed a prototype embedded network facility inside the University of Maryland / Mid-Atlantic Crossroads Science DMZ.  This prototype deployment defined a framework around which an architecture, Application Program Interfaces (APIs), and functional/performance specifications can be developed and tested.  Application workflow focused use cases were also identified and tested.     The NESCO facility architecture and design is an extension of the "Edge" computing paradigm, where some centralized cloud-based compute and storage functions are being moved to the enterprise edge.  The resulting hybrid mode of operation allows for flexible movement of data and application functions between the on-premise edge and central cloud in a manner which can be optimized for specific use cases.  The NESCO design extended this relocation of compute and storage resources one step further and embeds it also deeply within the network and adds per-flow level network programmability.  Existing mechanisms for compute and storage system dynamic provisioning were leveraged using the OpenStack and Ceph systems.  Because of the placement and tight coupling of these compute and storage resources within the network, the NESCO vision was to develop innovative and flexible approaches for flow level granularity in terms of using the compute, storage, and network programable resources and functions.      Unlike hybrid computing models, where data flows typically terminate on Edge Facility for application level processing, the network embedded model requires more of a focus on advanced network functions such as routing, switching, bump in the wire processing, and dynamically programmable middlebox functions.  The result is that the interconnect between the compute, storage, and multiple network connections must be constructed to allow line-rate management of individual flows.  In addition, the control plane mechanisms must allow for rapid reconfiguration in response to application workflow requirements.       The NESCO project has defined a set of functions that are required for this type of network embedded facility.  These include the following:     Flow Identification  Flow Ownership Establishment Flow Steering Flow Specific Topologies (FST):     Flow Inline Processing (FIP) Flow Termination/Process/Retransmit (FTPR) Flow Mirroring and Telemetry (FMT)         Figure 1 shows an architectural and functional view of the NESCO system.
