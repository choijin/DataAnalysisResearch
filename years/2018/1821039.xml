<AbstractNarration>Understanding future environmental change requires researchers to access and integrate data from the geological and biological sciences, in order to answer questions about how environmental change will affect life on Earth. In many cases the data needed to answer these questions already exists but, unfortunately, technology has not kept pace with research needs. This places increasing demands on researchers, who have to search for and download data from multiple separate online databases; compile published information from many different literature sources; and track down specimens housed in museum and other collections scattered around the world. The time needed to search and retrieve this information is enormous and, once found, the data often have to be standardized before they can be used. This project will tackle this problem by developing software tools to connect three established, well-supported, and critically important data sources: the Paleobiology Database (PBDB, paleontological, literature based), iDigPaleo (paleontological, specimen based) and iDigBio (neontological, specimen based). This project will allow users of any one of these databases to access and query the others at the same time, returning a much richer, combined set of data to the user. Connecting these resources will open up a whole host of research questions that are currently difficult to answer, even by multiple researchers working as a team. The development of this system will allow scientists to ask and answer new research questions affecting fields as diverse as biogeographic/niche modeling, systematics, functional morphology, evolutionary biology, ecology, climatology, conservation biology, oceanography, and petroleum geology. This project will fundamentally change the nature of the research questions that can be addressed by the scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The connectivity between modern and fossil, and specimen and literature-based resources does not currently exist.  The digital infrastructure provided by the composite ePANDDA application programming interfaces (APIs) will streamline and normalize data acquisition, including retrieval from disparate data sources, and will facilitate coordination with future data initiatives. Rather than creating another portal for the aggregation of data, ePANDDA will unify results that normally would have required multiple searches on numerous platforms. For the researcher, this eliminates a significant barrier to data collection and processing. Researchers will now have the ability to collaborate across disciplinary boundaries to study earth system processes and the nature of biotic response to environmental change across both space and time. Linking publications to specimens will enrich the potential of museum collections and augment their value for both research and education. The ePANDDA project also provides an opportunity to build collaborative programs that leverage existing education and outreach activities in addition to the primary research goals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ePANDDA: Enhancing PAleontological and Neontological Data Discovery API project developed application programming interfaces (APIs) that integrate paleontological and biological data within two separate databases - the Paleobiology Database (PBDB) and the integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio).  iDigBio is the National Science Foundation?s named national coordinating center for its Advancing the Digitization of Biodiversity Collections (ADBC) initiative that has resulted in the mobilization of over 121 million transcribed specimen records with an associated 30 million media attachments spanning the 3.8 billion-year timespan from fossil to modern life. The PBDB has amassed over 1.4 million paleontological occurrence records from over 70 thousand literature references.  The data in PBDB is derived from published scientific literature while iDigBio is the combined data from many natural history museum collections databases. By centralizing access and aligning different data sets using common parameters, ePANDDA has made it possible for anyone to access and use data from both resources.   An important aspect of this project was to have range of different scientists and software developers provide input into how the API would be structured and how the combined data would be provided.  We held community-input meetings throughout the project, beginning in 2015, at professional conferences, and at a 2-day ?hackathon? focused specifically on the ePANDDA API. The principle investigators and other key ePANDDA team members also met regularly,  in bi- weekly to monthly virtual meetings.  The API is now in use and freely available via the project website at: ePANDDA.org .   Additional information about the ePANDDA project is available through the EarthCube website (http://earthcube.org/); the ePANDDA GitHub repository (https://github.com/ePandda), and ePANDDA social media accounts on Facebook and Twitter. Presentations about ePANDDA and the hackathon are maintained on iDigBio?s website:   https://www.idigbio.org/wiki/images/1/18/EPANDDA_BerkeleyWrkshp_Gil.pdf   https://www.idigbio.org/wiki/images/f/f1/Butts_et_al_umich_idigbio_biodiversity_data_STANDARD_SLIDE_SIZE.pdf  https://www.idigbio.org/wiki/index.php/2017_ePANDDA_Hackathon.   To date, ePANDDA has returned more than 2.4 million record annotations to iDigBio, most with a one-to-many relationship to iDigBio records, creating a multiplier effect that has resulted in many more millions of records being impacted.  On the PBDB website, users searching the database can now view images of fossils retrieved from iDigBio and see them as part of their PBDB results. Designed to be expandable, the future of ePANDDA might include connections to new and varied biodiversity databases to further enhance research and scientific discovery.
