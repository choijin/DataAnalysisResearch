<AbstractNarration>The National Academies of Science recommended in 2015 that more research be undertaken to understand solar geoengineering, that is, approaches such as stratospheric aerosol injection that would cool the climate by reflecting some sunlight back to space. Introducing a design element into solar geoengineering research provides a critical shift in perspective that will fundamentally alter the conversation surrounding geoengineering, and inspire further research. Only recently have models been able to simultaneously capture the full coupling between aerosol microphysics, chemistry, and stratospheric dynamics. By taking advantage of this state-of-the-art capability, this research will enable a better assessment of what can and cannot be achieved through an intentionally designed stratospheric aerosol injection strategy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is plausible that temporary and limited geoengineering deployment could be used to reduce climate risks, but making such an assessment requires understanding projected impacts. This research aims to take a major step forwards towards that objective by developing a well-designed strategy based on an exploration of the design space. This is essential to ensure that future decisions regarding these approaches are well-informed. Furthermore, the multidisciplinary perspective gained by applying engineering optimization, dynamic systems, and feedback design to climate science provides an opportunity to broaden both communities with the potential to spark additional insights and research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Reducing emissions of CO2 and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases is essential, but may not be sufficient to avoid severe future impacts from climate change.  Given this context, it is possible that stratospheric aerosol geoengineering (SAG) may be considered as an additional element of a strategy for managing some climate change risks.  This would involve lofting aerosols (tiny droplets or particles) such as sulfate high into the atmosphere to reflect a small portion of incoming sunlight.  This would cool the climate but would not exactly cancel the climate changes caused by increased greenhouse gas concentrations; it would thus offset some, but not all risks of climate change, while creating others.  Fundamentally, the goal of this research is a step towards better informing future societal choices regarding whether or not to consider this technology: understanding what can and cannot be achieved by solar geoengineering will be an important input into these decisions.  More immediately, this research enables new research directions, and clarifies needs for both impact analysis and addressing governance challenges.  The climate effects of adding aerosols to the stratosphere depend, unsurprisingly, on the latitude at which they are added; this has been known for several years.  The new contribution here is to consider how the season in which they are added affects the climate.  If aerosols (or their precursor gas SO2) are added at low-mid latitudes, as has been considered in almost all prior research, choosing the season can have important influence on impacts, including for example less acid rain deposition due to increased efficiency and reduced changes to the Indian monsoon.  These are both often cited concerns associated with SAG, but this research shows that the latter depends on the strategy, as does the magnitude of the former.  That is, this research identified approaches for how one might deploy solar geoengineering with less impact and improved outcomes.  The effect of choosing the season in which aerosols are added is more pronounced when the addition is at higher latitudes.  At 60N, for example, restricting SO2-injection to spring (so that the resulting aerosols are present in the summer when there is the most sunlight to reflect) roughly doubles the efficiency relative to prior simulations with annually-constant SO2-injection ? doubling how much sea ice is restored, or equivalently halving impacts such as ozone depletion or acid rain deposition per unit sea ice.  This research thus has identified a way to make a more Arctic-focused strategy plausible.  To be clear, more research is needed on impacts, and no decisions should ever be undertaken without broad societal conversation ? but that conversation needs to be informed by an understanding of what is and is not possible.  This research thus opens up further research avenues by identifying alternate possible strategies for implementing SAG that will have a different distribution of impacts and risks.  Given that many critical effects of climate change arise from the Arctic ? loss of sea ice, thawing of permafrost that releases further greenhouse gases, sea level rise due to melting of the Greenland ice sheet, the potential for a more Arctic-focused strategy is an essential outcome of this research.  Research has also demonstrated that one could tune the amount of injection at different latitudes to meet different climate goals, such as balancing global mean precipitation changes rather than global mean temperature changes, or maintaining tropical precipitation, or Arctic sea ice; research also established a framework for how to think about what goals can be simultaneously managed and which cannot.  One might reasonably ask what the limits are; how many different such strategies have we not thought of?  A final contribution of this project is to begin to answer that question.  By combining different rates of aerosol injection at different latitudes and in different seasons, one cannot practically achieve any possible climate response ? simply because the stratospheric circulation that transports aerosols around the globe means that adding aerosols in relatively nearby locations will result in relatively similar climate response.  Work started, and still in progress, finds that there are between 4 and 8 independent degrees of freedom; this means that existing research that has successfully managed up to three independent climate goals has not yet explored the full range of possible strategies ? but that there will be limits to how different the climate effects from different strategies are likely to be.  In sum, this research in the near-term opens up new avenues for additional research, and in the longer-term represents a critical step forwards towards better understanding a technology option that might reduce many impacts of climate change, and thus to better informing future decisions.
