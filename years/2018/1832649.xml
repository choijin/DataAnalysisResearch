<AbstractNarration>A Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) is being organized as part of the 39th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI), the premier conference in the areas of programming languages and compilers. The conference will be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This award specifically supports students from underrepresented groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents to attend the mentoring workshop in addition to the PLDI conference. The impact of the award relates to broadening participation in computing, providing opportunities for students to receive mentoring from leading researchers, and building the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in programming languages and compilers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Programming Language Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) co-located with the conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI) in 2018 aimed to increase the participation and representation of underrepresented groups in programming languages.  A key motivation for this workshop is to close the representation gap for underrepresented groups by giving them a better understanding of the landscape of the programming language community, educating them on the tools needed to be successful, and plugging them into a support network of senior students and researchers within the community.  The PI and workshop co-organizers developed a scholarship program to award scholarships that covered student travel and attendance costs for the workshop as well as PLDI.  We crafted a program that included many distinguished speakers from the community. We also organized the day-of logistics of the workshop.  The scholarship program, which included both funds from the NSF as well as funds from ACM SIGPLAN and industry donors (i.e., Facebook, Google, IBM, and LLVM), resulted in full or partial scholarships for 39 students. NSF funds gave full or partial scholarship to 22 students in total, 11 were identified as female or non-binary and 3 of which (from the 22 students -- including 1 female counted in the 11) were members of an underrepresented ethnic minority group.   In total, the workshop had 50 student attendees ranging from senior undergraduates or junior graduates.  The program included 6 talks from researchers and faculty members, a panel (consisting of an additional 4 researchers and faculty members), and a poster session with content from an additional 15 researchers and faculty members. In total, students gained exposure to 26 researchers and faculty members throughout the day.   Intellectual Merits. Programming Languages Design and Implementation (PLDI) is the flagship conference on programming languages and systems, and one of the premier conferences in all of computer science. Graduate students and  -- in particular, their fresh perspectives on emerging concerns in computing  -- are the lifeblood of the programming languages community.  It is therefore critical that young graduate students attend PLDI to further the success and continued technical development of the field. Moreover, it is also imperative that we give students the skills and tools to successfully deliver technical contributions in the field. This project enabled students to attend both PLDI as well as PLMW.  Broader Impact. The broader impact of PLMW -- and, therefore, this project -- is threefold. First, it gives Ph.D. students a broader understanding of their field, thereby broadening the scope and impact of their work.  Second, PLMW gives undergraduate students who are worried about graduate school an opportunity to gain a better understanding of the option and have more confidence and direction in whichever option they choose. Third, that confidence and our emphasis on underrepresented groups brings more women and underrepresented minorities into graduate school. Thus, this project helps make for a more capable, more directed, and more diverse community of graduate students and eventual researchers for the world.
