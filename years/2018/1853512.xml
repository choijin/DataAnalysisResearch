<AbstractNarration>The Ninth International Workshop on Modeling in Crystal Growth (IWMCG-6) will bring together top senior and promising junior researchers of both academe and industry from the United States, Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world to identify common priorities, allow the exchange of new ideas, and foster future collaborative work.  This workshop, held from October 21-24, 2018, and ideally situated mid-way between the United States and Asia in Hawaii, builds upon a history of successful triennial meetings on this topic.  This award will support five additional U.S.-based young researchers (graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and young faculty) to participate in the symposium, where they will be exposed to cutting-edge research and to the broadly-based, international community of this field. The topic of the workshop addresses an area, crystal growth, that has been identified by the National Research Council as strategically important and in need of strengthening in the U.S.  Advances in this area will impact advanced manufacturing processes that affect electronic and photonic devices for information, energy, defense, and detector systems, the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and more. Improvements in these crystal-base systems will favorably impact wide-ranging domains relevant to national prosperity, defense, and health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to promoting discourse and collaboration among researchers in this area, the support of this workshop will promote an important and timely research topic. Crystal growth is itself profoundly interesting and significant, and modeling such processes, the focus of this workshop, is inherently interdisciplinary and demanding. From a fundamental vantage point, studying crystal growth yields important understanding of thermodynamic phase change, associated self-assembly and pattern-formation phenomena, and kinetic and transport limitations to growth. From a technological viewpoint, a successful crystal growth process represents a quintessential advanced manufacturing system, whose successful modeling and subsequent understanding, control, and optimization are inherently challenging and valuable. NSF support will allow young researchers in the U.S. an opportunity to advance their careers through international exposure and future collaboration in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF award supported the attendence of five U.S.-based young researchers (graduate students and post-doctoral fellows) to participate in the 9th International Workshop on Modeling in Crystal Growth (IWMCG-9), where they were exposed to cutting-edge research and to the broadly-based, international community of this field.  Without this support, none of these young researchers would have been able to attend.   The 9th International Workshop on Modeling in Crystal Growth (IWMCG-9) took place under the auspices of the American Association for Crystal Growth (AACG), the Japanese Association for Crystal Growth (JACG), and the International Organisation for Crystal Growth (IOCG) from October 21-23, 2018, on the Big Island, Hawaii, USA.  IWMCG-9 was the ninth in a series of workshops focusing on modeling of bulk crystal growth and thin film epitaxy.  The workshops, held approximately once every three years, have been highly successful at bringing together crystal growth researchers from university, industry, and government laboratories around the world to report on the latest advances in crystal growth modeling. The first eight workshops were successfully convened in Parma, Italy (1989), Durbuy, Belgium (1996), Hauppauge, New York, USA (2000), Fukuoka, Japan (2003), Bamberg, Germany (2006), Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, USA (2009), Taipei, Taiwan (2012), and Spa, Belgium (2015).    The workshop venue was Hawaii, equidistant between America and Asia and easily accessible from all continents. The workshop attracted 74 registrants, including 22 students, from 15 countries---the USA, Germany, Japan, Australia, Russia, China, Taiwan, France, Belgium, Romania, Latvia, Korea, Sweden, Israel, and Poland.   The technical program comprised 66 presentations, including 12 invited speakers, 30 contributed oral presentations, and 24 poster presentations. IWMCG-9 had sessions devoted to CZ Silicon, Melt Growth, Optimization and Analysis, Solution Growth, Novel Topics, Vapor-Phase Growth, and PV Silicon.   The Workshop, by all accounts, was a terrific success, promoted by the international attendees and highly scientific presentations. The credit is due to the IWMCG-9 international advisory committee, which included representatives from 13 countries, and the organizing committee, which consisted of volunteers from the University of Minnesota and Kyushsu University.  At the end of the Workshop, it was announced that the Tenth International Workshop on Modeling in Crystal Growth, IWMCG-10, will be held at Xi'an Jiaotong University in Xi’an, China in 2021.
