<AbstractNarration>Intermetallic compounds are an integral part of materials design for structural and functional applications and understanding their behavior is critical to improved performance. Extensive research has been underway to understand the fundamental aspects of intermetallics and the knowledge base is continuously evolving. Nevertheless, significant knowledge gaps exist in the fundamental science of intermetallics, as well as in processing and scale-up for eventual application. This award supports a symposium on fundamental understanding of the processing, microstructure, and properties of these materials at the Materials Research Society (MRS) Fall Meeting in Boston, Massachusetts, November 25-29, 2018. This symposium series was started in 1984 and is one of the longest running symposia in MRS history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will enable the attendance at the symposium of graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, early career faculty and researchers from underrepresented groups. Support for students and early career researchers for travel and registration at the MRS meeting is a critical part of broadening and educating the field of researchers, as well as advancing knowledge and information exchange about this important class of materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Invited and contributed presentations from the international community included the following topics: developments in innovative processing from the solid, liquid and vapor states; novel powder- related processing technologies (additive manufacturing); next generation alloys (with higher temperature and creep resistance); fundamentals of phase stability and their effects on microstructural design and microstructural degradation in extreme environments/service; physical and mechanical response to various loading conditions and the role of defects in influencing them; impact of integrated modeling on novel approaches of alloy development; advanced characterization techniques on an atomic level (in-situ investigation methods, 3D atom probe) and technological considerations for successful commercial applications. Presentations on intermetallic phases of interest included aluminides, silicides, Laves phases and Heusler phases, and various other geometrically- and topologically-close-packed compounds.
