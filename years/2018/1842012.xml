<AbstractNarration>Kilauea volcano began an eruption in May 2018. This project would mount a rapid response effort to understand how iron and phosphorus in the volcanic ash acts as fertilizer for ocean ecosystems. The investigators propose to conduct an oceanographic expedition to the regions east of Kapoho Bay and west (downwind) of the summit to collect samples and conduct experiments that will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the marine biogeochemistry of the 2018 Kilauea eruption. This project will complement the ongoing long-term observations at the NSF-supported Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) Station ALOHA.  The eruption of Kilauea is much more than a major geological event. It is an issue of local and global societal interest and has attracted significant interest and press coverage. The investigators plan to engage the public about the interactions of land and sea, and more broadly hope to promote a greater understanding of science. This will be achieved through interviews for public radio and other news outlets, through blogs and web-based information about the expedition, and by the publication and dissemination of knowledge gained through this study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study will include: (1) satellite-based observations of ash plume trajectories, dispersion, and deposition, (2) analysis of collected ash samples, and ash-seawater leaching and incubation studies to determine the effects of simulated ash deposition on a variety of microbial rates and processes, (3) field observations and sample collections at the lava-seawater contact zone near Kapoho Bay and in the ash deposition region downwind of Halema'uma'u, west of the island of Hawaii, and (4) deployment of an autonomous long-term (3-month) experiment consisting of a Wave Glider and a Seaglider working in a coordinated manner to record processes that occur over time as the ecosystem responds to the wet and dry deposition of volcanic ash over larger spatial and longer temporal scales. The region will be revisited approximately 2-3 months after the initial survey to obtain a second set of observations and to recover the autonomous vehicles. Incubation experiments will also be conducted at the HOT program Station ALOHA where NSF has supported a benchmark site for assessing ocean variability over the past three decades. Based on the long-term observations at Station ALOHA, the investigators have established an inextricable linkage between iron and phosphorus dynamics, and the controls on nitrogen fixation and particle export. Studies of the response of microbial communities to the Kilauea eruption will improve understanding of oceanic processes at Station ALOHA and lead to better carbon cycle models for the oligotrophic North Pacific Ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Kilauea Volcano on the island of Hawaii is one of the most active volcanoes on Earth.  In May 2018, there was an explosive summit eruption and by early June, molten lava from the lower East Rift Zone inundated the town of Kapoho and entered the ocean.  This rare event in the geologic history of the Hawaiian Islands presented a unique opportunity to investigate hydrothermal processes near the seawater-lava contact zone and to evaluate the impacts of volcanic aerosol and ash deposition on surrounding marine ecosystems.  We mounted a 5-day oceanographic expedition in early July to investigate the lava-impacted zone, where remote satellite images predicted the presence of a large plume of phytoplankton (microscopic plants that produce food for the entire ocean ecosystem).  A major goal of our expedition was to better understand how the lava flowing into the sea could fuel the growth of these phytoplankton.  Initially, we hypothesized that the lava was supplying essential nutrients like iron and phosphorus to phytoplankton.  However, lava is not known to contain another key nutrient essential for phytoplankton growth ? nitrogen.  So we also proposed that a group of specialized microorganisms that can use atmospheric nitrogen gas might also be stimulated by lava nutrients, and thereby provide additional nitrogen necessary for phytoplankton growth. Once on site, we discovered that the nitrogen-gas-utilizing microbes were in very low abundance and the phytoplankton that were present appeared to be using nitrate, which is present in limiting concentrations in the ocean around Hawaii.  Where was the nitrate coming from?  Our results pointed to an unexpected source of nutrients ? the deep sea.  Lava entering the coastal region quickly moved downslope into the deep waters that surround the island.  The hot lava produced large buoyant plumes that moved nitrate- and phosphate-rich deep waters to the surface where they could be used for phytoplankton growth, with carbon and energy passed up to higher trophic levels, including fish.  This previously unknown pathway to enhance photosynthesis in nutrient-poor environments served as a stimulus to conduct additional laboratory studies of lava-seawater interactions including geochemical studies of trace elements such as iron, nickel, copper, and zinc.  Our scientific results provide new insight into how major geological events like volcanic eruptions, can influence, even stimulate, phytoplankton growth and production in ocean ecosystems. Our results captured considerable interest, and were widely distributed to the public via news articles, blogs, tweets, and numerous interviews that were conducted by expedition participants.
