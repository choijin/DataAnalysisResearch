<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Professor Elmer-Rico Mojica from Pace University and colleagues Zhaohua Dai, Nigel Yarlett, Rita Upmacis and Jaime-Lee Rizzo have acquired an accelerated solvent extractor (ASE). This instrument allows extraction of substance of interest from mixtures of compounds with the aid of high temperatures and high pressures that make the various substances more soluble. Once the materials are dissolved, the mixtures are separated with the use of columns. In the column, there are substances that interact differently with the various components, thus allowing separation. Because of the high temperature and pressures, the system allows (much like a pressure cooker) the use of small volumes of liquids in the separation. This makes these systems environmentally friendly since they produce little waste. Common applications are in extraction of pesticides, herbicides, flame retardants, active ingredients in medicines, vitamins, dietary supplements, detergents and textiles. The instrument is used to train students in research at the host institution and the Navarro Borough Manhattan Community College. The solvent extractor serves many underrepresented students and facilitates retention in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of this accelerated solvent extractor is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts the characterization of natural materials, such as bee propolis, and their use as antimicrobial and antiprotozoal agents, the analyses of organic micropollutants and the presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in various types of sediments from New York City. The instrument is also used for investigating the presence of pollutants and pesticide residues in commercial tea samples, fruits, vegetables, honey and milk and for improving the sample preparation methods in the analysis of illicit drugs. In addition, it benefits  the development of molecular imprinted xerogels materials designed by computational methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The accelerated solvent extractor (ASE) acquisition allows Pace University to have an instrument with principles similar to the Keurig machine. The presence of this instrument allows research to be conducted in the fields of natural products, food science, and environmental chemistry/science by allowing the extraction of chemicals of great interest in complex samples. The instrument was successfully used in developing methods for the extraction of active chemicals with antioxidant activity from bee propolis. Its potential as an extracting method for samples such as bee propolis, bee pollen, seafood, and soil was studied with its ability to manipulate pressure and temperature conditions. A study on its impact on the extraction of active chemicals found in bee propolis was published discussing its advantages and disadvantages. At present, optimization of conditions is currently being performed. The research projects that utilized this instrument gave opportunities for students to be trained in its use. Some students were trained on how to use it (and some used it to do research), while other students in selected courses were made aware of this instrument and how it can serve as an alternative rapid extracting sample preparation method. Overall, 19 students were trained, with six students ending up using it in their research projects.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/01/2021<br>      Modified by: Elmer-Rico&nbsp;E&nbsp;Mojica</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1828320/1828320_10550610_1627867047275_JoASE--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1828320/1828320_10550610_1627867047275_JoASE--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ASE student user"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1828320/1828320_10550610_1627867047275_JoASE--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="ASE student user"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">One of the students using ASE in her research</div> <div class="imageCredit">Elmer Mojica research group</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Elmer-Rico&nbsp;E&nbsp;Mojica</div> <div class="imageTitle">ASE student user</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
