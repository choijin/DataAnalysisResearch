<AbstractNarration>This award will help support student and postdoctoral attendance at the Annual ACM/SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms Science (SODA) 2018, which will be held January 7-10 2018 in New Orleans, Louisiana. SODA is co-sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) . SODA is the premier annual research conference in the field of discrete algorithms and one of the three premier conferences in theoretical computer science. SODA has been meeting annually since 1990 and in a typical year has over 300 attendees. It is co-located with two smaller workshops, ALENEX (Meeting on Algorithm Engineering and Experimentation) and ANALCO (Meeting on Analysis of Algorithms). SODA is attended by researchers from all over the world. The field of algorithms is a vibrant one, with high participation rates from young researchers, and many papers with student authors. For these student authors and student attendees, the conference serves as a valuable educational experience, both for the technical content of the talks and for the opportunities for networking that it provides. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will provide partial support to approximately twenty students, partly defraying the cost of travel and lodging. Efforts will be made to support students from under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

SODA is attended by researchers all over the world. The field of algorithmsis a vibrant one, with high participation rates from young researchers, and many papers with student authors.   This project provided finanical support for 24 students to attend the conference.  The students received amounts around $500. The majority of these students made presentations at the conference and would not otherwise have been able to attend the conference.  The students were able to attend other talks and interact with many of the top researchers in the world in the field of discrete algorithms.  The students were all graduate students at universities in the United States. Most of them had not previously been able to attend the SODA conference and their careers were enhanced by the experience.
