<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program provides support for projects to design, implement, and assess strategies that can lead to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. This two-year planning project at Morris College seeks to eliminate the "one-size-fits-all" Biology curriculum to develop career directed pathways in effort to improve retention and 4-year graduation rates for under-represented students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In response to the call for action in the preparation of minority and under-represented students in STEM, the project objectives are to streamline the biology curriculum to 1) develop two new career tracks in Bio-Cyber Security and Biology-Forensics and 2) increase enrollment for first-generation students in the biology program, enabling them to succeed academically and professionally. This inter-divisional collaboration and local and state agency partnership is positioned to increase STEM student enrollment and student preparation for graduate school or direct entry into the STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      The Intellectual Merit of this 2-year Project is that the long standing curriculum was changed from the one-size-fits-all to three specific, career-related tracks that prompted the college to reduce the required hours for all majors in the institution.  It further made it possible for six new freshmen from financially disadvantaged families to become STEM majors despite the financial and social obstacles they faced before joining the program.        The Broader Impact of this project is that when the students graduate as biology majors, they will help increase the representation of members of an under-represented minority group (African American students) in the National STEM workforce, thus, enhancing the STEM workforce diversity and providing the American society with an additional talent that has not been, heretofore been fully utilized.   Project Summary       The two major goals of the project are:  Biology Curriculum Revision (Streamlining) Improving the Quality of Student Academic Preparation and Achievement    During the first year (2018-2019) of this two-year implementation project, the biology curriculum was streamlined into three tracks, replacing the previous one-size -fits-all curriculum.  The three new tracks are: The Biological Sciences Track, The Health Professions Track, and The Biology-Secondary Education Track.  The new tracks were incorporated into the 2019-2020 College Catalog and was implemented during the second year of the project, the 2019-2020 academic year.      During the second year of the project (2019-2020), the Mini Community of Learners was established and implemented to improve the quality of student academic preparation and achievement.     Significant Results: The results we were able to achieve in short two years are:  1. Streamlined the biology curriculum from one-size-fits-all format into 3 career-specific tracks.  2. Established the Mini Community of Learners consisting of 6 freshman Biology Majors, 2 upper-class peer-mentors and 4 faculty members.  Community Freshmen received structured tutoring by faculty members.   3. GPA of faculty-tutored freshman members of the Community of Learners was 0.6 GPA unit higher than the control group (Who did not receive structured faculty tutoring).  4. Four of the freshman Community members selected the Biological Sciences Track, one preferred the Health Science Track, and one chose the Biology-Secondary Education Track.  We were grateful for NSF for providing this opportunity to Morris College and for making it possible for its students to achieve academic success.
