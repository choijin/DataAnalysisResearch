<AbstractNarration>This project supports a workshop to identify research directions and build a research community for Internet-of-Things (IoT) hardware systems. IoT hardware systems combine wireless, low-power sensor and actuator nodes in networks along with fog and cloud computing.  They provide rich data sets that can be used for real-time monitoring, control, and decision-making. IoT systems are widely used for industrial, transportation, health care, and other applications. As IoT systems increase in scope and complexity, new research challenges arise that require new results and novel interdisciplinary collaborations. The workshop will involve researchers with expertise in a wide range of topics relevant to IoT. The attendees will collaborate to develop a report identifying key challenges and opportunities in IoT hardware systems as well as important resources needed to carry out this research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop convens researchers from related disciplines: sensor networks, VLSI, communication, signal processing, etc. The workshop will help to build a community of IoT researchers. The workshop will include graduate student attendees to broaden educational impact. The workshop organizers will strive to build an inclusive set of workshop attendees. The workshop will include a session on diversity issues in IoT research. Talks from the workshop will be broadcast for wider dissemination. The workshop report will be broadly distributed. Workshop attendees will be selected on the basis of white papers submitted to an open call. Workshop presentations will be broadcast on the Internet using video-conferencing tools. Topics of potential interest to the workshop include: VLSI IoT device architectures; ultra-low power design for IoT devices; IoT communication and networking; emerging technologies for IoT devices and systems; distributed algorithms under power and bandwidth constraints; IoT applications in manufacturing, transportation, health care, smart communities, etc.; safe and secure IoT systems; data science challenges in IoT systems; machine learning and AI using IoT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported the work of a group of contributors on important aspects in Internet-of-Things (IoT) research. The contributors met before the ICCAD conference in San Diego, California on November 4, 2018 to discuss ideas in person. Contributors included faculty and students from a wide range of U. S. universities. The report was completed by electronic discussion based on notes from that meeting.     Intellectual merit: IoT systems are large-scale networked embedded systems that are provide sensing, actuating, processing, and informing. An IoT system has two essential characteristics: it senses physical quantities, both continuous and discrete; and it operates on sensor data as a distributed computing system composed of several different types of nodes connected by wireless and/or wired networks. Application drivers are important for research. Safety, security, and privacy are key characteristics.  Machine learning is an important component technology; a great deal of inference and some training will need to be done at the edge to satisfy constraints on timing, power, and bandwidth.     Broader impacts: IoT systems are used in a wide variety of applications, including smart cities, health care, energy, and transportation.  The workshop report identified important characteristics of IoT systems, research challenges and opportunities, challenges and opportunities in diversity and inclusion, education and training issues, and enabling and dis-enabling factors for research and adoption of IoT systems.
