<AbstractNarration>The workshop, Statistics for the Environment: Research, Practice and Policy, will serve as the biennial workshop of the section on Statistics and the Environment (ENVR) of the American Statistical Association and will be held in Asheville, North Carolina, October 11-13, 2018. The workshop is designed to achieve three major goals: (i) provide a venue for environmental statisticians and practitioners to share ideas, facilitate collaboration and discuss ways to increase the impact and use of statistics in environmental practice and policy; (ii) provide an opportunity for environmental statisticians and environmental scientists to discuss and present novel statistical methods and new research findings in environmental and ecological disciplines; and (iii) provide training in new statistical methods developed to address some of the statistical and computational challenges typically posed by environmental and ecological data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will span two and a half days. During the first day, two short courses on high performance computing and hierarchical modeling, respectively, will take place. The second and third day will be devoted to scientific sessions with invited research talks on statistical methods for environmental and ecological data as well as applications. A contributed poster session will be held at the end of the second day. Topics discussed in the invited sessions include: statistical methods to handle massive, spatially correlated datasets and strategies for efficient computing; statistical models for spatial extremes; statistical methods for causal inference in an environmental context and understanding the (causal) effects of environmental exposures on human health and the environment, to name a few. The last day of the workshop will feature an invited panel discussion that will highlight cogent needs in environmental practice and policy and will examine possible avenues for impactful environmental statistics research.  More information on the workshop is available at: http://community.amstat.org/envr/events/envr2018workshop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
