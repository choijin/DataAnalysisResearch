<AbstractNarration>Coatings of surfaces is a fundamental materials process which impacts all areas of technology and is critical to many commercial products and manufacturing processes in industry, including coating, construction, chemical, cosmetic and drug formulation. As such it is key to all aspects of our national prosperity and welfare. Surface and interface of materials also play important roles in many research areas and is one of the most active cross-disciplinary topics. This grant supports a symposium on the topic of "Surface, Interface, and Coating Materials" at the 256th American Chemical Society (ACS) National Meeting. This symposium covers the recent advances in chemistry, physics and engineering of polymeric materials directly related to surface, interface and coating applications. The symposium is truly interdisciplinary, encouraging crosstalk and collaborations among different fields. Research discussed here will set the tone for future directions in surface and interface research, together with the next generation coating materials for industrial applications. It will also provide a multidisciplinary platform for scientists, including graduate students, postdocs and junior faculties, from both academia and industry to exchange information from different areas, and identify the emerging trends in fundamental research based on the needs of industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium will focus on the development of new chemistry and materials that enables tailoring physicochemical properties of surface and interface for diverse applications. Particular attention will be given to functionalized surfaces, such as super-hydrophobic surface, anti-fouling surface, anti-corrosion surface and smart coating materials. The symposium will also include the new analytical tools developed to characterize novel surface and interface, as well as the theories and computer simulations developed to help comprehensively understand the interfacial phenomena. The symposium is divided into three specific focus areas: (1) new chemical synthesis, physics and engineering related to surfaces; (2) study of interface in biomaterials and composite materials; (3) coating materials research and applications. The objectives are: (1) to highlight recent advances in the design, synthesis and characterization of surface and interface; (2) to translation of technologies generated in lab to industrial applications; (3) to promote dialogues and to exchange ideas among scientists and researchers across different disciplines, from both industry and academia; and (4) to provide opportunities for both senior and young investigators to present their most updated research results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
