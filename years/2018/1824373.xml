<AbstractNarration>This research project will study how gender-related workplace attributes and family pressures affect labor supply decisions of recent high school and college women graduates.  Despite increasing female educational attainment, female labor force participation (FLFP) remains low and lags that of men in many parts of the world.  This research involves an information experiment on a labor market platform in which individual job-seekers are randomly selected to receive information about the gender composition of the firm and/or gender of the supervisor at positions they are matched with.  The jobseeker is also asked about how her family feels about the job match.   The researchers are interested in whether the job-seeker chooses to apply to the positions for which she is matched with.  The results of this experiment are matched with a series of questions that measure differences between the jobseeker's preferences and her perceptions of her family's preferences regarding her job search to shed light on how family concerns and job place characteristics jointly affect female labor supply decisions.  The results of this research project will provide inputs into policies to increase female labor supply and in the process, enhance economic growth and reduce gender income inequality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will use field experiments to investigate the effects of gender-related job and firm characteristics and family and social perceptions on female labor supply.  The PIs will provide information about work place and firm characteristics, such as the gender composition of workers, supervisor's gender, and hours of work, to randomly selected individual prospective job-seekers as well as elicit information about familial consent of the job and firm characteristics to see how these affect the jobseeker's labor supply decisions.   In a cross-randomization, individuals are primed to think about their family's job search advice.  The outcome of interest is whether the job-seeker chooses to apply to each of the positions for which she is matched and meets the basic qualifications.  The results of this experiment are matched with a series of willingness-to-pay vignettes that measure differences between her own preferences and her perceptions of her family's preferences regarding her job search, to shed light on household constraints on female labor supply decisions.  The results of this research will shed light on why female labor force participation in many parts of the world has not kept pace with increased female education.  The results will also provide inputs into policies to employ increasing female human capital, hence lead to faster economic growth, increased income, and possibly gender equity in incomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The global ratio of female to male enrollment in secondary education has nearly reached one; in tertiary  education, this ratio has surpassed one. However, women are less likely than men to participate in the labor force, spend more hours than men on unpaid work, and earn less than men around the world.  Furthermore, women and men tend to work in different occupations in many settings. Thus, while globally women have attained higher levels of education in the last two decades, this has not been reflected fully in their interaction with the labor force. This empirical fact is concerning as it could have longer-run implications for economic growth and gender equity if women’s knowledge and skills are not being used effectively, particularly due to social norms.     In this project, I study the role of social norms in women’s job search decisions and occupational choice, which could contribute to underemployment.  As with any market transaction, there are two halves to the story: whether firms are willing to hire women and whether women apply to jobs.  In this project, I focus on the supply-side constraints that women can face to working outside the home.  I conduct a randomized experiment on a job search platform in Lahore, Pakistan, a setting where educational attainment has grown but female labor force participation remains low.      In the experiment, I randomly select educated female jobseekers to receive additional information about real job postings in the city: about gender composition of employees at the firm and/or gender of the supervisor.  For a portion of the sample, I conduct an additional experiment where I randomize whether jobseekers are primed to think about family job search advice before making decisions about whether to apply to a job.      I find that women primed to think about family job search advice are significantly less likely to apply to a job, consistent with concerns about family pressure against working outside the home.  In addition, I find that women are more likely to apply to a job if they receive information about the gender of the supervisor, and more likely to apply to a job they know has a female supervisor than one they know has a male supervisor, holding all other attributes of the job fixed.  There is some suggestive evidence that women believe that, aligned with a social norm about men and women not interacting in public spaces, their families do not want them to work at jobs with mostly male coworkers, and women avoid jobs with all male coworkers to align with how they believe their families would advise them due to the social norm.        More broadly, these results indicate that gender-related workplace attributes influence women’s interaction with the labor market on the supply-side in a way that is aligned with social norms pressures that women can face when choosing to work outside the home.  These job search decisions can impact women’s downstream job opportunities and career growth.  The results of this study shed light on the role of social norms in constraining women’s interaction with the labor market in South Asia, one of the regions of the world where the gap between women’s and men’s labor force participation is the widest.
