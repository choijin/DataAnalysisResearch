<AbstractNarration>Wireless devices have become ubiquitous.  New devices are coming on line all the time, and protocols for these devices continue to evolve.  This research will investigate a flexible platform that can support a variety of different devices and protocols for both high data rate wireless networking and low power, low bandwidth devices that are part of the Internet of Things (IoT).  This represents a shift from the rigid networks of previous generations, towards greater versatility and adaptability.  The resulting research will enable new devices to integrate with existing systems more easily, and has the potential to change the way wireless networking is supported worldwide. Essential enablers for this versatility include: more flexible radio access technologies and dynamic management of resources at the edge of wireless networks.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research represents a new collaboration between researchers in the US and in Ireland to pursue a common strategy to investigate physical layer wireless protocols.   Prototyping of new protocols as well as developing an agile approach to support existing protocols will be investigated.  The platform includes both hardware and software to enable prototyping and experimentation across a range of protocols especially at the physical layer.  The base platform will use state-of-the-art hardware that can easily be upgraded as new hardware becomes available.  In addition, supporting software packages will ease the use of the base hardware for researchers with wireless and communications backgrounds.  Hardware/software implementations will allow the support of a range of wireless applications at different performance points.   Run-time reconfiguration of hardware will enable rapidly adapting to the existing environment.  Flexibility and reconfigurability will ensure that real time implementations of future protocols can be experimented with.&lt;br/&gt;Shared test-beds for wireless networking research will be developed between Ireland and the US.  The test-beds will be flexible and reconfigurable and thus support novel designs in wireless protocols and edge computing.  The test-beds, which include both hardware and software, will be used for both research and educational purposes.  Educational materials that can be used in both the US and Ireland as well as worldwide will be developed and shared widely.  Material developed in this project will be shared with European Horizon 2020 researchers, as well as through the internet, conferences, and open source software.  The resulting platform will enable flexible, adaptable and scalable wireless networking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The diverse and demanding requirements for the next generation of mobile devices necessitates a shift away from the rigid networks of previous generations, towards greater versatility and adaptability. Essential enablers for this versatility include: more flexible radio access technologies and dynamic management of resources at the edge of wireless networks. This research represents a new collaboration between researchers in the US and in Ireland to pursue a common strategy to investigate physical layer wireless protocols. Prototyping of new protocols as well as developing an agile approach to support existing protocols have been investigated. Specifically, we are looking into the investigation of physical implementation of protocols on a Xilinx RFSoC board specifically designed for such implementations.  We investigated supporting 5G as well as other wireless protocols and specifically MIMO, beamforming and Digital Pre Distortion (DPD) in FPGA hardware, and how these implementations interact with local software.  This project lays the groundwork for joint research for the future between Northeastern University, researchers in Ireland (specifically Trinity College Dublin and Maynooth University) as well as researchers in Northern Ireland and other parts of the European Union.  This project enabled the development of a testbed that will further research into hardware/software codesign and wireless communications.  The testbed, is currently being used at both Northeastern and Maynooth University in Ireland.  It is built from components that others can easily assemble and includes both common and custom tools which are available to the community.   This testbed is the basis of ongoing research between Northeastern University and colleagues in Ireland and Northern Ireland.    One aspect of the research that the testbed was applied to is a novel approach to wireless security where characteristics of the channel allow a shared secret to be determined between transmitter and receiver.  Hardware experiments demonstrated that an eavesdropper would not be able to intercept the communication.  The advantage of this approach is that it is dynamic and varies based on the location of senders and receivers, and thus has a higher level of security than existing approaches.
