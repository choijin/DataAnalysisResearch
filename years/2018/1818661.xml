<AbstractNarration>Data science research advances society globally through new knowledge and methods.  Research collaborations that cross international boarders allows the best ideas to emerge from wherever they exist.  The US-Serbia and West Balkan Data Science Workshop, co-funded by the National Science Foundation and partners in West Balkans region, brings together the best minds in data science.  The workshop focuses on four timely areas of research:  mathematical foundations, big data processing including security and privacy, data science in biomedical informatics, and data science in computational archaeology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US-Serbia and West Balkan Data Science Workshop is structured in such a way as to have a lasting impact on data science collaboration between the US and the West Balkans region through facilitated interaction and follow through on high impact research topics in data science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ US-Serbia and West Balkan Data Science Workshop (Aug. 26-28, 2018) brought together a wide range of researchers from the US, Serbia, and West Balkan Region, addressing various challenges related to extracting value from data, including renowned experts, early stage investigators, and students from Serbia, the West Balkans, and the US.  The objective of the workshop was to determine particular areas of demonstrated strength by Serbia and West Balkans, which also generate big data and require advanced knowledge discovery methods that would benefit from multidisciplinary international collaborations to further advance these fields with state-of-the-art methods and technologies of data science and mathematics.   The program included 2 keynote lectures, 39 invited lectures, 101 poster presentations and 3 panels grouped in the following focus areas: Foundations, Biomedical Informatics, Critical Infrastructures, and Digital Archeology.  The overall impression was that the synergy built by the collaboration framework of investigators in Serbian and Western Balkan countries with US colleagues would contribute to the advancement of these fields and data science. Some of the benefits of such a framework include:  Serbia and the Western Balkan region have significant capacity to be involved in joint research projects with US partners within data science. These collaborations would benefit from strong research capacities of Serbia and the Balkan region in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) built on a very well-developed education system in these areas and track record of outstanding achievement in mathematics.   Investment in research collaboration with Serbia and the Western Balkans will be especially cost effective as smaller initial investments will be able to fund high quality research in data science at a lower cost-to-results ratio as compared to many countries with comparable research capacities that have higher cost of living and therefore require larger research funding. In addition, bilateral research collaboration with a non-EU country like Serbia could be easier to implement by avoiding often restrictive EU regulations and associated costs.   Serbia and the Western Balkans have access to unique data sets and environments for data science research, including a diverse and extensive range of archeological sites and populations for genetics research as well as federated education and critical infrastructure data warehouses and institutes and organizations actively collecting and analyzing such data.   Several specific initiatives were suggested related to building living labs in Serbia and the West Balkan region to facilitate data science related interdisciplinary and international research activities in the area of smart and connected life. Towards this objective, contacts were identified at the USAID, World Bank and relevant industries to apply to for financial help in building the proposed living labs. Priority living labs topics were identified based on participants data science research aimed to facilitate decision making in healthcare, resilience in energy and ecology, and quality of education. Examples of living labs-based collaboration opportunities were discussed focused on integration of data science research and innovations activities in Serbia and West Balkans with complementary activities in the US. The overall objective of the proposed living labs is developing an experiential environment where data science investigators, policy makers and citizens from both sides would immerse themselves in designing, exploring, experiencing and refining new methodologies, policies and regulations in real-life scenarios.  Following are three examples of living lab platforms that could be developed quickly with modest investments:  Balkan Regional Smart Grid Analytics Living Lab.   Serbia Learning Analytics Living Lab.     Serbia BioScience Living Lab.   A few hundred participants were physically present at the workshop, but there was a further global presence, as the workshop was live streamed to the entire world.  The workshop general chair was Z. Obradovic (Temple University, USA) while co-organizer and engagement chair was A. Drecun (Intersection Center for Science and Innovation, Serbia) and local co-chairs were Z. Ognjanovic (Mathematical Institute of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Serbia) and S. Ghilezan (University of Novi Sad, Serbia). The field trip host was M. Korac (Archeological Institute, Serbia).  The workshop had 2 keynotes on the following topics:  Data Science: Challenges and Opportunities when Playing in Everyone Else's Backyard (Z. Obradovic, Temple University, USA)   On the Importance of Causal Models in Making Sense of Big Data (V. Honavar, Pennsylvania State University, USA)   The program included 39 invited lectures, 101 poster presentations and 3 panels grouped in the following focus areas: Foundations, Biomedical Informatics, Critical Infrastructures, and Digital Archeology. 20 of invited speakers were from the US group, 11 from Serbia and 8 from other West Balkan countries.  Each of the four tracks has provided a report on the outcomes and identified the potentials and opportunities for collaborative research between the US and West Balkan researchers.
