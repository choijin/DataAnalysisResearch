<AbstractNarration>This award funds a workshop on Bio-inspired technologies in the general field of geotechnical engineering.  The workshop will be held in Pacific Grove, California, on May 19-22, 2019. The rapidly emerging discipline of biogeotechnics is comprised of both bio-mediated and bio-inspired technologies.  Bio-mediated technologies, such as microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) to cement sands, have been the primary focus over the past decade and have seen exponential growth.  Active research in the field now exists in more than 15 countries, companies have been founded, and national research centers have been established.  A new workforce has been created, with graduates working in the biogeotechnics field in both and industry.  Bio-inspired geotechnics, the complimentary aspect of biogeotechnics, however, is in its infancy.  This field is at a critical, formative stage.  The basal definition and scope of the field is being defined. Specific areas that hold exceptional promise for research are being identified.   Understanding and filtering through the broader field of bio-inspired engineering and design (or biomimicry), which itself has largely become established in only the last decade, is underway. Conversations with the geotechnical industry regarding what might be practically possible are just beginning.  The bio-inspired geotechnics field is at a time when an international, interdisciplinary workshop could accelerate growth and define future directions.  Therefore, the objectives of the workshop are to begin building interdisciplinary collaborations, identify research priorities and possible funding sources, engage with industry regarding implementability, and identify and address the educational needs of researchers entering the field and engineers entering the workforce.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together approximately 55 individual experts from academia and industry who are technically and demographically diverse, and collectively cover expertise in fields from geotechnical engineering to biology to soft robotics.  The workshop participants will include established senior investigators through assistant professors and underrepresented graduate students.  The workshop will be held over a period of three days at an inclusive meeting facility that will facilitate continuous planned formal workshop activities as well as informal interactions.  The workshop has been carefully designed in a structure that will scaffold, or gradually build, from developing a mutual foundation of discipline understanding, to sharing current research and brainstorming new opportunities, to identifying the necessary "action items" or developmental steps required to mature this field.  An informal environment that fosters discussion, brainstorming, free sharing of ideas, and development of collaboration relationships has been incorporated into the workshop agenda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit  This workshop brought together 60 researchers from different such as geotechnical and civil engineering, biology, robotics, mechanical engineering, and granular material physics. This workshop:  Facilitated transfer of knowledge through keynote lectures, poster presentations, working groups, and one-on-one interactions at the workshop. Identified technical knowledge gaps at the interface of the fields of soil mechanics, biology, robotics, and physics.  Evaluated which topics and applications hold the greatest potential and therefore should be considered high priority for further research in bioinspired geotechnics. Evaluated which topics and applications appear to be less promising and thus should be assigned a lower priority. Assessed efficacy and generality of bio-inspiration techniques that can facilitate idea abstraction and application to geotechnical engineering. Assessed experiences in the training and development of graduate students for this new field and to identify approaches that have been successful or appear to be promising. Produced a journal paper that summarized existing literature in biological principles, bio-inspired design, and research in the field of bio-inspired geotechnics.       Broader impacts  The workshop topic creates the opportunity for experts to meet and discuss an area that resides at the interface of a number of traditional fields, including geotechnical engineering, biology, plant science, microbiology, and bioengineering. Since few scientists and engineers currently perform research directly in this field (most attendees perform research related to this area but in their respective disciplines), the meeting stimulated interest among young investigators that may become the future leaders of this new field.   The proposed workshop provided significant broader impacts within and beyond the associated engineering and science communities including: (1) discovery of new sustainable and/or safe engineering solutions, (2) development of cost effective solutions to engineering problems, (3) improved understanding of scientific problems, (4) improved understanding of the effect of construction on nature, (5) cross-education of researchers, (6) identification of opportunities for improved undergraduate education, and (7) development of graduate students towards this new field.
