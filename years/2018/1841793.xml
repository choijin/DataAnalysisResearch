<AbstractNarration>1624331&lt;br/&gt;Van Aken&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Growing bioenergy feedstock plants on contaminated land for the combined benefit of bioenergy production and land bioremediation is an attractive strategy which has the potential to increase the cost-efficiency of plant-based biofuel. Production of bioethanol from lignocellulosic biomass, second generation bioethanol, is currently considered one of the most sustainable options for reducing dependency on fossil fuel and reducing carbon dioxide emissions, while limiting competition with land for food production. The plant selected for this study is the lignocellulosic feedstock species, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), which is a model plant to study the production of second-generation bioethanol. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objective of the proposed research is to determine the physiological and molecular effects of the phytotoxic antibiotic, chlortetracycline, on the biomass productivity and digestibility in the lignocellulosic plant, switchgrass. The contaminant that will be tested is the model emerging contaminant, chlortetracycline, which is known to exert toxic effects toward most plant species. The proposed research involves the two following specific aims: 1. To determine the effects of the phytotoxic emerging contaminant, chlortetracycline, on the biomass productivity, composition, and digestibility in the model lignocellulosic feedstock plant, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). 2. To understand the molecular mechanisms by which chlortetracycline affects the biomass productivity and lignocellulose composition in exposed switchgrass plants. Using a combination of analytical and molecular biology methods, the proposed research will address the following questions: 1. What is the tolerance of switchgrass plants toward the selected contaminant, chlortetracycline? 2. How will chlortetracycline affect switchgrass plants in terms of biomass productivity, lignocellulose digestibility, and bioethanol conversion? 3. What are the genetic and molecular bases underlying the changes in biomass and biomass composition (e.g., lignin) in chlortetracycline-exposed plants? The research team brings complementary expertise in phytotechnology, molecular biology, and spectral analyses to conduct the research. Besides the research objectives outlined above, this project will integrate research and education, at the University and include the participation of high school students.</AbstractNarration>

In addition, perennial lignocellulosic feedstock plants can be cultivated on polluted soil unsuitable for the production of edible plants and contribute to land bioremediation &ndash; a process referred to as phytoremediation. However, prior research has suggested that toxic contaminants may affect the lignin content in exposed plants, which would potentially impact the biomass digestibility and conversion into bioethanol.  The overall objective of the research was to determine the physiological and molecular effects of phytotoxic contaminants, including the antibiotic, chlortetracycline, a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), and one hydroxylated metabolite of PCB (OH-PCB), on the biomass productivity and digestibility in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana.  Intellectual Merit  The study used a combination of advanced analytical methods (chemometric analysis using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy&ndash;FTIR) and whole-genome gene expression methods to study the effect of the selected toxicants on the plant biomass.  Toxicity testing revealed that two compounds, chlortetracycline and the OH-PCB, exerted a significant toxic effect on the plants at doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg L-1. On the contrary, the PCB did not affect significantly the plant growth even at high concentration (100 mg L-1).  Using second derivative FTIR, we have shown that exposure of Arabidopsis to all three compounds resulted in significant increase in the relative lignin content (from 15 to 100%), although this changes were more evident in plants exposed to the PCB and its hydroxylated derivative than in plants exposed to chlortetracycline, regardless of their respective toxicity.  Whole-genome gene expression analysis of Arabidopsis exposed to the three toxicants was conducted using RNA sequencing, revealing that exposure to the PCB and the OH-PCB resulted in significant enrichment of genes involved in lignin biosynthesis (i.e., phenylpropanoid pathway). On the contrary, exposure to chlortetracycline did not result in clear enrichment in genes involved in lignin synthesis, which is consistent with the determination of the lignin content in exposed plants.  Besides genes specifically involved in lignin biosynthesis, exposure to the three toxicants also resulted in enrichment of genes involved in various categories potentially related to response xenobiotic compounds, including peroxidase activity, glutathione S-transferase activity, glycosyltransferase activity, response to oxidative stress, response to toxic substances, kinase activity, defense mechanisms, and regulation of transcription.  Our results showed for the first time that exposure of plants to toxic contaminants could impact the composition of the plant biomass (i.e., increase of the lignin content). This finding may have important implications for the strategy of growing bioenergy feedstock plants on contaminated land for bioenergy production and land bioremediation.

The results presented in this report also demonstrate that combination of chemometric analyses for the determination of the biomass composition and whole-genome gene expression data allows to link physiological observations with underlying changes at molecular level. This approach could find further applications in plant sciences, including the improvement of the nutritional values of plants or the production of plants resistant to stress.  Broader Impacts  Outcomes from this research are expected to promote the development of phytotechnologies consisting in growing plants on contaminated land for the benefits of land rehabilitation, sustainable energy production, and mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the increase of lignification in exposed plants may help mitigating the impact of toxic stress on the biomass digestibility.  This project supported the research of graduate students and high-school students, which is expected to contribute to increase their motivation to pursue a career in plant biotechnology and STEM disciplines.  With the sustained growth of the world population, the increase of environmental pollution, the degradation of agricultural land, and the potential impact of global warming on agricultural yield, there is an urgent need to understand better the response of plants to toxic and other environmental stresses. Our project combining the chemometric analysis of the plant biomass with the transcriptomic analysis of the molecular basis of the stress response could pave the way to further studies aiming at developing technologies for the efficient and safe cultivation of plants on impaired land.
