<AbstractNarration>Globalization has been eroding the US edge in civil engineering knowledge and research, which is fundamental to the development of the US economy and the welfare of its society. In reality, the advancement of knowledge across civil engineering disciplines (e.g. environmental, materials, water resources, transportation, structures, geotechnical, construction, computing, or telematics) requires not only an interdisciplinary approach but also the generation of globally-engaged and high-quality civil engineering researchers. In response to these challenges, this collaborative award between ASU and the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) promises to generate large-scale and long-lasting global engagement for a diverse cohort of US graduate civil engineering students through semester-long and world-class research experiences. The design of these research experiences aims at building permanent research collaborations by nurturing a strong personal connection of the students with the international research partner(s) along with knowledge of the cultural and physical contexts in which research occurs. In this project, the US students have access to unique sources of data, facilities, ideas, and networks of acquaintance, and thus will become better prepared to succeed in a competitive research context characterized by pressing global and sustainable issues. By contributing to the generation of a globally-engaged civil engineering workforce with world-class skills, this project contributes to the competitiveness of the US STEM workforce, colleges and universities, and public and private sector industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a 3-year duration, this award enables semester-long and world-class research experiences for a diverse cohort of 75 U.S. civil engineering graduate students at premier research universities located in Australia, China, Colombia, Canada, South Africa, India, and Israel. A significant presence of women and underrepresented minority students creates a diverse student cohort. Specific calls for application are disseminated through channels that can directly reach and engage minorities and disadvantaged students. Each student will remain a fellow for two years from notification of admittance with the aim to secure long-term networks of collaboration and build professional development. A robust professional development focus reinforces the research component in this award. For example, students develop expertise in leadership and ethics through ASU and ASCE's education resources. Students also engage with domestic professional conferences and regional/local meetings while in the US and through equivalent professional societies and industry organizations during their international experience. Additionally, a strong assessment plan will generate empirical data and results that promise to advance the understanding of aspects such as engagement, research, and cultural competence in international research experiences. Finally, this award will promote and disseminate its highlights and outcomes through a combination of academic and non-academic outlets in order to close the gap between academia, industry, and society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
