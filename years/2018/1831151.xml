<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is provided by a novel data processing architecture, utilizing high-parallel in-memory computing for certain recurring and data intensive functions. Traditional computer architecture funnels all data through the central processing unit (CPU). Multiple CPU cores and very high clock frequencies are used to address the issue of ever increasing demands on data processing capability. However, the transportation capacity of data between memory and CPU cores has become a limiting factor creating a 'memory bottleneck'. This limitation is most noticeable in the recent and rapid development of artificial intelligence applications which deploy so called neuromorphic computing techniques, which in turn require a very high parallelism in computation and proportional demands on memory bandwidth. This project performs key repetitive operations within the memory itself, leveraging the inherent parallelism of the memory architecture, thereby avoiding a large percentage of the data transport otherwise required. The resulting elimination of the memory bottleneck provides a path forward for high complexity neuromorphic computing applications such as autonomous navigation used for self-driving cars. Reduced demands on data transport and CPU also significantly reduce power consumption, enabling a wide variety of mobile artificial intelligence applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project investigates the system level integration challenges of a memory-centric neuromorphic computing approach, and aims to demonstrate a seamless integration with existing software platforms currently using traditional neuromorphic computing processors. It is important for a novel hardware platform to be compatible with existing software in order to lower barriers to market entry. This Phase II project also develops the actual semiconductor product which has been investigated in Phase I as a feasibility demonstrator. The Phase II product is based on a non-volatile high density memory architecture, and as such is expected to provide the full capability in terms of both power and operations per second. Once the hardware is available in the second half of the project, these key parameters will be thoroughly characterized and benchmarked against the current state of the art technology. A projection will be made outlining the future scaling potential using ultra high density volatile and non-volatile memory geared towards high complexity neuromorphic computing beyond what is currently possible using existing approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
