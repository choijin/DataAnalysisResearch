<AbstractNarration>This project examines the implementation of one of the first "no-wrong-door" client database and referral systems shared by local anti-poverty nonprofit organizations (NPOs) in a rural county and small city.  Federal and state governments frequently deliver services through non-governmental organizations rather than public bureaucracies, and social services are turning to technology and data-sharing as a tool to better track outcomes and collaborate across organizations. This study looks at this convergence and provides an analytical description of the implementation process from the perspective of NPO administrators, staff, and clients.  Results will help government policy-makers and NPO leaders be better informed about the consequences of encouraging NPOs to adopt collaborative, data-driven solutions for the delivery of social resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study draws on data from nine initial months of ethnographic observation at four focal nonprofits involved in the database initiative, and subsequent community observation over a total of 1.5 years.  During this time period, this group of NPOs has been proceeding with the implementation of a shared client management system, in which all organizations in the database have access to client information and can send referrals to each other.  In addition, community leaders, nonprofit administration and staff, and social service clients (n = 80 to 110) are interviewed for this research.  Examination of the initiative throughout its implementation will enable this study to understand the social, economic, and political processes involved in the development of a shared data infrastructure in the field of nonprofit social services, and their consequences for service delivery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of this project were to study the implementation of a shared case management platform among anti-poverty nonprofits in a small city in Central Pennsylvania. Methods to do so included ethnographic observation at four participating nonprofits, along with semi-structured interviews with community leaders, nonprofit administrators, staff, and clients.   In doing so, the study aimed to offer up a case study illuminating the following overall question: how do changes in American social policy and the resulting emphasis on data and affect the delivery of nonprofit social services at the community level?    Upon completion, this project successfully met these objectives. This ethnographic study found that this implementation of  shared case management platform among anti-poverty nonprofits illuminated tensions between its underlying vision for anti-poverty work and other important aspects of service delivery:   - Tension between technocratic and interactional social work approaches: In many participating programs, technocratic goals of coordination and performance measurement came into conflict with interactional components of social work such as the case manager-client relationship and professional discretion in decision-making.  - Differences in scope and operationalization of program goals: In other settings, the initiative’s outcome-oriented emphasis on "moving the needle" and meeting the ambitious goal of eliminating local poverty was at odds with more traditional programs’ narrower goals of providing short-term services.  - Competing tensions negatively affected the project's implementation: As revealed through the implementation of the database, these tensions led to a reshaping and renegotiating of the technology in ways that negatively affected both individual program operations and the success of the overall initiative.  In addition, this project led to the successful defense of the co-PI's (M&eacute;lanie Terrasse) doctoral dissertation.
