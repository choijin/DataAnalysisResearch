<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the 2018 East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium that will be held on October 13 and 14, 2018, on the campus of Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas. Additional information about this meeting can be found at the website: http://faculty.tcu.edu/jcarrion/ecoas2018/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is the sixteenth installment of the East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium (ECOAS), a series that annually brings together a diverse group of mathematicians with broad research interests in the theory of operator algebras, both C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras as well as noncommutative geometry. Some of the 2018 areas of emphasis will be on the following topics: the theory of subfactors, deformation/rigidity theory, free probabilty, classification of C*-algebras (the Elliott program), the C*-algebra approach to the Novikov conjecture, C*-algebras and dynamical systems, the Baum-Connes conjecture, noncommutative differential geometry, and index theory. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Speakers  included experts from the areas of C^*-algebras, von Neumann algebras,  and non-commutative geometry.  Most speakers were young researchers and  postdocs, who spoke on recent trends and cutting-edge techniques in  their fields.  The meeting featured eleven plenary speakers:  - Sarah Browne (Penn State) - Kristin Courtney (WWU M&uuml;nster) - Marius Dadarlat (Purdue University) - Rolando de Santiago (UCLA) - Daniel Drimbe (University of Regina) - James Gabe (University of Glasgow) - Bin Gui (Rutgers University) - Corey Jones (Australian National University) - Xin Ma (Texas A&amp;M) - Jesse Peterson (Vanderbilt University) - Rufus Willett (University of Hawai&#699;i at M&#257;noa)  Each of the speakers gave a 50-minute lecture.
