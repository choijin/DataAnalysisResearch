<AbstractNarration>This project contributes to efforts to develop a new class of optical quantum computing devices that are constructed using solid-state thin film materials and can operate at room temperature.  Such new devices have the potential to revolutionize information technology, with applications ranging from cryptographic code-breaking to ultra-secure communication over networks.  One of the most exciting features of the solid-state thin film materials investigated in this project is their potential to enable quantum information processing devices that require neither cryogenic nor high-vacuum environments, which add substantial bulk and complexity to prior approaches.  This project specifically addresses a set of open questions regarding the room-temperature optical properties of monolayer thin films of the material molybdenum diselenide, the answers to which are crucial for predicting the best achievable performance of practical computing systems.  Although bulk crystals of molybdenum diselenide have long been studied, the recent development of methods to prepare and characterize monolayer specimens - just a few atoms thick - have sparked new interest in this material because the properties of these thin films are markedly different from those of bulk samples.  Above and beyond its implications for the development of practical quantum information technology, this research contributes to the interdisciplinary training of Ph.D. students and to the development of state-of-the-art educational materials for classroom teaching in emerging areas of quantum engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on experimental and theoretical studies of the nonlinear optical responses and background optical absorption of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides over the temperature range from 4K to 300K.  The project leverages recent advances in the use of laser annealing to prepare high quality large-area homogeneous samples of molybdenum diselenide, as well as recent theoretical calculations of Kerr-type nonlinearities associated with transitions among bound exciton states.  The project aims to extend prior measurements and calculations to assess decoherence associated with exciton-phonon and exciton-exciton interactions at finite temperatures, and to arrive at quantum optical input-output models of transition metal dichalcogenide-based quantum photonic devices at room temperature with experimentally validated parameters.  The project also aims specifically to assess the feasibility of constructing nonlinear photonic resonators based on stacks of multiple transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers, and to predict the best possible performance of such devices for quantum photonic information processing.  Broader impacts of the project include interdisciplinary training of graduate students and the development of interdisciplinary material for graduate-level teaching at the intersection of quantum optics and quantum materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The broad aims of this project have been to advance our ideas and experimental capabilities pertaining to logic devices for quantum computing based on a novel class of materials called monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).  Our specific technical objectives divided into a theoretical component and an experimental component.  In our theoretical work we have aimed to improve our understanding of how defects in sample growth and preparation impact critical behaviors of TMDs for quantum logic devices.  In our experimental work we have aimed to demonstrate practical methods for eliminating growth- and sample preparation-induced defects in TMD materials, and to demonstrate ways in which the optical response of TMDs is similar to and different from that of gas-phase atoms, which are much simpler to model but much harder to use in practice.  Our key technical advances include the development and demonstration of a laser annealing technique for improving TMD samples grown by chemical vaport deposition (CVD), and the demonstration that TMDs couple strongly to collimated (as opposed to tightly-focused) laser beams.  Both of these results may significantly impact future strategies for building large-scale quantum computing architectures based on TMDs, as they show how simplified fabrication approaches and device designs may be much more effective than previously imagined.  This project has contributed substantially to the Ph.D. work of one graduate student and partially to the Ph.D. work of three more.
