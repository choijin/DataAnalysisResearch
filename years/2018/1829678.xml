<AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support for graduate students from US institutions, who are co- authors of one or more accepted papers, to participate and present their work at 2018 IEEE International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances for Wireless Communications (SPAWC), to be held in Kalamata Greece, June 25-28, 2018. This is the 19th workshop in the SPAWC series, and is devoted to advances in signal processing for wireless communications, networking, and information theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed graduate student participation is poised to have a positive impact on signal processing for wireless communications research in US institutions. The workshop will be a great opportunity for graduate students to learn about emerging areas, and meet with worldwide experts. More importantly, the students will gain new ideas leading to stronger and more complete entrepreneurial learning, and will put their contributions in perspective to ongoing research activities at the international level.The broader impact of the proposed student participation will materialize as these students joining the US workforce will be better positioned to spearhead research and development activities in diverse industrial sectors, such as those serving wireless communications, homeland security, defense, and the automotive industries. The gender diversity of the plenary and thematic oral session presenters will inspire female graduate students to remain and pursue careers in the field of signal processing for wireless communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

IEEE SPAWC 2018 was held on 25-28 June in Kalamata, Greece, and had over 250 registered attendees. With the help of NSF Travel awards, 5 students from US universities were able to attend the conference and gain valuable professional experience to help them grow into potential future leaders in their fields. The students learned about cutting-edge research aligned with the four main themes of SPAWC 2018 that centered on emerging topics and research directions in    Learning and data analytics,   Secure &amp; adversarial systems,   Biological communications and signal processing, and   5G and beyond.           Oral thematic sessions (each consisting of three in-depth talks) were held on each of these four themes. Four plenary talks aligned with these four themes were delivered by Olgica Milenkovic (UIUC), Leandros Tassiulas (Yale), Aaron Wagner (Cornell) and Rebecca Willett (presently at the University of Chicago).
