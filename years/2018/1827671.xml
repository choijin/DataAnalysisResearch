<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this PFI project is to create a new type of biosensor for biomedical research.  Biosensors are key tools in the study of how molecules bind to each other.  Proteins, antibodies, peptides, DNA strands, and medicines all bind and release each other in ways that are critical for human health; and the study of these binding interactions is critical to finding new medicines, detecting diseases, and understanding our own biology.  Better biosensors lead to better health outcomes, and the prototype biosensor developed by this project aims to reveal molecular interactions that are presently hidden to all other types of biosensors currently in use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will achieve this goal using recent innovations in biosensing research.  Specifically, electronic, solid-state biosensors have been successfully commercialized; and compatible single-molecule electronics have been proven to be useful for precision measurements of biochemical activity.  The technical objective of this project will be a proof-of-concept hybrid device that combines conventional ensemble sensing side-by-side with complementary, electronic monitoring of single-molecule binding kinetics.  This combination of simultaneous ensemble and single-molecule monitoring does not exist in any commercial sensor, but it provides new opportunities to break through fundamental limitations faced by all ensemble biosensors.  Specifically, the project hypothesizes that the combined data will extend the biosensor's effective dynamic range and help eliminate false positive and false negative results.  If successful, this type of hybrid sensor could establish a new paradigm where single-molecule data are leveraged in sensors generally to better inform end users in biology, healthcare, and manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This PFI-TT project was a collaboration between the research group of Prof. P. G. Collins at the Univ. of California, Irvine and Cardea Inc. in San Diego to investigate new techniques in electronic biosensing.  The project was structured around Cardea's Agile R100 product, a novel electronic platform based on graphene transistors that measure protein and antibody binding interactions.  The Collins group, which specializes in the single-molecule limits of electronic sensing, investigated the practicality and commercial opportunities of adding single-molecule sensing to the Agile R100 product.  Specifically, the project was designed to determine whether high-quality single-molecule data could improve the ensemble results from an assay like the Agile R100.  The project was made possible by the shared technological underpinnings of the PI's single-molecule biosensor devices and the Agile R100's graphene transistors.  Over the course of two years, our collaboration tested proof-of-concept modifications that investigated different modes of single-molecule detection.  Single-molecule measurements using UCI's nanoelectronic devices were compared against ensemble results from the Agile R100, providing a fuller characterization of antibody-antigen and protein-protein interactions.  In addition, the single-molecule work helped develop a better understanding of failure mechanisms and electronic responses in the ensemble sensors.  Graduate students working on the project contributed three conference presentations, and the work will result in two peer-reviewed journal publications.  One student completed their Ph.D. dissertation.  In addition to the technical work on single-molecule sensing, this PFI-TT project leveraged NSF's I-Corps and INTERN initiatives.  I-Corps leads teams through product development and customer discovery steps related to their science research, and our team completed a 6-week sequence of I-Corps at UCI.  Another graduate student completed a 9-month internship working on-site with Cardea's scientists.  The I-Corps and INTERN opportunities helped students and one postdoctoral researcher add diverse job skills to their laboratory expertise in nanotechnology and electronic biosensing.
