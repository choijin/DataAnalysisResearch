<AbstractNarration>This study examines the growing use of therapy as an alternative to criminal prosecution in the United States. Tens of thousands of defendants each year are now offered a pathway to avoid felony convictions by completing therapeutic activities and passing drug tests for designated periods of time. By analyzing the role and consequences of these pretrial diversion programs, this project will contribute to knowledge about the impacts of the contemporary criminal justice system. It also will provide information to policymakers, legal practitioners, and the public as they determine the role that pretrial diversion should play in criminal justice reform efforts and in the provision of mental healthcare.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Despite the growing popularity of pretrial diversion programs across the U.S., little sociological research has yet examined their impacts. This research draws on national and local datasets, document analysis, an original survey experiment, participant observation, and interviews with attorneys, defendants, and therapists to illuminate the consequences of diversion nationally and to explore variation between programs.  Three questions are addressed: 1) how effective diversion is as a tool to promote decarceration; 2) what the implications of diversion are for social inequality; and 3) what effects diversion has on the lives of defendants.  Findings will contribute to scholarship on contemporary U.S. criminal justice system reform and on the consequences of using the court system to provide mental health treatment. In addition, this research will provide empirical information to jurisdictions seeking to expand diversionary options or to design new programs, to policymakers in search of effective criminal justice alternatives, and to groups involved in advocating for penal reform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The U.S. criminal legal system has reached an unprecedented scale. As elected officials face growing pressure to reduce its reach, few reforms have garnered more widespread support than programs that offer individuals treatment in place of punishment. In particular, pretrial diversion programs run by prosecutors have become a gold standard for many advocates, since they allow defendants to exit the court system without criminal records. But even as such programs expand across the country, encouraged by substantial philanthropic and federal funding, few studies have examined their consequences on the ground.  This award helped to support twelve months of ethnographic fieldwork, including participant observation in a diversion program and 108 in-depth interviews with legal decision makers and diversion participants, along with the collection of administrative and experimental data. Drawing on that diverse set of data, I asked three main questions about the ways diversion shapes the operations of the criminal courts.

These findings raise concerns that availability of diversion can make legal outcomes worse for some defendants.
