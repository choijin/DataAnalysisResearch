<AbstractNarration>The creation of large data sets in materials research is transforming the way in which work is done in the materials research field, making data science one of the essential tools in the discovery of new materials and in the elucidation of structure/processing/property correlations. At present, many materials problems of technological relevance are inherently data-intensive. Lack of adequate frameworks to process complex raw data into sound scientific knowledge hinders progress in crucial fronts, such as the correlation of grain-boundary character distribution of materials microstructures, along with its many degrees of freedom, with thermo-mechanical properties; and the identification of mechanisms controlling both normal and abnormal grain growth to engineer bulk, nanograin materials, amongst others. Lack of available frameworks often results in acquired data being discarded, given the poor current understanding on how to process and analyze big data. In short, materials scientists are inundated with multi-dimensional data from many sources, both experimental and computational, and vast amounts of data are under-utilized or thrown out completely.  &lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this workshop is to build the needed framework by assembling four seemingly disparate platforms: Human Computer Interactions, Data Analytics, Fundamental Research in Materials, and New Tools. &lt;br/&gt;This workshop proposes a genuine convergence approach merging two NSF Big Ideas, where the pursuit of harnessing data through improved human-machine interaction presents a new framework for materials discovery. Outputs to this workshop include a roadmap to guide the framework, as well as the nucleation of transdisciplinary collaborations amongst participants and several education opportunities, including recruitment, early-community building, and publicly available education materials suitable for university courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Lehigh University, in partnership with The Ohio State University, hosted a National Science Foundation (Award #1821933) sponsored 2-day, international "Workshop on the Convergence of Materials Research and Multi-Sensory Data Science" at Bear Creek Mountain Resort in Macungie, PA from June 11-13, 2018.  The purpose of this workshop, and its intellectual merit,  was to bring together scientists from allied disciplines in the basic and social sciences and engineering to address many issues involved in multi-sensory data science as applied to problems in materials research.   The broader impacts are that it served to forge ongoing partnerships for the participants and to develop a roadmap that establishes a common language and framework for continued dialogue to move this effort of promoting multi-sensory, data science forward.  More specifically, the workshop revolved around several interrelated working groups and topical sessions to explore the many facets of the materials research/data science enterprise, including data analytics, human cognition and human factors, grand-challenge problems and the development of new tools. Central to our discussions was the use and curation of data generated by many platforms.  Many of the conversations at this gathering focused on data management issues that were deemed crucial to the field of data science, including: 1.) metadata curation, 2.) data ownership, provenance and sharing, 3.) ontologies and schema, etc.  These issues are critical to the development of data analytic techniques, as well as creating strong cognitive models of data processing and improving education. Several participants indicated that, as a result of the workshop discussion, they have begun to think more about the interdisciplinary work that will need to occur to bring about the convergence of materials research and multi-sensory data science.    One new tool discussed at the workshop is a unique, interdisciplinary facility, the Nano/Human Interface (NHI), for data-driven discovery in which humans interact immersively with machines to interpret large data sets.   This facility is being developed by Lehigh University in partnership with the Ohio State University (OSU) and the Army Research Laboratory (ARL).
