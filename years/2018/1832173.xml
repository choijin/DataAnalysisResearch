<AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation award provides support to the conference "The topology and geometry of low-dimensional manifolds" to be be held July 12-15, 2018 at the University of Texas, Austin. The conference will focus on recent developments in areas of mathematics known as three and four-manifold topology. It will promote discoveries and collaborations in low dimensional topology and related fields. For wider and longer term benefit notes from the research talks will be posted on the conference website making them accessible to researchers around the world. This award will provide support to graduate student and junior mathematicians to attend the conference and gain expertise in this dynamic and fast moving field of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This conference aims to bring together leading researchers and early career mathematicians working in low-dimensional topology and its connections with symplectic and contact geometry. There have been many advances in our understanding of three- and four-manifolds in the last decade due in large part to a convergence of many varied and exciting ideas; from new invariants, such as Monopole Homology and Involutive Floer homology, to subtle connections with symplectic and contact topology.  The conference will bring people working with diverse approaches together to share ideas and foster collaborations. More information can be found at the conference website http://www.ma.utexas.edu/conferences/gompf/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
