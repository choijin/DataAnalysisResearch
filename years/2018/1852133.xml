<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to Boise State University, located in Boise, ID, will support the training of 9 students per year for 10 weeks during the summers of 2019 - 2020. This award is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with NSF and the NSF Division of Biological Infrastructure. Research is conducted in study sites throughout southern Idaho including in the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area. The REU-Raptor Research Site partners faculty from Boise State University's Raptor Research Center with scientists from the Peregrine Fund, Intermountain Bird Observatory, US Geological Survey and other agencies with expertise in the study of birds of prey. Students focus research on hawks, falcons, eagles, and owls to investigate biological questions related to species interactions, behavior, physiology, population dynamics, ecosystem function, and potential effects of climate change and anthropogenic influences on animal systems. Under the guidance of experienced mentors, students have the choice of field or laboratory projects and may focus on basic or applied aspects of raptor biology. Students also participate in a core program focused on responsible conduct of research and animal handling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that 18 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Focus is also on broadening participation in STEM by engaging members of underrepresented groups, veterans, and first generation college students. Students will learn how research is conducted, and most will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Participants also benefit from workshops focused on the publication process, scientific communication, and applying to graduate school and fellowships. The REU program culminates with participation at a statewide undergraduate research conference, providing for networking with other undergraduate researchers and university, government, and STEM industry professionals. A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about REU-Raptor Research is available by visiting https://biology.boisestate.edu/reu/ or by contacting the PI (Dr. Jim Belthoff at jbeltho@boisestate.edu).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
