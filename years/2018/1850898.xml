<AbstractNarration>The proposed product spans the following innovation areas. Development of new technology: 1- Novel method is presented to design and fabricate a treadmill solution by which flexibility of the walking surface can be controlled. This treadmill has the ability to bilaterally adjust the surface stiffness in a purely vertical direction, regardless of the relative location of the person with respect to the treadmill. By using strong stiffness adjustment motors and properly selecting a short lever, the stiffness can be changed very quickly. 2- Development of new rehabilitation approach: feasibility of a theory-driven rehabilitation approach will be proven that can lead to successful clinical trials for after-stroke patients. The treadmill is integrated with a motion capture and energy consumption system that can provide real-time data regarding the performance of the patients. This can help a therapist to quickly find the optimal tuning for a patient. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research advances the field of mobility rehabilitation through introducing the possibility of adjusting the stiffness of the walking surface. As of 2015, there are more than 18.2 million people with mobility impairment in the US. Among them, the majority are post-stroke patients. In the US, a stroke occurs every 40 seconds and the aggregate lifetime cost of first strokes is about $40 billion per year. In addition, nearly 40% of people age 65 and older have a walking disability. Any rehabilitation method that can enhance independent mobility of these populations would have a huge impact on their quality of life as well as reduce economic burden on the them, their families, insurance companies and the government. This product can be a solution to improve the walking capability of these people for community settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span>Running on compliant surfaces is safe but challenging, and controlled challenges can build up strength in healthy athletes and foster recovery during the rehabilitation process for injured athletes. The principal investigator (PI), Dr. Jafari, seeks to understand the role that surface stiffness plays in walking gaits, metabolic costs, and muscle activation demand, both for healthy individuals and for mobility-impaired patients. In order to analyze the effect of surface stiffness systematically, the PI needed an apparatus whose surface compliance level can be accurately adjusted. Drawing from his previous experiences in designing and developing Variable Stiffness Actuators (<em>VSAs</em>), the PI envisioned a novel dual-belt treadmill whose surface compliance could be mechanically adjusted using a compliant lever mechanism. Using this mechanism, the surface stiffness can be continually adjusted so that it can range from completely rigid, making it function like a typical commercial treadmill, to completely passive, with a theoretical stiffness of 0. The PI developed a prototype of the Treadmill with Adjustable Stiffness (<em>TwAS</em>) with a team of students working on a senior design project. The PI then attached to the treadmill a partial-weight-bearing harness system called <em>LiteGait</em>, which was meant both to ensure safety and to facilitate rehabilitation. Using this system, the gait of the user can be recorded with an eight-camera <em>Vicon </em>motion-capture system and the metabolic cost can be measured with a <em>VO2-max </em>system. Muscle activation can also be estimated with electromyography <em>(EMG) </em>electrodes. Some initial tests were conducted on healthy individuals, and the results were published in several journals and presented at various conferences.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The PI and his team attended one of the 80 nationwide NSF I-Corps Nodes, which was hosted at The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). After the team completed the program and interviewed 25 potential customers in the San Antonio area, the NSF instructor recommended the team for inclusion in the national NSF <em>I-Corps </em>2018 Fall Atlanta Cohort and awarded it a $50K grant for customer discovery (<em>Award# 1850898, title: I-CORPS: A Treadmill with Adjustable Stiffness with integrated measurement systems for rehabilitation applications</em>). The I-Corps project?s <em>intellectual merits </em>include its novel method for designing and fabricating a treadmill whose walking surface flexibility can be adjusted. The user can bilaterally adjust the treadmill?s surface stiffness in a <em>purely vertical direction</em>, regardless of the relative location of the user with respect to the treadmill. The stiffness can be changed very quickly with strong stiffness-adjustment motors and a properly selected short lever. We anticipate that this technology will have a <em>broader impact </em>than other treadmill technologies because it can enhance independent mobility in the mobility-impaired population, which would positively impact quality of life and reduce the economic burden on mobility-impaired persons, their families, their insurance companies, and the government. As of 2015, there were more than 18.2 million mobility-impaired people in the U.S., the majority of whom are post-stroke patients.

The team initially measured its value propositions in terms of increased speed in the achievement of rehabilitation outcomes with decreased costs, making it a potentially valuable system for physical therapists at after-stroke rehabilitation institutes. The primary advantage of compliant surfaces, which are widely used in rehabilitation institutes, is that they provide more challenging (yet safely controlled) conditions for the patients, which require more muscle activation, leading to faster recovery times. However, somewhere around the 50th interview, the team realized that the ability to adjust surface stiffness might be more beneficial for <em>athletic trainers </em>because it can help them train athletes to reduced the frequency of injuries and improve recovery times during the rehabilitation of injuries. We learned that the type of surface on which an athlete runs affects the quality of performance and that different running surfaces have different effects, and some can decrease the likelihood of injury. That realization became the <em>pivot point </em>in our costumer discovery process. From that point on, our interviews focused on athletic trainers as our <em>target market segment</em>. The results confirmed our hypothesis, that there is a great unmet need for adjustable-surface compliance runways in this field; however, we also found that our technology was not ready for use in athletic rehabilitation centers, primarily because the TwAS was designed for mobility-impaired patients who can walk at a maximum speed of 0.5m/s, not for athletes who can run at much higher speeds.&nbsp;</span></p> <div><span><br /></span></div> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/29/2019<br>      Modified by: Amir&nbsp;Jafari</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1850898/1850898_10583643_1572359627948_ScreenShot2019-10-29at9.31.24AM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1850898/1850898_10583643_1572359627948_ScreenShot2019-10-29at9.31.24AM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="TwAS"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1850898/1850898_10583643_1572359627948_ScreenShot2019-10-29at9.31.24AM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="TwAS"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Treadmill with Adjustable Stiffness-1</div> <div class="imageCredit">UTSA</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Amir&nbsp;Jafari</div> <div class="imageTitle">TwAS</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1850898/1850898_10583643_1572359667591_ScreenShot2019-10-29at9.31.32AM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1850898/1850898_10583643_1572359667591_ScreenShot2019-10-29at9.31.32AM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="TwAS"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1850898/1850898_10583643_1572359667591_ScreenShot2019-10-29at9.31.32AM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="TwAS"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">TwAS with its VO2Max component</div> <div class="imageCredit">UTSA</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Amir&nbsp;Jafari</div> <div class="imageTitle">TwAS</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
