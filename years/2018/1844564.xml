<AbstractNarration>STATMOS (STatistical methods for ATMospheric and Oceanic Sciences)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a Research Network in the Mathematical Sciences.  Recent events in climate science have highlighted the need for increased participation of statisticians. While mathematics plays an important role in modeling fluid dynamics, statistics specializes in quantifying uncertainty.  The objective of this project is to build a network of statisticians with interest in atmospheric and ocean science. The hubs of the network (and some nodes) have personnel both in statistics and in atmospheric and ocean science; the National Center for Atmospheric Research is a common node connected to each of the nodes. The network will also connect with similar networks in the Pacific Northwest and in Europe, and will provide the research necessary for decision makers to make informed decisions, based on accurate assessment of uncertainty. Scientifically, the exchanges between the nodes of the network will help foster a cadre of young researchers, including both undergraduate and graduate students, able to work across disciplines, developing relevant methodologies and applying them to important scientific problems. Students at early stages in their careers will get effectively integrated in the statistical and scientific community. This will help them to build a network in the community of statisticians working on multidisciplinary problems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research topics of this project cover broad areas, with a common theme being multivariate nonstationary non-Gaussian spatio-temporal models, which are needed to describe a changing world. Network researchers will study extreme events in space and time, will develop methods to compare models to data, will make uncertainty assessments for scenario-based climate projections, and will produce computationally efficient ways to deal with large amounts of data from observations and numerical models. The particular combination of research and teaching carried out by the network will ensure that the knowledge generated by the group will immediately be transmitted to graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STATMOS Research Network home page:  http://www.nrcse.washington.edu/statmos/</AbstractNarration>

These community goals were in service to the four scientific objectives also achieved by the grant members. These objectives speak to the intellectual merit of the STATMOS members? accomplishments:  Environmental spatial processes: The network developed flexible models for prediction and estimation of environmental spatial processes observed over larger regions on the Earth's surface by introducing valid covariance models on the sphere and studying their properties. Spatial prediction: STATMOS members created general and flexible models for spatial prediction of multivariate environmental processes, introducing the concept of conditional correlation in spatial lattice models. Nonstationary, nonseparable spatial-temporal data: The network developed models for nonstationary, nonseparable spatial-temporal for both lattice and irregularly spaced data. Big Data&mdash;Methodology for large spatial prediction and estimation problems: STATMOS members developed methodology for large spatial prediction and estimation in the presence of massive data from observations, gridded satellite data with missing observations, and deterministic models.   STATMOs members increased our understanding of statistical methods for atmospheric and oceanic sciences, and they disseminated that information within and beyond their network to the public at large. A few specific examples&mdash;out of the hundreds of products created by the STATMOS network&mdash;are  ArgoVis: STATMOS members developed a software for Argo data visualization. This software allows the most extensive ocean data in history to be delivered to school classrooms for teaching and learning.  Hurricane forecasting: STATMOS grantees improved the forecast of hurricanes by fusing together different sources of spatial information. They submitted the seasonal hurricane forecast to the media on April 1, 2017. R Programming for Climate Data Analysis and Visualization: STATMOS members developed computing and plotting for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data applications. Mapping of physical environmental changes and analysis of changes in statistics of physical variables: STATMOS members worked on statistically mapping physical environmental changes into fisheries populations change.  New statistical models and algorithms for big data: STATMOS members published and implemented new statistical models and algorithms for big data to be able to calculate the likelihood function in the presence of large data with spatial correlations, allowing them to make inference with large datasets. Emulator: STATMOS grantees built an emulator as an alternative to the Regional Climate Models. Accumulation behavior of arsenic: STATMOS members improved the understanding of the accumulation behavior of arsenic applied homogeneously to a sand grain.
