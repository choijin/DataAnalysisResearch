<AbstractNarration>This award will support participants in a symposium at the annual meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology in January 2019. This symposium will bring together a diverse group of biologists that study the evolution of morphology and its function. In particular, the speakers will discuss the study of behaviors that require coordination of many structures (e.g., feeding and locomotion) and organisms that use the same structures across multiple behaviors. This multi-component coordination (referred to as integration) is common in organisms but, due to limitations in data acquisition and analytical tools, is typically not addressed.  This symposium will foster improved understanding of how integration influences the ecology and evolution of organisms by promoting discussion among speakers who are at the forefront of addressing hypotheses of integration, leveraging new tools in evolutionary statistics and biomechanical analysis. The speakers are diverse in terms of research topic, career stage, gender, ethnicity, and type of institution. Each speaker will publish an article in Integrative and Comparative Biology to provide a resource for future researchers interested in these ideas. This issue will also highlight complimentary presentations submitted by students and early career researchers. Open dialogue among participants, including a panel discussion, has been built into the program, and student social media representatives will convey ideas and questions to those who are unable to attend the symposium, including the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As increasing use of genomic tools informs scientists about genetic control of phenotype, understanding of patterns and processes driving evolution of complex phenotypes, such as those inherent in many biomechanical systems, lags behind. Functional morphologists and organismal biologists strive to understand how organisms persist and flourish in a given environment. However, the parts of an organism often interact in complex ways to affect function, survival, and evolution. For example, some structural elements can be redundant relative to function, organisms may use such elements differently across contexts, or organisms may use the same anatomical element to perform multiple functions. These interactions are typically considered constraints on the ability to adapt and evolve, but they may also facilitate evolution if they allow multiple parts to change simultaneously in a way that favors survival. These emergent properties of form-function relationships should be of considerable interest to comparative biologists, but the field has been constrained by the broad scope of these questions that require potentially complex methodologies. This symposium aims to reconcile and unify this integrative organismal perspective, provide inspiration for new methodological approaches, and generate new hypotheses that can stimulate future studies of structural and functional complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

This symposium funded participation by 20 researchers in the field of evolutionary morphology, including 10 invited symposium speakers, 7 complimentary speakers, and 3 student social media representatives. Speakers lead discussions on the role of complex relationships between structure and function in shaping the performance and evolution of organisms, utilizing insights from their research specialties. A subset of speakers also participated in a panel discussion on these topics with a wider SICB audience. Of the symposium and complimentary talks, 11 were chosen for publication as a special issue in the society?s journal <em>Integrative and Comparative Biology</em>, alongside an introductory article summarizing the outcomes and advances of the symposium. Additionally, social media representatives conveyed research ideas to a broader audience through outreach on Twitter. The significant intellectual advances of this work include new conceptual frameworks and methods for understanding and testing questions about interactions between structures and functions in organisms, examples of diverse ways in which these complex relationships affect whole organisms, and development of new hypotheses and recommendations for focusing areas of future work. Our symposium engaged an average of 49 audience members per talk. Additionally, the support provided from this award facilitated participation by researchers who had never attended a SICB conference previously, were at career stages ranging from graduate students to tenured professors, were associated with diverse institution types (including 4 minority serving institutions), and represented multiple axes of underrepresented identities.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/28/2020<br>      Modified by: Luz Patricia&nbsp;Hernandez</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
