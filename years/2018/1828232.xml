<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award supports the University of Alabama at Birmingham to acquire an atomic force microscope for interdisciplinary materials research and education. This microscope supports a diverse, multi-departmental research in soft materials ranging from soft synthetic hydrogels to relatively dense composites and biological structures. The instrument provides enhanced capabilities for quantitative nanoscale mapping of electrical, mechanical, biological, and chemical properties. It also plays a vital role in student education in the fields of chemistry, materials science, biomedical science and biomedical engineering. Educational opportunities are available not only for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows on the campus, but they expand via outreach to local middle and high school students. These multidisciplinary educational efforts are important to increase the recognition of the research efforts in the Departments of Chemistry, Medicine, and Biomedical Engineering in order to improve student recruiting, especially among underrepresented populations. A high caliber research environment is also vital to the regional economy in Central Alabama through raising community awareness toward biomedical and soft-materials technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;This atomic force microscope combines the capabilities for high-resolution and high-speed imaging with quantitative nano-electrical and nanomechanical mapping. The ability to acquire multifunctional, high-resolution data under a wide range of operating conditions allows for studies on a broad spectrum of dry and hydrated samples. The types of samples extend from synthetic networks, polymer composites, nanodevices, to cell membranes and tissues. The common theme among these samples is that they all involve soft materials, i.e., synthetic polymers, biological structures, or combinations of the two. An increased ability to characterize state-of-the-art nanomaterials results in an enhanced fundamental understanding of the structural properties of soft materials and the composition at their surfaces. This includes the effect of the surface morphology on the physical, biological, and chemical characteristics of the materials. The understanding enables transformative research for the development of new materials in tissue regenerative therapies, controlled drug delivery, molecular sensing, and related biotechnologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The developed collaborations will enrich the UAB community involved into those studies. The preliminary data obtained using the AFM purchased by funds from this grant supported three new research grant applications. The results generated by this project were disseminated through two peer-reviewed articles, and 8 presentations given at national and international scientific conferences.  Broader Impacts  The proposed research became a ground for the development of novel nano-layered materials which are used for basic research applications as well as cell-based transplantation materials.  The development of responsive hydrogels that was made possible through the instrumentation purchased through this grant advances understanding of the structure-property relationship of synthetic co-polymers, and, therefore, contributes to important areas of polymer chemistry and materials science.  Importantly, the understanding of the relationships between the mechanical properties and the internal structure of multilayer hydrogel systems should lead to novel types of 'intelligent' networks with programmable behavior.  In this way, such materials could contribute to the development of new sensing materials as well as of nanomedicines for smart delivery to impacted cells and tissues.  Understanding fundamental relationships between the capsules thickness and their physicochemical properties governing their biodistribution behavior will be transformative for the emerging fields of theranostic polymeric drug carriers. The AFM characterization of microsponge nanocomposites composed of porous polylactic acid microparticles with incorporated anatase titania nanoparticles was crucial in understanding photocatalytic behavior of these nontoxic photocatalytic materials for environmental cleanup of contaminated water. The synthetic methods developed through this work might offer simple, scalable, and environmentally friendly approaches which might be potentially applied in commercial manufacturing.  From the educational perspective, the project helped to develop a discovery-driven multidisciplinary biomaterials/polymer sciences program and enrich the existing polymer science B.S. and Ph.D. major programs at the UAB and promote diversity from the high school through graduate-level.  This instrument is vital in student education in the fields of chemistry, materials science, biomedical science, and biomedical engineering. Educational opportunities provided by this microscope are available for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows on the campus, and expand via outreach to local middle and high school students.  Both AFM machines have been included in educational curricula of polymer chemistry and polymer materials classes in which undergraduate students from UAB Chemistry, Materials Science and Engineering and Biomedical Engineering Departments are introduced to principles of materials characterization by AFM and have a lab demonstration and use of the NT-MDT Solver Nano and NTGRA AFM systems. The students learn the basics of AFM theory and operation and have opportunities for hands-on experience with the advanced technique for materials characterization. This experience provides students with an introduction to surface characterization techniques and methodologies familiar to both academic research and industry, which builds confidence in their ability to conduct independent research and development.
