<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation project will examine the evolutionary history of gelada monkeys (genus Theropithecus) based on skeletal and genetic data. Species of this group occur more broadly and in larger numbers than any other non-human primate in the fossil record of Africa. Fossils have been found in southern, eastern, and northern Africa, the Middle East, Spain, and even India, an unusual distribution for any primate group besides humans. The living representatives of this group, however, are only found in the highlands of Ethiopia. Because of their overlap with humans in the past, these monkeys have often been suggested as a model for understanding human evolution. Therefore, the in-depth analysis of gelada monkeys will not just provide better insight into the evolution of this group but will also advance the study of human evolution. This project will support graduate student training, and results from the project will be presented to the general public through the American Museum of Natural History Sackler Educational Laboratory's "Meet the Scientist" program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this project is to fully understand the evolutionary relationships, taxonomy and paleobiology of the primate genus Theropithecus. All available cranio-dental data for both living and extinct members of this group will be compiled. Morphometric data in the form of 3D landmarks and 2D measurements, as well as morphological data in the form of character states, will be collected. Genetic data will also be collected, thereby resulting in a large, integrated dataset for this primate group. This comprehensive dataset will then be used to: assess the morphological as well as genetic differences among the living populations of Theropithecus gelada; inform research on fossil populations; provide a comprehensive phylogenetic reconstruction of the genus Theropithecus; investigate the dietary trends seen in this genus and their relationship to cranio-dental morphological trends; and investigate the cause of the extreme facial morphology exhibited by some species of this genus and evaluate whether that is related to diet, sexual selection or some other factor. As part of this study a new and relatively unknown population of an extant endemic primate will be analyzed and provide new insights for conservation purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
