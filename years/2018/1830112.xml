<AbstractNarration>This project will fund early-career US participants to attend a conference on "Microlocal Analysis and Applications" to be held at Fudan University in Shanghai in June 2019.  This conference, the first ever in the field to take place in China, will focus on the theory and uses of microlocal analysis, a field of mathematics which studies how solutions to many equations arising in physics and geometry may be analyzed in phase space, where one keeps track of momentum as well as position.  The project will enhance training in this important field of mathematics and will facilitate international collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will fund junior US researchers, primarily postdocs and advanced graduate students, but possibly also tenure-track researchers from non-R1 institutions, to attend a meeting on the theory and applications of microlocal analysis at Fudan University in Shanghai in June 2019.  Microlocal analysis, which is analysis of partial differential equations by phase space methods, has roots in the development of pseudodifferential and Fourier integral operators in the 1960s, but has of late been experiencing a renaissance in the breadth of its applications across pure and applied mathematics.  The meeting will explore advances in fundamental techniques as well as recent applications in areas as diverse as inverse problems, general relativity, classical dynamics, and quantum chaos.  The grant will enhance US doctoral and postdoctoral training in microlocal analysis as well as encouraging international collaborations in this and related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://sites.math.northwestern.edu/fudan-microlocal/index.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The grant funded the travel of US-based junior researchers to the conference "Microlocal Analysis and its Applications" held at Fudan University in Shanghai, China, in June 2019.  The conference, which brought together researchers and students from all over the world, was the first ever conference in China devoted to this theme.  The main meeting spanned a week and included 21 speakers, and was preceded by a two day minicourse intended to provide an introduction to microlocal analysis and its applications for students and postdocsas well as more established researchers working in neighboring fields. Microlocal analysis is a collection of techniques devoted to understanding the differential equations arising in physics and geometry from the point of view of their relationship to the classical dynamics of particles. This relationship is sometimes viewed as being the mathematical underpinnings of the "correspondence principle" of quantum mechanics, which says that on a macroscropic scale, quantum effects should give way to more familiar Newtonian dynamics; however, it turns out to have a broad range of applicability, especially in the analysis of high frequency wave phenomena arising in a huge range of applications.  Among the areas of application discussed at the meeting were inverse problems (motivated, for instance, by medical imaging and geological prospecting); general relativity; quantum field theory; dynamical systems; and geometry. The grant funded the attendance of 12 students and postdocs frominstitutions around the US.       Last Modified: 07/13/2020       Submitted by: Jared Wunsch]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
