<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to revolutionize conventional rehabilitation assistant and body movement assessment tools with low-cost machine vision based solutions by maximizing the capability of ubiquitous tablets and 2D cameras, which have significant cost and accessibility advantage over more expensive 3D cameras. A set of tablet/smartphone Apps can be developed base on the embedded machine vision technology, and the team plan to create related services using a subscription model. This innovation will benefit broad healthcare market, which includes rehab facilities, surgery/neurology outpatient clinics, physical therapy clinics, stroke centers, and individuals. Overall, the innovation will make embedded machine vision technology accessible to and serve many population groups in the society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on preliminary results that we obtained on a PC platform to identify and track human body joint points in close to real-time. The prototype leverages novel machine learning algorithms and high performance processors (graphics processing units). Our next phase of research is to generate depth map from a 2D camera, recognize and track body joint points, and score body movements, all on a tablet platform. The challenges include depth generation with 2D images and efficient models and algorithms to execute on a resource constraint embedded platform. The team will leverage embedded deep learning techniques to optimize the algorithms towards an embedded processor architecture on modern tablets so that the proof-of-concept can deliver satisfactory performance. The team also plan to work with a medical doctor and a rehabilitation facility advisor to review and refine the software features and validate the early prototype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
