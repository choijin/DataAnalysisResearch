<AbstractNarration>Human adaptations in diet and metabolism are likely to be linked to other important human traits, like our large, metabolically demanding brains. This doctoral dissertation project will study astrocytes, a type of metabolically important brain cell, to determine their contribution to the unique metabolism of the human brain. This work will further our understanding of evolved metabolic and neurological differences among primates, while providing insight into an understudied, but critical cell type of the brain at the cellular and genetic levels. This project will support the research of a first-generation female college and graduate student, as well as the development of public and K-12 science communication efforts largely focused on demystifying the genome and understanding the societal implications of readily accessible genomic data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous research has consistently shown enrichment of metabolic function in genes differentially expressed between the brains of several primate species. This proposal will investigate the evolution of gene expression and function in astrocytes, to understand the extent to which this cell type contributes to the unique metabolism of the human brain. The investigators will use established, non-invasive cell culture methods to grow and develop astrocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells of both humans and chimpanzees. These astrocytes will be assayed for differences in gene expression and traits important for metabolic function, such as glucose uptake into the cell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The human brain utilizes ~ 20% of all of the body’s metabolic resources, while chimpanzee brains use less than 10%.

To investigate cell-type specific interspecies differences in brain gene expression, we conducted RNA-Seq on neural progenitor cells (NPCs), neurons, and astrocytes generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from humans and chimpanzees.

These findings suggest that astrocytes may have contributed significantly to the evolution of greater brain glucose metabolism with proximity to humans.  Evolved differences in metabolic investment may be the basis for a number of primate-specific traits or "phenotypes", including those that are unique to humans, such as slow reproduction and growth and correspondingly longer lifespan than other placental mammals. Adaptation can act on metabolic phenotypes through alterations to energy budget including reductions of or increases in total energy budget or differential allocation of energy within energy budget.  Our results demonstrate that altered gene expression between species’ astrocytes - an under-studied, but critical brain cell type with known metabolic relevance, provide insight into the metabolic changes that were necessary to support evolution of the human brain.  This project supported the final chapeter of a first-generation college student in her Ph.D. at UMass Amherst and would not have been possible without NSF funding.
