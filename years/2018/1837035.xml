<AbstractNarration>This award to the University of Southern California will provide partial support for the International, Mind, Brain, and Education Society (IMBES) conference to be held in Los Angeles in September 2018. It is a unique opportunity for a broad range of researchers and educators with interest in educational neuroscience to engage with other communities, affording researchers the opportunity to learn nuances of translating their work for other researchers and practitioners, and for educational practitioners to advance their understandings of cutting edge research at the intersection of brain and behavior. The award will particularly support sessions that aim to foster the careers of students and young career scientists and help allay the costs of their participation. The proposal is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports fundamental research that advances the research literature on STEM learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The foci of the conference will be: (1) neuroscientific advances in understanding variability in brain development; (2) neural, cognitive and educational ramifications of cultural experiences and socio-economic status; and (3) strengths and liabilities of digital media use for brain and cognitive development, with a special emphasis on math and other kinds of STEM learning disabilities. especially for STEM learning. The conference will together practitioners, administrators, policy-makers, and researchers from a range of different disciplines and backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
