<AbstractNarration>This award supports US participants to attend the workshop "Arithmetic Topology" at the Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences (PIMS) from June 10-14, 2019 in Vancouver.  Recent years have seen spectacular advances at the intersection of number theory, specifically problems asking how many solutions an equations has, and topology which studies mathematical properties of shapes and spaces. While mathematicians have understood for several decades that individual equations have an associated space whose properties reflect the equation, many natural equations (and many natural spaces) come in infinite sequences.  The last decade has seen spectacular advances (leading in part to Venkatesh's 2018 Fields Medal, highest honor in mathematics) in our understanding of how the asymptotic behavior in natural sequences of equations ("arithmetic statistics") governs and is governed by the asymptotic behavior in natural sequences of spaces ("homological stability"). This workshop aims to bring together a diverse group of leading and emerging researchers working in number theory, algebraic geometry and topology to obtain a global view of a fast emerging and multidisciplinary area, to train participants in the range of methods available, and to generate a robust problem list that can guide activity in the area for the next 5-10 years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last 10 years have brought a burst of activity at the intersection of algebraic topology, number theory and algebraic geometry. This has led to a wealth of:&lt;br/&gt;1) new theorems, such as Ellenberg-Venkatesh-Westerland's proof of the&lt;br/&gt;Cohen-Lenstra heuristics for function fields; &lt;br/&gt;2) new sources of heuristics in topology, such as Vakil-Wood's predictions from the Grothendieck ring, or the notion and coincidences of homological densities as in Farb-Wolfson-Wood; &lt;br/&gt;3) refinements of classical enumerative theorems using modern topological tools, such as Kass-Wickelgren's arithmetic count of the 27 lines on a cubic surface; and&lt;br/&gt;4) a renewed focus on unstable homology, as in Galatius-Kupers-Randal-Williams and Miller-Wilson. &lt;br/&gt;The organizers of the workshop believe that these results are just the beginning of the emerging area of arithmetic topology. They are organizing a 5 day workshop to bring together a diverse group of junior and senior researchers from across these areas with the goal of: &lt;br/&gt;1) giving participants a global view of a fast emerging and multidisciplinary area,&lt;br/&gt;2) giving participants a detailed awareness on the range of methods available, and&lt;br/&gt;3) emerging with a robust problem list which can help guide activity in the area for the next 5-10 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information is available at the conference website:&lt;br/&gt;https://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-event/190610-pwat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In June 2019, we hosted a 5 day workshop at the Pacific Institute for Mathematical Sciences (PIMS), in Vancouver, Canada, on "Arithmetic Topology", a fast emerging discipline at the intersection of topology, number theory and algebraic geometry.  The goals of the workshop were to bring together leading and emerging researchers from across these areas to 1) give participants a global view of a fast emerging and multidisciplinary area, 2) give participants a detailed awareness on the range of methods available, and 3) emerge with a robust problem list which can help guide activity in the area for the next 5-10 years. An implicit goal was to help coalesce a research community to drive progress in this area.  The conference was well attended, with over 100 participants hearing from 14 leading experts drawn from North America and Europe, as well as 19 junior speakers from North American, South America and Europe. The grant supported the attendance of approximately 45 US participants, predominantly graduate students and postdocs, to gain expertise and form professional connections with colleagues in the area.  Given our goal to help coalesce a research community, the conference organizers paid particular attention to including women and members of under-represented groups in the conference both as speakers and as participants.  For example, while we still have fell short of gender parity (6 of 14 invited speakers were women and about 1 in 3 participants), we far exceeded average numbers in our field (typically about 1 in 5) and many participants and speakers commented on how much the better gender balance contributed to the energy and research productivity of the workshop.   The conference succeeded in generating a rich problem list, and the organizers are now editing a special issue ("Arithmetic Topology - PIMS 2019") of the journal Research in the Mathematical Sciences.  Four articles featuring research presented at or inspired by the workshop have already appeared, and we expect to publish 5-10 more, in addition to an edited version of the problem list.  Videos/slides of the talks are available on the conference website at  https://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-event/190610-pwat          Last Modified: 08/04/2020       Submitted by: Jesse Wolfson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
