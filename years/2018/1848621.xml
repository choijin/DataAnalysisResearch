<AbstractNarration>This award funds work to expand a telescope network that was developed with a pilot project, and carry out observing campaigns to measure size and shapes of ten Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) in the outer solar system, and search for moons around them. TNOs are relatively small (diameters range from larger than Pluto to smaller than 100km) frozen bodies that orbit the Sun beyond Neptune's average distance, and formed at the same time as the rest of our solar system. The investigators plan to determine the TNO sizes by observing them as they pass in front of, and temporarily block, distant starlight.  They will do this by using 40 telescopes spread out throughout the western United States with the help of 40 different communities of citizen scientists, whom they will teach and train in research methods with workshops and other education efforts.  The data will be used to test models of solar system formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The occultation diameters will also be used to provide cross-calibration of thermal radiometry-based diameters, extend the occultation sample down to 100 km objects, and improve knowledge of albedo distributions. The team will also constrain the binary fraction to a small smaller physical and angular separation than is currently possible with other surveys, and search for low-separation multiple component (moons) systems.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Research and Education Collaborative Occultation Network (RECON) is an investigation to measure the sizes and characteristics of 100 km trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) through coordinated occultation observations involving a network of small telescopes located across the western United States (Buie and Keller, 2016; www.tnoRECON.net). Resulting measurements of sizes, albedos, and densities of small TNOs as well as potential close binary and ring systems enhance our understanding of Solar System formation and evolution. Because the RECON network involves K-16 teachers, students, and amateur astronomers from over 50 communities, this project is also a significant citizen science astronomy research effort with a unique footprint in rural regions of Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, and Arizona (see Figure 1).&nbsp; The RECON project has been supported from 2012 to 2020 through the NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Research Grant program (Awards 1413287, 1848621, 1413072, and 1212159).</p> <p dir="ltr"><span>To support the RECON prediction system, astrometry data was also collected by the project from five observatories: KPNO Mayall 4-m Telescope, Canada France Hawaii Telescope, Lowell Discovery Telescope, Apache Point Observatory 3.5-m Telescope, and Pan-STARRS.&nbsp; In just the last two years of the project, observations of more than 660 objects were obtained and processed with over 47,000 observations submitted to the Minor Planet Center.&nbsp; These data have been important for improving the orbit estimates of these objects and thus decreasing the uncertainty of predicted events while also generally contributing to the field of study involving small bodies in the outer Solar System.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The RECON project has outfitted and trained K-12 students, undergraduates, and community members (totalling over 250 individuals) to collect occultation data using portable telescopes who now routinely participate directly in authentic, NSF-funded research (see Figures 2 &amp; 3).&nbsp; Through training workshops, annual team meetings, and regular network interactions, the project has strengthened collaboration amongst educators and community members both within and between communities.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Research and Education Collaborative Occultation Network (RECON) is an investigation to measure the sizes and characteristics of 100 km trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) through coordinated occultation observations involving a network of small telescopes located across the western United States (Buie and Keller, 2016; www.tnoRECON.net). Resulting measurements of sizes, albedos, and densities of small TNOs as well as potential close binary and ring systems enhance our understanding of Solar System formation and evolution. Because the RECON network involves K-16 teachers, students, and amateur astronomers from over 50 communities, this project is also a significant citizen science astronomy research effort with a unique footprint in rural regions of Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, and Arizona (see Figure 1).  The RECON project has been supported from 2012 to 2020 through the NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Research Grant program (Awards 1413287, 1848621, 1413072, and 1212159). To support the RECON prediction system, astrometry data was also collected by the project from five observatories: KPNO Mayall 4-m Telescope, Canada France Hawaii Telescope, Lowell Discovery Telescope, Apache Point Observatory 3.5-m Telescope, and Pan-STARRS.  In just the last two years of the project, observations of more than 660 objects were obtained and processed with over 47,000 observations submitted to the Minor Planet Center.  These data have been important for improving the orbit estimates of these objects and thus decreasing the uncertainty of predicted events while also generally contributing to the field of study involving small bodies in the outer Solar System. The RECON project has outfitted and trained K-12 students, undergraduates, and community members (totalling over 250 individuals) to collect occultation data using portable telescopes who now routinely participate directly in authentic, NSF-funded research (see Figures 2 &amp; 3).  Through training workshops, annual team meetings, and regular network interactions, the project has strengthened collaboration amongst educators and community members both within and between communities. In many communities, RECON has provided opportunities for amateur astronomers to play larger roles in K-12 education. The project is bringing resources and educational opportunities to rural, underserved communities and furthering awareness toward ways that the general public can contribute to scientific research endeavors (Trouille et al, 2019).  Inspired by the project design, Canadian collaborators obtained their own funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [RGPIN/5499-2016] to create a network of six telescopes called CanCON that extends RECON roughly 300 km north into British Columbia.   The project produced nine peer-reviewed papers, two of which describe RECON and its educational outcomes.  The rest of the papers present results of stellar occultation observations of eight objects.  Most of these events were exclusively measured by RECON.  For some of the events, RECON provided an important subset of the combined observations.  All of our results provide fundamentally improved size measurements with corresponding improvements in surface albedo estimates (see Figure 4).  Among our results we also have size measurements of two binary systems, one of which was discovered by RECON (Figure 5).  Objects in our sample cover the full range of dynamical classifications in the outer solar system and also include one Jupiter Trojan asteroid (see Figure 6).  This project has convincingly demonstrated our ability to provide important constraints on binary objects, showing there are closely spaced binaries at a finer spatial resolution than even the Hubble Space Telescope or the best adaptive-optics systems can detect.
