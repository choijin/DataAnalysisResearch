<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will result in higher performing polymeric photonic materials (plastics which interact with light) which will have extensive application in consumer devices such as computers, cell phones, lighting units, telecommunications, cameras, and sensors.  Polymeric photonic materials are finding evermore application in devices due to their low weight, high-impact resistance, and ability to be fabricated into unique shapes/architectures, however, have paltry optical performance when compared to their heavier, costlier glass counterparts.  The material developed here combines the existing positive attributes of polymeric optical materials while offering significantly higher performance without large increases in price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will develop high optical quality crosslinked polymer networks with the unique ability to be remolded, reshaped, and repurposed when placed under the correct conditions without loss of mechanical integrity or optical properties.  Polymeric optical components (lenses, waveguides, etc.) are desirable over fragile and heavy glass counterparts, however, defects and birefringence (stresses which negatively interact with light) prevent polymers from being used for applications requiring high optical quality materials.  This proprietary technology allows for microscopic scrambling of chemical bonds to occur in the polymeric materials only when it is placed under certain conditions, effectively annealing out the aforementioned defects and birefringence in the polymer, giving high optical quality materials.  Current research is focused on taking this dynamic platform and placing it into commercially relevant resins that fabricate tough, robust, optically clear, high performance materials.</AbstractNarration>
