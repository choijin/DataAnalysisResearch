<AbstractNarration>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER project aims to conduct a study designed to operationalize a culturally responsive computing framework, from theory to empirical application, by exploring what factors can be identified and later used to develop items for an instrument to assess youths' self-efficacy and self-perceptions in computing and technology-related fields and careers. The project explores the constructs of culturally responsive computing across youths of diverse gender and racial identities (i.e., White, African American, Latino, Native American, Alaskan Native boys and girls) using a culturally responsive, participatory action research approach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project explores and develops the factor structure of an instrument on culturally responsive computing with diverse middle and high schoolers of intersecting identities. It uses culturally responsive methodologies to co-create an instrument for later validation that will assess youths' self-efficacy and self-perceptions in technology. The project will explore Culturally Response Computing constructs across variables by conducting observations, focus groups and interviews, and collect context data and information from teachers and students that will contribute to a series of case examples. The work involves a two-phase mixed-methods research study focused on assembling evidence to assess, design and validate a Culturally Responsive Computing Framework from theory to empirical application. A total of 50 students and teachers from four geographically diverse rural and urban areas and racial ethnic backgrounds will participate in co-creating constructs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project developed a survey instrument to help evaluate the theories of culturally responsive computing, especially from the perspectives of students. No such instrument previously existed.     To construct this instrument, the project first interviewed students about their experiences with math and technology education and how that education translated to their broader experiences and interests at home and in their local communities. The project focused on students aged 12-14 in communities from Saipan, Compton, Alaska, and Hawai‘i--communities often excluded and under-anticipated in STEM. Doing so enabled the project to explore the constructs of culturally responsive computing across youths of diverse gender and racial identities (i.e., Hawai‘ian and Pacific Islander, Alaskan Native, African American, Latinx, Native American, White, boys, and girls) using a culturally responsive, participatory action research approach. We also interviewed the students’ STEM teachers for additional context. Results generated new knowledge about the perspectives of students from under-anticipated communities and how technological education can respond to their from diverse cultural backgrounds.     After thematically coding these interviews, the project next used factor analysis to develop and conduct preliminary validation of an instrument on students’ perceptions of culturally responsive computing. This instrument was found to be appropriate and applicable to the samples examined given that the items were drawn from descriptions generated by the students themselves.
