<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will enable technologies on the cutting-edge like Spin Torque Transfer-Random Access Memory (STT-RAM) and high efficiency solar cells to permeate the marketplace. Currently, semiconductor applications like these technologies face significant nanomanufacturing challenges. In fact, fabricating semiconductor devices is so challenging that 55% of new semiconductor products fail to meet their original launch date and over 40% of development projects exceed the planned budgets. With its proposed virtual recipe development environment, this SBIR project will allow semiconductor chip and equipment manufacturers to save up to 66% of process development costs, gain market share through three times faster development cycles, and enable the process development of next-generation of high performance, energy efficient electronic devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will use statistical self-learning inference algorithms, sophisticated process models, and the vast amount of available fab data to make high accuracy process predictions and enable high volume manufacturing of innovative nanotechnologies. Three key components will be developed: (1) A recipe analytics engine capable of performing process predictions and process design for multiple process objectives, (2) A topography simulator for profile prediction of nanofeatures, and (3) A commercial platform interface for real-time process development decision making. The components will be devised to accurately capture large process systems and multiple process objectives, reduce computational expense, and facilitate commercial adoption. These innovations will be accomplished by: (a) Using parallel computing to reduce computational expense, (b) Developing reduced-order plasma and surface kinetic models, (c) Employing adaptive algorithms to accelerate recipe optimization, and (d) Using uncertainty analysis techniques for recipe co-optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Creating these recipes is a significant barrier to the deployment of novel microelectronic devices and imposes a huge economic burden on semiconductor manufacturers who must make significant R&amp;D investments to stay competitive.  With support from the National Science Foundation, SandBox Semiconductor has developed the software tools SandBox Oculus and SandBox Analytics that enable process engineers to identify optimal etch and deposition recipes with one-third the experiments of present methods making it three times faster and three times less expensive than the current industry standard. With SandBox Oculus and SandBox Analytics process engineers can:  Efficiently organize and analyze experimental data across multi-dimensional process spaces Perform model-driven experimental design to rapidly determine the optimal etch recipe Identify regions with optimal process parameters to achieve a desired etch Predict the etch profiles for different process conditions.   SandBox Oculus and SandBox Analytics allow process engineers to collaborate and analyze their data more effectively and increase the speed of development of complex fabrication recipes. Both SandBox Oculus and SandBox Analytics have been successfully demonstrated on multistep and multi-material stack etching.  They have been commercialized and are being used by SandBox Semiconductor customers in several states.
