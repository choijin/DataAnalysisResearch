<AbstractNarration>A one-and-half-day  workshop will be held at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, on November 30 - December 1, 2018. This workshop will bring together some of the most prominent researchers in the field of statistics from around the world. The main goals are to facilitate the exchange of recent research developments, to provide opportunities for new researchers and underrepresented groups, and to establish new collaborations that will channel efforts into pending problems and open new directions for future investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will cover topics of fundamental statistical theory having broad applicability. It will also emphasize areas of statistical research offering innovative approaches to problems arising in various branches of the sciences including bioinformatics, image analysis, signal processing and genomics. In addition to the core invited talks, the workshop will feature discussion sessions. Slides of all the talks will be posted on the conference web site https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/research/seminars-conferences/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      The field of statistics continues to offer profound contributions to many branches of science, medicine, and industry. In the rapidly-evolving information age, we have access to overwhelming quantities of data for the study of complex phenomena.
