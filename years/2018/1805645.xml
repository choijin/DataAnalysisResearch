<AbstractNarration>This award supports research on children and families affected by Hurricane Irma, which hit the Southeastern United States in September 2017. This research project will study how natural disasters affect brain, thinking, and mood. Natural disasters are disruptive and affect millions of people worldwide each year, including children. Disaster experiences are associated with youth feeling vulnerable and experiencing problems at school, at home, and with peers, as well as problems with mental health and substance use. This research also examines how pre-disaster brain functioning and thinking may protect against some of the effects of disaster-related stress on youth. The funded work will likely inform local, state, and national responses to disasters, identify youth at greatest risk after a disaster, reveal patterns of resilience, and strengthen our understanding of typical child development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the year before Hurricane Irma's landfall, a large sample of children in Florida and South Carolina--who were later affected by the hurricane--began participating in a large, multisite longitudinal investigation of brain and cognitive development, the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Also studied was a large sample of control children in California, who were not affected by the hurricane. The current study will take advantage of data collected prior to the hurricane in the ABCD study, which used a battery of neuropsychological, interview, genetic, and structural and functional neuroimaging tests. Because disasters are rarely predictable, most prior studies of the effects of disaster exposure do not have access to important information about research participants' pre-disaster statuses or levels of functioning; the prospective design of the current research will avoid this problem. In addition, this research will enable data to be collected very soon after the hurricane, while the experiences of the hurricane and its aftermath are fresh. As a result, the researchers will be able to compare pre- and post-hurricane brain functioning, mood, and thinking, to test hypotheses about the effects of disaster-related stress on several developmental processes. Key predictions are that in addition to causing elevated posttraumatic stress symptoms in both cognitive and affective domains, increased hurricane-associated stress will have caused loss of volume, reduced cortical thickness, and impaired neural transmission in specific brain areas (for example, in the hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and other areas). Neural measurements will be taken using T1- and T2-weighted MRI scans and diffusion-weighted MRI scans. By studying children's Irma-related experiences, traumatic exposure, and evacuation-related stress, this study will afford a unique opportunity to longitudinally examine the effects of disaster exposure and disaster-related stress on youth development. This study will help the general public better understand the effects of disasters on children and identify youth at greatest risk in the aftermath of disasters.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Across the past decade, natural disasters have killed over 700,00 persons and left over two billion others injured, homeless, or in need of emergency assistance for survival. In particular, weather-related disasters, and their associated human and economic tolls, are on the rise. Such disasters carry a very broad, heavy, and sustained mental health toll, with robust post-disaster evidence documenting elevated posttraumatic stress (PTS) responses among large subsets of individuals. Children are among the most vulnerable, as they are still developing a stable sense of their security and they have relatively limited control over their environments. Thus, traumatic experiences during disasters are associated with (a) considerable life disruption and reduced quality of life; (b) impaired functioning in family, academic, and peer domains; (c) negative alterations in cognition and mood; (d) hyperarousal (including exaggerated startle reflex, and sleep difficulties); and (e) elevated rates of psychopathology and substance misuse. Therefore, it is important to understand the specific factors that affect youth during and following disasters so that we can inform local and national responses, identify youth at greatest risk in the aftermath of disaster, and elucidate patterns of resilience.</p> <p>Notably, the mental health burdens of disasters are not confined to proximally exposed youth. Individuals near and far show elevated PTS responses in the aftermath of disasters, with increasing evidence pointing to the important role disaster-related media exposure may play in explaining PTS symptoms in distal individuals. That said, research on this front has predominantly focused on manmade disasters with malicious intent, such as terrorism and mass shootings. Related work has not considered youth media effects in the context of increasingly common weather-related disasters, which are typically preceded by an extensive warning period and extensive pre-event threat-related media attention. Related research in adult samples has predominantly focused on regionally affected individuals, and may not speak to media effects in youth, given cognitive developmental differences in risk assessment, threat perception, and media literacy. Research has also failed to consider potential prospective neural vulnerabilities that may help predict which youth are most susceptible to PTS responses related to anticipatory disaster-related media exposure.</p> <p>To overcome current limitations, in a multi-state sample of youth, we examined interactions between prospective neural vulnerability and reports of pre-disaster anticipatory media exposure in the context of Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record. In the week prior to Irma making landfall, nationally televised and Internet-based media coverage provided sensationalized, around-the-clock forecasting of the impending catastrophic storm and its threatened unprecedented destruction of epic proportions to the Southeastern United States, culminating in the largest human evacuation in American history (~7 million people).</p> <p>In this project, we present results of analyses on 478 well-characterized children from four sites of the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study across Irma-impacted and non-impacted states (Table 1). The four participating study sites included three in Irma-impacted states (i.e., Florida International University (FIU) in Miami, Florida; University of Florida (UF) in Gainesville, Florida; Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston, South Carolina)&nbsp; and one in a distal non-impacted state (i.e., University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in San Diego, California; see Table 1). In the year prior to Hurricane Irma, these four sites collected demographic, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures during the standard ABCD Baseline Visit, and 6-8 months after the storm these four ABCD sites collected a post-Irma supplementary follow-up survey that assessed children's objective hurricane exposure and Irma-related media exposure, as well as their PTS responses.</p> <p>We report a number of interesting results that inform the complex and dynamic interactions that unfold across time in the aftermath of disasters. First, we found that objective and media-based exposure to the hurricane both predicted later PTS symptoms (Figures 1 and 2). Importantly, though, proximity to the hurricane was not necessary to elicit the media-related effects--even children in San Diego, 4000 kilometers away from the hurricane, showed media-related PTS responses following the storm. Second, we were able to detect a neural vulnerability to these media effects by examining children's biases to responding to fearful faces in a functional neuroimaging task. The neural response in brain regions associated with anxiety and traumatic stress (Figure 3) differentially predicted the influence of storm-related media exposure on children's PTS outcomes (Figure 4). Thus, some children seemed to have a particular predisposition to being negatively influenced by anticipatory media surrounding the disaster.</p> <p>Overall, understanding media-related and neural factors associated with PTS outcomes following natural disasters is critical for developing appropriate public response, especially for youth. Identifying which forms of exposure to natural disasters are linked with worse youth mental health, and elucidating factors that promote trajectories of risk versus resilience can inform first responders and local, state, and federal agencies as they prepare for and respond to future large-scale disasters.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/01/2020<br>      Modified by: Anthony&nbsp;S&nbsp;Dick</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1805645/1805645_10527196_1585622776075_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1805645/1805645_10527196_1585622776075_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1805645/1805645_10527196_1585622776075_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1</div> <div class="imageCredit">Anthony Dick</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Anthony&nbsp;S&nbsp;Dick</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1805645/1805645_10527196_1585622817525_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1805645/1805645_10527196_1585622817525_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1805645/1805645_10527196_1585622817525_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 2</div> <div class="imageCredit">Anthony Dick</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Anthony&nbsp;S&nbsp;Dick</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1805645/1805645_10527196_1585622910638_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1805645/1805645_10527196_1585622910638_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1805645/1805645_10527196_1585622910638_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 4</div> <div class="imageCredit">Anthony Dick</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Anthony&nbsp;S&nbsp;Dick</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 4</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1805645/1805645_10527196_1585622741230_Table1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1805645/1805645_10527196_1585622741230_Table1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Table 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1805645/1805645_10527196_1585622741230_Table1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Table 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Breakdown of parents and children who completed the post-hurricane surveys at each site.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Anthony Dick</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Anthony&nbsp;S&nbsp;Dick</div> <div class="imageTitle">Table 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1805645/1805645_10527196_1585622854748_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1805645/1805645_10527196_1585622854748_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1805645/1805645_10527196_1585622854748_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 3</div> <div class="imageCredit">Anthony Dick</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Anthony&nbsp;S&nbsp;Dick</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
