<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2018,&lt;br/&gt;Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Understanding the environmental factors that allow species to survive in various environments is an important goal of ecologists. Knowledge gained from such work can be used to explain patterns of biodiversity, predict how species will respond to changing environments, and enable society to make informed decisions about conservation and management. Temperature is a prevalent factor that determines aspects of life for ectotherms, i.e., animals that cannot produce their own body heat. For example, an insect living underneath a leaf in a shady tree may experience temperatures that are much cooler compared to the surrounding air. How does this "micro-scale" temperature change from leaf to leaf? How does it affect the growth and survival of the insect? How does it affect the interactions between the insect and others? These questions will be answered using leaf miners, small moths that live inside aspen leaves, and their wasp predators. Answering these questions requires a large team effort, making such a project ideal for teaching scientific methods to students. The Fellow will use this opportunity to teach undergraduates from underrepresented communities, especially Native American students, how to conduct a scientific experiment, collect data, and interpret and share results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand the thermal environment of leaf miners, the Fellow and her team will first collect temperature data using thermocouples from several hundred leaves located in various parts of aspen trees. Then, to record which temperatures are optimal for miners, the Fellow and her team will construct thermal performance curves using growth rate. Finally, the team will investigate how interactions between wasps and miners are altered by experimentally manipulating temperature in an experimental arena. The experiments are designed to test multiple hypotheses about how leaf temperature affects leaf miners and how it might alter predator-prey interactions. The Fellow will also teach Native middle school children how to use basic biological monitoring techniques with insects to assess the health of streams around the Flathead Indian Reservation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Insect communities are declining rapidly around the world. One known culprit for this decline is rising temperature due to climate change. In this research program, I wished to understand how insect communities are responding to heat stress by examining the thermal tolerance traits of a specific pair of interacting insects, leaf mining moths and their wasp parasitoids. We learned that moths and wasps interact at two stages of their life-cycles 1) during pupal development and 2) when adult wasps lay eggs on larval leaf miners. My team and I therefore focused on these stages and examined how temperature affects the pupa-to-adult development rates of moths and wasps as they develop together, and whether adult wasps and larval miners differ in their tolerance. Together, these data provided us with information for how the interaction will change under global warming. Our research revealed some interesting insights. We found that during development, leaf miners prefer cooler temperatures, whereas wasps can withstand higher temperatures. However, <em>after</em> development, leaf miners appear to be more resilient to heat stress than adult wasps. Further, despite being reared at high temperatures, adult wasps appear to prefer approximately 20 degrees C. These results suggest that assessments of thermal tolerance and response to climate change depend on many factors. First, they depend on which life-stage is being measured. Second, they require that our knowledge of natural history is strong and we know how and with whom specific species interact. And finally, they require understanding how an interaction changes with temperature (e.g. development rate experiment mentioned above). These tasks are challenging, but nevertheless important. Our work provides a foundation on which to study the interactions of moths and parasitoids in more detail and expand to other interacting pairs of insects in the future.&nbsp;</p> <p>An equally vital goal of this fellowship was to encourage Native American middle and high school students to experience, enjoy, and ultimately become comfortable with STEM subjects. To this end, I created a program to teach students from the Flathead Indian Reservation about how insects, especially aquatic species, can be used to monitor the health of ecosystems. Students from several Native communities attended, including, the Blackfeet, Salish and Kootenai, Crow, and Navajo nations. Students spent a week at the University of Montana learning how to identify aquatic insects, understanding the connections among insects, fish, birds, bears and even trees, designing and building their own experimental traps to monitor insect biomass, and testing scientific hypotheses. Several of these methods are used by wildlife managers, so students were taught practical skills. Our project was a success as students gained new and important insight into biology, conservation, and management. Although the fellowship has now come to an end, the summer camp will continue for the next few years and will be almost entirely run by teachers from the various reservations. An uplifting outcome of this effort is that students from new tribes will be joining the camp in the following years.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/30/2021<br>      Modified by: Alisha&nbsp;A&nbsp;Shah</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
