<AbstractNarration>Teaching methods that actively engage students are more effective for learning about science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) than traditional teaching methods such as lecturing. One specific active learning method that has been broadly implemented in STEM fields at both the high school and college levels is Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL). Professional development experiences that enable STEM teachers to interact with others who use similar active learning methods help them become even more effective in their classrooms. One objective of the POGIL Project's strategic plan is to increase the diversity of the POGIL faculty community and the students it serves. This includes supporting the participation of faculty members of diverse backgrounds and from a full range of high schools, colleges, and universities across the United States. The second National Conference for Advanced POGIL Practitioners will bring teachers who use POGIL together to network, discuss common concerns, and share accomplishments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE: EHR) project will provide support for about 30 faculty members and a plenary speaker from targeted groups to attend the second National Conference for Advanced POGIL Practitioners (NCAPP). The targeted college and university faculty members to be supported are from groups underrepresented in STEM fields, two-year colleges, minority-serving institutions, or other institutions with limited financial resources for faculty professional development. The award also provides support for facilitating a conference workshop on "Inclusive Excellence in the POGIL Classroom", which is expected to promote increased awareness and understanding of diversity and equity issues in the classroom, as well as the use of thoughtful and inclusive classroom practices by conference attendees. Overall, the second NCAPP will provide a forum for faculty members to share expertise and accomplishments; work with others to design new POGIL activities and strategies for implementation; and discuss challenges related to using POGIL in their STEM classrooms. The impact of the conference on participants' teaching practices, as well as opportunities for new professional interactions and contacts, will be evaluated via surveys and interviews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

This was the second biennial NCAPP, a three-day conference focused on professional development for experienced POGIL practitioners seeking new ways to increase student learning and designed to address three broad goals: &#9679;      Promote change in classroom practice &#9679;      Increase the diversity of the community of POGIL practitioners &#9679;      Promote new connections that last beyond the conference  The project provided financial support for conference costs, housing, meals and/or travel for 25 post-secondary instructors who had one at least one of the following characteristics: &#9679;      from groups underrepresented in STEM fields; or &#9679;      from minority-serving institutions; or &#9679;      from two-year colleges or other institutions with limited financial resources for faculty professional development.  The project also provided financial support for a workshop on Inclusive Excellence and two plenary presentations:  Inclusive Science: What Institutions and Individual Faculty Do to Center Student Identity in Science, presented by Prof. Sylvia Hurtado (UCLA). Scaffolding Case Studies, Role-play, and Deliberative Dialogue for Authentic Assessment, presented by Prof. Katayoun Chamany (The New School).      In pre- and post- surveys completed immediately prior to and at the conclusion of the conference, participants reported increased sense of belonging to The POGIL Project, increased self-efficacy to implement POGIL, and increased self-efficacy for promoting inclusivity in their classrooms. They also reported increases in self-efficacy for developing POGIL activities and consistently high levels of interest and likelihood of attending another POGIL professional development event in the next two years.  In a "delayed" survey distributed in January, 2020 (about seven months following the end of the conference), most of the increases observed in the post-survey had been lost as scores for almost all topics returned to their pre-survey averages. Of the 25 participants supported by this project, 10 are currently registered to attend the 2021 NCAPP to be held as a virtual meeting in June, 2021.  The Broader Impacts of this project are found in the classrooms and students of the project participants. To the extent that those classrooms are more inclusive and provide more effective implementation of POGIL and other student-centered and evidence-based practices, all future students will have more successful and productive learning experiences in STEM classes.
