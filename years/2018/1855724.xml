<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the "Third Midwestern Microlocal Meeting: Microlocal Analysis, Inverse Problems and Resonances" held at Purdue University from March 22 to 24, 2019. The involvement of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in any scientific meeting is extremely important; this is one way scientific knowledge gets transmitted from one generation to the next. The award gives early-career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without other sources of support a chance to attend lectures and interact with the invited speakers and with each other. This will expose junior mathematicians to an exciting and dynamical mathematical environment and will motivate and encourage them to continue working on mathematical research. The topics of the conference are closely related to questions that are of interest in physics, such as mathematical resonances, scattering, the long-time behavior of waves, and inverse problems. Participants will be exposed to these possible applications, potentially leading to future developments in medical imaging, geophysics, and other interdisciplinary subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics discussed in the meeting belong to the field of mathematical analysis, and include scattering theory, inverse scattering, resolvent estimates, resonances, inverse problems, and generalized Radon and X-ray transforms.  The conference will help disseminate recent results and contribute to future developments in these fields. More information can be found at http://www.math.purdue.edu/~kdatchev/Plamen/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of an inverse problem is to determine causes of an observed phenomenon. These problems can often be translated into a mathematical problem which is to determine unknown coefficients of differential equations from partial information about their solutions.  An example of an inverse problem is whether one can determine the speed of a wave that propagates underground by making measurements on the surface of the earth. The answer to such a question has applications to location of oil and mineral deposits in the earth's substructure.  Another example is whether one can determine the electrical conductivity of an object by applying a  voltage to its surface and measuring the electrical current it produces on its surface. For example, it is known that diseased human tissue has very different electrical conductivity than a healthy one, and such methods can be used in the detection of tumors by applying a voltage and measuring the current it produces on the surface of the body (non-ivasive procedure).   Inverse problems often lead to very interesting questions in the intersection of  several areas of mathematics.  The conference concentrated on the fundamental mathematical problems arising in inverse problems and their relations with analysis, geometry, scattering theory, boundary value problems, hybrid methods in medical imaging, microlocal methods and resonances.   There were 16 speakers, leaders of the field,  from  Finland, India, the United Kingdom, and the United States.  Among the speakers there were three women.  The involvement of  graduate students and post-docs in any scientific meeting is extremely important; this is one way scientific knowledge gets transmitted from one generation to the next.   Twenty-four  24 graduate students and four recent Ph.Ds attended the conference. Among them there were five women, three Latinos and one African American.  These junior mathematicians had the opportunity to be part of a dynamical mathematical environment and were exposed to research that is currently being done. This  hopefully will give them mathematical problems to work on in the future, motivate and encourage them to continue working on mathematical  research.
