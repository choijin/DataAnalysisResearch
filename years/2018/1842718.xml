<AbstractNarration>Sensitive, selective, rapid, cost-effective detection of chemicals and biological molecules is critical in many sectors of society.  The goal of this project is to develop a novel biosensor consisting of optoelectronic transducer (a device that converts light to an electronic signal) composed of two layers of nanomaterials graphene and molybdenum disulfide coupled with biological sensing molecules. When molecular targets are present in liquid samples, the biological molecules will sense them and the transducer will provide a readout signaled by a change the optoelectronic properties of the device. The proposed device will find a broad spectrum of applications critical for society, such as diagnosing diseases, monitoring food, water and environment quality and safety and personal/homeland security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Affinity-based biosensors are analytical platforms that detect analytes through specific interactions between analyte targets and recognition molecules. Current affinity-based biosensor require a label for quantification. The lack of an ideal label and tedious/time consuming protocol are major limitations of the current affinity-based biosensors.  Field-effect transistors (FET)-based biosensors are an alternative for alleviating these limitations. The proposed research will develop a novel all two-dimensional layered van der Waals (LVDW) nanomaterial-bioreceptor hybrid optoelectronic biosensor for detecting chemical/biological molecules with ultrahigh sensitivity, exquisite selectivity and label-free analysis. The proposed optoelectronic device will be a photogated FET transducer made from single-layer of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) semiconductor as channel/gate, single-layer graphene as source and drain electrodes and a red LED as photons supplier. The MoS2 channel will be functionalized by bioreceptor specific for the target analyte. The analytical figures of merits, i.e. sensitivity, limit of detection, selectivity, speed, reproducibility, stability, etc., will be established. The sensing of avidin as target with biotin as receptor will be used as a model system for this EAGER project.  Intellectual merits of the research program include a novel biosensor consisting of optoelectronic transducer composed of a heterostructure of two-dimensional nanomaterials graphene and molybdenum disulfide coupled with a red light LED and interfaced to biological sensing molecules that is expected to revolutionize the designs and performances of FET-based label-free affinity biosensors platforms. Broader Impacts of the project would be a new paradigm in label-free affinity-based biosensors for highly sensitive, selective, rapid, cost-effective, facile and in-field multiplexed detection of chemical and biological molecules. The proposed sensing platform is expected to find applications in medical diagnostics, food safety and quality, environmental monitoring, homeland/personal security, etc. This research will help increase (i) US technological competitiveness; (ii) develop a globally competitive STEM workforce; (iii) increase participation of women and underrepresented minorities; and (iv) contribute to undergraduate and graduate STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
