<AbstractNarration>Non-technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;Meeting of Young Investigators is organized to provide researchers with necessary information about NSF process, opportunities and mechanisms related to proposal submission. A group of first-time applicants or those who did not apply to NSF in the past will be provided helpful information designed to improve their proposal writing skills and understand the NSF process better. A mock proposal review activity will enable better understanding of the merit review process. Participation of PIs from small colleges and underrepresented groups was encouraged. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Participants of the DMR Young Investigators Workshop will receive information about the NSF process presented by current or past Program Directors. Specifically, the participants will be trained in Merit Review Principles, writing a successful proposal, building a strong Broader Impact component, Conflict of Interest and Ethics rules and they will learn about funding opportunities within NSF. Participants will write and review one-page proposals, to be evaluated by panels, including a full panel review process, discussion and writing panel summaries. The two-day intensive training obtained during the Workshop is expected to be most beneficial to young PIs and increase their chances of successful interactions with NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The workshop provided new and future PI?s with information on NSF programs, policies, and priorities, allowed networking, gave an indication of what the community considers to be hot topics at the current time, highlighted funding opportunities, and gave hints about the best practices for proposal preparation and reviewing. Unlike previous years, in 2018 the workshop was lengthen from 1.5 days to 2 full days and added a new program: activities emulating the full processes from proposal writing and submission to panel review.  The participants participated in the mock panel review processes for the proposals submitted by other participants.  Each panel composed of about 10 members was trained and guided by a Program Director.  This program, which was initiated by Durakiewicz at NSF, received overwhelmingly positive responses from the participants.   The Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences has a wide and diverse portfolio, focusing on fundamental issues as well as pioneering effort in all areas of mathematics and physical sciences. The PI?s, especially early in their careers, are typically single investigators with individual laboratory facilities and a small group of students and postdocs. This ?stand-alone? structure means that mentoring of these investigators, in particular, in the underrepresented group is perhaps not as complete as for those in other groups.  The continued development of younger single PI?s in any representative groups entering the program is of extreme importance to the NSF and the future scientific community.  This workshop provided young faculty in the target group with information and skills necessary to further their success in the future.
