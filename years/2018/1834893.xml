<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to bring more usable technology to elderly populations to help them age with greater independence.  Specifically, existing in-home robots could assist a broader cohort of elderly users if the robots were easier to understand and use.  This is an especially timely opportunity as the elderly population is quickly growing in the United States. Elderly users need a robot that can express many internal states through external features, especially in an intuitive and interactive way. Choreographers and theater artists recognize how to convey narrative through context (set), movement (choreography), and commands (dialogue), therefore bringing a special expertise beyond typical product design processes.  Marrying this expertise with robotic hardware development has the potential to produce a significant transformation in how aging adults relate to and take advantage of technology in their homes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project aims to explore the commercial potential of a three-part design methodology that has been developed to layer robotic systems with greater expressiveness and understandable features. This method 1) creates systems with appropriate expressive bandwidth to communicate internal state to human viewers through motion profiles, 2) helps users understand how to interact with robotic systems through character-driven narrative, and 3) predicts affective responses to these systems, across multiple contexts. Initial results indicate that trust and acceptance of in-home technology can be facilitated with low-cost, simple hardware like LEDs, off-the-shelf servo motors, improved how-to literature, and context-based behavior, with existing, low-cost robot hardware. For example, something as simple as a heart rate monitor has opaque, hard to interpret monitors, confusing multiple-step procedures, and an ominous beeping. This novel approach adds a customizable expressive layer to an existing device like this, creates a character-driven narrative about how the device works, and uses theatrical context which may improve user adoption via priming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The team set out to understand how a novel design methodology could help elderly aging-in-place alleviate feelings of loneliness. The grant supported a rigorous customer discovery process, which has led to several pivots in our business plan. The project has developed all of the team members' awareness of the personal relationships people have with their family members and how technology often gets in the way of feeling like a healthy, embodied person. After discovering a common thread in adults young and old, the team ended up pursuing a product that would help alleviate the antagonist relationship that many people have with their bodies, creating a product that helps people feel powerful and creative in their bodies. This product was built, a parallel activity using a separate funding source, and delivered to an initial customer at the Microsoft Technology Center (MTC) in the Aon Center in downtown Chicago. &nbsp;Customer interviews with various stakeholders at this site, prior to, during, and after development, have aided the design of this device. The product was the ``sleeper-hit'' of the center's grand re-opening in October, and this event facilitated many further customer interviews. The MTC where the prototype booth is installed is open to the public and frequently hosts groups (from local student groups to professional groups in healthcare, technology, agriculture, and consulting), allowing the device exposure to hundreds of participants. So far, in 5 months of operation we've averaged 30 users a month entering their phone number after they use the booth; we estimate that a little under 1/3 of users take this step, corresponding with about 100 users a month. &nbsp;At the end of this award, the team is compiling feedback from users, site managers, and artists in order to continue their business creating embodied, empowering experiences for isolated participants through digital body-tracking and expressive system design.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/22/2020<br>      Modified by: Amy&nbsp;E&nbsp;Laviers</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1834893/1834893_10547052_1584721378604_IMG_1151--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1834893/1834893_10547052_1584721378604_IMG_1151--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Booth for movement experiences"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1834893/1834893_10547052_1584721378604_IMG_1151--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Booth for movement experiences"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The newly created startup, caali LLC, developed this booth, located in the Microsoft Technology Center (MTC) in the Aon Center in downtown Chicago, through parallel investment and with input from customer interviews conducted during the grant period.</div> <div class="imageCredit">A.
