<AbstractNarration>This project will conduct a two-day workshop examining black girls' and women's mathematics and computing identities. The goals of the workshop are to 1) explore the intersectional experiences of black girls and women in math and computer science (CS), 2) begin to understand how math and CS identities relate and inform each other, 3) start understanding factors that lead black women to study math and CS in college, and 4) establish a more extensive research agenda around these issues. The workshop will bring together thought leaders to examine the trajectories of success for black girls and women in mathematics and CS. The results of this workshop will inform the national dialogue in support of broadening participation in both computing and mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contributions of the workshop address the need to increase the diversity of ideas and perspectives in computer science and mathematics, particularly for black women. This workshop will go beyond simply adding to the discourse for the need to increase diversity in these disciplines by 1) actively investigating research to differentiate the experiences of black women from other groups in computing and mathematics, 2) providing a critical analysis of the conditions under which black girls and women thrive, 3) actively investigating the relationship between computer science and mathematics through both curricular and experiential lenses, and 4) engaging black girls and women to articulate the experiences that differentiate them from other groups in computing and mathematics. The organizers will create and distribute an article describing the workshop, its enactment and the findings that emerge from the discussion and interaction. They will also develop a videography of black girls and women sharing how their personal experiences affect their math and CS identities as well as their interest and persistence in these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

This complex discourse produced the identification of some factors that shape Black girls? decisions to major/minor in computer science or mathematics including early interest and sustained exposure to math and computer science overtime through programming (i.e. summer programs/camps or clubs). We learned that when Black girls get to middle school, the critical experience is to be on the college track for mathematics to get exposed to the extra programming, otherwise, it can be a challenge for them to make these connections. We also learned that a mediating factor for this can be the consistent reinforcements by teachers and family members that Black girls are good at these subjects/disciplines. Finally, this Collective established an ongoing working group to introduce and vet research ideas and projects from the workshop that will serve as a future research agenda.
