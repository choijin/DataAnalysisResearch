<AbstractNarration>The Conference on Stochastic Weather Generators (SWGEN 2018) will be held in Boulder, Colorado on October 2-4, 2018.  The conference will be held at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  Stochastic weather generators (SWGs) are mathematical or statistical algorithms whose simulated values capture the statistical distribution of weather or climate variables of interest. Weather and climate-related phenomena can have substantial impacts on human safety, for example flooding, heat waves and severe storms.  They also have significant societal and economic impacts: seasonal water resource planning, crop yield studies and weather volatility risk assessments all require high resolution simulations of relevant weather quantities such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed and solar insolation. Historically, SWGs were developed by domain scientists for applied projects such as statistical downscaling of climate models. Recently the applied mathematics and statistical science communities have taken increasing interest in their formal development, which feed back into novel modeling, estimation and simulation techniques that then warrant theoretical study. SWGEN 2018 serves as the first conference devoted to SWGs in the United States, and is intended to introduce a wide audience of mathematical, statistical and domain scientists to the current state of the field, disseminate novel techniques for precipitation, temperature, wind speed and solar radiation modeling, to forge new collaborative opportunities and to identify areas of future research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will consist of keynote lectures, a poster session and research talks featuring topics of major interest in mathematical and statistical communities for weather simulation including 1) modeling techniques for renewable energy applications such as wind and solar irradiance simulation, 2) modeling and simulation of complex nonstationary and inhomogeneous processes that evolve over space and time, and 3) large-scale spatiotemporally-coherent simulation methods. Generating realistic spatiotemporal weather processes requires novel techniques from areas such as spatial and computational statistics. These methods dovetail with current interests in the statistical community involving big data modeling, estimation and simulation techniques. Other topics will be considered, including nonlinear processes, high frequency data, multi-scale models, extremes, analog or resampling techniques, and non-Gaussian processes with applications in hydrology, agriculture, air quality, insurance and environmental engineering. Links between topics will be identified and discussed to better understand the role of mathematics and statistics in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference website is at: https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/calendar/swgen-2018-stochastic-weather-generators-conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Attendees of the conference came from a broad set of disciplines including statistics, applied mathematics, hydrology, civil engineering, atmospheric science, climate science as well as insurance.   The first day of the conference opened with a keynote lecture by a leading researcher in the field, followed by four research oral sessions.  That evening a poster session was held at NCAR, highlighting novel weather simulation techniques by early career researchers. The second day opened with a keynote lecture, followed by four oral sessions, while the final day was an area hike to foster interdisciplinary networking.  Keynote lectures were 60 minutes, while contributed talks were 25 minutes.  14 posters were presented, primarily by early career scientists.  Group lunches were held in NCAR's cafeteria, contributing to networking opportunities between senior and junior researchers.  Topics covered at the conference represented cutting-edge research at the intersection of statistics, applied mathematics and atmospheric science including space-time modeling, wind power forecasting, multivariate methods, precipitation extremes, weather generators for climate models, solar power modeling, dust storm modeling and stochastic parameterizations.   The conference was attended by 53 researchers, and the program committee heavily promoted attendance by early career researchers including graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and pre-tenure faculty members.  Contributed talks and early career travel grant applications were reviewed by a program committee from multiple institutions.  Approximately 56% of attendees were early career scientists, many of whom contributed to the technical program. Thus, the conference fostered future scientists in this increasingly important area at the intersection of mathematics, atmospheric and climate science. Moreover, this was the first meeting of its kind in the United States, with prior iterations being held in Europe; 62% of participants were US researchers, while prior international conferences in this series had less than 10% attendance by US scientists.
