<AbstractNarration>This research project studies several problems in discrete geometry, which lies on the interface of combinatorics and geometry.  Problems in the field are often simply described, and typically involve fundamental objects in Euclidean space such as points, lines, spheres, etc.  While many questions in discrete geometry are worth studying for their own sake, others are motivated by their applications in computer science and engineering.  More recently, discrete geometry has seen tremendous growth, and numerous unexpected connections to other fields of mathematics are being discovered.  One of the main goals of this project is to further explore these connections, and to apply new tools and techniques to several long-standing open problems. The PI will also continue to encourage high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students to work in combinatorial research, and continue to teach courses that cover the latest results and open problems in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two main areas under investigation:  geometric Ramsey theory and incidence geometry.  Over the past few decades, Ramsey numbers have been applied extensively to give upper bounds on homogeneity problems arising in geometry. For many of these applications, one can obtain much better bounds by exploiting the fact that the edges are defined algebraically.  The PI will continue a sequence of recent works on Ramsey-type problems for hypergraphs defined algebraically, which includes the famous Happy Ending Problem of Erdos and Szekeres, and finding large independent sets in intersection graphs of geometric objects.  Another major goal of this project is to explore various extensions of the Szemeredi-Trotter theorem and its applications to additive number theory.  Specific problems include characterizing dense point-line arrangements and estimating the number of incidences between points and d-dimensional varieties.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This research project was in the area of Ramsey theory and incidence geometry.   Ramsey theory is a rich area of mathematics with an underlying theme that every sufficiently large system contains a large well organized subsystem.  Incidence geometry is the study of intersection patterns between points and lines in the plane, or more generally, between points and surfaces in higher dimensions.  This project focused on finite systems, such as graphs, hypergraphs, and point sets, and our main interest is in the asymptotic behaviors as the size of the underlying system goes to infinity.      During this project, the PI was able to asymptotically solve the famous Erdos-Szekeres Happy Ending problem, a problem which dates back to 1935.  More precisely, he asymptotically determined the minimum size of a planar point set that guarantees a convex n-gon.     The PI and his co-authors showed that many classical theorems in extremal combinatorics can be significantly improved if we restrict our attention to graphs and hypergraphs that arise in geometry.  This work developed a new method for proving the existence of large well organized structures, and had numerous applications in geometry, combinatorics, and computer science.     Determining (classical) hypergraph Ramsey numbers is a notoriously difficult problem in extremal combinatorics, and is one of the most central problems in the area.    During this project, the PI and his co-author established new lower bounds for classical hypergraph Ramsey numbers, and determined the correct tower growth rate for the Ramsey number  r_k(k+2,n).     The PI collaborated extensively with his PhD student at his home institution.  In joint work with his graduate student, the PI completed a project that established a structure theorem for point sets in the plane.  They are currently finishing another project which analyzes the intersection pattern between points and circles in the plane, which is related to the famous unit distance problem of Erdos.       Several outreach activities were also accomplished during this project.  The PI gave numerous talks in seminars and conferences around the world, including several general talks to mathematicians outside of his specific field.   He organized a 5-day workshop in Banff, Canada for 40 researchers in the field, and served as a reviewer for several academic journals.
