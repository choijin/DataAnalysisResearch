<AbstractNarration>Natural disasters challenge human communities in multiple ways that go well beyond the obvious problems associated with large scale destruction of property and loss of life, some of them subtle but no less important for building sustainability, reducing vulnerability, enabling families to survive and reproduce, and decreasing dependence on external economic assistance. By destroying power grids, communication and transportation infrastructure, hospitals, water and sewer systems, and other public and private resources, Hurricanes Irma and Maria left the peoples of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico heavily dependent on external aid. This project explores a set of economic behaviors emerging in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico following Hurricanes Irma and Maria, with the aim of improving scientific understandings of creative resilience, and identifying the principal sources of extreme vulnerability. Findings will be disseminated to organizations that explore and manage the causes, consequences, and complexities of disaster management and recovery. Funding this research also trains researchers from underrepresented groups in social science research. Findings from this have the potential to establish patterns for how people develop new economic organizational principles in the wake of catastrophe that are more sustainable than the current methods of continued debt and debt service that has plagued Puerto Rico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID award supports the collection of critical but ephemeral data in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A team of researchers led by Dr. David Griffith of East Carolina University will explore the relationship between local moral economics, vulnerability, and resilience in post-disaster recovery zones. Observational, transect walk, and comparative photographic methods will take place across five impacted communities, and a stratified (by socio-economic, educational, and other variables) sample of individuals will be interviewed, with the objective of documenting variations and similarities in labor arrangements, common facility, land, and resource use, distribution patterns, and marketing and exchange locales. how perceptions vary, how they develop over time, and how they affect the eventual mitigation and prevention plans that are produced. The research will produce a baseline for future research on vulnerability and resilience in the wake of anthropogenic disasters. Research has established that moral economies tend to emerge in response to recession, depression, austerity programs, and economies disrupted from war, environmental degradation, and natural disaster. Such systems are often critical for long-term resilience. Research conducted on the social and natural sources of vulnerability following Hurricane Mitch, for example, established that vulnerability could be linked to a social system that had encouraged deforestation and other environmentally degrading economic practices. The project will enable us to understand what variance there is with respect to the efficacy of these economic behaviors in mitigating vulnerability and improving resilience.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Following the four person-months of fieldwork we completed during winter and spring of 2017-2018, immediately after Hurricanes Irma and Mar?a, we analyzed data quickly to submit a larger proposal building on the rapid proposal, which was not funded.&nbsp; Since then, we have been developing materials for publication, publishing and presenting the results of the work.&nbsp; We developed a panel for the American Anthropological Association meetings in the fall of 2018 and secured funding for a multi-university project on the relationships between environmental change and migration that draws on the results of this study.&nbsp; That work has been funded by the Department of Defense under its MURI program and will last from 2018 to 2023.&nbsp;</p> <p>Through our attention to the relationships between moral economy and political economy following the storm, we learned that prior social organizational and structural factors were instrumental in how people responded to and recovered from the storms.&nbsp; Perhaps foremost among the factors influencing behaviors following the storms were the diasporas that have formed between the U.S. Caribbean and the U.S. mainland over the past several decades.&nbsp; Connections across these diasporas were essential in influencing where people sent their children for schooling following the closing of schools on the islands, where they sought temporary or long-term refuge and shelter, where they went for goods needed to assist with the recovery, and where people were located who participated in the recovery by sending donations of generators, solar-powered lights and small appliances, cash, and other goods and services.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet the diasporas were not alone in facilitating response and recovery.&nbsp; In another case, for example, a social movement to protect mangroves on the southeast coast of Puerto Rico became a vehicle for organizing work groups and distribution centers that became critical in providing goods and services to the most affected households and families.&nbsp; Similarly, Puerto Rican fishing associations used their organizational capacities to provide fresh fish to hungry families during lengthy power outages when access to other sources of protein were limited.&nbsp;</p> <p>Not all of the responses to the storm were positive, however.&nbsp; Predatory capitalist interests in the tourist sector used the storm to leverage insurance payments and expand their control of coastal regions that have long been locations where locals have foraged for land crabs, fish, and shellfish.&nbsp; Some of this was facilitated by the fact that many Puerto Ricans do not have title to the lands on which they live and where they have developed livelihoods, in part due to the ways in which many areas around the island have been settled historically.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, the formation of parcelas, or housing developments that emerged from initially squatting on government lands, have been undertaken by successive generations without securing title.&nbsp; FEMA could not assist with rebuilding efforts in cases where title to property is uncertain.&nbsp;</p> <p>We anticipate developing further work on relationships between economic formations and processes and disasters in the U.S. Caribbean. &nbsp; For the project team, the primary intellectual merit of the study has been to elucidate the importance of moral economic sentiments in immediate responses to natural disasters and how they deteriorate, but unevenly, over time, in some cases being displaced by political economic sentiments but in other cases spawning new economic formations.&nbsp; In terms of broader impacts, we continue to present the results of our research to groups interested in recovery from natural hazards.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/01/2019<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;Griffith</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806303/1806303_10525267_1556722584201_Aguadilla_Fish_Assn2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806303/1806303_10525267_1556722584201_Aguadilla_Fish_Assn2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Aguadilla Fishing Association"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806303/1806303_10525267_1556722584201_Aguadilla_Fish_Assn2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Aguadilla Fishing Association"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Damaged fishing association near where Hurricane Maria exited the island.</div> <div class="imageCredit">David Griffith</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">David&nbsp;Griffith</div> <div class="imageTitle">Aguadilla Fishing Association</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806303/1806303_10525267_1556722429775_Red_Cross_Distribute_Food_Puerto_Real--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806303/1806303_10525267_1556722429775_Red_Cross_Distribute_Food_Puerto_Real--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Red Cross Food Distribution"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806303/1806303_10525267_1556722429775_Red_Cross_Distribute_Food_Puerto_Real--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Red Cross Food Distribution"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Taken in Cabo Rojo in December, 2017, just two and a half months after the storm</div> <div class="imageCredit">David Griffith</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">David&nbsp;Griffith</div> <div class="imageTitle">Red Cross Food Distribution</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806303/1806303_10525267_1556722700012_Roof_Missing_Joyuda--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806303/1806303_10525267_1556722700012_Roof_Missing_Joyuda--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Missing Roof in Joyuda"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806303/1806303_10525267_1556722700012_Roof_Missing_Joyuda--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Missing Roof in Joyuda"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">More evidence of the destruction</div> <div class="imageCredit">David Griffith</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">David&nbsp;Griffith</div> <div class="imageTitle">Missing Roof in Joyuda</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806303/1806303_10525267_1556722974658_Guanica_SunkenVessel--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806303/1806303_10525267_1556722974658_Guanica_SunkenVessel--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sunken Recreational vessel with still active commercial vessels"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806303/1806303_10525267_1556722974658_Guanica_SunkenVessel--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sunken Recreational vessel with still active commercial vessels"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Commercial fishermen were able to move their boats and motors out of harms way, but many recreational vessel owners did not have the same opportunities.</div> <div class="imageCredit">David Griffith</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">David&nbsp;Griffith</div> <div class="imageTitle">Sunken Recreational vessel with still active commercial vessels</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806303/1806303_10525267_1556731047434_IMG_3043--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806303/1806303_10525267_1556731047434_IMG_3043--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Blue Tarps"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1806303/1806303_10525267_1556731047434_IMG_3043--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Blue Tarps"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Blue Roofs are an indicator of the extent of damage to selected neighborhoods.
