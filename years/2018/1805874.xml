<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to recover fossil corals from the island of Espiritu Santo, Vanuatu in the western tropical Pacific that will enable reconstruction of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during the last glacial period using coral skeleton geochemistry. Few paleoclimate records exist that can resolve interannual changes during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), a time that can be used to help constrain the large uncertainty in ENSO's response to changes in global temperature. Corals provide one such record but fossil corals still in place from the LGM are normally found at water depths of 120-140 m below present sea level, and hence require expensive and logistically complex offshore approaches to obtain. In contrast, Vanuatu has experienced rapid rates of tectonic uplift which has raised the LGM paleo-shoreline to the point where glacial corals are expected to be near the surface and reachable by shallow drilling from onshore sites. The project thus offers a rare and important opportunity for the paleoceanographic community to acquire coral samples that can be used to develop high resolution time-series of ENSO and investigate western tropical Pacific variability during the LGM. The research team will modify an existing drill system to make it portable enough to hand-carry into hard to reach locations, and then conduct an extended field program to deploy and drill a series of onshore coral transects along the Vanuatu coast. U-Th dating will be used to confirm the ages of recovered corals and the samples obtained will be assessed for their suitability for later geochemical studies. The project will support an early career researcher as well as graduate and undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern coral geochemical records from Vanuatu show a significant degree of skill in capturing the hydrological imprint of ENSO. Confidence in modern coral records suggest that fossil coral records can be used to estimate past changes in ENSO variability. On Vanuatu, tectonic uplift has raised the LGM paleo-shoreline to near present sea level, bringing old corals close to the surface as demonstrated by the research team's preliminary fieldwork. As part of this project, the team will build a new drill system that is portable, cost-efficient, and time-efficient for drilling shallow holes (5-25 m), a system that currently does not exist. The strategy will be to have a human-portable drill system that can be quickly moved to virtually any site to drill as many holes as possible, increasing the likelihood of recovering LGM coral material. The drilling operation will capitalize on an area where previous surveys have identified corals as old as 14.25 kyrs within a few meters of present sea level. A further advantage of applying this strategy to Vanuatu is that LGM corals are most likely still submerged in seawater rather than being uplifted completely onto dry land. This greatly reduces the chance for diagenetic alteration that all too often affects the geochemistry of older corals. The recovered coral samples will be dated using U-Th methods and screened for their geochemical integrity. The successful recovery of pristine glacial-age corals from Vanuatu will open the door for subsequent studies to determine how ENSO and tropical climate may have responded during the LGM, a time of greatly altered mean climate. An additional benefit for the larger community will be development and fabrication of the modified Winkie drill system. Such a portable system is expected to find considerable use by other researchers for land-based drilling operations in rough terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goals of this grant were 1. to design and build a unique man-portable drill able to be transported by hand into extremely rugged terrain to drill rapidly uplifting coral reefs and 2. to recover cores from corals that have sub-annually resolved geochemical records of past El Ni&ntilde;o/La Ni&ntilde;a events that grew during the last ice age. Both goals were achieved: 1. We built a man-portable hydraulic drill that takes unusually large-diameter cores (75 mm or 3 inches), which is critical to a high recovery rate of viable samples, and 2. drilled cores that included a 2.5 m Porites species coral dated at 15,690 yrs old, plus many other corals, from important glacial-age time periods. These results validate both our drill-design/building expertise and our strategy to access glacial-age corals by land-based drilling.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The climate information locked in the chemical changes of a coral skeleton is a well-vetted means of determining past ocean water temperatures and salinities and has been widely applied to corals of the past centuries and, in a few cases, periods from the past several thousand years. El Ni&ntilde;o/La Ni&ntilde;a events impact most of the countries that neighbor the Pacific Ocean, and how these events will respond to future climate change is unknown. The effects of El Ni&ntilde;o/La Ni&ntilde;a events, which are global in scope, range from widespread flooding and drought on land to the bleaching of coral reefs in the ocean. However, little is known about past variations in the frequency or intensity of El Ni&ntilde;o/La Ni&ntilde;a events due to so few paleoclimate records. Typically, paleoclimate records lack the annual to sub-annual resolution needed to show how these events changed in the past, but ancient<strong>&nbsp;</strong>corals are unique in their detailed recordings of past climate changes in the ocean.&nbsp;Furthermore, climate models disagree on how El Ni&ntilde;o/La Ni&ntilde;a events will change in the future. Therefore, we set out to recover ancient corals that recorded how El Ni&ntilde;o/La Ni&ntilde;a events behaved when mean global climate was radically different from today in order to compare them to climate models, the same ones that are used to project future changes, run under past climate conditions.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This proposal aimed to capitalize on extremely rapid uplift rates (6-7 mm/yr) on Espiritu Santo Island in the Republic of Vanuatu, located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, where fast uplift has raised coral reefs that are 10,000 to 15,000 years old almost to the surface. This uplifted terrain, which lies above a subduction zone in the ocean, is extremely rugged. We found no commercially available drill rig that could be moved to the drill sites at reasonable costs, thus causing us to build a new drilling system. The new drill was designed, built, and tested by ourselves in Austin, TX. After testing, we deployed the drill for two months to a remote location on Espiritu Santo Island.&nbsp;&nbsp;We drilled for a total of 21 days at 9 different holes to a maximum depth of 16 m, and recovered 77 meters of core. We dated a total of 24 individual corals and ages range from ~2,000 to 16,000 years ago. One especially excellent coral specimen is 2.5m long and was dated to have grown 15,690 years ago. Based on our success, we plan to submit a proposal to analyze the samples drilled thus far, to improve the drill based on what we learned, and to drill for samples that grew as climate and sea level changed rapidly as the ice caps melted during the end of the last ice age. The period from 10,000 to 21,000 years ago is a time when mean global sea level was 30-125 meters lower than present, making it difficult to access corals that grew during this time. Also, it is a period when one climate model developed by the United States predicts that El Ni&ntilde;o/La Ni&ntilde;a events were reduced compared to today. The same model also projects that El Ni&ntilde;o/La Ni&ntilde;a events strengthen in the future with climate change. In other words, if the model is right about past changes in climate, then we can place more confidence in the changes it predicts for the future.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/25/2021<br>      Modified by: Judson&nbsp;W&nbsp;Partin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1805874/1805874_10574103_1614273413656_Figure3-Drillsetup--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1805874/1805874_10574103_1614273413656_Figure3-Drillsetup--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3 | Setting up the Drill on the Reef"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1805874/1805874_10574103_1614273413656_Figure3-Drillsetup--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3 | Setting up the Drill on the Reef"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Our team setting up the drill on an uplifted coral reef in Tanavusvus, Espirtu Santo, Vanuatu.
