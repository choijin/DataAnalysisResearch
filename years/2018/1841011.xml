<AbstractNarration>The goal of this 4-year project is to develop the Climatology of Anthropogenic and Natural Very Low Frequency (VLF) wave Activity in Space (CANVAS) Cubesat which will measure VLF wave energy that originates from lightning and ground-based transmitters and propagates to the outer reaches of Earth's magnetic field (the magnetosphere). Previous research has shown that VLF waves from these sources play a significant role in the dynamics of Earths radiation environment. This project will focus on quantifying how much VLF energy from sources on the Earth's surface and in the atmosphere propagates through the charged layers of Earth's upper atmosphere and into the magnetosphere. This is important for understanding the extent to which ground based electromagnetic sources can impact the near-Earth space environment. The project is led by two early career scientists, engages graduate students through class participation, and provides funding for undergraduate and postdoctoral research experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CANVAS consists of a three-axis magnetic search coil deployed on the end of a 1-meter carbon fiber boom; together with a two-axis dipole antenna. Together, these five wave components will be used to determine the wave power spectral density at 1 second time resolution using real-time Fast Fourier Transforms calculated in onboard Field Programmable Gate Arrays. Data will be sent to the ground to determine the full set of wave parameters, including polarization, planarity, and k-vector direction. The CANVAS CubeSat will employ the Blue Canyon Attitude Determination and Control System to provide sub-degree pointing accuracy, together with heritage spacecraft subsystems from the previous successful  missions at CU Boulder. An S-band transceiver and dual antennas will communicate with a new ground station in Boulder to downlink all of the science data. The cubesat will take continuous measurements in low Earth orbit to address the following science questions: i) What is the average electromagnetic energy input into the space environment by lightning? ii) What is the spectrum of VLF wave energy above the ionosphere in the 0.3-50 kHz frequency range? iii) What is the transmission transfer function of the ionosphere for VLF energy, and how does it vary in space and time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
