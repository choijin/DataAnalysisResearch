<AbstractNarration>This project examines how 'manner of death' categories are constructed and used in forensic science. Forensic scientists are required to use a standardized set of categories when determining how a person dies, however, many forms of death are uncertain or occur in situations that challenge official categories. As a result, forensic scientists must often relate causes of death in ways that defy the actual nature of the death under investigation. This process shapes related social outcomes, such as the nature of potential criminal investigations and insurance claims and can lead the justice system to function in ways that obfuscate the collection of valid scientific knowledge. Understanding how manner of death categories are constructed and how they might be changed could lead to more accurate conceptions of death categories, particularly for socially vulnerable categories of people, and a to improvements in the justice system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a multi-method investigation of 'manner of death' categories as they are employed in forensic science, and how these matter for jointly shaping science, medicine, and the criminal justice system. Data come from documentary analyses of policy documents at the federal, state, and local levels, and of forensic science textbooks. These will be complemented by ethnographic observations and interviews at forensic science departments, and at the offices of coroners and medical examines. The main goal of the project is to show how academic research practices and seemingly mundane forms of scientific typologies and categorizations affect legal practices and the effective functioning of the criminal justice system. In doing so, it helps build on existing scholarship in science studies indicating that science and technology not only assist in resolving legal disputes, but can also actively produce them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated how the 'Manner of Death' category within Death Certificates influences death certifiers and death investigators, and how that influence contributes to the possibility that individual deaths will be certified as being "Natural" in cases of environmental toxic exposure.  Through analyzing the history of how causality has been understood within the law, medicine, and cemented within contemporary Death Certificates, gaps were identified both in the structure of Death Certificates for accounting for the circumstances of deaths, as well as in the considerations and conceptions of death certifiers and investigators of what is causally explanatory of why a death occurred. In particular, when mortality disparities exist between different communities after deaths designated as 'Homicide,' 'Suicide,' and 'Accidental' are factored out, the remaining deaths are those designated as 'Natural' even in situations where the life expectancy between two communities may be on the order of 15+ years.   This research interrogated the circumstances of death investigation and certifying that lead to 'Natural' Manner of Death designations being applied when mortality disparities exist.  It was found that the 'Natural' Manner of Death category in effect is used in situations where another Manner of Death category cannot be established within the limited definitions and requirements of medico-legal causality. In other words, if a death does not fit the strict criteria of 'Homicide,' 'Suicide,' or 'Accidental,' it tend to be designated 'Natural.' This identifies that should the criteria and understanding of the circumstances of death be altered, deaths due to such things as environmental toxic exposure may be able to be recognized by the criminal justice system, something that at present it does not.  By identifying the mechanisms and practices in death certifying that prevent long-term toxic exposures to be recognized within individual death certificates, this research contributes to the scholarship and research on Social Determinants of Health, in particular that by Environmental Justice Scholars. Research that seeks understandings for the production and persistence of disparities in mortality rates between different communities and the intractability of government organizations, in particular criminal justice organizations, to address or take up such disparities as falling under their purview, will be aided by an account of how the category ‘Natural’ functions, influences, and determines how deaths are understood and accepted.
