<AbstractNarration>Sixteen graduate students will be recruited to participate in a 21-day Advanced Study Institute (ASI) in Argentina in conjunction with the NSF-sponsored RELAMPAGO (Remote sensing of Electrification, Lightning, And Mesoscale/microscale Processes with Adaptive Ground Observations) field campaign from 30 October thru 19 November 2018. The ASI program will provide a dynamic and highly collaborative research experience by focusing on five key elements: (1) intensive field research with active field campaign instrumentation platforms under the guidance of the instrument PIs; (2) recruitment of a diverse set of graduate students who would not otherwise have opportunities to participate in intensive field research; (3) an ASI curriculum focused on scientific understanding of cloud and mesoscale processes of the atmosphere and professional/academic development topics; (4) outreach to local K-12 schools and organized cultural activities; and (5) building a collaborative international research network between the U.S., Argentina, and Brazil to promote weather and climate research. These five elements serve to increase motivation and improve self-confidence of students to participate in scientific research and field work with goals of increasing retention in STEM graduate programs and advancing the careers of students from underrepresented groups. The experience for participating advanced graduate students is intentionally designed by the multi-cultural and international ASI organizing committee to develop a wide variety of professional skills to prepare the students for the transition to their careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI-team will conduct an Advanced Study Institute (ASI) in Argentina for three weeks in conjunction with the NSF-sponsored RELAMPAGO (Remote sensing of Electrification, Lightning, And Mesoscale/microscale Processes with Adaptive Ground Observations) field campaign that will support the participation of sixteen highly motivated and diverse advanced graduate students from the U.S. This region arguably has among the most intense convective systems in the world with respect to the frequency of large hail, high storm tops, and extreme lightning activity, yet the processes that give rise to such extremes are unclear because of a scarcity of observations. The ASI will be coordinated by international and U.S.-based atmospheric scientists involved in RELAMPAGO. The ASI program will provide a dynamic and highly collaborative research experience by focusing on five key elements: (1) intensive field research with active field campaign instrumentation platforms under the guidance of the instrument PIs; (2) recruitment of a diverse set of graduate students who would not otherwise have opportunities to participate in intensive field research; (3) an ASI curriculum focused on scientific understanding of cloud and mesoscale processes of the atmosphere and professional/academic development topics; (4) outreach to local K-12 schools and organized cultural activities; and (5) building a collaborative international research network between the U.S., Argentina, and Brazil to promote weather and climate research. These five elements serve to increase motivation and improve self-confidence of students to participate in scientific research and field work with goals of increasing retention in STEM graduate programs and advancing the careers of students from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

This program is unique as it represents the first effort to integrate an intensive Advanced Study Institute with a field campaign in atmospheric science. Major international field campaigns of this type do not happen often and are typically only accessible to student advisees of the campaign Principal Investigators (PIs). Thus, students from institutions that do not typically conduct field work (e.g., smaller colleges, Minority Serving Institutions), or those doing computational or theoretical research projects, may not have the opportunity to participate in a major field campaign in an international setting.

More specifically, the students requested that more professional development topics be covered, including career-related topics like job applications and interviewing.

As the first Advanced Study Institute organized in collaboration with a major field campaign in atmospheric science, the ASI-FSCA program provides a model for future programs that can potentially improve access to a broader demographic of students to the unique environments in field campaigns.
