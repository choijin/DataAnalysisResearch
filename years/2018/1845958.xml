<AbstractNarration>One of the greatest challenges to understanding variability in human behavior and cognition, in both health and disease, is the relative disconnection between scientific psychology and neurobiological knowledge.  Not much is known of how personality, intelligence, and other variables are related, and we do not know how they arise from brain activity.  The overarching, high-risk goal of this NSF-EAGER project is to use neuroscience data to discover the architecture of the mind: can we build a new psychology from knowledge about the brain?  The starting point of this work is the notion that instead of personality, intelligence, positive mood, attention and other current psychological constructs, none of which were derived based on neuroscience data, one might end up with a very different inventory if these psychological variables were derived in a data-driven fashion from neuroimaging data.  This project is exploratory, since there are no extant paths for approaching this issue.  The project will use approaches from the field of causal discovery, essentially asking if we can identify features in neuroimaging data that best explain new, revised psychological variables.  The results will be a proof-of-principle that such an approach could yield new psychological constructs, and if successful will provide an initial direction in which this new field could evolve. The project will also use open science practices throughout its activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER project investigates individual differences in psychology and brain function to address a high-risk, high-payoff question: can we use neuroscience to revise psychology?  It will focus on probing two domains of utmost importance to functioning in the real world: personality and intelligence.  There has been success in predicting classical derivations of personality dimensions and intelligence from neuroimaging data, but this approach is inherently limited by the particular psychological constructs used in the first place.  The further step taken here is to optimally combine test results in light of neural predictability, based on causal graphs that are estimated from resting-state fMRI data.  The project will also use a novel, entirely data-driven approach, Causal Feature Learning (CFL), to automatically derive candidate causal variables from the fMRI measurements that may explain the behavioral and psychometric measures used to determine personality and intelligence.  CFL has been used successfully in this fashion to analyze climate data, but it has never been applied to neuroscience. The project intends to make substantial contributions to philosophical and psychological conceptualizations of mental variables and cognitive architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project investigated a deep conceptual question that has very broad applications: what variables should a science of psychology use?  Currently, we have a rather heterogeneous mix of such variables, such as memory, attention, perception, emotion, personality, intelligence, and so forth.  Our project addresses both a broad question about how to revise these with neuroscience data, and about investigating the last two in detail.   Our project begins by arguing that these kinds of psychological variables certainly exist, that they are latent variables that provide causal explanations of behavior, and that they are instantiated in the brain [1]. But all of the above listed variables were in use well before there was any mature science using them, and so it seems likely that they would need revision.  How would we go about revising them?  Since the psychological variables are instantiated in the brain, we propose to develop an algorithm that would take the brain data (e.g., MRI scans from subjects) and use it to revise the behavioral measures (e.g., questionnaires, task performances) from which the psychological variable is normally inferred.  Thus, it might turn out, for instance, that personality is best described not by the common "Big Five" personality dimensions (which are derived just from factor analyses of the words people commonly use to describe personality), but by some other set of factors that are most closely related to the underlying brain function.   Our project had two specific aims.  The first aim was to discover causal features in neuroimaging data (causal effects between brain regions estimated from fMRI) that could be used to predict individual differences in intelligence and personality of people.  We developed a new approach that allowed us to use relatively sparse fMRI data from an individual person and estimate a causal graph from such data, using a population-based prior.  While fMRI data have been used to predict individual differences in many studies by now, the use of causal features from the fMRI data is novel in our approach.   The second specific aim was more ambitious: to develop an algorithm that could literally let us discover new psychological variables and their neural causes.  Under the present NSF-funded project, we developed such an algorithm, and have just published the code for it [2].  The algorithm, causal feature learning (CFL), aggregates observations from one set of variables (the cause) and observations from a second set of variables (the effect) such that the causal relation between the two sets of variables is respected.  In our application, measurements from individual brain regions can be aggregated so that they have the tightest causal fit with their effects (e.g., the behaviors from which personality is usually inferred). CFL is an automated procedure that is entirely data-driven, and so it can discover causally meaningful macrovariables that humans would not have hypothesized. This algorithm can be applied to many different kinds of data, not only neuroscience data, and with the code now available from this NSF-funded project we hope that scientists in other disciplines will find it useful as well.   The project involved close collaboration between two faculty at Caltech and a team of undergraduate students and post-doctoral fellows.  The final code for CFL was pair programmed by two team members who are fellows of the Caltech Schmidt Academy for Software Engineering (https://sase.caltech.edu/).  The project was highly interdisciplinary and brought together philosophers, computer scientists, and neuroscientists.     Bibliography 1. Dubois, J., et al., Personality beyond taxonomy.
