<AbstractNarration>SES-1151449&lt;br/&gt;Andrew Papachristos&lt;br/&gt;Yale University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER:  Crime Victimization Patterns in American Cities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research explores the importance of social networks for individual victimization by analyzing the ways social networks and an individual's position within social networks influence the probability of being a victim of homicide or violent crime.  The project is based on a comparative case study of violent crime patterns in four U.S. cities: Chicago, Boston, Cincinnati, and San Francisco. Particular attention is directed towards understanding how the topology of social networks influences the spread of crime and violence within a population, maintaining that this diffusion of crime and violence can be more fully explained by the structure of social networks than by individual or neighborhood attributes.  To that end, the project is divided into two inter-related studies. The first phase focuses on individual networks at the core of inter-personal violence. By analyzing the social networks of individuals in these four cities it examines (a) how an individual's position within a social network influence his likelihood of being shot or the victim of violent crime, (b) whether or not certain types of networks are more conducive to the diffusion of violence than others, and (c) the extent to which certain network positions are more susceptible to victimization than others. The second phase focuses on how three specific ecological contexts (the city, the neighborhood, the gang) may foster or constrain particular types of social relationships.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to inform policy and violence prevention efforts by determining strategic points of intervention. Findings regarding the role of different types of networks and the precise patterns of violence might help identify individuals and groups most at risk of victimization.  Findings might be of interest to the law enforcement community, social service agencies, urban planners, policy makers, and the general public.</AbstractNarration>

The project also incorporated training in network science for violence prevention professionals, an evaluation component, and a training component for students. The project met or exceeded all of these objectives having (1) produced more than nine major publications in sociology, criminology, public health, and medical journals<sup>1-9</sup>&nbsp;and dozens of conference papers; (2) hosted annual training sessions in partnership with the&nbsp;<a href="https://nnscommunities.org/">National Network for Safe Communities</a>&nbsp;(NNSC) whose violence prevention efforts reach more than 50 cities; and (3) mentored more than ten graduate students.</p> <p class="subtleemphasis1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Four</span>&nbsp;central findings emerge from the project.&nbsp;<strong>First</strong>, the effects of crime and violence are more greatly concentrated within social networks than previously believed. Results consistently found that gunshot victimization is severely concentrated within small networks comprised of individuals with prior contact with the criminal justice system. In Chicago, for example, more than 70% of all gunshot victims over a six-year period could be located in a network comprised of less than 5% of the city&rsquo;s population.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;<strong>Second</strong>, the probability of one&rsquo;s own victimization is conditioned on the exposure to other victims in one&rsquo;s social network: having more associates who are victims increases one&rsquo;s own risk of victimization.<sup>3,8,9</sup>&nbsp;<strong>Third</strong>, exposure to gunshot victimization in one&rsquo;s network can lead to &ldquo;cascades&rdquo; of other gunshot injuries among connected individuals; importantly, the network models developed in this project can help to assess the precise timing of such shootings as well as individuals at greatest risk of victimization.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<strong>Fourth</strong>, the same networks that link individuals are also responsible for the spatial diffusion of crime across geographic neighborhoods; this suggests that past work on the spatial diffusion of crime might, in fact, be modeling unmeasured social networks as part of the diffusion mechanism.<sup>5,6</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p class="subtleemphasis1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project applied these methods to understand and evaluate the gun violence reduction efforts of NNSC&rsquo;s Violence Reduction Strategy (VRS), a collaborative community-police gun violence. VRS used a network-based approach that directed intervention, prevention, and service efforts towards those gangs/groups most immediately involved in gun violence. Our group-level evaluation leveraged the known network of gang conflict to determine the impact of VRS on disrupting crime and victimization pattern. Quasi-experimental results showed&nbsp;<strong>a 23% reduction</strong>&nbsp;in overall shooting behavior. An individual-level evaluation of the program currently under review finds that leveraging such networks for interventions might also lead to <strong>positive spill-ov</strong>er to untreated individuals: the program reduced victimization by 39% among the treatment group and a measurable spillover effect reduced victimization among peers by 28%.</p> <p class="subtleemphasis1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, in coordination with the NNSC, the PI conducted annual trainings of violence prevention specialists from schools, police departments, and social service agencies training them on the principles of network science and how to use it amplify their work. Each workshop was attended by approximately 25 people and participants were given free access to training materials, computer codes, and extensive pre- and post-training technical support by both the PI and the NNSC.
