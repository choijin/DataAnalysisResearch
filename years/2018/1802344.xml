<AbstractNarration>We know that status, or how much people defer to one another, and authority, or whether one individual gives orders to another, operate separately in organizations.  However, much scholarship combines these two social structures under the notion of hierarchy, making it difficult to detect how each might be unique. We also do not know how each structure may change over time. This project addresses these gaps by asking how organizational status and authority hierarchies co-evolve. The project investigates whether higher status is associated with exercising authority; whether exercising authority changes a person's relative status; and what the temporal patterns of these changes tell us about the mechanisms linking them. The project studies user actions from over 90,000 workers in 1700 organizations over nearly three years.  These findings help us understand the evolution of inequality at work, with a focus on how authority operates in smaller organizations, where two thirds of net new jobs in the United States are created.  In doing so it will provide policy guidance regarding how smaller workplaces can be organized to reduce social inequality.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project analyzes hierarchies in motion by asking how status and authority hierarchies co-evolve in small organizations.  To measure these hierarchies, the project uses uniquely detailed anonymized metadata from five billion user actions taken in a project-and-task-management software system.  These data make it possible to separate the exercise of authority from other actions for 90,000 individuals in 1700 organizations over nearly three years. These data are combined with three months of participant observation at one of these organizations and interviews with managers and employees at it and eight other organizations.  The project provides insights into expectation states theory as well as organizational theory regarding status, authority, hierarchy and their evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Clark Bernier has completed his dissertation, "The Dynamics of Post-Bureaucracy: How Status Shapes Authority in Contemporary Organizations," supported by a NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant.  During the funding period, he spent four months as a participant observer at a medium-sized technology company in San Francisco, studying the dynamics of authority in a context where official job roles often do not specify who is allowed to lead whom.  These data were supplemented with interviews collected using a novel interview protocol designed and fielded with support from this grant.  He also analyzed project management interaction data from several thousand other organizations to further develop and test ideas generated from the participant-observer and interview data.    Completed in Jan 2020, the dissertation is an important contribution to our understanding of contemporary organizations, of authority, and of status  and deference processes.  First, Bernier develops ideas about how people coordinate with one another when pre-existing role structures are too ambiguous to guide them.  He argues that absent clearly-defined roles, people in organizations negotiate their coordination in terms of the organization's dominant culture.  This highlights an often-overlooked aspect of organizational culture: how it sets the terms for coordination and authority.  He also provides a theoretical account of a specific cultural tool, "ownership," that is common in many technology organizations.    He also develops ideas about how individuals navigate changes in their own relative authority.  Using interaction data from a project management system, he traces the interaction histories of more than 5000 people as they first begin to give orders to their coworkers.  He finds, contrary to the idea that "leadership is taken, not given," that people tend to wait until others are already deferring to them before starting to give direct orders.  For some people, deference to them increases before they begin to give orders, but for all people, the deference offered by their coworkers plateaus once they begin to give orders.    He goes on to show that this relationship is more pronounced in organizations with more interdependent work.  Intensive interdependence---a deeper amount of coordination between individuals---makes it more important for people to coordinate their decisions and increases the costs of conflict. Both coordination and increases in the cost of conflict make people more sensitive to others' perceptions of them.  Dispersed interdependence---characterized by individuals coordinating with multiple coworkers---increases the ambiguity of whose judgments matter and gives people less insight into particular coworkers' perceptions, also increasing individuals' sensitivity to how they are perceived in general    This project also contributes a number of innovations in how data are collected and used in social science research.  First, the interview protocol uses an interactive digital dashboard developed by Bernier to give the interviews a longitudinal focus.  Many interviewees had occupied multiple roles in their organization over several years.  Details about work before their most recent role were more difficult to obtain in a standard interview due to the limits of memory and relevance.  The completeness of the interaction record in the dashboard, however, served as a focal object for conversations, regularly prompting stories that the interviewee had forgotten until seeing the dashboard.  Second, the attention to dynamics and temporal models throughout the project advance our understanding of how to study change more broadly.  Finally, Bernier's work demonstrates the feasibility of using fine-grained interaction data to explore ideas, like status, that are difficult to study over time and outside of the lab.
