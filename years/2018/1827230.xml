<AbstractNarration>Severe natural disasters carry great economic costs and threaten the health and well-being of many people.  Severe natural disasters during the past decade include unprecedented flooding, catastrophic hurricanes, and devastating wildfires.  The worst wildfire in California history struck Ventura and Santa Barbara counties in December 2017.  The Thomas Fire in those counties burned 282,000 acres, took two lives, and incinerated or damaged over one thousand structures. Because of its location to major population centers, over 100,000 residents were evacuated, many more than once.  In the aftermath of the fire, rain produced a massive mudslide cascading through the city of Montecito killing 23 people and destroying 115 homes.  These catastrophic events within a geographically concentrated region offer a unique opportunity to better understand how individuals and families cope with and recover from profound stress.  The focus of this project is to gain a richer understanding of how individuals and families manage post-disaster recovery and what predicts both positive and negative outcomes. By bringing together a multi-disciplinary team of computer scientists and disaster psychologists, new theories and computational methods will be evaluated to better understand human response to extreme events and to inform the development of future interventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using Smart Phone technology and online surveys over a six-month period of time, 100 parent/child pairs and 100 non-parent survivors in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties will be followed.  The surveys and the daily "check-ins" will provide critical data on how people cope with stress across time.  By cultivating a very rich set of data on the same individuals over time, it will be possible to discern patterns of recovery in ways that past research has not done.  Measuring outcomes on a daily basis will generate significant data and support the use of "big data" analysis methods (e.g., machine learning techniques) that can identify unique changes or shifts in functioning predicted by the guiding theoretical framework (self-regulation shift theory).  This project extends what is currently understood related to post-disaster recovery by targeting key coping mechanisms of change and highlighting possible critical targets for supportive interventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The impact of natural disasters such as the Wildfires that struck both Southern and Northern California during the fire season of 2017-2018, includes massive economic, housing, environmental and psychological impacts.  In 2018 alone, 8500 fires burned in California leaving a trail of destruction costing the state $102.6bn.  Many in the communities either directly or indirectly impacted by these fires struggled with employment challenges, health difficulties related to toxic smoke and other contaminants, and the emotional toll related to the disasters.  The current study focused on how people cope with these types of events across time.  The specific wildfires during 2017 and 2018 that we studied were: the Thomas Fire, the Holiday Fire, the Carr Fire, the Camp Fire, and the Woolsey Fire. We followed individuals over a 6 month period of time.  The overarching goal of this project was to get a better understanding of the post-disaster recovery process and determine important factors that might serve as catalysts for having more psychological difficulties. Specifically, this study tested a new theory of trauma/disaster adaptation utilizing advanced statistical techniques to inform the development of future interventions for disaster survivors.              A total of 148 wildfire survivors (majority female) with a mean age of 43 years took part in the initial assessment.  Among these 148 people, 82 of them completed a 6-week assessment, and 66 of them took the 6-month assessment. Participants completed the online surveys related to their emotional distress, their coping self-efficacy, wildfire exposure, previous traumatic stress experience, sleep quality, and posttraumatic growth.  In addition, they completed daily questions about their coping self-efficacy, their mood, wildfire distress, and posttraumatic growth.  Survivors were also asked to do a short video asking them "How are you doing today?".  Lastly, Participants could also choose to do a quick survey if they had a particularly hard day as well as provide a video.   Findings for the study showed that how people view their capability for managing recovery challenges was important in determining a critical threshold for survivors where their distress either stayed steady or showed a marked rapid increase.  This threshold was influenced by the amount of dissociation (feeling disconnected from one?s thoughts, feelings, memories, and surroundings).  In addition, sleep quality was also found to be an important factor in these threshold shifts.  This project extends what is currently understood related to post-disaster recovery by targeting key coping mechanisms related to psychological adjustment and highlights critical targets for interventions in the post wildfire disaster context.
