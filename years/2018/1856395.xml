<AbstractNarration>In this project, Dr. Travis Williams and his team at the University of Southern California are developing new bi-functional catalysts to speed up fuel production.  The new catalysts combine two capabilities that allow them to operate at mild temperatures and with high efficiency.  Specifically, the catalysts pair a transition metal with a color-containing molecule, a Lewis acid, or other species to produce high-value added chemical products.  In addition to these potentially commercializable efforts, Professor Travis is involved in several educational outreach activities; These include acting as a mentor for the student-hosted colloquia at USC and enabling the Boy Scouts to visit a biodiesel refinery at Catalina Island. The biodiesel plan converts used cooking oil obtained from a hard-to-manage waste streams to diesel fuel for water desalination.  The visits teach lessons of sustainability to hundreds of young people every summer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of NSF's Chemistry Division, Dr. Travis Williams at co-workers at the University of Southern California are developing new catalysts in which two modes of catalytic reactivity are combined in a single catalyst. The group is extending concepts in cooperative catalysis to advance technologies that form and cleave of carbon-hydrogen bonds.  The project combines the concept of quinoline photobasicity with very successful alcohol oxidation catalysts to realize a first-of-class temporary, photo-activated base within a late-metal (iridium) complex.  This bifunctional catalyst enables catalytic reactions where both an acid and base are needed in a single catalytic cycle. The project further deploys a nickel catalyst for carbon dioxide-to-methanol conversions. These initial efforts are then combined to generate a hybrid system in which two-electron hydride transfers to the iridium catalyst are enabled by the sequential one-electron redox events at the nickel catalyst.  In addition to these efforts, Dr. Williams supports an education programs involving a demonstration biodiesel refinery at Catalina Island. This facility works with neighboring youth summer camps to teach lessons of sustainability and waste reclamation to hundreds of young people every summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
