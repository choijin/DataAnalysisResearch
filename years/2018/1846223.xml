<AbstractNarration>This award supports a Workshop on Opportunities, Challenges, and Best Practices for Basic Plasma Science User Facilities to take place on May 20-21, 2019 at the University of Maryland, College Park, MD.  The Workshop will bring together representatives of the plasma physics and scientifically related communities to discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with establishing and operating university-based basic plasma science user facilities across the spectrum of plasma science sub-fields.  A variety of user facility management models will be considered, including facilities in a physically contiguous laboratory environment and centrally-coordinated but geographically distributed instrumentation networks, as well as both the open user facility and collaborative shared-use facility management models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop will distill what are considered to be the premiere intellectual opportunities and challenges in plasma physics that necessitate mid-scale or major user facilities. This will be a needed, important, and timely community discussion. The Workshop will aim to address the following questions:&lt;br/&gt;1) What are the science questions that require establishment and operation of plasma science user facilities and cannot be addressed on smaller scale single-PI experimental facilities?  Are there compelling plasma science questions of such value and interest to the global scientific community that may warrant establishment of new user facilities? If so, what are they?&lt;br/&gt;2) Under constrained resources, what are the upsides and the downsides of investing in the operation of user facilities in each of the relevant sub-fields?&lt;br/&gt;3) What may be the limiting factors, e.g., the size of the community of potential users or the flexibility and ease of operation, in establishing an experimental facility as a user facility?&lt;br/&gt;4) Are there particular challenges to transparent and effective operation of user facilities specific to plasma science or any of its sub-fields?  If so, what are they and what modes of operation may be used to overcome such challenges? &lt;br/&gt;5) What are the best practices for managing transparent and effective operation of mid-scale and major user facilities for plasma science?&lt;br/&gt;The workshop presentations will be webcast with the opportunity for online commentary and Q&amp;A with offsite participants. The Workshop will produce a publicly available report addressing the above questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Which scientific questions in plasma physics would be considered important enough to the broader science community to justify the significant expense of a major experimental facility?     In an effort to bring this question to the fore, the Physics Division of the National Science Foundation funded a Workshop (held May 20-21, 2019, at the University of Maryland, College Park), with supplementary funding from DoE (FES), AFOSR, and ONR, where a broad cross section of the plasma community identified a relatively small number of iconic basic plasma physics experiments of broad interest, discussed possible facilities models for their study, and assessed what works for best science outcomes.     Based on presentations and discussions during and after the Workshop among the organizers and participants, and with input from the community, the following research areas were deemed to be (i) fundamental and broadly scientifically compelling, (ii) engaging of multiple sub-disciplines in plasma physics as well as other physics areas, (iii) requiring a major facility, but not currently addressable by existing US facilities or facility arrangements, and (iv) conceptually and technically ready to proceed with specific, well-articulated experimental designs.     (1) Dense, high temperature quantum plasmas  The area promises discovery of altogether new material properties such as superconductivity at high temperature, as well as ultrahigh density effects on atomic structure and nuclear reactions, and will provide insight into the structure and evolution of planets and stars. This research will engage the plasma-centered high energy density physics and laboratory astrophysics communities, as well as communities from high pressure physics and geophysics, condensed matter physics, and atomic and nuclear structure.  Main facility needs: Co-location of very high energy long pulse (picosecond through nanosecond) laser with synchronized high intensity short pulse system(s).     (2) Ultra-intense laser and particle beam-plasma interactions into the QED regime  From generation of intense                                                   jets in intense laser-solid target interactions to, at higher laser intensity,    generation from ‘breaking the vacuum’, this area opens the door to quantum electrodynamics in the non-perturbative regime, coupled to collective plasma behavior. The needed facility would also be used to study a wealth of wave particle interactions of interest to astrophysics and to develop particle accelerators and x-ray sources for applications to other areas of physics. Beyond plasma physics, communities engaged would be from laboratory astrophysics, high energy physics, and accelerator physics.  Main facility needs: For the QED experiments, multi-petawatt short pulse laser system preferably co-located with GeV-scale electron accelerator. For some of the lab astrophysics and accelerator experiments, lasers of the scale of those in the LaserNetUS network may be adequate.     (3) Confined low density plasmas: non-neutral, matter-antimatter, and turbulent  Basic physics of confined plasmas, with application to space physics, astrophysics, spectroscopy of anti-atoms, and fundamentals of plasma physics itself. The communities attracted will be basic plasma and atomic physics, laboratory astrophysics, and space plasma physics.  Main facility needs: Here, a network of basic confinement devices in single- or few-PI labs, existing, upgraded, or new, would be best for spanning the parameters of interest and providing a broad infrastructure for basic confinement plasma physics. Some of these experiments, potentially on new devices, would focus on confined pair plasmas and studies of turbulent energy cascade and dissipation in selected regions of parameter space.
