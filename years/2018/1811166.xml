<AbstractNarration>As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.  This exploratory Pilot study project brings together a diverse set of partners that include the Watertown Children's Theatre (WCT) which is west of Boston, and, from Boston College a team of science educators, learning science researchers, and positive youth development experts. The goal is to design and develop a project for middle school-aged youth. The pilot project, which integrates hands-on science learning experiences, experiments, and field trips with the student-led production of short plays, will engage youth in expressing their beliefs, passions, and their own identities about STEM by examining how the intersection of skills and practices used in both domains (science and theatre) can enable them to learn about science concepts, principles and methods as well as to develop science-focused identities. Middle-school youth will be engaged in a three-week summer program where they will be led by science teachers, playwrights, and high school students to conduct hands-on investigations in science in conjunction with developing original, ten-minute plays around a specific scientific theme relevant to their life experience, for example, the potential impact on their lives of heavy metals in water and poor air quality.  After a science theme is chosen, the principal investigators will identify the big ideas that are important for youth to understand and be able to explain. Upon identification of the key science ideas, youth will then engage in pertinent science activities, visits to local sites, reading current news articles and then in identifying the local impacts and how the underlying science relates to those local impacts.  The youth will perform their ten-minute plays at the end of the summer program. Following this showcase event, they will engage in additional science learning experiences and also revise their productions throughout the academic year in preparation for a youth science festival, where their creations will be performed by professional adult actors as a part of the Cambridge Science Festival taking place in the spring. The broader impact of the work focuses on broadening participation in STEM, specifically, the engagement of youth from under-represented populations in the sciences, such as African-Americans, Latinxs, and women with partner Boston Public Schools.  The Pilot study will investigate the student learning and organizational dimensions of the model being developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Boston College researchers will study youth's sense of purpose and identity toward science, particularly how youth's identity discrepancy changes through participation in the project. The work places youth voice at the center of the creation of STEM-based theatre plays. The theoretical foundation of the work is grounded in part in the concept of "path to purpose."  The major research questions are: How do youth perceptions (interest, science anxiety, identity) toward science shift as they participate in the project?  What is the residual impact on parents (family members) and youth on their discussions about science, and how does participation in the project impact those discussions?  Research methods include surveys, interviews and observations.  The external evaluation study will focus on understanding project implementation and progress toward meeting the project goals, in particular, how well the initiative works to establish a model for the informal STEM learning field that the team and others can apply beyond the Pilot study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ About the project work  In this project we worked with middle-school aged youth over two years where we engaged them in expressing their beliefs, passions, and their own identity in regards to STEM by taking them on a personal journey designed to help them discover the relevance and relationship between art and STEM. In particular we examined how the intersection of the skills and practices used in both domains can enable youth to develop a science-focused identity.   Intellectural Merit: Why Blend Art and Science  In this project we examined how to support youth from under-represented populations in STEM to explore, engage, and utilize practices that cut across the fields of art and science.  In both science and art one is often engaged in a process of story telling whether that story is a narrative about an event or a story about what a particular data set means.  Further, a lot of the same process and practices that are utilized in science and engineering are also utilized in the creation of art as both fields draw upon the need to be creative, make a product or develop a process, and have a shareable product.    Science and art are both disciplines that are grounded in the idea of asking questions and creating shared notions of understanding. By using theatre as a vehicle for students to make connections between scientific concepts or phenomena and their own lives (Odegaard, 2003), theatre serves as a key way for students otherwise disengaged in or intimidated by the sciences to reimagine what it means for them to participate in and enjoy science.  Findings and Broader Impacts  In our work we learned that many middle school youth from low-income backgrounds have a limited view of what it really means to do art and have a limited idea of the creative and innovative nature of science.  Thus, by making these connections between the disciplines explicit by engage youth in using science and engineering practices to explore issues that were important to them such as water quality and environmental justice youth were able to come to understand and draw upon transdiciplinary practices that blended the practices described in the Next Generation Science Standards and the Performing Arts standards (see image 1).

We also found that it is important when one undertakes a STEAM curriculum or project it is critical that the the key intersection points be found early, we found that the practices served as the key connection point in this work, rather than compartmenlazing the two disciplines and making connections between art and science.  The connections between art and scientific practices need to be made explicit early and need to be driving framework around which instruction is built.
