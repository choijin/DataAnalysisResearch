<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve the literacy of blind people by enabling improved access to digital content. Currently blind people rely heavily on text-to-speech software and audiobooks to digest digital context. However, listening does not delivery the same sense of immediacy and literacy as reading braille. Also, audio technology and single line displays cannot deliver spatial information, e.g. mathematical equations, diagrams, and graphs, which are critical to literacy in science, technology, and math-related subjects.  Commercial electronic tactile displays exist, but due to the complexity and cost of the underlying technology, the devices are prohibitively expensive and are limited to a single line of braille. An affordable full-page tactile display delivering multiple lines of braille and tactile graphics would significantly improve blind people's access to digital technology. New technology can improve literacy rates, education outcomes and overall lifestyle of blind people. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The I-Corps project will assess the commercial viability of using a patented microfluidic technology for developing a full-page tactile display. Based on the technology, a microfluidic chip can reduce the complexity and cost of controlling a large number of densely-packed pneumatic actuators. A large array of thousands of individually controllable features is possible. The pneumatic actuators are integrated directly into the microfluidic chip using large-scale integration, making the device low-cost and highly scalable. Pressure-based actuation ensures that even tightly placed features will maintain relatively high force outputs. These are all essential features for building dense-array tactile displays, particularly ones that are low-cost and suitable for rendering braille and tactile graphics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Intellectual Merit Information literacy is a key skill in todayâ€™s digital environment. However, for blind computer users, lack of access to a refreshable display that can deliver on-demand content of a spatial nature such as graphs and charts has meant that they cannot participate fully in the data revolution.  The merit of this project lies in the fact that, through over 150 interviews with teachers of the visually impaired, and with suppliers of products and services, we have begun to quantify the size of the gap blind students face in entering STEM careers in part because of lack of appropriate access to scientific material.  We have also identified strategic partners who can help us bring a product to market that meets the needs of these students at every level from our manufacturing pipeline, to technology partners who might integrate our product to producers of content for text books and testing, to the teachers and students who anxiously await the outcome of our work.   Broader Impact Results from this project have the potential to facilitate a technological revolution for blind individuals, one that will, quite literally, place the information age at their fingertips. Access to an interactive tactile surface will make it possible for BVI individuals to gain meaningful employment in fields that require a level of literacy in manipulating non-textual data, thereby opening up new educational and employment opportunities in fields such as STEM, finance and data management.  Being able to access a much broader range of employment opportunities will ultimately contribute to the greater independence and well-being of people who are blind and visually impaired.
