<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide the capability to affordably and reliably connect underserved or unserved Americans to high speed internet using surface-mounted optical fiber, whether they live in a suburban neighborhood or in a remote rural area. The lack of high speed internet access is largely due to an inability to economically distribute broadband communications over the 'last mile' to businesses, homes, schools, and medical or government entities. An understanding of the installed durability of fiber using this technique will usher in new developments to deploy surface-mounted fiber nationwide. More accessible high-speed internet provides more information, opportunity, and economic productivity regardless of the locale. The digital divide between urban and rural Americans could be reduced or eliminated. Lower cost fiber deployments will make it easier to deploy new technologies, like 5G antennas and connected vehicles, and will shrink the cost to make cities smarter with ubiquitous sensors and cameras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will demonstrate that optical fibers under protective coatings bonded to paved surfaces can provide reliable high speed communications while subjected to weather and traffic. It will allow estimation of the predicted life time of surface mounted fiber on pavement. The testing will place asphalt samples in an environmental test chamber to evaluate competing fiberoptic installations and to identify the best performers for a series of follow-on field and lab tests. This will allow the future targeting of financial resources on the most promising material and profile combinations. Test samples will undergo wide ranging temperature and humidity cycles and repetitive tire impacts under controlled conditions. This testing will identify statistical life predictions in years after only a few months of actual test time. The longer the predicted life, the larger the customer pool, and the wider the potential market penetration. Understanding the predicted lifetime of a fiber installation will open the door to more early adopters, to more pilot program users, and eventually to fiberoptic installers and long term customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

However, providing connectivity to end users has challenged network installers. This challenge is known as the Last Mile Problem due to the cost, time, and difficulty of trenching communication cables underground, or hanging them aerially on utility poles.  TRAXyL has developed FiberTRAX, a new way to install fiber without cutting trenches into the ground. TRAXyLs method saves time and money and eliminates the risk of damage to other underground utilities.  The Innovation  TRAXyLs product, FiberTRAX, creates a communication line between two points by bonding a low-profile optical fiber cable directly onto pavement. The armored fiber cable is encased and protected in durable resins that cure within minutes. The finished communication line is about 3/16ths of an inch tall and about three inches wide and can be colored to blend into any surface.  FiberTRAX can bridge over cracks in the pavement and is resistant to snowplows. The fibers are easy to terminate or splice into existing fiber cables inside junction boxes and enclosures that are installed next to the pavement. The use cases for FiberTRAX are almost endless with any paved surface now supporting fiber connectivity.  Environmental / Traffic Testing  The purpose of this SBIR Phase 1 grant award from the National Science Foundation was to test samples of FiberTRAX to understand the longevity and durability of the product. TRAXyL first had a paving contractor pour an asphalt pad. Then TRAXyL team members cut the pad into numerous blocks of asphalt before installing FiberTRAX samples on the blocks.

TRAXyL contracted with a reputable, independent third-party assurance, inspection, product test, and certification company. The company conducted durability and accelerated life testing of the FiberTRAX samples in an environmental test chamber. A loaded wheel test fixture cycled back and forth over the samples as the temperature and humidity were cycled to extremes inside the chamber. At the conclusion of the testing, TRAXyL identified the best performing family of installation materials that compose a FiberTRAX line. This sample FiberTRAX family survived all tests without a single failure.  Conclusion  The testing demonstrated a useful life and impressive durability of FiberTRAX and its ability to survive traffic and weather. TRAXyL believes FiberTRAX will speed fiber deployment times while bringing down fiber deployment costs for optical network installations. FiberTRAX will enable greater connectivity for homes and businesses and will support 5G roll out, smart city innovations, and autonomous vehicle operations. TRAXyL plans to build commercial installation equipment with support from an SBIR Phase 2.
