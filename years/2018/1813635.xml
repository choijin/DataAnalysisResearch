<AbstractNarration>The accurate and efficient numerical simulation of complex mathematical models is critical to the design and analysis of contemporary engineering, scientific, and medical systems.  Mathematical models of drones, computer vision and graphics, medical imaging, fluid dynamics of plasmas, and gravitational waves are posed on curved spaces, which possess geometric properties that have to be respected by the numerical simulations in order to obtain accurate, robust, and reliable predictions.  The two main motivating applications for this project are to plasma physics and gravitational waves.  Plasmas are highly ionized gases; theyarise in nuclear fusion devices, propulsion systems for space exploration, and during the formation of galaxies.  Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime that were predicted by Einstein, and they arise from the collision of massive astrophysical bodies like black holes and neutron stars.  The construction of numerical methods for such problems enables scientists to design more stable and efficient nuclear fusion systems, and to more accurately determine the astrophysical events that correspond to gravitational waves that are detected.  In addition, the investigator develops optimization and sensitivity analysis techniques that improve the efficiency of optimization algorithms that underlie deep learning and other machine learning techniques in data science.  Graduate students participate in the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project combines theoretical and computational tools arising from discrete Dirac mechanics and geometry, variational integrators, the relationship between symmetric spaces and the generalized polar decomposition, and embeddings of noncanonical Hamiltonian systems as well as nonvariational equations and their adjoints into degenerate Lagrangian systems.  This provides a systematic method for constructing and analyzing geometric structure-preserving discretizations of degenerate noncanonical Hamiltonian systems, nonvariational equations and their adjoints, and problems that evolve on symmetric spaces.  The resulting methods have implications for plasma physics, which is described by noncanonical Hamiltonian systems, as well as general relativity, which is a degenerate higher-order gauge field theory on a symmetric space.  In addition, adjoint equations arise in many important applications, including optimal control, optimal design, optimal estimation, uncertainty quantification, and sensitivity analysis.  A deeper understanding of the hidden geometric structure underlying an arbitrary system of differential equations and their associated adjoint equations, and variational discretizations that respect that geometric structure, would have profound implications on the broad range of analytical and numerical techniques that rely critically on the solution of adjoint equations.  Graduate students participate in the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
