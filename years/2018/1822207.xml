<AbstractNarration>Most public health systems around the world are investing into initiatives promoting and supporting the convergence of medicine and technology for improving the healthcare delivery systems. These efforts rely on integrating sensing, logistics, computing, actuation and communication functionalities in everyday practices. The University of Arizona will work with Arizona State University, University of Southern California, University of Connecticut, and Southern Illinois University to form a new IUCRC for Networked Embedded, Smart and Trusted Things (NESTT). The vision of NESTT is to contribute to the development of an equitable, safe and secure connected world. NESTT will achieve this vision by focusing on creating holistic IoT solutions, integrating technology disciplines with expertise in medicine, law, business, and humanities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to make these transformative approaches and technologies a reality, machine learning and artificial intelligence are some of the emerging tools for processing the massive amounts of IoT data and information that will shift the medical decision making processes from simple binary modes to complex "nuanced" and "near real-time" models. UofA NESTT site will co-organized workshops to design industry specifications and prototype health logistics appliances, wearable sensor systems, ambient intelligence and A.I. data algorithms that can be integrated effectively into the regulatory framework and processes of the healthcare delivery system by enabling the IoT advanced technology solutions planned at the other NESTT nodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is trend in digitalization of medicine and healthcare, especially with the emergence of the Internet of Things which will disrupt the healthcare industry in this decade. UA NESTT site will investigate this digital transformation through the entire value chain, from discovery to bedside. Health platforms designed to address unmet needs and improve medical access to underserved large populations will provide useful solutions to the global healthcare challenges. UA NESTT academic, clinical and business partners will contribute their expertise to provide contextualization and standardization of information to offer real-world insights in digital transformation of the healthcare sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The agenda and documentation of activities for the NESTT IUCRC planning meetings will be made available on UofA's website for the Center for Applied Nanobioscience and Medicine (https://phoenixmed.arizona.edu/anbm ). It will be maintained until the establishment of NESTT, and then merged with the NESTT site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Major Project Outcomes  The goal of this project was to organize a workshop to bring together researchers from academia and companies from a broad range of industries for the purpose to establishing a new IUCRC named NESTT, "Networked Embedded, Smart and Trusted Things".  The specific objectives of this project comprised:  to recruit companies from a wide spectrum of industries that can benefit from IoT,  to construct an efficient organization,  to establish well defined set of procedures for operating NESTT, and  to produce an industry-ranked set of proposals.   A proposal to establish NESTT was then drafted for future submission to NSF at the conclusion of the planning phase. The vision of NESTT is to contribute to the creation of an equitable, safe and secure connected world. The techno- logical, societal and business challenges outlined above will be addressed through the inclusion of faculty from the schools of engineering, business, law and humanities. The work in NESST will be focused along three major themes:  Mobile, Edge and Cloud Computing  Industrial, Medical, Retail IoT  Transportation and Infrastructure   The objective of the IUCRC based on the outcome of the planning grant has been to establish a multi-university, multi-disciplinary, collaborative effort of five universities to undertake industry relevant research and development of Internet of Things with safety as the primary theme and overarching driving force. The five universities are: Arizona State University (ASU), University of Arizona (UA), University of Southern California (USC), Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIUC) and University of Connecticut (UConn).     What Outcomes were produced?   A major product of this planning grant consisted of organizing and delivering a Workshop with all the participants recruited from a large pool of academic and industry partners. This was accomplished by performing the following tasks:   Creation of a full marketing campaign including:  Design of the event flyer Working with IT group to establish an interactive website; Online registrations; Event newsletter;    Organizing the workshop  Negotiating with hotels for optimal pricing Preparing workshop literature including presentations, posters, registration materials, arranging for food and beverages, preparing literature for out-of-town visitors, and organizing transportation for some individuals.    Launching of the Workshop  1 &frac12; day planning grant meeting held on May 16-17, 2019, Phoenix, AZ @ Hilton Garden Inn    Specific Objectives  One of the main for our institution was to assess how digital technologies can enable broad applications in healthcare.   Significant Results   Key Outcomes: Attendees         Industry Total    37 companies (50 representatives)      ASU    12 companies (15   representatives)      Southern Illinois   University Carbondale    12 companies (18   representatives)      University of   Arizona    2 companies (5   representatives)      University of   Connecticut    1 company (1   representative)      University of   Southern California    10 companies (11   representatives)      Site Directors    5      Faculty    21      Students    10      Site Staff    2      NSF    3         Summary Evaluation of NSF PM  This is one of the best planning grant meetings he has seen; backing of University, support team, site and center leadership, etc. Center is positioned well for success; researchers are smart and good, but must be pushed on, and they will do well at that point. He liked what he heard from this center and meeting.   Our institution also achieved its special objectives with a broader interest by technology companies for the digital health and healthcare applications. Since the workshop, our team has engaged with multiple Pharma companies but also technology developers.        What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?  Since NESTT initiative, our team at UofA has initiated multiple initiatives related to digital health. For example, Zenhausern is co-organizing a Panel Discussion on "Immersive Medicine" which has been part of the 2020 Annual Symposium of the Fitzpatrick Institute for Photonics at Duke University. This "virtual" event brought scientists and executives from Microsoft Research, Amazon Web Services, Novartis and academic partners in A.I/ML technologies.  UofA and Duke University have also been selected for running a session at the BIO 2020 Conference which is the largest conference for the Pharma Industry. The scientific session was entitled: The Immersive Medicine of the Future:  At the convergence of smart sensors, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. This event was also co-sponsored by the Flinn Foundation from Arizona and the City of Phoenix. The feedback has been very positive and likely to be pursued again next year.     How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?  Most of our dissemination has been produced through the above workshops but also through website information and other standard internal channels of communication between our departments and other academic units.     What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals? We are waiting for NSF program restructuring.
