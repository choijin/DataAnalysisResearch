<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Madison Lectures in Fourier Analysis" that will be held May 13-17, 2019 at University of Wisconsin-Madison.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially on the topics of generalized Brascamp-Lieb inequalities, Fourier restriction problems, singular and fractional Radon transforms, and sparse bounds.   A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers not funded by NSF, an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.   The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.   More information will be made available at:  http://www.math.wisc.edu/seeger2019/?q=node/8&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The week-long conference brought together leading researchers from around the world to discuss recent developments at the cutting edge of harmonic analysis.  The conference also provided an opportunity for junior researchers to present their work in a poster session and facilitated a number of long distance collaborations by our participants.  Intellectual Merit:  The scientific focus of the conference was threefold: Brascamp-Lieb inequalities (an important class of estimates which include, as a special case, Youngâ€™s inequality), singular and fractional Radon transforms (a topic which has grown well beyond its initial applications in medical imaging), and sparse bounds (a generalization of classical Lebesgue space estimates).  The conference featured 22 one-hour lectures by world-renowned senior researchers and provided an opportunity for another 11 rising stars in the field to present their recent work in a poster session.  Slides from most of the speakers' talks have been made publicly available on the web.  In an hour-long open problem session, eight researchers discussed some of the most important open questions in the field.   Broader Impacts:  The chief broader impact of the conference was the dissemination of knowledge, through the talks themselves, the posters, and the public availability of speakers' slides.  The conference provided training and networking opportunities for junior researchers who were able to interact with senior mathematicians, to present their work, and to pursue collaborations with harmonic analysts from around the world.
