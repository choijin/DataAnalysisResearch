<AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative project involving the American Association of Physics Teachers (Award DUE-1431638), Brigham Young University (Award DUE-1431454), the University of Maryland at College Park (Award DUE-1431681), and the University of Colorado at Boulder (Award DUE-1431779).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most new college and university STEM faculty members begin their first teaching assignments with little or no experience with methods of effective pedagogy. Consequently, both they and their students are often frustrated when the students do not seem to learn what the faculty members think they are teaching. To address this problem in physics and astronomy, the American Association of Physics Teachers, the American Astronomical Society, and the American Physical Society propose to continue a successful series of Physics and Astronomy Faculty Workshops focusing on effective pedagogy, building on what has been learned during the previous series of workshops. During the course of the new five-year project, the workshops will work with about 900 four-year college and university faculty members (about 50% of the new tenure-track hires in physics and astronomy in the United States), who collectively teach more than 100,000 students each year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three new components will be added to the program of workshops:  (1) a permanent set of Experienced Faculty Workshops aimed at more senior faculty members; (2) a series of virtual Faculty Learning Communities (FLCs), which will provide coaching and feedback for the workshop participants as they implement interactive-engagement teaching methods; and (3) a research program focusing on the most effective ways to implement the FLCs and developing a more systematic understanding of the workshops themselves. Items (2) and (3) will directly address the "implementation dip" that occurs for faculty considering the use of new pedagogy. The dip has been documented in almost all STEM faculty workshops. Although the current physics and astronomy workshops have been successful in developing knowledge about effective pedagogy and the evidence for its effectiveness, and in inspiring the participants to implement those pedagogies, the evaluations also show that the faculty members are not always persistent in implementing those pedagogies. The new project is designed to enhance the implementation of what the participants learn in the workshops and to add to the knowledge base of what constitutes effective pedagogical professional development for physics and astronomy faculty. The same methods should be broadly applicable to faculty members in other STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by four NSF programs:&lt;br/&gt;* Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE), Division of Undergraduate Education, Directorate for Education and Human Resources;&lt;br/&gt;* Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), Division of Human Resource Development, Directorate for Education and Human Resources;&lt;br/&gt;* Education and Interdisciplinary Research (EIR), Division of Physics, Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences; and&lt;br/&gt;* Education and Special Programs (ESP), Division of Astronomical Sciences, Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the last year of our project we only ran one New Faculty Workshop as the COVID pandemic forced us to cancel our spring 2020 workshop. We made great strides in participant, organizer, and presenter logistics and communications at our last workshop in October of 2019. We also used the additional time in the spring of 2020 to contemplate what a well supported and run online New Faculty Workshop would look like and we executed those plans in the fall of 2020.  The overall New Faculty Workshop project has met or exceeded all of our initial goals for this last grant. We have researched the impact of post-workshop engagement pieces along with the structure of our in-person workshops. We have streamlined our logistical process and have better prepared our guest speakers to serve the needs of our participants. We have served approximately 2500 participants over the 20+ years of this project.  This sub-project has focused on the logistical needs of putting together a successful New Faculty Workshop. We have refined our timelines, our communication process, and ensured that all the right voices are present in both our planning and our reviews of the work.   The team is well suited for the next major grant (recently submitted) that is looking at supporting the whole faculty member, recognizing the great affordances of post-workshop engagement, and embracing multiple modalities, including fully online workshops.
