<AbstractNarration>RUI: Enabling Rational Design of Smart Interfaces Incorporating Metal-Organic Coordinated Assemblies (CHE-1508244)&lt;br/&gt;Mary E. Anderson, Hope College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Public Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline, porous materials with extremely high surface areas that exhibit great potential for chemical sensing, reaction catalysis, and gas storage.  For many of these applications, the incorporation of MOF thin films grown directly on supporting materials is required.  To effectively fabricate devices with smart interfaces that harness the properties of these MOF materials, it is crucial to understand the fundamentals of film formation.  This research systematically investigates thin film MOF growth and develops design rules for low-energy processing techniques on a variety of technologically-relevant substrates.  These design rules, for tailoring film structure and composition, are utilized 1) to tune the optical, electrical, and mechanical properties of the film and 2) to develop fabrication techniques that integrate MOF thin films into cutting-edge technologies for chemical sensing and harvesting solar energy.  Undergraduate students are actively engaged in all aspects of the research, providing them with experience in the interdisciplinary areas of materials chemistry, surface science, and modern analytical instrumentation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;With this award the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanchemistry Program of the NSF Chemistry Division supports the research of Dr. Anderson at Hope College to investigate the formation of surface-anchored metal-organic frameworks (SurMOF) for integration directly into device architectures for chemical sensing and photonic applications.  Film formation is studied for different systems with incrementally increasing complexity (i.e. HKUST-1, MOF-14, MOF-5, IRMOF-3).  Effects of deposition variables such as temperature, time, and deposition methods (i.e. layer-by-layer, co-deposition, seeded deposition) are investigated.  Studies are extended to understand deposition on different substrates of technological relevance, such as oxide materials (i.e. SiO2, ITO, Al2O3) and flexible polymeric materials.  Rational design rules for growth initiation as well as inhibition are determined.  Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) and surface-specific spectroscopies (i.e. ellipsometry, FT-IR) are used to characterize SurMOF film growth to determine the effect of deposition conditions with particular focus on foundational layers forming at the substrate-film interface.  Mechanical, electrical, and optical properties of films are evaluated using advanced SPM modes (i.e. quantitative nanomechanical mapping, conductive probe), electrochemistry (i.e. cyclic voltammetry, chronocoulometry), and spectroelectrochemical characterization. By following developed design rules, understanding material properties, and employing membrane-templating techniques, this research integrates SurMOF films as smart interfaces into test-bed structures fabricated for chemical sensing and solar energy harvesting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award enabled research in the Anderson lab from June 2015 through May 2019 supporting students and research at Hope College and Furman University.  Associate Professor of Chemistry Mary Elizabeth Anderson engages with undergraduate research students to investigate the bottom-up solution-phase synthesis of nanomaterials.  This research examines both surface-anchored and free-standing nanomaterials to gain fundamental understanding about their growth, which is necessary to tune material properties and to integrate the material into hierarchical structures.  In the area of surface science, three papers were completed regarding the film formation and material properties of surface-anchored metal-organic frameworks (surMOFs), specifically three related systems containing the copper-paddlewheel structural unit were quantitatively analyzed.  MOF materials are nanoporous and crystalline resulting in high-surface area and low density, which are especially attractive properties for gas storage, separation, catalysis, and sensing.  surMOFs allow us to integrate the versatility and potential of the MOF directly into devices or architectures for these applications.   First reported was the development of co-deposition and seeded-growth methods to control HKUST-1 surMOF film morphology. By varying temperature, time, and deposition method, design rules were established to tailor surMOFs with a desired thickness, roughness, and grain size.   Next, a systematic study was undertaken wherein the effect of ammonia gas was compared for three different variations of HKUST-1. The size of these structural variations span from millimeter crystals (bulk powders) to micrometer grains (drop-cast films) and nanometer crystallites (SurMOFs), revealing what effects are inherent to the MOF system or fabrication method as opposed to being substrate-induced or size-dependent. Additionally, how paddlewheel adsorbates alter the ammonia interaction with the HKUST-1 framework was studied, looking specifically at alterations in morphology and crystal structure.   After investigating the film formation of the iconic HKUST-1, two related systems with the same type of metal-organic node, the copper-paddlewheel were investigated.  The film formation of these related MOFs was found to differ from that of HKUST-1. Electrochemical tests using a ferrocene redox probe confirmed the porosity of these films.  Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy evaluated the electronic transport properties.  Additionally, a fourth paper was published regarding the use of carboxyl-carboranes to control the work function of germanium.  This research was an entry point for the aforementioned electrochemical characterization of the surMOF films and for the investigation of surMOFs deposited on germanium substrates.  In the area of materials chemistry, two papers were published regarding the Anderson group's development of a rapid and low energy synthesis for thermoelectric nanoparticles, a class of material capable of capturing waste heat and converting it into usable electricity.  Tetrahedrite (Cu12Sb4S13) was synthesized and its thermoelectric performance was evaluated, finding figure of merit values comparable or greater than those obtained for the same compounds fabricated using time and energy intensive conventional methods.  Tetrahedrite has been widely studied as a p-type thermoelectric, but for manufacturing and technical reasons, it is desirable in commercial thermoelectric generators to have n- and p-type legs of the same base composition.  Recently reported by this group was the first n-type behavior in tetrahedrite, with the observation found for Fe-doped compositions.  Within this grant period, research associated with this funding has been disseminated by 5 published peer-reviewed papers (plus 1 submitted manuscript), 35 external regional and national presentations (by PI and students), 5 senior research theses, and ~55 on-campus presentations.  Twenty unique undergraduate research students have been engaged in this research. Thirteen of them are student authors on the 6 manuscripts mentioned above with 5 of them being on multiple publications.  Thirteen have graduated with 8 in chemistry or material science graduate school, 1 in dental school, 1 in medical school, 1 working as an EMT while applying for medical school, 1 in a chemical engineering industry position, and 1 obtaining a masters of urban education while teaching science to an under-served student population.   To build support networks and to participate in outreach activities, the PI and students were engaged with WISE (Women In Science and Engineering), SWE (Society of Women in Engineering), and FACES (Fostering a Community of Excellence in Science).  Additionally, nine students involved in this research were highly engaged as leaders in TA and PPL (peer partnership learning) opportunities assisting their younger peers to mature in their scientific abilities.  Beyond the research lab, ~30 additional undergraduates were impacted by research implemented in the teaching laboratory with students reproducing findings and undertaking preliminary experiments to test out potential new experimental pathways.
