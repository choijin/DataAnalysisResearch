<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in an international symposium at Rice University in Houston, Texas, held June 25-29, 2018, entitled "A Symposium on Optimal Stopping."  The symposium is designed both to bring participants to the frontiers of research in the mathematical theory of optimal stopping as well as to stimulate further research. The event aims to encourage young U.S. researchers to pursue research in optimal stopping and offers the opportunity to more senior researchers to consolidate their experiences and to form fresh research collaborations. In addition, the meeting will develop future avenues for research that should benefit researchers working in the fields of: mathematical and numerical analysis (partial differential equations, partial integro-differential equations, boundary value problems, free boundary problems); financial and insurance mathematics (particularly exotic option pricing in semimartingale markets and credit risk); statistics (particularly sequential testing, quickest detection, and optimal prediction); and physics (particularly two-phase problems including obstacle problems and problems of melting and solidification).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium encompasses six themes: 1) The connection between optimal stopping problems and free-boundary problems in mathematical physics; 2) Methods of solution for optimal stopping problems, in particular nonlinear methods; 3) Applications of optimal stopping to American type options, credit risk, and game theory; 4) Applications of optimal stopping to sequential testing, quickest detection, regularity problems, detection of hidden targets, and optimal prediction; 5) Nonlinear and constrained optimal stopping; and 6) Connections of optimal stopping to stochastic control and to statistical inference for stochastic processes. Keynote speakers include S. Asmussen (Aarhus University), N.H. Bingham (Imperial College London), S. Jacka (University of Warwick), I. Karatzas (Columbia University), G. Peskir (University of Manchester), P. Salminen (Abo Akademi), D. Siegmund (Stanford University), and N. Touzi (Ecole Polytechnique). More information is available on the conference webpage: www.optimalstopping.com.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The symposium was designed both to bring participants to the frontiers of research in optimal stopping as well as to stimulate further research in the theory and applications of optimal stopping. The symposium has played a leading role in encouraging many young American researchers to pursue research in optimal stopping and has offered the opportunity to more senior researchers to consolidate their experiences and to form fresh research collaborations.  Intellectual Merit:  The symposium has acted as a point of reference from which many research collaborations and directions have emerged. Approximately twenty original research articles motivated by the conference will appear as part of a special issue entitled "In Memoriam: Larry Shepp," to appear as a special issue of Stochastic Processes and their Applications in 2020, with Professor Philip Ernst as Editor-in-Chief and Professor Goran Peskir, Professor L.C.G. Rogers, and Professor Frederi Viens as co-Editors. These contributions, as well as other contributions directly motivated by the symposium, largely address the themes below.  Optimal stopping and free boundary problems: The connection between optimal stopping problems and free-boundary problems in mathematical physics (the obstacle problem and the Stefan problem describing the process of melting and solidification) has raised many challenging questions to analysts when the underlying Markov process has jumps (such as Levy processes). In this case one needs to deal with PIDEs (instead of PDEs) and very little is known about regularity of the fundamental solution. On the other hand, the methods relying upon local-time calculus allow an approach to the problem via nonlinear integral equations for the optimal boundary so that existence and uniqueness results can still be proved. This line of research is very promising and, in a large part due to collaboration developed at the symposium, is now being further developed.  Quickest Detection: Recent applications involve a quickest detection of arbitrage. A significant progress in understanding the problem is achieved for Markov processes with jumps and the exchange of facts and ideas in this direction during the symposium has proved most stimulating and useful. Recent developments in sequential testing and quickest detection, when the signal-to-noise ratio is non-constant, lead to fully two-dimensional optimal stopping problems. Although the general theory of optimal stopping covers examples of this kind, there are many specific questions that need to be resolved in every specific example.  This has raised many interesting questions on solving specific optimal stopping problems in higher dimensions.  Nonlinear Optimal Stopping: Imagine an investor who owns a stock which he wishes to sell so as to maximize his return. Accounting for the additional feature of the investor wishing to minimize his risk upon selling, identifying the return with the expectation of the stock price and the risk with the variance of the stock price (in line with the mean-variance analysis of Markowitz), the quadratic nonlinearity of the variance then moves the resulting optimal stopping problem outside the scope of the standard optimal stopping theory. Consequently the results and methods of the standard/linear optimal stopping theory are not directly applicable in this new/nonlinear setting. The purpose of recent research driven by the symposium has been to develop a new methodology for solving nonlinear optimal stopping problems of this kind.   Broader Impacts:  The meeting marked the first large-scale international conference in optimal stopping in the United States. The meeting was attended by a large number of young graduate students who we hope will become the future leading experts in the field. Attendees from underrepresented groups in STEM were actively recruited and were well represented at the symposium. The meeting has given the rare opportunity for young scientists to rediscover a classical theme from a modern perspective from which they can springboard into one of several new directions of popular research in optimal stopping and in applied probability in general.
