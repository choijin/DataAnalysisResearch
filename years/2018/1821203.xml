<AbstractNarration>This proposal supports student travel to attend the 2018 IEEE Communications and Network Security Symposium to be held in Beijing, China in May 2018. CNS is a primer venue for communications and networking researchers to present new research results, focusing on communications and network security. This travel grant will enable career development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen graduate students. Attending conferences is an important component of graduate school education for our society's future computer security researchers. Students have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class computer security researchers, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
