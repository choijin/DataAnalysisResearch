<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to provide travel support for students to attend the International Conference on Smart Computing, sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), to be held June 18-19, 2018 in Hong Kong. The conference includes papers on many technologies that are fundamental to the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) program and the smart systems aspect of the Partnership For Innovation: Broadening Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) program, including smart and connected communities, pervasive computing, and social computing. This project will fund 10-15 students to attend the conference.  A selection committee will be established and will make travel award decisions.  Selection criteria include the impact of attendance on future student research, support for women and unrepresented minorities, as well as participation from institutions that are frequently unable to attend these conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will organize a PhD Forum for students and will provide important networking opportunities for the students. The attendance and participation in conference activities including the PhD Forum and student sessions will have strong impact on the education of the next generation of pervasive computing and cyber-physical system experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
