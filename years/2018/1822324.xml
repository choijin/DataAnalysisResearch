<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund Oceanographic Instrumentation for the Research Vessel Savannah, a 92-foot coastal research vessel, owned and operated by Skidaway Institute of Oceanography as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. With this proposal, Skidaway provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Oceanographic Instrumentation:&lt;br/&gt;Vertical Profiling CTD/Fluorometer Upgrades $24,347&lt;br/&gt;Network and DAS Upgrades $6,813&lt;br/&gt;TSG Upgrade $12,812&lt;br/&gt;Deck Incubators $5,513&lt;br/&gt;      $49,485&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Numerous technological enhancements to the R/V Savannah were funded under this NSF Oceanographic Instrumentation award.  The R/V Savannah is a 92-foot UNOLS coastal/local class research vessel operated by the University of Georgia, Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO).  The vessel was put into operation in the fall of 2001.  The R/V Savannah has proven to be a capable platform for research and education, with most operations conducted in the estuarine, coastal and shelf waters of the South Atlantic Bight (between NE Florida and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina).  The ship has also served projects in Chesapeake Bay, Gulf of Mexico, across the Gulf Stream and into the western Sargasso Sea, and as far south as Curacao in the Southeast Caribbean.   This award funded equipment to improve scientific capabilities and infrastructure on the R/V Savannah.  The equipment funded were grouped into four projects, (1) fluorometer upgrades to the CTD vertical profiler, (2) network/server upgrades, (3) thermosalinograph upgrade, and (4) construction of new deck incubators.  All projects were completed as proposed and are currently operational for all ship users.  The ships CTD is deployed on most cruises to meet science objectives.  The fluorometer upgrades now permit vertical profiles to greater deeper depths and have improved data quality compared to the older models.  Network upgrades included a new server to operate the ship?s primary Data Acquisition System (DAS) for shipboard data integration via the NOAA SCS program.  Data logged on this server includes variables related to atmospheric and sea surface conditions, as well as ship motion and position.  Surface water data is continuously collected from the vessels thermosalinograph (TSG).  This instrument serves as a primary DAS used by the science party.  The TSG upgrade replaced a larger model SBE 21 that occupied a large footprint on the wet lab bench used by science.  The new, smaller TSG model SBE 45 enabled the relocation to a machinery space opening up the valuable bench space in the wet lab.  Lastly, the new deck incubators now provide sufficient tanks to conduct certain common biological experiments on the R/V Savannah.  These incubators have been added to the institute?s shared-use equipment pool making them available to other UNOLS vessels in the Academic Research Fleet.  Shared-use instrumentation, much of which has been acquired through support from the NSF Oceanographic Instrumentation program, has played an important role in serving the research and education objectives of ship users throughout the country.
