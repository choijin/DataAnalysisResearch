<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop the process to 3D print continuous fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composite (CMC) components for turbine and combustion engines, hypersonic vehicles, and satellites. CMCs are currently a $2.5b market that is expected to triple over the next decade. The ability to produce CMCs with 3D printing will enable superior designs in current applications, as well as enabling their use in a greater number of components that are currently limited by the higher density and lower temperature capabilities of superalloys such as Inconel and Invar. Developing this manufacturing process will enable more basic materials research by serving as a lower cost testbed for new CMC compositions since a mold is not required and turnaround times are much faster. This will also allow engineers to develop more optimized systems with a faster design cycle. This capability will result in efficiency increases in turbine and combustion engines for substantial improvements in fuel efficiency, reducing costs and environmental impact. Finally, the ability to 3D print CMCs will vastly improve geometric complexity of high temperature components, which will enable the next generation of hypersonic vehicles, supporting national defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is in establishing a novel manufacturing process for CMCs based on 3D printing. Melt infiltration is a low cost method to produce CMCs, which starts with a polymer matrix composite that is pyrolyzed, and then infiltrated with a molten metal. The matrix is usually a phenolic thermoset, but high temperature thermoplastics have recently been proven viable for simple coupons. This project will use 5-axis continuous fiber reinforced high temperature thermoplastic composites as green bodies. Since thermoplastics melt, support materials will be implemented during the pyrolysis step, which are effective in retaining part geometry. Additionally, a novel process of growing a boron nitride interphase layer on the fibers after pyrolysis instead of prior to forming the polymer composite will be implemented since tight corners during printing might damage an interphase layer. Finally, 3D printing with larger bend radius silicon carbide fibers instead of carbon fibers will be attempted. This project will demonstrate the effectiveness of this interphase with improved flexural strength and toughness, and the ability to form geometrically complex CMCs that are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to make with other methods. These two milestones will enable a path to begin developing parts for customers in commercial applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

With NSF approval, the work plan for this Stage I grant shifted from development of a ceramic post-process for weight reduction in engine structures to a more immediately marketable focus on expanding the capability and control of our printing system in 3-dimensional space. This allows us to produce far more intricate components, and, by extension, replace far more components currently machined out of metal with lighter carbon fiber alternatives. This expansion consisted of developing the software and hardware systems that allowed for printing in all directions within a part while collecting and processing a wide variety of process variables to ensure reliability and quality in the end products. Prior to the grant period, Mantis Composites developed and built a 5-axis machine capable of 3D printing carbon fiber, but two axes were locked out to simplify early printing efforts. Development of the capability into 5-axes necessitated completion of the following key tasks:  Continued development of software that could create, display, and then stream fiber paths and associated process parameters to our 5-axis machine. Tuning of additional and existing processing parameters to accommodate printing at any angle. Iteration on printer mechanics to enable smoother and more consistent 5-axis motion. Integration of support material printing to enable more complex end shapes. Continued development of input material to ensure ideal muti-axis printing properties while introducing flight-capable material systems. Implementation of data collection and storage systems necessary to produce components capable of flight certification.   All of these steps were accomplished and demonstrated thereafter using a component that required 5-axis printing with designs provided by an aerospace customer.   Development of this capability enables significant weight reduction on intricate components currently only possible to produce using machined metals, allowing for fuel use and performance improvements across the aerospace market. A proposed Stage II includes testing and process improvements necessary to produce flight-capable components using the software and hardware developed during the performance period of this proposal.
