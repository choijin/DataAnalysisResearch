<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "NEAM 2018: The 3rd Northeastern Analysis Meeting" that will be held October 19-21, 2018 at SUNY New Paltz. The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of harmonic analysis and Partial Differential equations.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.   The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.   More information will be made available at: https://www.newpaltz.edu/neam2018/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     NEAM   2018, the Third Northeastern Analysis Meeting, was an Analysis conference   held in the Fall of 2018 at SUNY New Paltz, which drew an audience of 89   participants.  Thanks   to the 16 plenary talks, all attendees were exposed to interesting concepts   and methods from other fields of Mathematics, inspiring them in their own   research and giving rise to cross-disciplinary collaborations.  In addition, the 43 parallel session talks gave participants the occasion to   more thoroughly immerse themselves into their own fields of study.  Junior mathematicians constituted 61% of the participants and gave 68% of the   conference talks. Thanks to the substantial presence of senior faculty,   junior participants had an opportunity to interact with world-renowned   experts in various branches of Analysis and to approach them in person, so as   to benefit from their presence and from their guidance.  Many participants came from smaller regional institutions from the   northeastern United States. Due to its accessibility, NEAM was the first   large conference of its kind that they attended. Being scheduled in the fall,   NEAM is especially helpful to participants who are currently on the job   market, who can take advantage of this opportunity to polish the presentation   of their results and popularize their research findings.  New Paltz undergraduate students took advantage of this unique opportunity to   learn about the broad mathematical topics discussed at the conference. The   poster session in particular allowed students to fully immerse themselves in   a mathematical environment and to make contacts that may help them in their   future careers. Some faculty members from other fields also attended.  The conference reached a wide variety of target audience groups, spanning   from undergraduate, masters, and doctoral students, to postdocs, adjoint   faculty, and assistant professors, to tenured faculty members, and even some   retired mathematicians.  This New Paltz edition of NEAM led to sustained discussions among all   participants and gave mathematicians from disparate branches of Analysis an   occasion to get together and exchange ideas. The third edition of NEAM   consolidated the mission of the conference to bring together all researchers   interested in Mathematical Analysis, from the Northeastern US and beyond, and   to serve their professional and scientific needs.
