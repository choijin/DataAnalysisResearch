<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this PFI project is to increase the economic competitiveness of the United States in the carbon nanotube thermophone market, specifically beating other countries to market in the active noise control arena. Ventilation noise in hospitals is detrimental to patient recovery, in schools is detrimental to student learning outcomes, and in communities is detrimental to restful sleep leading to increased stress. This project develops a noise control product concept to significantly improve the welfare of the American people in these areas. In addition to the beachhead market of building ventilation, the technology has applications in the automotive and heavy equipment industries, and in military stealth applications, potentially protecting the lives of the American warfighter. This project will enhance a partnership between academia and industry, potentially launching a new start-up. This PFI-TT project will engage one graduate student and one post-graduate student in active entrepreneurship while supporting participation of women in science, engineering, and entrepreneurship. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop a prototype for a coaxial active noise cancelation device in ventilation ducts using carbon nanotube (CNT) thermophones. The technology provides an active silencer solution that allows the occupant to customize sound in real time, a unique market feature, with as much as an 80% size and weight reduction while improving air handler efficiency over current passive silencer technologies. The coaxial loudspeaker technology is enabled through carbon nanotechnology to create a compact speaker with no moving parts. The product is a drop-in replacement to existing duct systems and can be installed in line. Excessive noise from air handlers is detrimental in schools, theaters, hospitals, and in communities near industrial facilities. This technology aims to alleviate these noise burdens in an economical and safe way. The prototype developed under this program will be used to prove the technology to industry facility managers, value-added-resellers, and building engineers, who are historically risk-averse in adopting new technology. In particular, showing that the technology can be scaled to large ducts (6" in diameter or more), that the device does not increase system backpressure, and that it has significant lifespan with limited maintenance will be key outcomes from this work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This PFI-TT project developed a minimum viable product and de-risked technology for a coaxial thermophone used for active noise control in HVAC ducts. Technical outcomes included showing effectiveness (&gt;20 dB) of active noise control of plane waves in a 6" diameter HVAC duct using a full-scale coaxial thermophone. It also showed limited effectiveness of the prototype to actively cancel more complex acoustic waves, on the order of 3-5 dB of cancellation. Finally, the large-scale prototype, the largest of its kind ever built using carbon nanotube thin films, showed robustness through advanced lifecycle durability testing amounting to 16 days of continuous run time with no performance degradation.&nbsp;</p> <p>Broader impacts included education of a graduate student, internship opportunities, creating a minimum viable product, and launching a start-up company to pursue commercialization of the technology. The graduate student was educated in noise and vibration. She was afforded an internship, through the NSF INTERN program, at a small company where she was able to learn about submitting and executing SBIR and STTR grants. The mininum viable product that was developed on this project, and the data from it, helped to launch a start-up company, NanoSound Inc. NanoSound secured an initial investment of $50,000 and two partnership contracts with potential business partners as a direct result of this work. They are now working on transitioning this HVAC technology to industrial blowers, thanks in part, to the outcomes of the PFI-TT grant. The company has successfully submitted an SBIR pitch to NSF and expects to submit the full SBIR proposal application in the near future.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/02/2021<br>      Modified by: Andrew&nbsp;R&nbsp;Barnard</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1827486/1827486_10560545_1614691197168_PFI_TestBench--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1827486/1827486_10560545_1614691197168_PFI_TestBench--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Prototype test bench"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1827486/1827486_10560545_1614691197168_PFI_TestBench--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Prototype test bench"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This is the minimum viable product developed over the course of the PFI-TT grant.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephania Vaglica</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Andrew&nbsp;R&nbsp;Barnard</div> <div class="imageTitle">Prototype test bench</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1827486/1827486_10560545_1614691293827_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1827486/1827486_10560545_1614691293827_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Schematic of MVP system"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1827486/1827486_10560545_1614691293827_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Schematic of MVP system"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This is a schematic of the coaxial thermophone for active noise cancellation in the MVP design.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephania Vaglica</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Andrew&nbsp;R&nbsp;Barnard</div> <div class="imageTitle">Schematic of MVP system</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1827486/1827486_10560545_1614691399816_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1827486/1827486_10560545_1614691399816_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Demonstration of active noise cancellation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1827486/1827486_10560545_1614691399816_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Demonstration of active noise cancellation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This is a demonstration, at full scale, of the effectiveness of cancelling plane waves in a duct with a coaxial thermophone.
