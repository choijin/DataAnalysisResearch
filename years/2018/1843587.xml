<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will provide new opportunities for purifying waters that cannot be economically treated using existing commercial membranes.  Increased market growth to include recycle and re-use of contaminated water that is currently slated for disposal or long term environmentally risky storage will increase water availability for industry and agriculture and reduce environmental impact from these same users.  More available water, especially in higher demand locations, will lead to higher production and lower costs for industrial and agriculture based consumers, leading to job growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to validate a new method of thin film composite membrane fabrication using new materials strategies to produce game changing anti-fouling and chlorine resistant reverse osmosis membranes.  Current market dominating polyamide thin film composite (TFC) membranes are inherently susceptible to fouling and degraded by chlorine disinfectants used to mitigate bio-fouling, which is the greatest challenge to membrane operation.  The established TFC production technique provides very thin active layers on the order of 100?s of nanometers but is limited to polyamides.  The proposed technology will produce TFCs with alternative polymers.  Polymers that are chlorine resistant and inherently non-fouling are targeted for use but the unmet challenge has been the opportunity to manufacture them with membrane thicknesses down to the 100?s of nm thickness regime necessary to challenge the flux properties of current commercial membranes.  Combining this new fabrication technology and new polymers is the technological breakthrough needed to develop innovative membranes.  The project will synthesize a target polymer composition, develop the formulation and fabrication parameters within the new process and produce TFC samples for testing.  TFC samples will undergo comparative testing of fouling and chlorine resistance, water flux and salt rejection in a variety of simulated test waters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Chemically Resistant Reverse Osmosis Membranes NALA Systems, Inc.     Introduction              NALA’s goal is to produce a new class of reverse osmosis membranes based on sulfonated polysulfones as the active layer that are chemically resistant to oxidizing agents such as chlorinated disinfectants and cleaning fluids.     Intellectual Merit              Key outcomes of the NSF Phase I project are summarized below.        Established in-house capability to synthesize the new sulfonated polysulfone ionic membrane candidate materials &ndash; both linear and crosslinkable. Scaled to 100’s of grams in-house to enable pilot scale coating trials.      Designed and constructed cross-flow transport instrumentation and lab-scale coating apparatus so that key NALA thin film composite membranes could be produced and transport properties could be measured in-house.      Established relationships among the chemical structures of the candidate class of polymer materials, water permeabilities and salt rejections against benchmark commercial polyamides (both seawater and brackish water membrane controls) at one pressure (27.58 bar, 400 psi) and one salt concentration (2000 ppm NaCl, 0.034 molar). NALA membranes made with our pre-sulfonated monomers that are directly polymerized in the sulfonated form have comparable water permeabilities and salt rejections to the seawater benchmark polyamide material. NALA post-sulfonated polymers have water permeabilities similar to the benchmark brackish water control with salt rejections only about 1% lower under these conditions. Such a comparison is unprecedented. It opens the possibility for a set of highly ionic water purification membranes that separate impurities by Donnan exclusion in addition to the established size sieving mechanism of the benchmark materials.       Established a lab-scale coating method for applying very thin NALA active layers onto a commercial ultrafiltration membrane comprised of a porous non-sulfonated polysulfone. Thus, it may be possible to afford new membranes with only small volumes of the new polymers per square meter of membrane.      Water fluxes of NALA thin film composites, even made in our lab-scale coating process, are in the range of seawater polyamide control membranes at 2000 ppm NaCl and 27.58 bar applied pressure. They are lower than brackish water controls under the same conditions.      Our first pilot coating trial with a contract manufacturer suggests that NALA’s process for batch lab-scale samples will be translatable to continuous coating methods.       Broader Impacts              It is clear that population growth and urbanization will contribute to a predicted scarcity of clean potable water for billions of people in the near future. Reverse osmosis is the leading candidate method to alleviate this scarcity. NALA’s new ionic reverse osmosis membranes are superior to current materials in that they are chemically resistant against oxidizing (e.g., chlorine) disinfectants and cleaning fluids.
