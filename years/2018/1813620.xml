<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to support a workshop that will focus on getting community input on long-term deployments of Resident-Autonomous Undersea vehicles. (R-AUVs). The workshop will look at the technical challenges and potential benefits of deploying a highly capable, next-generation R-AUV on the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Cabled Array at Axial Seamount on the Juan de Fuca Ridge off Washington-Oregon. The workshop will serve as a forum for the open exploration of operational concepts and application spaces uniquely suited to R-AUV systems, with a goal of defining a roadmap leading to the deployment of such systems for a broad range of users. The proposed 2.5 day workshop will be held at the University of Washington in April 2018.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Our Workshop was held in Seattle at the University of Washington with an expected attendance of about 50 people across the spectrum of academia, government, and industry scientists and engineers interested in the near-future use of Autonomous Undersea Vehicles to conduct scientific nquries and surveillence both on earth and eventually within other oceans in the solar system.     In fact 98 people attended the workshop and particpated in four different sub-groups: 1) Mid-Ocean Ridge Research, 2) Methane Hydrate venting at the bottom of the sea, 3) Polar-under ice- and off-planet research and exploration of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and 4) Industry and military surveillence of seafloor installations such as in the petroleum extraction industry, the offshore power industry, and electro-optical cables and pipelines.     The overall conclusions were that rapid progress was being made with a variety of increasingly sophisticated platforms that could eventually be deployed for long term projects utilizing man-made or natural energy sources within the sea.  A variety of forms of real-time, two-way communications about system condition, data collected, and control of the next steps in the deployment execution based on the data received, were discussed and mapped out.      A number of participants formed subsequent working connections that had not been in existence prior to the workshop. Eight students participated in the workshop.  By all accounts the workshop was considered to be a success.  The 86-page workshop report was published and is avaiable at this link:   http://www.apl.uw.edu/research/downloads/publications/tr_1901.pdf  The cover of the report is uploaded with this report.
