<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division supports the research of Professor Daniel Seidel. Professor Seidel is a member of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.  This project aims to advance the field of asymmetric catalysis on a fundamental level through exploration of conceptually new and underdeveloped methods of substrate activation. Asymmetric catalysis is the development of small molecules that can achieve high selectivity in chemical reactions - producing a specific product in high prurity. Chiral molecules have a right-handed and left-handed version.  These two mirror image molecules are described as enantiomers. A major goal of this resesarch is the development of reactions that produce enantiomerically enriched products through intervention of chiral ion pairs.  Novel Br√∏nsted acids and hydrogen bond donor catalysts are used to facilitate unprecedented enantioselective processes and address challenging problems. Multifunctional catalysts are being used as a means to achieve enzyme-like catalysis under mild reaction conditions.  The research provides an excellent training ground for undergraduate and graduate students and preparing them for future careers in industry or academia. There is a strong commitment to engage a diverse group of students carrying out this research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to prepare complex chiral molecules in the most cost-effective way possible is directly dependent on the availability of sustainable synthetic methodologies.  The new synthetic methods that are emerging from this work provide enhanced access to biologically significant, chiral nitrogen containing compounds such as amines, amides, lactams, amino acids and indole containing substances that, in turn, help advance the chemical industry.  Furthermore, this project provides an ideal training ground to prepare the next generation of researchers in the chemical sciences. Students working on this project gain expertise in modern synthetic methods and laboratory techniques while being exposed to an intellectually stimulating and challenging environment that will prepare them for future careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to advance the field of asymmetric catalysis through the exploration of conceptually new and underdeveloped methods of substrate activation.  Several classes of reactions were developed that produce enantiomerically enriched products through intervention of chiral ion pairs.  We further developed a class of chiral Br&oslash;nsted acid catalysts in which a thiourea moiety, acting as an anion recognition site, is connected via a chiral linker to a carboxylic acid.  Upon substrate protonation, the conjugate base (carboxylate anion) binds to the anion receptor, resulting in the formation of a chiral substrate-catalyst ion pair.  An extensive analysis encompassing experimental and computational studies revealed the mode of operation of the conjugate-base-stabilized Br&oslash;nsted acids.  A network of noncovalent interactions including hydrogen bonding, &pi;&minus;&pi; interactions, and halogen bonding is responsible for controlling enantioselectivity.  In other work, we developed the first catalytic enantioselective reactions of enolizable anhydrides with a range of simple imines to provide valuable lactam products in highly enantioenriched form, a process that does not generate any byproducts.  This formal [4+2] cycloaddition reaction represents an unusual case of asymmetric ion pairing catalysis in which a neutral catalyst (containing thiourea and amide moieties) simultaneously interacts with an anionic nucleophile and a cationic electrophile.  In another project involving ion pairing, we developed reductive condensations of alcohols with aldehydes/ketones to generate ethers.  These reactions are efficiently catalyzed by a readily accessible thiourea organocatalyst which operates in combination with HCl and a silane-based reducing reagent.  The reaction exhibits broad functional group tolerance and competing reductive homocoupling of the carbonyl component is effectively suppressed.  Other achievements resulting from this project include the development of a method for the catalytic enantioselective preparation of isoindolinones, enabling an enantioselective synthesis of the natural product mariline A.  This project provided valuable training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.       Last Modified: 09/10/2019       Submitted by: Daniel Seidel]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
