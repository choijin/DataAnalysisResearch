<AbstractNarration>Plant synthetic biology is becoming a field of great economic importance in a broad variety of industries, including medical, energy, and agriculture. The rapidly advancing field requires the expertise of scientists, chemical and biological engineers, and mathematicians to develop accurate modeling systems, optimize high value chemical production, and ultimately manufacture essential feedstock and precursors on an industrial scale in a manner which is both sustainable and economically viable. Presented by the Society of Biological Engineering (SBE), the 2nd International Conference on Plant Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology brings together scientists and engineers from universities, industry and government working in all aspects of Plant Synthetic Biology, Plant Bioengineering and Plant Biotechnology. The conference focuses on exhibiting advances made in scientific knowledge regarding plant genomes, revolutionary gene editing tools and techniques, as well as mathematical models that advance understanding and the prediction of the engineered biological processes. The conference gathers scientists and engineers to provide an atmosphere and venue amenable to discussing various principles and approaches and to motivate new research into barriers that limit the development of plant synthetic biology. The scientific presentations are from a diverse group of researchers and there will be active participation by graduate and undergraduate researchers. The conference is inclusive of female scientists and those that are members of underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2nd International Conference on Plant Synthetic Biology, Bioengineering, and Biotechnology Conference is the first instance of its kind, designed to bring together researchers from academia and industry to a highly-interactive and engaging meeting, enabling professionals and young researchers to hear from one another through organized talks, panel and question and answer discussions and poster sessions. The topics of this conference are expected to have a high impact across several fields in biology, as well as applications to a myriad of various industries. The conference will focus on exhibiting advances made in scientific knowledge regarding plant genomes, revolutionary gene editing tools and techniques, as well as mathematical models that advance understanding and the prediction of the engineered biological processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
