<AbstractNarration>The goal of FLIP (Diversifying Future Leadership in the Professoriate), an NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilot, is to address the broadening participation challenge of increasing the diversity of the future leadership in the professoriate in computing at research universities as a way to achieve diversity across the field. According to the 2016 CRA Taulbee Survey, only 4.3% of the tenure-track faculty at PhD-granting universities are from underrepresented minorities. This challenge is important to address because diverse faculty contributes to academia in the following critical ways: serve as excellent role models for a diverse study body, bring diverse backgrounds to the student programs and policies developed by the department, and bring diverse perspectives to the research projects and programs. Further, the focus is on research universities, because in practice, key national leadership roles, such as serving on national committees that impact thefield of computing, often come from research universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shared purpose and broad vision of the FLIP launch pilot is to increase faculty diversity in computing at research universities by increasing the diversity of PhD graduates from the top producers of computing faculty. The focus is on four underrepresented groups in computing: African Americans; Hispanics; Native Americans and indigenous peoples; and Persons with Disabilities. The long-term goal is to pursue this vision through strategic partnerships with those institutions that are the top producers of computing faculty and organizations that focus on diverse students in STEM, as well as partnerships that collectively adopt proven strategies for recruiting, graduating, and preparing a diverse set of doctoral students for academic careers. The purpose of the pilot is to establish a unified approach across the different partners that will build upon proven strategies to develop novel practices for increasing the diversity of the PhD graduates from key institutions, thereby increasing the faculty diversity in computing at research universities. For the pilot, FLIP will focus on recruitment and admissions and professional development for current PhD students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Organizational Strategy &amp; Community Building  The FLIP Alliance made substantive progress in refining its organizational strategy and community building efforts over the course of the project. The monthly conference calls with the FLIP PIs, Advocates, and computer science graduate admissions staff has served as a vehicle for continuity and furthering the building of this community. The agendas and conference call minutes were provided to all participants prior to conference calls through Google drive where there is also a mutual sharing of institutional documents and information to inform conference call  discussions but also in email communications between calls. Both the conference calls and email communications reflect a considerable level of engagement and focus that also is indicative of increasing trust, and strengthening of the Alliance as a community. Project continuity is maintained within the various institutions and the FLIP Alliance even though there is frequent turnover in the faculty and staff Advocates.  Recruitment &amp; Admissions Data  Over the course of the project, Alliance members have developed efficient strategies for sharing and discussing data related to recruiting and admitting their students. In the spirit of a genuine interest in increasing representation from the targeted groups, all participating institutions signed a confidentiality agreement to facilitate candid conversations where members can work to address barriers to recruitment and admission without judgement or concerns about privacy. FLIP Advocates made significant progress facilitating modifications in recruitment and admissions practices at their institutions. These efforts resulted in a transparent assessment of the existing processes and structures currently in place across the Alliance. In 2020, the community of FLIP Advocates identified the issue with the GRE in the admission process and collaborated efficiently to develop and disseminate a statement to be shared by the Alliance. Following a robust discussion regarding the GRE in the admissions process, the Alliance is issuing a statement that states that FLIP institutions are committed to taking all steps to ensure that students without GRE scores are not disadvantaged. Potential pinch points were identified and Alliance members strategized potential solutions to address these issues.  Career Development &amp; Aspirations  Eighty-nine percent of the respondents to a survey strongly agreed/agreed that their graduate program provided opportunities that prepared them for careers post-graduation.
