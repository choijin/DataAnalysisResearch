<AbstractNarration>The motion of electrons and protons inside molecules when they are subjected to strong forces is a fundamental issue in molecular and chemical science. Understanding and controlling this internal motion is important: For example, proton motion does much of the work in organic chemistry, energy storage, and biomedicine, therefore controlling proton motion with external forces may be useful in future implementations of chemical synthesis or quantum computing; or even for splitting water to make hydrogen fuel. This NSF program will explore new ways to create and control the motion of protons and electrons inside molecules using external laser fields in the laboratory. The laser field strengths must be large enough to overcome the internal fields that hold molecules together, on the order of volts per Angstrom; and they must be able to pulse on and off in well under a hundredth of a trillionth of a second as well, to keep up with the natural pace of movement inside molecules. Research using these laser tools will test basic models of molecular transformations, such as conjectures that there are special atomic geometries where molecules become especially susceptible to control by outside forces. The molecules to be tested are water and acetylene, both proton-rich building-blocks for many chemical processes. This research will also provide training for students and postdocs, and thus prepare them to contribute technical talents that are needed to support the nation's economy and security in the coming century. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intramolecular motion is one of the core issues in molecular physics, and the key to many important physical and chemical processes such as chemical synthesis and energy production. This activity explores how ultrafast laser-induced strong field interactions can change the motion of atoms in molecules and therefore alter the path of chemical change. These paths are complicated in part because the motion of every atom in a molecule generally affects every other atom. The result is that motion takes place in a high-dimensional space: three internal dimensions for a simple three-atom molecule like water; but three additional dimensions for every additional atom in the molecule. The high-dimensional topology of this space is difficult to visualize and highly non-intuitive. It leads to special locations in this molecular landscape -- seams or surfaces structures embedded in the higher dimensional space -- where the interatomic bonds can rearrange without any energy penalty. Here the objective is to understand how high-dimensional features in coupled atomic motion can be altered by strong laser fields to enhance, suppress, or modify atomic rearrangement, rapid ionization, multiple ionization, and even Coulomb explosions. This tests a hypothesis that external strong fields coupled to atomic motion can control and redirect these natural processes. Water and acetylene have been selected for study because their internal motion is dominated by hydrogen atoms, which move more rapidly because of the low mass of their proton nuclei. This enhances the effects under study. The investigations use infrared, ultraviolet, and vacuum ultraviolet coherent laser fields to both excite and control these molecular systems. Results of the excitation and the control are measured by recording the velocities of all of the molecular constituents directly, either by allowing the molecules to fall apart or by forcing them apart with a laser-produced Coulomb explosion. Understanding molecular behavior in external fields has relevance for many practical applications areas, including catalysis, proton medical therapy and photo-initiated hydrogenase chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
