<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for participants to attend the Workshop on Hadronic Parity Non-Conservation, which will be hosted by the Kavili Institute for Theoretical Physics and is being organized through the NSF Theory Hub "Network for Neutrinos, Nuclear Astrophysics, and Symmetries".  The purpose of the workshop is to convene experts in the field to plan a path forward that can test a new model based on a large number of degrees of freedom and potentially lead to a deeper understanding of hadronic parity non-conservation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Workshop on Hadronic Parity Nonconservation (HPNC) focused on recent developments in our understanding of hadronic parity nonconservation that impact US plans for future experiments, including those using the cold neutron beams available at the SNS and NIST.   The workshop was hosted by the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, March 15-16, 2018, and was cosponsored by the NSF Hub N3AS (Network for Neutrinos, Nuclear Astrophysics).  Attendance was by invitation: twenty three members of the community active in HPNC attended.  Hadronic systems involve strong and electromagnetic interactions.  The effects of the much weaker weak interaction can be probed in nuclear systems because of the parity violation the weak interaction induces.  The pseudoscalar observables induced by HPNC are still very difficult to isolate, as the effects are typically one part in 10,000,000.  The workshop covered meson-exchange models of HPNC, pionless effective field theory approaches and the five Danilov amplitudes, recent uses of large Nc QCD to establish a hierarchy among these amplitudes, global analyses of existing experiments, the suppression of the long-distance pion-exchange contribution to HPNC, the NPDGamma and NDTGamma experiments, n+4He, the possibility of studying HPNC in deuteron photodisintegration, three-nucleon effects, neutron spin rotation, the potential use of lattice QCD to determine the strength of isotensor HPNC, quantum Monte Carlo applications to HPNC, anapole moments, modern shell model applications to HPNC, and future opportunities.  Workshop discussions focused on the need to revisit many of the calculations found in the literature, to repair a number of inconsistencies that likely distort current analyses.  It also focused on the need for a formalism that can be related to low-energy EFT treatments while also allowing one to  do conventional full-space calculations of the sort that represent the state-of-the-art for few-body systems.  (The contact interactions used in EFT are troublesome, if used directly.)  There was clearly more to do than the two-day workshop format allowed.  The group plans to meet again in November, 2019, at the INT, to begin the program described above.   NSF support provided through this grant allowed us to provide local support to those participants requesting it, and partial travel support for a few participants requiring this help.
