<AbstractNarration>This award will support student travel to attend the second edition of a workshop focused on abusive language in online environments. The workshop, the 2018 Abusive Language Online Conference, is co-located with the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, October 31 - November 4, 2018, in Brussels, Belgium. The Workshop will develop students' skills and knowledge to use multidisciplinary approaches and computational methods for research on abusive language in contexts such as social media platforms. Students will learn about policies related to these behaviors and ways to develop tools and processes to allow relevant parties to respond quickly to abusive language online. Students will engage with researchers to develop ways to categorize and classify content and ways to evaluate guidelines and standards. Activities will include panel discussions and plenary talks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This travel grant supports student travel to attend the second and the third editions of abusive language online workshop, co-located with EMNLP 2018 in Belgium and ACL 2019 in Italy respectively. Abusive behavior such as cyberbullying, hate speech, and scapegoating can poison the social climates within online communities. The last few years have seen a surge in abusive online behavior resulting in governments, social media platforms, and individuals struggling to deal with the consequences. While governance demands the ability to respond quickly and at scale, we do not yet have effective human or technical processes that can address this need. Students attending the workshop have the opportunity to discuss inter-disciplinary research with world-class researchers from diverse backgrounds, and establish connections and mentoring relationships that will help their research career developments.  The travel grant has supported six students to travel to the second edition of abusive language online workshop and five students to travel to the third edition of abusive language online workshop. Among the eleven supported students, six are female students.  In addition, for each edition of the workshop, we compiled and submitted a report to the main conference, describing participations, discussions and other results of the workshop. The reports are publicly accessible on the ACL Anthology website.                       Last Modified: 11/18/2020       Submitted by: Ruihong Huang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
