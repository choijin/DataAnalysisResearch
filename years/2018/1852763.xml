<AbstractNarration>This Noyce Capacity Building project will contribute to the national interest by creating a viable and attractive pathway for STEM students at Neumann University to become certified as teachers.  The project aims to supply additional highly qualified STEM teachers to meet workforce needs and to develop a partnership with local high-need schools to ensure that the revised curriculum prepares STEM teachers who have the appropriate knowledge, skills, competencies, and mentorship to excel in the classroom. The project also seeks to deepen partnerships between STEM and education faculty through the curriculum revision process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will revise an existing degree program leading to a Biology degree with certification in Biology and/or General Science teaching so that it can be completed in four years rather than five.  Prior work to revise the Mathematics Education curriculum at the institution will be leveraged to inform the revisions.  Activities will include the development of two online general education courses, which will be offered in summer to reduce schedule crowding and allow time for early teaching experiences during the academic year. The project will provide professional development opportunities for STEM and education faculty, establish a formal partnership with a local high-need school, and develop recruiting strategies involving school visits, a showcase during the annual Science Olympiad, and targeted redirection of existing majors. A mentoring program and induction support activities for new teachers will also be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

There were three signed partnership agreements with high needs schools: Bonner-Prendergast High School procured August 2018, Chichester High school procured December 2018 and the School District of Philadelphia procured December 2018.  However, this discussion confirmed the details of the activities and meeting the objectives and brought to light additional information on topics including partnering with local and nearby school systems.  These relations go far beyond a letter of agreement to an important partnership with significant support of student teachers from NU as they gain experience in the classroom.  Other areas where NU demonstrated positive outcomes of the grant activities include enhanced advisor training, participation in several meetings and conferences on a range of relevant topics including diversity and inclusion, additional cross-disciplinary colloquia and events, and an extensive literature review on engaging and supporting students preparing for and transitioning into secondary school educators in STEM. NU will continue with the marketing strategies put in place and continue with faculty development and collaboration through Neumann colloquiums, ?Meet and Greets.? and biology and mathematics seminars.  Overall, NU appears to have made very good use of the opportunity provided by the Noyce capacity building grant under challenging circumstances and will continue to benefit from the experience and insights gained as they continue to recruit and support STEM students for possible post-graduation careers as secondary school STEM educators.
