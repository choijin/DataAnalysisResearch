<AbstractNarration>This workshop will have three foci - pedagogy, student success and grant writing. This workshop will assist Historically Black College and University (HBCU) faculty in improving their research productivity by engaging in increased grant writing while continuing their mission to be effective advisors and educators.  Increasing the number of underrepresented groups earning computer and information science and engineering degrees is critical to the nation's economic competitiveness.  Minority-serving colleges and universities produce a disproportionate share of bachelor's degree graduates in computer and information science and engineering: HBCUs are only 3 percent of all 4-year colleges and universities, but awarded 11.4 percent of bachelor's degrees in computer and information science to African Americans. HBCU faculty are extremely important to the success of HBCU students in computer and information science.  The investigators will leverage the UNCF (United Negro College Fund) Innovation Summit to introduce workshop attendees to current and emerging topics that can create more competitive proposal topics (and writing), impact pedagogy to improve student retention and generate the interest of institutional leaders who typically attend the annual event.  A pre-and-post survey will be used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF award facilitated the convening of 24 engineering and computer and information science faculty from 15 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in a professional development workshop. The major goals for the workshop were to assist the HBCU engineering and computer and information science faculty with:     Pedagogy that improves student learning in engineering and computer and information science;  Sharing innovative strategies to improve the retention and graduation of engineering and computer and information science students; and  Providing tools and strategies for developing grant proposals and effectively competing in national grant solicitations.      In addition, the expected outcomes were:     Outline a STEM-focused faculty research agenda.  Submission of a STEM-focused competitive national grant proposal.  Demonstrated collaborations among other HBCUs.       APLU partnered with Dr. Lesia Crumpton-Young, Vice President of Research and Institutional Advancement at Tennessee State University to host the 2019 HBCU Engineering and Computer Science Faculty Workshop in Nashville, TN on May 22-24, 2019.  HP Inc. sponsored two Chromebooks that were raffled off during the workshop.     Workshop participants learned about:  Digital and Adaptive Learning: understanding on adaptive learning technologies; how other are using these learning technologies; consider the barriers and identify potential resources (internal and external) that could assist in improving the teaching and learning experience; and identify potential courseware for introducing engineering and computer and information science courses.    The Emergence of The Internet of Everything (IoE) Smart Connected Devices and EduGadgets for Real-Time On-Demand Transformation of Education.   Demystifying the NSF Funding Process Part 1? understanding the program solicitation, interacting with NSF, proposal writing or submission, the review process or being notified about the reviews; review the Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide (PAPPG) when submitting a proposal to NSF.  Grant Writing: a discussion on academic careers, research and scholarly expectations and planning, ideas for compelling research projects that align with the grand challenges, the art of publishing, getting funded, marketing and branding strategies, professional reputation and collaborative efforts, and the importance of professional development. Expanding HBCU Impact in Engineering and Computer and Information Science Entrepreneurship and Commercialization.      Significant Results:     At the workshop five teams were formed as a result of various targeted activities, networking, and group discussions. Each team presented a potential research project for an NSF submission.  See below for more details.     Smart Technology-enabled nutrient lifecycle and supply chain management optimization. This proposal is designed to advance progress in multi-scale modeling for hybrid biological-industrial type systems, engineer next-generation smart technology tailored to farm-to-market food management applications, promote interdisciplinary training of students in smart technology related to systems, food science, data analytics, and stimulate workforce adoption of integrated smart technology. To determine the most optimal way to deliver resources (sunlight and fertilizer, etc.) through a supply chain to schools, stores, etc. to areas that are experiencing dessert droughts.       Generating 3D models for sustainable infrastructure using drones to improve safety and efficiency maintenance of infrastructures. This project is designed to Increase worker safety, the reduction of maintenance on facilities, and better reporting systems for financial forecasting.      Innovative techniques to access algae blooms as consequences on surface water. This project is designed to increase the accuracy of detection using cutting edge technology that includes aerial and aquatic drones to enable forecasting to detect toxic algae blooms.      Increase the underrepresented population to participate in interdisciplinary design competitions. This three-year project is desinged to use computer aided design simulations and coding software to engage undergraduate students in interdisciplinary competitions.      New methods for the develoment of high efficiency solar cells that integrates undergraduate research experiences.
