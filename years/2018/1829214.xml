<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund Oceanographic Instrumentation on R/V Atlantis, a 274? general purpose research vessel, and R/V Armstrong, a new 238? multidisciplinary vessel. Both are operated by WHOI as part of the U.S. Academic Fleet which is scheduled by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS). Both are owned by the U.S. Navy, have state-of-the-art instrumentation and support all disciplines of oceanographic research.  The vessels work in all the world?s oceans supporting science funded primarily by U.S government agencies. R/V Atlantis is specifically outfitted for launching and servicing Alvin, the human occupied submersible as well as other vehicles of the National Deep Submergence Facility (NDSF). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2017, R/V Atlantis completed 297 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 69% of the total sailing schedule (205 days). In 2018, Atlantis is scheduled for 303 days with NSF accounting for 236 of those or 78%.  R/V Armstrong sailed 230 total days in 2017 and 71 of these, 31%, were for NSF. Additionally, 73 days (32%) were for NSF-OOI. The vessel is scheduled for 251 days in 2018, 52% of which (129 days) are for NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Sonardyne USBL Tracking Beacons $29,750 &lt;br/&gt;2) Seabird CTD and Rosette Connector Upgrades $149,812 &lt;br/&gt;       $179,562 &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
