<AbstractNarration>This award provides financial support for the symposium entitled: International Union on Technical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) Symposium on Architectured Material Mechanics to be held on September 17-19, 2018, in Chicago, Illinois. Architectured or micro-architectured material may be a described as a material-structure system, which at the larger scales of interest can be effectively defined as a material system, whereas on the smaller scales it can be explained in terms of the constituent material(s) and structural features. It is an emerging field, which aspires to exploit the union between material and structure to attain otherwise difficult to obtain performance characteristics in engineered materials, such as multifunctional response behavior, high strength to stiffness ratio, and enhanced damage and failure tolerance. While researchers have been able to advance the field through ad-hoc design methods and prototypical fabrications, a deeper insight into the mechanics principles underlying the architectured materials is missing. This event aspires to provide the forum where the experts in mechanics exchange ideas fruitfully and interact with subject matter experts from relevant fields, such as architecture, materials science, and physics. It is expected that this interaction will advance the state-of-the-art in this emerging area, thereby increasing US economic competitiveness, and potentially improving the quality of life, health, and well-being of the society. Funding from this grant will support participation of graduate and post-doctoral scholars and holding of the poster session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this three-day symposium, around 100 leading US and international experts in the mechanics of architecture materials as well as architects, materials scientists, and physicists will convene in an interactive setting to discuss ways to stimulate strong understanding of the principles of mechanics governing the behavior of architecture materials. The impact of the symposium on the field will come in terms of scientific and engineering clarity achieved through speeches, posters, and open discussions. It will increase the possibility of inter- and cross-disciplinary collaboration, which is quite needed. The interaction of students and post-docs with established researchers will play a significant role in their education and field exposure. The meeting proceedings will be made available through online videos of key lectures and publication of the conference proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
