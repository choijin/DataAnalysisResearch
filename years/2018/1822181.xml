<AbstractNarration>This grant supports a week-long summer school on Cognitive Robotics to be held in Boston, Ma in July 2018. The summer school will be a combination of invited talks and tutorials, which are designed to introduce researchers to issues in planning and execution from perspectives of both Robotics and Cognitive Artificial Intelligence, and daily labs, which are designed to give students hands-on experience with robotic hardware and state-of-the-art software tools for developing robotic behaviors. The summer school will help expose graduate students to cutting-edge ideas at the intersection of Robotics and Cognitive Systems and will help to form a new community of researchers in this interdisciplinary area.  The hands-on experience with, and open-source release of, the Enterprise Executive Architecture will facilitate the formation of this collaborative community.  The summer school concludes with a grand challenge using robot hardware that combines what the students have learned during the week.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Williams (MIT), Marlyse Reeves (MIT), Dr. Ashkan Jasour (MIT),  and the Model-based Embedded and Robotic Systems (MERS) group at MIT based upon the following premise:  The goal of this unique summer school was to help catalyze a community of researchers that works closely together on a sustained basis, and that draws equally upon the disciplines of Robotics and Cognitive AI, particularly, those focused on planning and execution within both disciplines. Building upon the success of the 2017 summer school for cognitive robotics, we provided essential tools for sustained collaboration centered around a common robotic execution architecture that unifies the many methods presented, together with daily robotics labs and a grand challenge for the week. This architecture included a decision layer, based on the Enterprise planning and execution architecture, developed by the MERS group at MIT, and a mobility layer, based on the Robotics Operating System (ROS).  Besides bringing two community of AI and robotics together, we aimed to establish an open source community based on the Enterprise executive architecture. Students and researchers were able to take this architecture and integrated toolset home, as a catalyst for future research, studies and collaboration and as the foundation for a new open source community in cognitive robotics.  The intended audience for this summer school included top graduate students, postdocs, and junior researchers, from both the cognitive AI and Robotics disciplines.  Advanced tutorials were offered on those major elements of planning and perception that are key to developing capable autonomous systems, and focused on the daily themes of robust execution, motion planning, activity planning, perception and manipulation, and planning with uncertainty and bounded risk.  The summer school included a strong hands on focus, using a common robotic execution architecture that unifies the many methods presented, together with daily robotics labs and a grand challenge for the week, which emphasized modeling and integrated application.
