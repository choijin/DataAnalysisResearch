<AbstractNarration>Power systems are going through a paradigm change from the current power systems dominated by electric machines to the next-generation smart grid enabled by power electronics. Millions of active, intermittent, non-synchronous, variable, and distributed energy resources and flexible loads are being connected to power systems through power electronic converters. This brings an unprecedented challenge to grid stability and reliability. To address this challenge, Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) is pioneering a synchronized and democratized (SYNDEM) framework for next-generation smart grids, which enables all power electronics-interfaced suppliers and loads to behave like virtual synchronous machines (VSM). As a result, they can seamlessly integrate with the grid and actively maintain grid stability, following the synchronization mechanism of synchronous machines that has underpinned the operation and growth of power systems for over 100 years. This will significantly reduce/defer the infrastructure investment on transmission and distribution networks, reduce the required reserve, release the communication infrastructure from low-level control, enhance cybersecurity, and open up the prospect of achieving autonomous power systems. The objective of this project is to establish a large-scale real-time simulation facility to further advance the research, education, training and outreach activities of IIT in next-generation smart grid while benefiting some neighboring institutions and outreaching Chicago-area high-school students and others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funds to acquire a large-scale real-time simulation facility for next-generation smart grid with high-penetration of power electronic converters. It consists of one RTDS NovaCor power systems simulator, one main OPAL RT OP5707 power electronics simulator, eight distributed OPAL RT OP4510 power electronics simulators, and a bundle of software packages for simulation and communication. The eight OP4510 distributed simulators can be operated individually for small-scale power electronics simulations or together with the OP5707 for large-scale power electronics simulations, which can be operated separately or together with the RTDS power systems simulator, all through high-speed optical Aurora links. It provides a great means to replicate and simulate real-world power systems and develop enabling technologies for next-generation smart grid. The unique combination of the strengths of the RTDS power systems simulator and the OPAL RT power electronics simulators will substantially enhance IIT's research capabilities in energy and power systems, power electronics, networked and autonomous systems, embedded systems, communication systems, and cyber-physical systems. The facility will also offer a great opportunity for students to obtain hands-on experiences to broaden their career opportunities. Moreover, the facility will have an impact on the research and training at neighboring institutions, including University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), Northern Illinois University, Bradley University, and Argonne National Laboratory. The facility will also impact on 100 Chicago-area high-school students annually through IIT's Global Leaders Program and have a nationwide impact on about 45 people annually through the Summer Institute on Sustainability and Energy of UIC. These will broaden the participation in science and engineering research by women, underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
