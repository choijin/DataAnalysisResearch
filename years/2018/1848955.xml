<AbstractNarration>Disproportionate attention is paid to low-probability, long-term potential implications of data science and&lt;br/&gt;artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, substantial negative impacts are being felt now. One explanation for&lt;br/&gt;this disconnect is the stark racial, gender, and geographic detachment of large technology companies from the people--disproportionately racial and ethnic minorities and women--who feel these negative effects.  This award will support a conference at Rutgers University-Newark centered around the transformative potential of engaged research around Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. (Engaged scholarship refers to integrating research, teaching, and public service. Engaged research in AI and Data Science emphasizes the importance of not just algorithms, but the data they are trained on, the problems they are deployed on, and the communities they affect, as well as the people who do the work.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The conference brought together diverse scholars from machine learning &amp; artificial intelligence with experts in the legal, social and workforce implications of these technologies. The conference focused on: 1) understanding the current state of the art in Machine Learning &amp; AI and the Law, especially aspects of fairness and accountability; 2) discussing current and potential future implications of these technologies for society; and 3) prioritizing actions that can be taken, in Newark and across the country, to ensure a future in which technologies benefit our diverse citizenry.     AI and machine learning increasingly make or mediate decisions in society. While promising in many ways, there are also stark negative implications, especially for women and underrepresented minorities. For example, facial recognition software is being used by police departments despite the fact that it fails to correctly identify women and people of color. Companies use algorithms to determine who is likely to succeed at a job, default on a loan, recommit crimes despite the algorithms’ tendency to relfect the society’s biases toward women and minorities. Advertisers are being sold the ability to target highly specific subgroups of people, which has been used to collect massive amounts of information about people, influence opinions, and affect elections.   Researchers from AI, law, and policy discussed advances in understanding and combating these negative implications of AI. Attendees included members of universities and government, and spanned undergraduate, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty, as well as members of the community and media.
