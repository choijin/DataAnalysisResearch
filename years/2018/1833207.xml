<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPITON: The goal of the 2018 Professional Development Workshop in Ceramics is to enhance the career development of the next generation of future leaders in ceramic materials research and education. The workshop focuses on early-career faculty who have recently been awarded NSF CAREER grants from the Ceramics Program in the Division of Materials Research, but the workshop activities are structured to be of value to all participants as there is a desire to increase the scale and scope of this workshop over prior versions. The workshop is also open to other early-career faculty as well as interested post-doctoral associates, faculty-minded senior graduate students, and more senior faculty interested in mentoring the next generation. It an intensive (Oct. 13-14, 2018) workshop that brings together two 2017 CAREER awardees with targeted panels of U.S.-based and international experts from their chosen technical specialties in a forum that promotes professional discussions, mentoring, and networking activities. The direct panel feedback aims to impact the research and training of the early career faculty; the broader exchange of best practices for training and teaching as well as the forging of new collaborative research opportunities and mentoring relationships will benefit all participants. These outcomes provide a strong base to help faculty succeed in becoming outstanding researchers and educators in their chosen fields, while strengthening the ceramics community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: The 2018 Professional Development Workshop in Ceramics will be held on Oct. 13-14, 2018 to coordinate with the Materials Science and Technology meeting Oct. 14-18, 2018 in Columbus, Ohio (MS&amp;T18). This workshop focuses on two technical topics to be presented by the two participating CAREER awardees: 1) understanding the spatiotemporal evolution of structure, chemistry, and morphology of ceramic electrolyte interfaces within solid-state batteries, and 2) enhancing ferroelastic toughening in electroceramic composites through microstructural coupling. The respective early career faculty and the technical experts in their sub-specialties of ceramic materials research are leading the scientific discussions for the purpose of critically evaluating research plans, career development, and education efforts. Pre-registration is appreciated, please e-mail the PI with "2018 Professional Development Workshop in Ceramics" as the subject line, or register on-line at the MS&amp;T18 website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
