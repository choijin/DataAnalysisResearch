<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "The 34th Southeastern Analysis Meeting" that will be held March 23-25, 2018 at the Georgia Institute of Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of harmonic analysis, complex analysis, and other related fields.   A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.   The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.   More information will be made available at:&lt;br/&gt;https://www.math.gatech.edu/hg/item/597350&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

There were 94 participants at this conference, a very high level of attendance! We think that this was due to the exceptional quality of the plenary talks, as well as the convenient location.  In addition, the Workshop in Convexity and Geometic Aspects of Harmonic Analysis was held from December 9-13, 2019 at Georgia Tech.  Four lecture courses were delivered by the following: Shiri Artstein (Tel-Aviv University) Alexander Kodobsky (University of Missouri-Columbia) Grigoris Paouris (Texas A&amp;M University) Elisabeth Werner (Case Western Reserve University)  Many new collaborations by junior participants were initiated.
