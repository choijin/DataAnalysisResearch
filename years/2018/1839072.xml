<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project's technology has its basis in a range of microfluidic cooling products. The potential of the technology is its positive impacts on several computing technologies where it may expand the limits of processing frequency and therefore system speed/performance. Commercial applications that can benefit from the project's technology are broad, such as those requiring the acceleration of high-performance computing in data centers, graphics computing in the fields of artificial intelligence, self-driving transportation, videogame hardware, digital currency (blockchain) technology, augmented and virtual reality, among others. The I-Corps customer discovery activities will also provide useful insights into other potential markets for this project's cooling technology, confirming if there is a need/interest by other industries, such as lasers, concentrated solar photovoltaics, and thermoelectric products, among many potential markets that use liquid-cooling systems at some level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is motivated by a technology that consists of an embedded microfluidic cooling layer that offers significantly enhanced heat removal capabilities when compared with current thermal hardware -- this is as a result of eliminating the thermal interfaces and heat spreaders commonly used in microelectronic devices. The heat removal is directly managed by bonding the microfluidic cooling layer to the silicon chip surface through a metallic joint. The resulting micro-cooling layer replaces the need for the heat spreader used in current technologies since the microstructures embedded in the cooling layer have the appropriate feature sizes and layout with an appropriate flow distribution through engineered manifolds for effective heat dissipation. This technology provides the capability of unlocking the clock frequency on micro-processing units by allowing the input of higher voltages to the computing cores, while also keeping the device temperature below design limits. Laboratory experimentation with these microfluidic cooling layers under a wide variety of operating conditions and refrigerants has demonstrated capabilities for removing heat fluxes of up to 500 W/cm2; a 5x increase when compared with the current maximum heat fluxes of commercial, high-end central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This I-CORPS project was targeted to take prior research on embedded microfluidic cooling of high heat flux electronic components towards commercialization.  As part of the summer 2018 I-CORPS cohort, the project team conducted 111 interviews to identify potential markets for the technology.  While a number of potential products were identified, the highest promise for the commercialization of technology was identified for e-sports and graphics rendering markets.  Over the first half of 2019, a minimum viable product was demonstrated, and its superior performance was demonstrated through benchmarking with the current best-in-class technologies.  This resulted in the incorporation of the start-up EMCOOL, Inc. in June 2019.  Subsequently, customer discovery continued until  December 2019, through a no-cost extension of the I-CORPS project. The significant interest in the technology for the high performance computing sector was confirmed, which is planned as a future product market.  In the past few months, EMCOOL, Inc. has launched its first set of product offerings.  These products are beginning to receive market traction, validating the analysis of customer discovery data during the earlier part of the I-CORPS project.  Overall, this project is a successful demonstration of the I-CORPS approach for technology transition from academic research laboratories to the commercial marketplace.
