<AbstractNarration>The grant provides travel support to students and junior faculty to attend  ESEC/FSE, the result of a recent merger of two, top-tier conferences in Software Engineering -- the International Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE) and its European counterpart, the  European Software Engineering Conference (ESEC)).  The travel support is aimed at attendees of the Doctoral Symposium and first-time attendees, who will participate in a mentorship program provided by the organizers. The grant enables  participants to engage in technical exchange of information and research conversations/collaborations leading to advances the field.  Participation is an important education, training and mentoring experience. The international nature of this conference helps develop a globally-aware workforce of research and educators within the US and helps build the community of researchers in the field of Software Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant provided support for travel to the 26th ACM Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (ESEC/FSE), held on November 4-9, 2018, in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.  The goals of the travel support for this key conference in software engineering were to:  1. Give doctoral students feedback on their research plans and guidance on future directions, from a panel of experts,  2. Enhance the research community?s supportive and collaborative spirit, and  3. Increase interaction between students and other participants.  Therefore, this grant helped support travel to the conference?s doctoral symposium, the New Ideas and Emerging results (NIER) track, and its mentorship program. The mentorship program aimed to connect younger researchers with more senior mentors, particularly those in their specialized research area.  Travel support was advertised on the ESEC/FSE 2018 conference website as funding for people who were already in the US, and all applicants were from universities in the US. 36.4% of the applicants for travel support were women. Of those requesting support 3% were Black or African-American, and 6% preferred not to give their race or ethnicity. Almost half of the funds went to support women. The only African-American applicant received funds from the grant.  For the doctoral symposium participants, 36.4% of the applicants were at the stage of writing their proposal, and another 36.4% had an approved proposal and were conducting research. Another 18.2% were deciding on a topic.  All of the mentorship program applicants were associate professors.  Costs estimated for student support to present a paper was estimated from $400 to $3000, with the average cost about $1000.  All funds went to people who were from the US; that is all who received funding were either faculty or students at a US university. More than half of the funds went to support travel of US citizens or permanent residents. (People who were not from the US were advised to apply for SIGSOFT CAPS travel support instead.) Intellectual Merit  The conference helped advance knowledge in the field of Software Engineering, by fostering the dissemination of the latest results and by strengthening the field's community of researchers. The conference and the people supported by this travel support are furthering research that addresses the fundamental problems in software engineering: finding general techniques to make software development and maintenance more productive and making software that is more robust, resilient, and easy to use. Broader Impacts  The problems of finding general techniques to make software development and maintenance more productive, and to make software more robust, resilient, and easy to use are important as our society becomes increasingly reliant on software for both every day and critical tasks.  The impact on society overall has been to help discover, refine, and popularize new foundational techniques for the design, development, and maintenance of software. The travel support helped bring new talent and new perspectives to the field. Bringing more diversity to the field of software engineering helps promote more diversity of thought to the field, resulting in better software solutions for all people.  A key broader impact is that it helped foster the next generation of software researchers. The doctoral symposium (DS) was directly aimed at fostering the research of PhD students. The DS format was oriented toward encouraging these PhD students, through the involvement of a panel of more established researchers and its emphasis on constructive feedback. The Mentoring sessions focused on encouraging and helping mid-career researchers (associate professors).  Finally, the grant helped aid broader participation in the software engineering community. Almost half of the funds went to support women. The only African-American applicant received funds from the grant.
