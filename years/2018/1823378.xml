<AbstractNarration>Science is increasingly based on computation for science simulations, data management and analysis, instrument control and collaboration. For scientific results generated through computation to be considered robust and become widely accepted, the computational techniques should be automated, reproducible and trustworthy. By exploring the practices of gravitational-wave astronomy researchers working on the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) project, this project seeks to create a set of case studies documenting broadly applicable methods for reproducible computational science. Specifically, the project will explore and articulate what reproducibility, automation, and trust mean with respect to computation-based research in gravitational-wave astronomy, identify, implement and validate a set of experimental practices, that will include computational techniques, and finally, evaluate how these experimental practices can be extended to other science domains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robust computational science builds on rigorous methods and is composed of three key elements: (1) reproducibility, which enables the verification and leveraging of scientists' findings; (2) automation, which speeds up the exploration of alternative solutions and the processing of large amounts of data while reducing the introduction of errors; and (3) trust, providing security and reliability for software and data, while supplying the necessary attributes for confidence in the scientist's own results and results from others. This project explores robust science in the LIGO project through the following activities within the context of gravitational-wave astronomy: (1) articulating the roles of reproducibility, automation, and trust in gravitational-wave astronomy; (2) identifying, implementing and validating a set of experimental practices, including computational techniques; and (3) advancing towards the project's vision of general computational methods for robust science by evaluating how the experimental practices can be extended to other science domains. The project will develop and use a survey to collect information about LIGO workflows that are composed of a series of experimental, computational, and data manipulation steps. The analysis of the survey will result in a document that describes what reproducibility means in the LIGO context and help identify potential improvements in LIGO's practices. The project will generalize these findings by documenting a mapping of LIGOÃ•s original and enhanced approach to other science workflows including those of the molecular dynamics and bioinformatics communities. The final project document will target a broad audience that includes researchers and students at various levels of education, with the goal of introducing them to the concept of robust computational research, and the underlying concepts of reproducibility, automation and trust, teaching them to access code, data, and workflow information to regenerate findings, learn about the scientific methods, and to engage in STEM research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The goals of this 2-year project were to (a) reproduce the computational process that led to the first direct detection of a  gravitational wave resulting from a binary black hole merger (GW150914) on a commodity cluster and (b) document the LIGOâ€™s practices using formalisms such as the PRIMAD model and  create a script that other scientists can run using public resources to reproduce the discovery of GW150914 and to help identify potential improvements in LIGOâ€™s practices.  In Year 1, we built a post-hoc characterization analysis of three key peer-reviewed LIGO papers with the support of the PRIMAD model, which describes workflows in terms of this 6-component space such as Platform / execution environment / context (P), Research objectives / goals (R ), Implementation / code / source-code (I),  Methods / algorithms (M), Actors / persons (A), and Data (D). The first two papers are LIGO-Virgo Binary Catalogue papers from Abbott and co-authors based on datasets from the first and second LIGO/Virgo observing runs. While both of these papers provide various code and artifacts from their results, they were not written with the intent that a reader could exactly reproduce the analysis. The third paper is the 1-OGC paper from Nitz and co-authors describing a run of the PyCBC matched filtering workflow on the public LIGO O1 data using an updated pipeline configuration and with the intent that the analysis performed could be reproduced by scientists who were not involved in the original analysis.  In Year 2, we reproduced the generation of one of the key results from LIGO's first gravitational-wave detection, using the same set of LIGO scientific codes and gravitational-wave data, but on a different computing environment. Instead of executing the analysis on LIGO Data Grid and Open Science Grid, we set up the underlying workflows to execute on a local computational cluster (managed by HTCondor) at USC/ISI using only publicly available information.  In our reproducibility process, we have considered the role of actors who may have designed the overall workflow or individual parts of it (i.e., those who define and perform the original scientific study, such as the scientists, users, technicians). To this end, our analysis was reproduced by a scientist who was not involved in the original discovery in collaboration with a member of the original team that did the analysis. The outcomes of the project are a software repository including both data and software needed for the LIGOâ€™s  computational reproducibility  of GW150914 and two publications describing the applicability and generalization of our lessons learned and reproducibility methods beyond the LIGOâ€™s workflows through the lens of the PRIMAD model. The reproducibility approach designed and used in the project can be expanded to other projects as an example of technology transfer.
