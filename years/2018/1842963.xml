<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funds to enable 14 students to attend the 25th annual &lt;br/&gt;25th annual Radio Frequency Ionospheric Interactions (RFII) Workshop in Arlington, VA during July 29-August 1, 2018. The RFII Workshop is a scientific workshop focused on &lt;br/&gt;the interaction of high-power RF waves from ground-based transmitters with the ionospheric plasma. The effects include (but are not limited to) artificial generation of aurorae and ionospheric irregularities. The topics covered by this workshop are of interest not only to the Aeronomy radio science subcommunity, but also to the wider Atmospheric and Geospace science communities. These topics are also highlighted at assembly meetings such as the AGU and the IUGG. Student participation is a strong element of the RFII workshop, which affords them the opportunity to network with scientific leaders.  The workshop also exposes students to work performed at cutting edge research facilities, such as HAARP and Arecibo Observatory. These encounters are strong motivators for future careers in upper atmospheric and space sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2018 RF Ionospheric Interactions (RFII) Workshop was held in Arlington, Virginia from 29 July 2018 to 1 August 2018.  The RFII Workshop is a scientific workshop focused on ionospheric modification by high power electromagnetic waves, including those emanated by lightning, and by high energy particles, such as those that populate the Earth's radiation belts.  The scientific topics covered by the workshop are of great interest to the atmospheric and geospace science community.  The RFII Workshop strongly encourages student participation, and this award directly supported the participation of 14 students (9 graduate students and 5 undergraduate students) from US institutions who are pursuing technical degrees related to ionospheric physics.  The award covered cost of travel, registration, and accomodation for these students, representing Georgia Institute of Technology, Notre Dame University, the University of Alabama, the University of Colorado Denver, and the University of Florida.  Over the course of the three day workshop, we received updates from the world's ionospheric heaters (HAARP, EISCAT, Arecibo, and Sura), we received graduate level training for ionospheric diagostic tools (e.g., digisondes, incoherent scatter radars, and magnetometer chains), and we received detailed tutorials on ionospheric heating in the D-Region ionosphere (R.

The students in turn presented posters and talks on their current areas of research (10 students made presentations).  One of the best parts of the Workshop (according to students) was the group work setting: Students were divided into groups to analyze different types of ionospheric heating data sets and present their results to the Workshop.
