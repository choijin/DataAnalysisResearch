<AbstractNarration>The oceans are dominated by microscopic plants and animals (microorganisms) that are at the base of the food web and drive energy and carbon cycles on global scales.  Soft jellylike animals called gelatinous grazers specialize in feeding on microorganisms using nets made out of mucus. Gelatinous grazers are abundant in the ocean and have high feeding rates on microorganisms so could have a very strong influence on the abundance and diversity of microorganisms and could change how oceanic food webs are currently understood. However, gelatinous grazers are very fragile and patchy in their distributions so it has been difficult to determine the magnitude and dynamics of these important predator-prey relationships on a meaningful scale using traditional approaches, thus they have typically been disregarded in food web studies. Learning more about the predator-prey relationship between gelatinous grazers and microorganisms will improve understanding of the structure, mechanics, and dynamics of the ocean?s food web, which is a critical economic and ecosystem resource on Earth. This project is determining grazing rates by gelatinous animals on microbes to inform food web models.  The project also trains students to communicate, disseminate, and interpret scientific findings. These broader impacts goals will be attained through partnerships at the University of Oregon (Applied Scientific Communication) and Portland State University (Advanced Technical Writing), training of 1 PhD student, 2 undergraduates, and 4 science communication interns, and development of a week-long workshop and establish student mentorship relationships towards production of communication products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project integrates laboratory and oceanographic approaches to address several specific aspects of the predator-prey relationship between gelatinous grazers and ocean microorganisms. Five distinct types of gelatinous grazers, each with different feeding morphologies and life history, will be studied in an oceanographic setting with an abundant and diverse natural microbial population. These target organisms include pelagic tunicates (salps, appendicularians, doliolods and pyrosomes) and thecosome pteropods.  The approach quantifies: 1) grazing rates in the natural ocean environment, 2) particle selectivity with a focus on size and shape and, 3) the morphological and hydrodynamic properties of feeding that underlie the measured grazing rates and particle selection.  The project uses a variety of techniques including sampling via SCUBA diving, laboratory experiments, high speed/high resolution videography, flow cytometry, and DNA sequencing techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
