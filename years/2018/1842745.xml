<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR/STTR) Phase I project is to commercialize the world?s first sunscreen that protects against UVA-induced photoaging, provides sufficient UVB protection and to reverse UVB-induced damage, and is safe to coral reefs. Leading sunscreens that are currently on the market have been shown to be inadequate in protection against UVA damage (photoaging). Moreover, Oxybenzone and octinoxate, which are found in over 80% of chemical sunscreens, have been shown to be highly toxic to coral cells. Estimated 14,000 tons of sunscreen settle into the world?s coral reefs every year and the oxybenzone that is present in many of these sunscreens cause coral bleaching and accelerate the destruction of the world?s already fragile coral reefs. The Magic Blue sunscreen uses an alternative eco-friendly technology to protect the skin from UVA and UVB damage, and the successful commercialization/market adoption of the Magic Blue sunscreen will significantly benefit the global environment by protecting our aquatic ecosystems, especially coral reefs, from further oxybenzone/octinoxate-induced damage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR/STTR) Phase I project will develop a novel coral reef-friendly sunscreen that can provide broad spectrum protection. Magic Blue, LLC is partnering with the University of Maryland, College Park and collaborating with the Carnegie Institution for Science to conduct the key feasibility experiments, including biological analysis of UVA protection in 2D and 3D human skin tissues, chemical assays on SPF determination, and environmental study on the effects of the new sunscreen on soft and hard coral reefs.  Once these experiments are complete, Phase II of the project will revolve around obtaining necessary FDA approval for commercial launch. The overall outcome from a successful STTR project will be the commercialization of the world?s first sunscreen that will encompass the following attributes: scientifically proven to protect against UVA-induced photoaging, abilities to provide sufficient UVB protection and to reverse UVB-induced damage, and safe to coral reefs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Sunscreen is a vitally important product that protects skin against sun damage from ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Sunscreens on the market today don't provide full UV spectrum protection and the majority of brands include ingredients that have now been called into question by consumer advocates, environmentalists and the FDA.  Full spectrum protection:  UVR is comprised of UVA and UVB waves. UVB damages skin through burns and cancer-causing DNA mutations, while UVA leads to photo aging (wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, etc). The Sun Protection Factor standard (SPF) is regulated by the FDA and aims to protect consumers from skin cancer causing exposure. As a result, most sunscreens have been designed to be effective at blocking UVB radiation at the expense of often-inadequate protection against UVA-induced photo aging.  Safety and Environmental Concerns:  In July 2018, Hawaii became the first state in the U.S. to pass a legal ban on sunscreens containing Oxybenzone and Octinoxate due to their toxic effects on coral reefs. Other states and countries like Australia and Mexico have followed suit. A number of consumer safety groups have also raised concerns that these two ingredients may be harmful to humans and the FDA has requested safety studies from the sunscreen  manufacturers.  Project Goal:  The major goal for this project was the validation that Methylene Blue (MB), a compound discovered by Dr. Cao, the Founder of Magic Blue, LLC (dBa Mblue Labs), performs the functions of a full-spectrum sunscreen that does not harm coral reefs.   Outcome:   The team was in fact able to demonstrate that MB not only functions as a UVB block and a UVA screen, but also prevents photo-aging, without any negative impact to coral reef life. This establishes MB as a superior UVB/UVA full spectrum sunscreen active ingredient when compared to the most widely used sunscreen actives Oxybenzone and Octinaxate.    Project Aims and Specific Results:  1. Comparative studies between MB-based vs. Oxybenzone-based formula on their effects of neutralizing UVA-induced ROS.  The team’s first aim was to quantify and compare the level of mitochondrial ROS activity and resulting in cell proliferation for MB and Oxybenzone. We observed an increase in cell proliferation in MB-treated samples, while the cells treated with Oxybenzone had an elevated level of ROS activity. Together these experiments establish MB as an effective UVA scavenger that prevents photo-aging from sun exposure.     2. Study to quantify MB’s UVB protection capabilities  The second aim was to measure MB’s effectiveness to absorb UVB radiation and establish MB’s ability to stimulate the DNA repair process after UVB exposure. The spectrophotometric analysis of various dilute solutions, established MB’s ability to absorb UVB in the full wavelength spectrum from 200-320 nm and in the full UVA spectrum from 320-400 nm. The study shows that MB outperforms Oxybenzone. Secondly, skin cells treated with MB had a significantly better recovery than those treated with Oxybenzone. To show MB’s potential to repair DNA damage from UVB exposure, we tested human skin fibroblasts at various UVB levels. MB treated cells showed reduced levels of H2AX, while the control group doubled the levels of H2AX (The histone H2AX is phosphorylated to a gamma form H2AX upon DNA double-strand breakage and the levels positively correlate with the presence of DNA breaks, commonly generated by UVB).   3. Comparative study of the impact of MB, Oxybenzone, and Octinaxate on the health of coral reefs  The third aim was to measure the effects of exposure to MB, Oxybenzone, and Octinaxate on the most common types of corals. We observed no harmful changes for soft and stony corals after exposure to MB. However, exposure to Oxybenzone and Octinaxate caused coral bleaching, a process in which corals expel their symbiotic algae (Symbiodinium), from which they derive nutrition.  Conclusion:  There is a big opportunity for MB to serve as a replacement for Oxybenzone/Octinoxate, for which the industry is seeking an alternative that is safe for humans and coral reefs. The unique ability of MB to reverse damage from both UVA and UVB waves makes it a great candidate to become a new, higher-performing, active ingredient in Sunscreen.
