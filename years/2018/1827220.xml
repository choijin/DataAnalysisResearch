<AbstractNarration>According to the theory of plate tectonics, continents can collide against others or dive under another plate (subduction) to depths of over 100 km. The existence of rocks at the Earth's surface that have minerals that can only be formed at great depths in the Earth's interior suggests that continental subduction is a common process. The geological processes that are able to bring rocks from considerable depth back to the surface, also known as exhumation, remain enigmatic. This project focuses on a study of one of the largest and best-exposed area in the world (the Western Gneiss Region of Norway) where these so-called ultrahigh pressure rocks (UHP) are exposed. This study will examine how this process of exhumation may have occurred in the past. Because large blocks of UHP rocks have yet to be discovered in North America, they are typically not readily available in teaching collections at U.S. colleges and universities. One of the education activities in this project will be to create a teaching module centered on UHP rocks that includes rock and thin section sets to be used in petrology and related courses. The collections and teaching module will be disseminated to 15 schools in collaboration with geoscience education specialists in order to optimize impact and diversity, and help manage teaching effectiveness and assessment. The project also includes a display and activities using field photos and rock samples from the Western Gneiss Region to explain plate tectonics and subduction zones to K-12 students visiting the Earth Science and Mineral Engineering Museum housed at University of Nevada - Reno. In addition, graduate and undergraduate students are to be trained in both research and outreach activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rates and mechanisms of exhumation of UHP terranes are still poorly known because the preservation of UHP mineral assemblages is sporadic, and it is also a function of how reactive the exhumed crust was. Two end-member modes of exhumation of UHP terranes have been proposed: 1) education of a coherent and thus poorly reactive lithospheric slab; and 2) return flow of a body of highly reactive UHP rocks along the subduction channel. The Western Gneiss Region of Norway is an ideal terrane to study these processes because it is transected by numerous 10-100 m scale shear zones that offer a clear history of progressive exhumation based on outcrop-scale crosscutting relationships and metamorphic overprinting in both the mafic (eclogite/amphibolite) bodies and the host quartzofeldspathic gneiss. These largely unstudied shear zones preserve the best record of pressure-temperature-time-deformation (P-T-t-D) conditions during exhumation from mantle to crustal depths and are therefore prime candidates for evaluating the proposed exhumation models. Methods that investigate the petrologic and geochemical record within the shear zones include: (1) detailed field mapping, from outcrop to regional scale, incorporating microstructural analyses within shear zones from across the Western Gneiss Region to determine progressive deformation-recrystallization of minerals, including datable minerals; (2) Titanium-in-quartz thermobarometry to trace conditions during ascent and decompression; and (3) petrochronology based on high- and medium-temperature chronometers based on U-Pb dating using zircon and monazite for the (U)HP part of the path and rutile and titanite for the HP to amphibolite-facies portion of the path. Results provide significant new insight into the P-T-t-D paths that are preserved in the geologic record of exhumed UHP terranes, and more generally into the rates and mechanisms of UHP terrane exhumation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
