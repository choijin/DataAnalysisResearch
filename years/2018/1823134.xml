<AbstractNarration>To enable a world-wide multi-user community to realize research and education programs, the University of Central Florida (UCF) presents a strategic vision over the next five years to manage, operate, and disseminate results from the unique capabilities of the Arecibo Observatory (AO).  AO will provide observations, and support researchers, in three main areas:  Radio Astronomy, Atmospheric Sciences, and Planetary Radar. The management team includes members with expertise in the science at AO, in maintenance and operations, and in education and public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under UCF management, AO will allow researchers to make innovative use of the facility, and maintain its central role in science and education into the future. For example, the role of AO in the detection and characterization of Gravitational Waves is an exciting new opportunity.  The management team will search for other collaborators and funders interested in using the unique capabilities of AO (for example, its reflector sensitivity and location). The PIs will implement a New Business Development Team focused on developing other funding sources including donations, tourism and commercial clients. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UCF balances science with the maintenance that assures the viability of AO for the long term. The management team plans to grow the diversity of science and maintain observations without trading off the condition of the facilities/equipment or a reduction in workforce. The goal is to maintain the total funding at the 2017/2018 level through government and non-government funding sources.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AO continues to be a source of intellectual inspiration to the next generation of scientist, particularly those located in Puerto Rico. Under UCF management, AO will enable research by student scientists in Puerto Rico that will result in the next generation of Astronomers and Atmospheric Scientists. In addition, AO will provide workshops emphasizing STEAM education, create a summer research academy for high school students, and train a large number of STEAM high school teachers each year. Team member UMET, leading collaborations with the Puerto Rico Space Grant Consortium, expects to expand delivery of high quality student and teacher education programs using AO as a hub. An expected result is a pipeline of potential students and postdocs to support the science investigation interests of both UCF and Universities across Puerto Rico. The outreach plan updates the Angel Ramos Foundation Visitor Center, expanding the visitor experience at AO.</AbstractNarration>

Finally, all education and public outreach activities, including the operations of the Angel Ramos Foundation Science and Visitor?s Center, fell under Universidad Metropolitana, a top educational institution in P.R. with over 8 years of experience managing the center.  Throughout the transition research observations and facility maintenance activities were maintained as previously scheduled, thus minimizing any operational downtime.
