<AbstractNarration>This proposal supports student travel to attend the 2018 Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium to be held in Santa Diego, California, Feb 2018. NDSS brings together innovative and forward-thinking members of the Internet community who research, design, develop, and deploy the technologies that define network and distributed system security. This travel grant will enable career development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen graduate students. Attending conferences is an important component of graduate school education for our society's future computer security researchers. Students have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class computer security researchers, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project aimed to assist sixteen (16) US-based graduate and undergraduate students to attend the Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium (https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2018/) held in San Diego, CA on February 18 - 21, 2018. It is an annual,three-day conference hosted by Internet Society (ISOC) that brings together innovative and forward-thinking members of the Internet community who research, design, develop, and deploy the technologies that define network and distributed system security. It was a highly successful event with 71 papers, 18 posters, and 2 keynotes, in addition to 4 workshops held prior to the symposium on Day 0.     Participation in symposia like the NDSS is a critical part of these students' educational experiences, providing them the opportunity to interact with senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work in the field.  The National Science Foundation?s support enabled the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend the NDSS, and also directly benefited the NDSS and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), two institutions that benefit from a greater cross-pollination and increased academic involvement.     Women and under-represented groups were actively encouraged to apply through established networks of academics and industry leaders. Moreover, outreach was focused on networks of computer scientists who actively mentor under-represented communities in the computer technology sector, including outreach to academic colleagues at institutions where students are less likely to have travel funding available and to make sure their students are aware of this opportunity.      The fellowship committees' decision criteria included:  Evidence of serious interest and aptitude in the security field, as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience; Evidence of community leadership interests and skills, as demonstrated by engagement with the broader community; Evidence of collaboration and teamwork activities, especially as applied to problems in the security field;  Identified benefit from attendance and participation, particularly how participating in the symposium could shape the student's future studies and/or research;  Considerations for students from underrepresented communities and first-time attendees; and Proof of enrollment in a security-related program at a college/university located in the USA.      The award achieved its goals by supporting sixteen (16) students, including three (3) women, from a pool of sixty-eight (68) applicants - a year over year application increase of 39% -to attend the 2018 NDSS meeting when they would otherwise be unable to do so.  All of the recipients were graduate students, except for one who noted in the feedback report that attending the event provided encouragement to pursue post-graduate research in computer science. The selected students representan infusion of new perspectives to the cybersecurity field, as well as the multiplier effect: taking their NDSS experience and knowledge back to their academic institutions to inspire and motivate others in the field.  Anecdotal evidence provided by each student after the event, in the form of a required Student Survey, was positive.     Support for students' attendance and engagement in the annual event advances ISOC?s mission to prepare the next generation of Internet technical leaders in two complementary ways: First, it equips emerging academic researchers and technologists to address rising challenges facing the Internet, one of the greatest being trust, security and resiliency of the Internet.  Second, as the administrative home of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), ISOC is committed to increasing cross-pollination between the NDSS and the IETF. This has the bidirectional benefit of increasing academic involvement and bringing new ideas and fresh energy to the IETF's global standard-setting work, while providing focus and timely real-world problems and feedback for academics and researchers.     In support of this cross-pollination, four workshops were organized on Day 0 of the symposium.  These included:     Binary Analysis Research: https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2018/bar-workshop-programme/     Decentralized IoT Security and Standards:https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2018/diss-workshop-programme/     DNS Privacy: https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2018/dns-privacy-workshop-programme/     Usable Security: https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2018/usec-workshop-programme/     Regardless of the field, investing in the development of human capital is crucial for the future.  Supporting and nurturing the next generation of network security experts, providing them with an opportunity to learn from and engage with established experts benefits the entire community.  Each provides the other with lessons learned, fresh ideas, and infuses a spirit of collaboration among a rather small sub-section of the technical space.
