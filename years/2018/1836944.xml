<AbstractNarration>This award will support the 25th Gordon Research Conference (GRC) in the field of mineral resources geochemistry, and the first ever Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) that targets early-career scientists. Funding will significantly reduce the cost of attendance for early-career scientists, defined here as students, and post-docs and tenure-track and tenured faculty within five years of having earned their doctoral degree, and for under-represented minorities. National and international researchers in the field of mineral resources will gather to discuss issues concerning the geochemistry of metal transportation and deposition in the natural environment. The format of this meeting provides an outstanding opportunity to mentor future generations of scientists who will be responsible for ensuring the sustainable supply of resources, including critical metals, for society. Participating early-career scientists will engage with representatives from academia and various government agencies and laboratories, as well as from the mining and geothermal industries, who bring to the group their experience and expertise concerning immediate problems requiring practical solutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GRC and GRS meetings on Geochemistry of Mineral Deposits will cover a broad range of topics across all scales, from nano-particles to crustal. The GRC will open with a discussion of how ore deposits relate to the evolution of the Earth's hydrosphere and lithosphere. Morning sessions include detailed appraisals of mineralizing processes in all key ore-forming environments on Planet Earth, its oceans and basins, metamorphic and magmatic environments, and areas of active deformation. Evening sessions will focus on the timing and duration of mineralizing processes, how weathering can enhance, obscure or destroy ore deposits, the latest advances in geochemical exploration for ore deposits, and predictions of future directions in ore deposit geochemistry research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
