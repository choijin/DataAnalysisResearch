<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to develop a microfluidic device for cell therapy manufacturing. Advantages in terms of cost and quality of the cell products produced by the proposed technology should benefit clinical researchers and cell therapeutics. Further, by providing an efficient, standardized, and scalable approach to the manufacturing process, the translation of lab-scale discoveries to curative therapies that are widely-available should be significantly accelerated.  On a fundamental level, this project will enhance technological understanding of how to apply microfluidic technology concepts to clinically-relevant applications (requiring macroscopic flowrates) in a practical manner, while also establishing a new medical device sector centered on a suite of easily implemented cell separation devices for use in cellular therapies and related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to employ a cell separation approach to create a high-throughput proof-of-concept prototype to help simplify and streamline the manufacture of cellular therapies.  To accomplish this objective, a two-stage microfluidic module will be designed to achieve isolation of separate lymphocyte- and monocyte-rich subpopulations from blood samples, while removing undesirable red blood cells and platelets, at levels sufficient for successful culture growth.  In addition, the plan is to fabricate a full-scale prototype system of parallelized lymphocyte/monocyte isolation modules to achieve a volumetric throughput capable of processing 200mL of peripheral blood-, buffy coat-, or mononuclear cell (MNC) leukapheresis-derived product within ~30 minutes.  Once developed, this technology will overcome many drawbacks that plague current cell isolation approaches including high per unit cost, laborious/time-consuming workflow, and potential to compromise sterility. This device will require no expensive or complex equipment on-site to drive the separation/concentration of the cells of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[During this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, a ground-breaking microfluidic-based, flow-through cell separation concept was successfully adapted to the specific needs of cellular therapy manufacturing.  Implementation of the disposable, standalone cell separation devices based on this concept would eliminate the need for centrifugation equipment, pumping mechanisms, or any of the other complex machinery that is commonly required to enable the isolation of desired cells from a given blood sample.  Using only gravity-driven flow through the 'passive' devices ensures that this new approach is closed/sterile, inexpensive, and easy to employ.  Despite its relative simplicity, the performance of this Phase I proof-of-concept technology nevertheless rivaled that of established competitors, and cells harvested with this approach have been shown to expand in culture at significantly faster rates than conventionally-isolated cells.  Thus, the advancement of knowledge in the area of cellular therapy research, and related fields, should eventually directly benefit from the successful completion of this work.  Broader impacts of this SBIR project will likely be achieved long-term primarily through its disruption of the emerging cellular therapy market, by providing a superior (and simpler) alternative to the existing equipment currently used at several stages of cell therapy manufacturing.  Advantages in terms of cost and quality of the cell products produced by the technology under development should ultimately improve both clinical research and patientcare alike.  Further, by providing an efficient, standardized, and scalable approach to the currently ad hoc cell therapy manufacturing process, the translation of lab-scale discoveries to widely-available curative therapies should be significantly accelerated.  On a fundamental level, this project has also enhanced technological understanding of how to best apply high-precision microfluidic technology concepts to clinically-relevant applications (requiring high volumetric throughput) in a practical and cost-effective manner.  This should result in eventual development of an entire host of easily-implementable devices for use in a wide range of additional fields (e.g. platelet concentration, algae harvesting, water filtration) in which a more efficient method for the concentration or separation of cells/particles of a given size would be beneficial to scientific research and/or society at large.
