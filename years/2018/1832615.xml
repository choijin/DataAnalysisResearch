<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project focuses on the development of a lower-cost, improved performance infrared radiation detection technology.  Numerous technologies presently exist for detecting Infrared radiation.  Those which are cost effective for commercial applications tend to lack adequate performance specifications, while those with ideal performance are too expensive.  This technology has broad application potential.  The proposed I-Corps program explores implementation and commercialization opportunities within the project's initial application focus of Nondispersive Infrared (NDIR) gas sensing of carbon dioxide and volatile organic compounds (VOC), such as methane and ethylene gas.  These sensors have significant markets related to smart ventilation systems for cars, homes, and businesses, as well as leak monitoring in industrial processes and oil and gas production.  Further enabling the mass deployment of these sensors will have significant impact on energy conservation, environmental protection, and health and safety.  Additionally, longer term development of the technology may prove to be disruptive in thermal imaging applications.  Presently, thermal imaging applications are broad but the hardware is often too cumbersome and expensive to be practical for commercial use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the premise that the intersection of different scientific disciplines leads to disruptive innovation.  The project's technology is a fundamentally different approach to infrared radiation detection than those developed in the past 50+ years.  This project pursues an optical solution to a semiconductor material processing problem which has hampered the realization of adequate production yield, manufacturing scalability, and device performance, resulting in too high a cost and limited suitability for many commercial applications.  Previous progress on this project has focused on the theoretical development of the optical design and experimental verification of these nanofabricated structures.  Initial results have been encouraging, and work continues to enhance responsivity, as well as other necessary device specifications.  This I-Corps process will be used to refine our understanding of customer problems/needs and the potential for our technology to solve them.  This will further inform our technology development path and specification focus, enabling the release of a useful product to market sooner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes   Visible cameras have changed the way we interact with the world. They empower the individual to capture pivotal moments and to share the experience. While visible cameras capture what we can already see, infrared cameras extend human perception enabling greater situational awareness. The importance of the camera is not in the device itself, but in what it produces. Infrared cameras empower the user to "see" heat or dangerous invisible gases, or to "see" through flames, smoke, fog, and darkness. They have increased safety for soldiers, law enforcement, and firefighters. They have also enabled improvements in home and work place safety and have become a critical tool in broader environmental protection. Infrared cameras have begun to be integrated into personal smart phones, onto UAVs for remote and rapid imaging as well as onto ships, airplanes, and even driven and autonomous vehicles.  Underlying almost all infrared camera applications is their ability to increase safety. Whether through domestic surveillance, guiding firefighters through a burning building, or providing a soldier with greater situational awareness on the battlefield, they have proven to have a significant impact. Infrared cameras are incredibly versatile tools being capable of and ideal for a plethora of applications. The availability of affordable, high performance infrared cameras is essential for fully enabling these applications, as well as inspiring development of emerging applications.  The outcome of our work under this grant has been the development of a new class of infrared camera which promises increased image quality and accessibility through price reduction.  This grant aided in identifying our product and target customer and to determine what our value propositions are.  During this program we incorporated a company, filed multiple patent applications, applied to SBIR grants, and have been accepted into Startup competitions as well as invited to publish our work.  This grant laid the foundation for what we plan to build into a successful company that will change the way everyone sees the world.
