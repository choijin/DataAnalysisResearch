<AbstractNarration>The Internet comprises tens of thousands of networks (Autonomous Systems) operated by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that exchange traffic with each other at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), to save on transit costs and bring content closer to their consumers. IXPs act as giant switches for groups of ISPs to exchange traffic and have a significant role in today's Internet as much of the traffic flows through IXPs. Stability and efficiency of ISP connectivity and peering relationships that form at these IXPs are crucial to long-term sustainability and scalability of the Internet. In the current practice, however, the price paid for traffic exchange at an IXP is typically determined by coarse, static measures that can result in end-to-end performance inefficiency in the traffic flows. This project aims to improve the state of traffic exchange and peering settlements at an IXP (for both non-profit and for-profit IXPs) through economically efficient pricing of IXP services coupled with flexible and value-driven ISP peering relationships. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Towards fostering stable and economically beneficial inter-ISP peering relationships, this project will investigate the following important questions. Firstly, it will explore how the IXP services for traffic exchange should be shared (in the non-profit model) or be priced (in the for-profit model) so that economic efficiency is attained at equilibrium. Secondly, it will investigate the potential benefits of paid peering at an IXP, when there is significant asymmetry between the traffic flows. Finally, it will explore how IXP providers (which typically operate at different co-location centers) can facilitate formation of groups between ISPs at different co-location centers to maximize overall efficiency of traffic flows across an entire geographical region. This project is expected to enhance the understanding on how IXPs should operate in the near future to cope with the increased rate and asymmetry in traffic exchanges, and streamline the peering process and make it value-driven. It aims to improve traffic flows in the Internet, and bring the content closer to users, resulting in higher traffic rates, lower costs, and lower delays in content delivery to end users. The project's impact and outreach will be strengthened through collaboration with industry, and integration of education with research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
