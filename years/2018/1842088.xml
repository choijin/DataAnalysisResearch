<AbstractNarration>The 2018 Campus Cyberinfrastructure and Cybersecurity Innovation for Cyberinfrastructure PI Workshop builds upon the success of the previous Campus Cyberinfrastructure Workshops providing an opportunity for recipients of all active NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) and Cybersecurity Innovation for Cyberinfrastructure (CICI) awards to meet in person, exchange project findings, interact with national cyberinfrastructure experts and collaborate across project areas and project regions. By again co-locating with the Quilt Fall Member Meeting, the broader scope encourages relationships between campus cyberinfrastructure, science driven applications, cybersecurity, and regional and national cyberinfrastructure resources. Based on last year's experience, we have updated the meeting schedule to provide additional opportunities for interaction between PIs themselves as well as between the three groups participating in the meetings. New to the 2018 PI Workshop is an expanded pre-workshop set of breakout sessions half-day breakout sessions on topics relevant to academic research networking challenges facing campuses and CC* and CICI PI teams. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is the exchange of project findings, interaction between national cyberinfrastructure experts, collaboration across project areas and project regions that will lead to new ideas, relationships and collaborations associated with an in person workshop. The half-day cyberinfrastructure engineering session will provide timely insights into growing practice of cyberinfrastructure facilitation in the campus environment that can be shared with the co-located meeting attendees as well as the community in general. The broader impact associated with the workshop includes the dissemination of workshop information, including the workshop presentations. By co-locating with the Quilt meeting the workshop continues to bring together stakeholders with a vested interest in leveraging campus cyberinfrastructure investments to provide the opportunity to develop stronger ties between campus cyberinfrastructure, science driven applications and regional and national cyberinfrastructure resources, leading to a broader set of collaborations and lasting impact on national campus cyberinfrastructure and science driven applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
