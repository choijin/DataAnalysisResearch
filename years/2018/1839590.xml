<AbstractNarration>The proposed project on US-EU Two-Dimensional (2D) Layered Materials and Devices Workshop seeks financial support to support researcher participation in a workshop to be held September 10-14, 2018  in San Sebastian, Spain. It will run in association with Graphene Week, which is an event organized by the European Graphene Flagship and will be attended by many Researchers involved in the NSF sponsored 2-DARE (Two-Dimensional Atomic-layer Research and Engineering) program. The Workshop will address research areas of a wide range of non-graphene 2D atomic layers such as phosphorene, transition metal di-chalcogenides, hexagonal boron nitride, tertiary compounds of carbo-nitrides, and complex oxides. The Workshop will bring together leading scientists working on graphene and beyond graphene 2D materials and devices from Europe and the United States to help promote future collaborations and address common challenges. It should positively impact learning in the science and engineering disciplines through personnel exchange programs that are likely to catalyze from this workshop, including bi-lateral exchange of faculty, graduate students and post-doctoral fellows. There is support planned to be provided to US doctoral students participating in the meeting to advance their understanding and to build collaborations with their counterparts in Europe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students participating in the Graphene Week Exhibition will have the opportunity to present the US research to the greater science and technology graphene community from all over the world. It will prompt collaborations with the EU Graphene Flagship program administrators and NSF that will lead to international activities that can facilitate joint collaborative programs in the future. The Workshop is expected to play a key role in addressing in detail currently faced bottlenecks in 2D material and device research and identifying new directions for research. 2D layered materials has a high potential for spawning technological breakthroughs and disruptive technologies impacting society in the areas of microelectronics, optoelectronics, health and medical diagnostics, energy harvesting, and environmental monitoring. It will have significant broader impact by catalyzing potential international partnerships between leading researchers in the US and Europe to discuss broad directions for future research in this highly dynamic and interdisciplinary area. A final report detailing the discussion topics and conclusions/recommendations will also be posted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
