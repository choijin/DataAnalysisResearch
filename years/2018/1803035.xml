<AbstractNarration>Category 4 Hurricane Harvey, the most intense wind and rain event to strike Texas in 56 years, made landfall on August 25, 2017, with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph and a storm surge of over 2 m. In addition, the hurricane brought 30-50 inches of rain and caused record-breaking freshwater flooding throughout southeastern Texas, inundating large tracts of coastal marshes with flood waters from rivers and the Gulf of Mexico. Severe freshwater flooding also occurred in inland fluvial wetlands along the Brazos, Trinity, and San Bernard Rivers. Harvey provides an excellent opportunity to study the sedimentary signatures of a rare wind-and-rain event and to estimate its return period by documenting past similar event deposits in the geological record. In addition, there is growing public awareness of the detrimental effects of climate change, particularly in coastal areas threatened by accelerated sea-level rise. This research will help determine whether coastal marshes can survive rising sea-level by providing new information on the role of hurricanes in contributing sediment to marshes, causing accretion and counteracting relative elevation loss due to sea-level rise. This is a collaborative project by research teams at Louisiana State University and the University of North Texas encompassing the complete sedimentary impacts of Hurricane Harvey along a coastal (saltwater)-to-fluvial (freshwater) transect across southeastern Texas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studies conducted to date suggest that hurricanes are major contributors to marsh growth, with the&lt;br/&gt;magnitude of Hurricane sedimentation (millions of metric tons) exceeding annual riverine and coastal sediment inputs, but the topic is still debated.  Through marsh coring along the freshwater to marine transect, this study?s main objectives include: (i) documenting the magnitude, character and extent of washover and flood sedimentation in coastal marshes in southeast Texas, and (ii) to measure the magnitude and inland extent of washover sedimentation in the lee of foredune barriers to evaluate whether relatively subtle increases in barrier dimensions can cause substantial reductions in the magnitude of washover sedimentation in marshes. The study will inform coastal management agencies on the use of barriers to block or reduce storm overwash, potentially reducing washover sediment magnitude and inland extent in adjacent marshes, at a time when such sedimentation may be a crucial factor in survivability of marshes in the face of accelerating sea-level rise. This study also aims at producing centuries-to-millennia-long multi-proxy records of hurricane-generated extreme events for southeastern Texas. These long-term records are vital for estimating the return period of such extreme events as Harvey and is critically important for hurricane- and flood-risk assessments and coastal management decision-making.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This RAPID project sought to document the complete sedimentary record of Hurricane Harvey that encompasses both the marine-dominated signals from the storm surge and overwash deposits along the coast and the freshwater-dominated flood deposits further inland.  The LSU team led by Dr. Kam-biu Liu undertook six field trips to six main study sites along the Texas coast and collected 73 sediment cores ranging in length from 4.5 to 0.3 m from coastal lakes and marshes.  Multi-proxy analyses were conducted on these cores in order to distinguish between the freshwater flood deposit and the saltwater storm surge deposit attributed to Harvey?s compound flooding event based on their sedimentology, geochemistry, and microfossil contents.

By contrast, most cores taken from the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in central Texas, the ?ground zero? of Hurricane Harvey?s landfall, show a distinct storm deposit identifiable visually and/or by a sharp rise in the Cl/Br ratio or the Ca/Fe ratio (both marine indicators).  This project has further developed the use of the Cl/Br ratio as a geochemical proxy for distinguishing between the saltwater versus freshwater contributions to storm deposition  A core taken from Round Lake in the Trinity River estuary east of Houston shows exceptional promise as it contains multiple storm deposits attributable to Hurricanes Harvey, Ike, and possibly other historical storms.  The Cl/Br ratio of the Harvey layer is only slightly elevated compared with the sharp spike associated with the Ike layer, suggesting that the storm surge-driven saltwater intrusion was mitigated by freshwater flooding during the Harvey event.  Pollen data from this core corroborated the geochemical data, suggesting that a multi-proxy approach, especially by coupling the biological proxies with geochemical proxies, is promising for deciphering the relative contributions between freshwater flooding and saltwater intrusion in compound flooding events.   The McFaddin National Wildlife Refuge component of this collaborative project was led by co-PI Dr. Harry Williams of the University of North Texas.  Here in easternmost Texas widespread flood deposits were found in coastal marshes resulting from terrestrial flood waters flowing from inland. The deposit ranged up to 7 cm in thickness and averaged 2.8 cm - the equivalent of seven years of ?normal? sedimentation in this marsh. This study provides valuable new information on the contribution of terrestrial floods to coastal marsh aggradation, a topic that has received little attention in previous studies of marsh growth.   This RAPID project has resulted in the publication of two refereed journal articles in Marine Geology (Williams and Liu, 2019) and Estuaries and Coasts (Yao et al., 2019), in addition to six presentations at national professional meetings.  In terms of its broader impact, this project has contributed to the training of four postdoctoral scholars, four graduate students (3 Ph.D. and 1 M.S.), and two undergraduate students at LSU.   Compound flooding events, like the complex interactions between fluvial flooding and storm surge caused by Hurricane Harvey, are becoming a major societal concern in the face of global climate changes.  This study contributes to improving our understanding of Harvey?s compound flooding event by sharpening the research methodology for investigating it in the sedimentary record.  By deciphering what happened in the past it helps society to better prepare for what will happen in the future.             Last Modified: 03/29/2020       Submitted by: Kam-Biu Liu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
