<AbstractNarration>3D Printing, also known as additive manufacturing, offers the potential for individuals and companies to design and produce customized parts in quantities as small as a single unit.  However, unlike conventional mass production, for which production machines are adjusted to maintain quality by periodically measuring the parts that are produced, the small lots produced in 3D Printing do not provide the opportunity to tune the production machines in the same way.  This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) will investigate a statistical method for adjusting the production quality of a 3D Printing machine based on experience in producing parts of different part types.  Such a tool has the capability to be offered to manufacturers as a cloud-based utility, with possible extension to aggregating data from similar machines at different sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental barrier to knowledge transfer between engineering processes lies in lurking variables, which are process variables that are unobserved due to infeasibility of measurement or insufficient knowledge. The project will model and mitigate the effects of lurking variables in terms of observable control variables to enable a novel gray-box model transfer strategy for additive manufacturing systems.  The proposed research tasks include: (1) establishing a theoretical formulation of effect equivalence to quantify effects of lurking variables, (2) exploring a statistical foundation for learning effect equivalence, (3) verifying effect equivalence models and their robustness, and (4) obtaining engineering insight from effect equivalence and developing a multi-resolution measurement strategy. The project is expected to produce a mathematical formulation of engineering effect equivalence, demonstrate the formulation in predicting geometric shape deformation of 3D products built by additive manufacturing machines, and a multi-resolution measurement strategy for equivalence-based additive manufacturing process control.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our joint collaborative research with the University of Southern California, Northwestern University, and Florida State University has provided a framework, and associated statistical methodology and algorithms, for knowledge transfer in cybermanufacturing systems.  Because of differences in product designs/varieties, materials, processes, and user conditions, a model developed under one machine?s data may not apply to another.  Rebuilding the model completely for another machine is not possible because of the limited data available.  We developed a statistical framework and associated methodology for transferring models that underlie quality control policies across different cybermanufacturing environments and processes. The framework and methodology were formulated by compensating the input across different models and demonstrating why that solves many of the underlying issues.  The framework describes the equivalent effects of lurking variables of the manufacturing environments in terms of control variables whose effects are more easily understood, modeled, and compensated. Separately conducted was a general analysis of additive manufacturing model calibration, where the model is an inexact representation of a true system for all parameters.  The study found a new methodology for how models can be calibrated that could be applied to an additive manufacturing setting.   The key outcomes and achievements include: a new sequential process improvement algorithm can construct satisfactory quality control policies; case studies based on simulations and real data for in-plane deviations in stereolithography processes demonstrate the potential of our framework and methodologies for advancing quality control in cyber-physical additive manufacturing systems; general-purpose methodology for inexact model calibration.  Ultimately, the results of our research from studies on cyber-manufacturing additive manufacturing data and simulations indicate that the outcomes of this project can advance comprehensive quality control for cybermanufacturing systems, and consequently contribute to smarter cybermanufacturing systems.
