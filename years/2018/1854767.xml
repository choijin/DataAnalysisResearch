<AbstractNarration>Innovative research on the complex interaction of socio-economic and global environmental trends on biodiversity and ecosystem services is needed to help develop more informative scenarios for addressing environmental and human development challenges. To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. Employing this methodology, this research project, which is an international coalition between scientists in the US and six European nations, seeks to establish a process that accounts for multiple viewpoints in decision-making on the future of conservation and resource management using sites in the US, Sweden, Spain, and the Netherlands as case studies, with the US site consisting of the Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska. Selected sites were chosen because protected wilderness areas designations in the US and Europe are among the most ambitious in the world, yet these areas face unprecedented threats from changing socio-ecological dynamics and diverging societal visions for conservation. Common challenges for protected wilderness areas include inconsistent priorities between local and national governments, a need to expand stakeholder involvement in conservation initiatives, and an imbalance between biodiversity conservation goals and economic objectives. Thus, over a three-year period this research will develop processes and forums that link local, national, US, and European policy makers with researchers, civil society members, and the private sector to foster dialogue that seeks to accommodate multiple visions for biodiversity conservation. The project will construct strategies that span interest groups and enable protected area management agencies to develop policy that is responsive to community needs and preferences for future growth using participatory scenario modelling, multi-narrative platforms, knowledge co-creation, and capacity building through local and inter-site knowledge alliances. Research results will deliver useful means and models for advancing policy, developing communities of practice, and contribute to the advancement of scientific literature in biodiversity and social science conservation. The Program found the broader impacts of the work to be strong. These include international collaboration with scientists from six nations (Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK, and Switzerland), improving the interaction between local communities; the private sector; conservation groups; and government such that common visions and sustainable policies can be envisioned and enacted to protect wilderness areas. The project also provides training of a postdoctoral researcher in international transdisciplinary conservation work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on "Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Using this methodology, this research project involves seven integrated work packages that are designed to engage and learn from various stakeholders and local communities associated with protected wilderness areas to help them collectively identify ways to balance social, ecological, and economic well-being. This approach involves novel strategies for communicating and engaging with inter-site and local site knowledge alliances as well as mobilizing and synthesizing multiple types of knowledge and ways of engaging with and better knowing the benefits and resources of protected areas. A model for inclusive conservation will be developed through site-based, social-ecological inventories, systematic scientific literature reviews, and oral histories of diverse stakeholders including those of environmental managers, indigenous peoples, non-native subsistence users, industry, local businesses, local government, and educators. The hands-on tool, STREAMLINE, will be used to examine the consequences of different scenarios and visions for protected areas that take into account all perspectives. Results will be quantified and visualized in easy-to-use, visually appealing, graphical formats. The work will also include development of experiments to determine how, why, and to what extent values of different stakeholders shift over time. This will be achieved using participatory mapping methods (e.g., Maptionnaire) and the translation of stakeholder visions into potential management strategies that incorporate estimates of uncertainty. An additional goal of the project is to establish workable governance models using social network analysis, characterizing power relationships, and providing for co-creation of knowledge which is essential for viable conservation approaches. Research results will be broadly disseminated to stakeholders and the public via outlets such as factsheets, policy briefs, webinars, film, and festivals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
