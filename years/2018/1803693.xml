<AbstractNarration>Bacteria resistance to antibiotic drugs is a major health challenge to the United States affecting the lives of many people each year. Since bacteria develop resistance to drugs and chemicals over time, it is paramount to the health and well being of our society to find new solutions to effectively kill such bacteria. Nanomaterials that have very few layers of atoms offer exciting new properties to fight against bacteria. This research project aims to understand how atomically-thin nanomaterials interact with bacteria. If this research is successful, it facilitates the design of new antibacterial agents to kill drug-resistant bacteria. This research also has the potential to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The principal investigators will recruit and mentor female and underrepresented students during the course of this research. In addition, the research findings will be showcased and discussed in relevant undergraduate and graduate classes to further stimulate a new generation of students with the fundamental knowledge to engage in this field. To increase public awareness, the principal investigators will disseminate the new results of this project through social media, press coverage, and news releases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria pose a significant threat to the well being of humanity killing many people each year. Through biochemical evolution, such bacteria usually develop new defensive mechanisms to survive the effects of chemical-based antibiotic drugs. As such, physical-based methods to kill bacteria enable new frontiers to suppress the bacteria resistance. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials depending on their chemistry and surface properties provide new means to fight bacteria. The goal of this project is to investigate how 2D nanomaterials interact with bacteria. This project will study the interaction of bacteria with certain 2D nanomaterials by direct imaging of hydrated bacteria at high resolutions. It is expected that the high surface reactivity of 2D nanomaterials lead to degradation of bacteria membrane upon contact and eliminate the creation of superbugs by suppressing the capability of bacteria to develop resistance. For broader impacts, the principal investigators will involve students at both undergraduate and graduate levels in training and education on the state-of-the art microscopy techniques for health sciences. Scientific visits and hands-on experience on the lab activities will be showcased for minority and underrepresented students. The finding of this research will be incorporated in a bioengineering graduate course that has been developed for senior undergraduate and graduate students. The principal investigators are committed to recruit female/minority students for undergraduate education through well-established outreach programs at the University of Illinois at Chicago.</AbstractNarration>
