<AbstractNarration>This is funding to support travel for about 10 students enrolled in MS or PhD programs in U.S. educational institutions, to present their accepted papers and posters and/or to attend the Doctoral Consortium associated with the 26th International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (UMAP 2018), to be held July 8-11, 2018 at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, and which is sponsored by ACM SIGCHI and SIGWEB.  User interfaces that adapt themselves to available user information (such as special needs or individual preferences) are becoming increasingly important, so much so that adaptability has become a selling point for software products.  A system with the ability to construct and consult a user model (an explicit representation of properties of a particular user or group of users) can adapt diverse aspects of its performance and enhance its effectiveness, usability and/or acceptance in a variety of situations (e.g., to reduce information overload, to improve the quality of information retrieval, filtering and annotation, and to generate useful information visualizations).  Applications for user modeling range from electronic commerce and intelligent learning environments to health care and assistive technologies.  Relevant platforms for user modeling include mobile and wearable systems and smart environments, as well as individual desktop systems, groupware, adaptive hypermedia, and other web-based systems.  The annual UMAP conference is the premier forum at which academic and industrial researchers from all these fields gather to present their latest research and to exchange their complementary insights on user modeling issues. Attending and presenting their work at UMAP will have a significant impact on the careers of the future generation of user modeling, adaptation, and personalization researchers.  More information about the conference is available online at http://www.um.org/umap2018/.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student authors at UMAP and attendees in the Doctoral Consortium will both have the opportunity to present their work to a knowledgeable audience and through lively discussions get useful comments at an early stage of their research when it will be most useful.  Just as importantly, they will have a chance to meet established researchers and other graduate students doing similar work, to exchange ideas and to make contacts that will be invaluable to them as they progress in their scientific careers.  Interacting with young researchers is also beneficial to experienced investigators, by providing fresh ideas and new perspectives.  Thus, the Doctoral Consortium is a great confidence builder for the students involved, and highly stimulating to the senior researchers as well.   Students whose work has been selected for presentation at the Doctoral Consortium will be invited to write a paper that will be published in the UMAP 2018 conference proceedings, which will be included in the ACM Digital Library.  They will have a 30-minute window in which to present their work (with a short demonstration where appropriate), including time for questions and discussion.  During the question/discussion period and in subsequent informal interactions, organizing committee members and other participants will provide constructive comments on each student's work and attempt to address aspects on which the student has requested advice.  The organizers have reaffirmed the long-standing and demonstrated UMAP commitment to diversity; to this end, they will make special efforts to recruit women and members of under-represented groups when selecting the candidates to receive financial support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aimed to fund graduate students from U.S. institutions to present their work at the 26th International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (UMAP), held in Singapore, July 8-11, 2018. The travel support focused on helping students enrolled in Ph.D. programs in the US who are placed at disadvantage due to the conference location in Singapore. Remaining grants will also be available for students enrolled in graduate and/or undergraduate programs in the US. There was a special goal to select women and members of under-represented communities from the potential candidates.    Due to the fact that there was a remaining balance in the grant after the ACM UMAP conference in 2018, the remaining grant was used to support graduate students from U.S. institutions to present their work in ACM UMAP conference in 2019.   User modeling has been found to enhance the effectiveness and usability of software systems in a variety of situations.  A user model is an explicit representation of a particular user, and a system that constructs and consults user models can adapt diverse aspects of its behavior to better suit each individual user.  Applications for user modeling range from electronic commerce and intelligent learning environments to health care and assistive technologies.  Relevant platforms for user modeling include mobile and wearable systems and smart environments, as well as individual desktop systems, groupware, adaptive hypermedia, and other web-based systems.The International Conferences on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (UMAP) provide a forum in which academic and industrial researchers from all of these fields can exchange their complementary insights on user modeling issues.  The size and format of the meetings support intensive discussion, which often continues long after the conference has ended.  Experience with previous conferences in the UMAP, UM and AH series has shown that they provide an exceptionally good environment for exchanging ideas and forming new collaborations.  This is in sharp contrast with broader and larger conferences, where it is often difficult to find researchers with similar interests.   Scheduled events for ACM UMAP 2018 and 2019 included keynote talks by world-renowned researchers, full and short oral presentations, poster presentations, workshops, tutorials, interactive events, and the Doctoral Consortium (DC). The DC included oral presentations and poster sessions in which students presented their work and one-on-one meetings with an assigned mentor. Funded students had the opportunity to attend sessions with keynotes, papers, posters, tutorials, and workshops as well as informally interact with accomplished researchers. This activity supports the mission of NSF and other granting agencies to "train more advanced professionals in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)."
