<AbstractNarration>Western Boundary Currents (WBCs) such as the Gulf Stream are regions of intense air-sea exchange and some of the strongest CO2 uptake in the world ocean.  Yet basic questions persist about the mechanisms governing this uptake, partly because of the difficulty of making sustained measurement in these dynamic regions. This project will demonstrate that Saildrone, a fast-moving (3-5 knots), high-endurance (over 3 months) autonomous surface platform that measures lower atmosphere and surface ocean properties, can provide a much-needed, novel WBC observing strategy. With the integration of a state-of-the-art CO2 sensor designed for autonomous use by NOAA's Pacific Marine Environment Lab (PMEL),  Saildrone could provide as a potentially transformative solution to observing air-sea fluxes across the remote and chronically-undersampled WBCs of the Southern Hemisphere. Thus, the proposed work is an important step toward closing the global ocean carbon budget. The project will also include some outreach to the general public. The principal investigator is working with the University of Rhode Island Office of Marine Programs to coordinate a public event to coincide with the recovery of the Saildrone in Newport. She also plans to visit a local elementary school to do a map-reading exercise with a bilingual second grade, in which they pick a Saildrone waypoint and track its progress toward it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this study is to use Saildrone to measure wintertime surface heat and CO2 fluxes across the Gulf Stream. Because of the short space and time scales characterizing their variability, WBCs present tremendous observing challenges that are not addressed with Argo float measurements.  A state-of-the-art, self-calibrating CO2 sensor developed by PMEL has collected climate-quality data for hundreds of days on moored buoys, was recently adapted for use on the Saildrone, and preliminary missions show that it is capable of collecting climate quality pCO2 data (accurate to &lt; 2 micro atm) aboard the platform.  The principal investigator of this project recently won the Saildrone award to sail a 30-day mission across the Gulf Stream in winter 2019. This RAPID project funds the urgent task of preparing and integrating the Autonomous Surface Vehicle CO2 sensor system (ASVCO2) in time for the deployment. The Saildrone mission can reveal, for the first time, the importance of CO2 uptake along the Lagrangian pathway of the Gulf Stream relative to uptake during mode water formation. The Gulf Stream is also an ideal region to test the capability of the Saildrone platform as a WBC air-sea flux observing strategy, as there are nearby observing assets that will provide independent data for calibration and validation and a recent wintertime ship-based flux survey to provide valuable data for comparison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF award provided the funding to integrate a sensor system capable of measuring ocean and atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations aboard an unmanned wind-powered surface vehicle, called Saildrone. Pictured just before its launch in Newport, RI (Figure 1), Saildrone also carries a large payload of instruments, including those capable of measuring wind speed, atmospheric temperature and relative humidity, ocean currents to a depth of 80 m, sea surface temperature, salinity and oxygen.  We sent this autonomous platform in a zipper pattern across the Gulf Stream in January/February 2019 with a set of pre-determined waypoints that were adapted on-the-fly to respond to the rapidly changing position of the Gulf Stream (Figure 2).   Along its path, the Saildrone collected high quality and high-resolution measurements of the surface ocean and lower atmosphere, which were transmitted back to our team on land in real time.  We have used these data to calculate the flux of CO2 and heat between the ocean and atmosphere.  The Gulf Stream is an extraordinarily dynamic region, especially in winter, when a frigid atmosphere passing over the warm ocean generates powerful storms.  These storms cool the underlying ocean and pump CO2 into its turbulent surface.  They also create a dangerous sea state that has hindered the ability of manned research vessels to collect wintertime observations in the past.  Indeed, our planned month-long Saildrone mission was cut short, when a storm generated 40-foot waves that damaged the platform after 19 days.  It was the third intense storm the Saildrone experienced on the short mission, and it sailed through the first two without harm.  These operational hazards explain why this Saildrone mission was the first to collect both ocean and atmosphere CO2 data in February in the Gulf Stream, despite that this region is known to be a hotspot of ocean carbon uptake in winter.  With the ocean taking up more than a quarter of all anthropogenic CO2 emissions since the start of the industrial revolution, knowing how this uptake happens is critical for predicting its ability to continue absorbing CO2 in the future. The project generated considerable excitement with the public through a press event at the Saildrone launch from Newport, RI, that resulted in coverage by local TV news outlets and newspapers, a broader impact of the work.  The PI also visited two elementary school classrooms to do demonstrations on ocean waves, how we make measurements at sea, and the density of seawater, the latter timed to align with a unit in the standard state curriculum on density. Finally, a PhD student is basing the first chapter of her dissertation on carbon uptake in the Gulf Stream from these data, and a visiting undergraduate research fellow did a summer project on air-sea heat exchange from the data.  This project has provided data to better inform our estimates of air-sea heat and carbon exchange and reduce their uncertainty in the future.  So far, our work suggests that the wintertime ocean CO2 uptake in the Gulf Stream in February 2019 was 10-20% higher than expected from reconstructions based on other variables, such as sea surface temperature.  Equally important, the Saildrone mission has provided a detailed view of where the CO2 uptake is most intense, and the ocean and atmosphere dynamics that accompany this uptake.  We are using this information to inform future missions and unravel the processes governing the uptake.        Last Modified: 02/27/2020       Submitted by: Jaime B Palter]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
