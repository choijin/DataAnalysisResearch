<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop an extended depth imaging variation of optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT is an optical imaging method that can visualize tissue structures up to 1mm deep with microscopic resolution. It has been well adapted for retinal imaging but although available for skin imaging application, the performance and price point are not sufficient to encourage market adoption. Building on NSF supported research at Duke University, this project will extend the depth range of OCT from the current 1-2 mm, which is only the most superficial layer of skin, to 3-4 mm, enabling full imaging of skin layers down to the dermal junction. This will enable dermatologists to access OCT without a large financial outlay and provide a non-invasive imaging modality in the office setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extended depth imaging is also applicable to dental imaging and may allow dentists to reduce the need for X-ray imaging by providing cross sectional images of teeth and gums. Since these OCT instruments are highly portable, the deep imaging system can be widely used, across lab benches, in the field or shared throughout a medical office. This project will support the development of new products and the teams that design and build them. Extended depth imaging OCT uses a novel design to dramatically increase the depth penetration of OCT into skin, teeth and other samples. By using distinct illumination and collection apertures, extended depth (or dual axis) OCT can triangulate the signal to layers deep beneath the tissue surface. Compared to previous OCT systems, this increases the imaging depth by a factor of 2. This innovation will be combined with proprietary spectrometer design, which was developed to take advantage of 3D printing methods, to develop a disruptive new instrument for imaging with the performance and price necessary for commercial success in clinical dermatology and dentistry. This proposal will build a prototype system and test it on several types of animal tissue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research goal of this project was to realize a DA-OCT (dual-axis optical coherence tomography) system prototype that is suitable for commercialization. DA-OCT uses a novel scanner design to dramatically extend the depth penetration of OCT into skin.  By using distinct illumination and collection apertures the imaging signal may be triangulated in layers deep beneath the tissue surface.  Substantially more photons are available leading to increased imaging depth.  This technoloy may lead to a disruptive new instrument for tissue imaging with the performance and price necessary for commercial success in clinical dermatology, dentistry, and other applications.  To build this instrument we combined the novel scanning geometry with Lumedica?s proprietary spectrometer design to implement a compact, integrated system.  Achieving the necessary cost targets for commercial viablitly required replacing the high cost line scan array, light source and computer of a typical OCT system with lower cost components that still meet the required performance metric.  In particular a new InGaAs line scan array was used with a camera board that we developed in house.  New software was implmented enabling real time image processing and a novel approach for reducing speckle in OCT images in real time.  Once this prototype was built, system performance was validated by imaging various animal tissues.          Last Modified: 06/04/2019       Submitted by: William Brown]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
