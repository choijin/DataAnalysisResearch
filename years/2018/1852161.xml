<AbstractNarration>This REU Site: Engineering Sensors, Systems, and Signal Processing for Speech Pathology at the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa will immerse a diverse cohort of undergraduate students in research at the interface of engineering/computer science and speech pathology.  Research projects will apply engineering principles to develop technologies to improve screening, diagnosis, and therapy for populations impacted by communication, voice, and swallowing disorders.  These experiences will provide an opportunity for students to contribute to projects that have direct applications to improve society and increase student's awareness of social responsibility in engineering.  Students will receive technical and clinical mentorship from faculty in both engineering/computer science and speech pathology, providing truly interdisciplinary research experiences.  Additionally, professional development training and clinical shadowing will expand the range of student experiences to prepare them for conducting research and understanding the critical issues faced by patients and clinicians.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goals of the proposed NSF REU site are to: 1) engage undergraduate students from science/engineering in speech pathology practice to understand critical issues faced by patients and clinicians, 2) integrate the experiences and information from these groups to apply engineering principles to develop technologies to improve screening, diagnosis, and therapy in speech pathology research, 3) develop communication skills to support interactions with professionals, clinicians, and the wider-public, 4) increase the number of students from under-represented groups in STEM and research-limited institutions participating in research, and 5) increase awareness of social responsibility in engineering and raise student interest in pursuing graduate studies.  During clinical practice, clinicians utilize a range of technologies including audio recording/acoustic analysis, electromyography, and video imaging/analysis. While there are tools available for speech pathologists, their research needs that require application-specific sensors, systems, and signal-processing methods are often under-served as a result of disconnects between speech pathology and engineering/computer science.  This REU Site aims to bridge that disconnect by introducing undergraduate students to interdisciplinary research requiring image analysis, sensor design, algorithm development, and information processing applied to research investigating hearing assessment, voice problems, swallowing problems, speech language processing, pediatric feeding, and stuttering events.  Additionally, students will interact with clinicians and patients during the REU through shadowing experiences coordinated at the Speech and Hearing Center to introduce students to the wide range of practice of these professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
