<AbstractNarration>The conference "Representations, Geometry, and Quantization" will take place May 28 - June 1, 2018, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Since the introduction of quantum mechanics a hundred years ago, a fundamental problem has been to understand the relationship between classical physics, which is extraordinarily accurate and complete as a description of the world at large scales and low energies, and quantum physics, which offers an apparently different description of the world, including small scales and high energies. This relationship has many parallels in mathematics, and understanding those parallels is a source of inspiration in both mathematics and physics. The conference will bring together world leaders in this subject to present their research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some particular recent developments to be discussed include: an algorithm to identify unitary representations of real reductive Lie groups; improved understanding of character theory for tilting modules; geometric quantization for noncompact manifolds; and mirror symmetry for Grassmannians. The conference web site is https://math.mit.edu/conferences/kostant/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A week-long conference entitled "Representations, geometry, and quantization" has been held in Cambridge, MA in May 2018. The meeting featured lectures by many of the world's most influential contributors to a subject at the heart of a large part of modern mathematics.   Throughout its history representation theory has thrived on the interplay of ideas and methods from a variety of related subjects. In particular, quantum physics provided a key impetus for development of representation theory at early stages of the subject's history; it continues to crucially influence its progress today. No less important are its connections to differential and algebraic geometry and topology. In fact, its unique position at the crossroads between geometry, topology, mathematical physics and algebra is arguably among the reasons for the many successes of representation theory in the recent decades.  The talks described recent progress in these different aspects of representation theory and related subjects. The conference was a major event promoting progress in each of these directions, as well as interaction between different areas of research within representation theory.  Women and/or junior mathematicians (graduate students or postdocs) constituted a significant portion of conference participants. Thus broader impacts of the conference include promoting participation of underrepresented groups in the mathematical research and contribution to preparation of the next generation of experts.
