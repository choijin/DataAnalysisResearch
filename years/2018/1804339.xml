<AbstractNarration>"Workshop on Transport and Localization in Random Media: Theory and Applications" will be held at Columbia University in New York City from May 1st to May 3rd, 2018. Random environments are ubiquitous to many physical systems: gases, condensed matter, chemical reaction, etc. The inherent complexity of these phenomena motivates the use of noise in their mathematical description. A fundamental challenge is to interpret how this noise affects the dynamical aspects of the system. In condensed matter physics, the lack of synchrony between random scatterers can eliminate all propagation of waves-- a phenomena known as Anderson localization. On the other hand, disordered gases exhibit high diffusivity properties, with applications in imaging. A mathematical understanding has impact on technological applications in atmospheric science, wireless communications in urban environments, physiological imaging and electronic transport in nano-structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will present recent developments on wave propagation, scattering and diffusion in random medias at the interface of probability theory, mathematical physics and partial differential equations. Accessible lectures by leading mathematicians will catalyze interactions among both junior and senior researchers in fundamental and applied fields.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop website is: http://www.ki-net.umd.edu/content/conf?event_id=843&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
