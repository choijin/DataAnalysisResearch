<AbstractNarration>For nearly four decades, NSF has effectively supported the broad availability and innovative uses of leading edge computational resources to accelerate advances in science and engineering. These NSF investments have spanned discipline-specific instruments and facilities; computational systems of varying capabilities and architectures optimized for different applications; virtual organizations for allocating resources and interfacing with users; and network backbones connecting and providing access to these resources. Recent profound advances across science and engineering interests and priorities, as well as in enabling technologies, contribute to the current view of cyberinfrastructure supporting research as appropriately embodying a model of an "ecosystem" constituting interconnected, appropriately synergistically evolving, elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this workshop is to further foster and promote the NSF supported cyberinfrastructure ecosystem, including its makeup of interconnected, appropriately evolving, elements, to continue to be both motivated by scientific interests and priorities, as well as to evolve responsively to an increasing pace of technologies developments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported the organization and hosting of a workshop convened at NSF on May 30-31, 2018 in Alexandria, VA. The overarching objective of the workshop was to rethink the nature and composition of the NSF-supported computational science and engineering ecosystem given changing application requirements and resources and technology landscapes.  The workshop included roughly 50 participants, drawn from high-performance computing (HPC) centers, campus computing facilities, cloud service providers (academic and commercial), and distributed resource providers.  Participants spanned both large research institutions and smaller universities.    Organized by Daniel Reed (University of Iowa and University of Utah, chair), David Lifka (Cornell University), David Swanson (University of Nebraska), Rommie Amaro (University of California at San Diego), and Nancy Wilkins-Diehr (University of California at San Diego/San Diego Supercomputing Center), the workshop was motivated by the following two observations.  First, there have been dramatic changes in the number and nature of science and engineering applications using NSF-funded computing resources, as well as their resource needs.  Second, there have been dramatic changes in the landscape of computing technologies, resources, and delivery mechanisms, spanning large scientific instruments, ubiquitous sensors, and cloud services, among others.   The result of the workshop was a written report highlighting ideas and potential future directions that would benefit the national science and engineering research and education community.  The final workshop report, as well as the workshop agenda and participant list, is hosted on the following web site: https://uiowa.edu/nsfcyberinfrastructure/       Last Modified: 07/01/2019       Submitted by: Daniel A Reed]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
