<AbstractNarration>As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.  The theme of this conference project by the New York Hall of Science will be exploring how to better design exhibits to promote "public engagement with science."  Here, "public engagement with science" refers to opportunities that go beyond traditional approaches to the public understanding of science.  The event will invite professionals to consider how to shift exhibit designs toward engaging visitors with STEM in ways that emphasize the intersection of STEM innovation with visitors' daily lives, their personal agency, and their interdependence with their personal social networks and the institutions that advance STEM knowledge and innovation. The conference and its pre- and post-conference activities will bring together curators, exhibition developers, community outreach professionals, museum administrators, and learning scientists from the United States and Canada. They will work together to identify design principles and key obstacles to designing exhibits that can better help science museums achieve two goals: 1) making visitors' diverse and personal questions, concerns, and perspectives central to their experience of the exhibits; and 2) engaging visitors as contributors to the exhibit experience in ways that make their contributions visible and consequential. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During this two-day event attendees will consider how exhibits can support broader and more diverse public participation in critical debates about the roles of STEM discovery and innovation in society.  The effort is grounded in recent work on public engagement with science; on reorganizing museums to become sites for participation and contribution by visitors, and particularly by institutions' local communities; and on making and engineering design programming within museums. The goal is to chart a course toward a vision of the future of science museums in which they maintain their status as sources of trusted information, while also fulfilling their potential as sites of genuine participation and social interaction, in which visitors make meaningful contributions to the substance and workings of the museum floor while also engaging with, learning about and holding themselves accountable to the core concepts and practices of the STEM disciplines.  The conference will build the capacity and collaborative engagement of a network of science centers whose work is central to achieving the museum field's ultimate goal of engaging the public of all ages in learning STEM in informal environments.  The conference and associated activities will be evaluated by staff at the New York Hall of Science, with oversight by an external advisory committee of research and development professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   In May, 2019, the New York Hall of Science held a conference that brought together an international group of thirty science museum professionals, including exhibit designers and developers, researchers, and institutional leaders.

During this two-day event, participants considered how exhibits can support broader and more diverse public participation in critical debates about the roles of STEM discovery and innovation in society.  The conference agenda engaged attendees in a process to help us chart a collective course toward a vision of the future of science museums in which we maintain our status as sources of trusted information, while also fulfilling our potential as sites of genuine participation and social interaction, in which visitors make meaningful contributions to the substance and workings of the museum floor while also engaging with, learning about and holding themselves accountable to the core concepts and practices of the STEM disciplines. This conversation builds on a history of science centers? deep investment in making science relevant and accessible to its audiences. Our goal was to advance this conversation by looking together, concretely, at the ways that the perspectives of individuals or teams of museum professionals may often exclude from consideration the very different perspectives and needs that museum visitors may bring with them ? or that may be keeping many individuals from visiting our science centers in the first place. We aimed to facilitate preliminary thought and dialogue surrounding how participants perceive inclusivity and agency in their respective roles by reflecting on whether they think a particular exhibit they helped to create is or is not inclusive, how it succeeds or fails in building agency, and what the design process entailed. During the conference activities, we aimed to help participants form a common understanding of language, explore how we approach exhibit design, and be better equipped to have conversations about creating operationally feasible, actionable ideas for redesigning exhibits that are more inclusive, participatory, and with more opportunities for agency. Over the course of the two-day event the group had a sustained conversation about how to name and break down barriers that create inequitable access to learning opportunities in science centers. While the impact of this meeting on the field is not easily measurable, attendees felt strongly that the conversation was a needed one and that the experience had pushed their thinking. The attendees recommended creating a product that would support other science centers in leading a similar learning experience within other science centers, to continue the conversation with a goal of having a concrete impact on both the process and the outcome of exhibit designers? and developers? work in science centers.

We noted during this discussion that exhibit developers and designers have not typically used more research-based tools like theories of action or logic models to push themselves to make explicit the connections they build among design choices, visitor behavior, and intended goals. This conversation made it possible to begin talking much more explicitly about why exhibit designers and developers might value certain kinds of visitor behavior, and to them ask whether their expectations might, or might not, align with visitors? own experiences of their behavior.
