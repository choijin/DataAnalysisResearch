<AbstractNarration>Overview:&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is a request for funds for Shipboard Operations on the RV Blue Heron, an 86ft-research&lt;br/&gt;vessel that is owned by the University of Minnesota and operated by the Large Lakes Observatory (LLO).&lt;br/&gt;The award will cover the 2018 to 2022 field seasons, with annual reports providing detailed information&lt;br/&gt;for the 2019 to 2022 seasons. During the 2018 calendar year, two NSF-peered reviewed funded projects have requested&lt;br/&gt;the ship for 22 days:&lt;br/&gt;* Samuel Kelly (Univ. of Minnesota): 9 days, 'Collaborative research: Coastal inertial-band dynamics:&lt;br/&gt;separating forced and free responses in a natural laboratory' (OCE/PO-1635560).&lt;br/&gt;* Tedy Ozersky (Univ. of Minnesota): 13 days, 'Ecosystem-scale responses of coupled C-N-P cycles to&lt;br/&gt;dramatic shifts in benthic communities: the Upper Great Lakes' (OCE/CO-1737368).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Work done aboard the R/V Blue Heron is in support of NSF funded research programs. The intellectual&lt;br/&gt;merit for these research programs is normally reviewed separately as part of a research proposal to NSF.&lt;br/&gt;Kelly's project (OCE/PO-1635560) will quantify coastal kinetic-energy pathways using realistic&lt;br/&gt;numerical simulations and extensive direct observations of winds, turbulence and near-inertial waves&lt;br/&gt;along lacustrine coastlines and rough coastal bathymetry. The project will improve our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;near inertial motions throughout the coastal ocean and in large lakes. Ozersky's project (OCE/CO-&lt;br/&gt;1737368) will study the effects of invasive zebra and quagga mussels on the biology and chemistry of the&lt;br/&gt;Great Lakes. The impact of benthic communities on carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in freshwater&lt;br/&gt;systems at the ecosystem level are understudied and the mechanisms for how these nutrients are affected&lt;br/&gt;by the introduction of dreissenid mussel invasives are unclear. Ozersky's work will advance the&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the ecology of the Great Lakes and improve models of sediment-water column&lt;br/&gt;interactions in aquatic ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two projects will involve students in all aspects of the research. In addition to facilitating research&lt;br/&gt;projects on the Great Lakes, the R/V Blue Heron has numerous educational or 'class cruises' during the&lt;br/&gt;year (9 during 2017), enabling undergraduate and graduate students to participate in work on a research&lt;br/&gt;vessel with equipment typically used on larger, ocean going, research vessels. Beyond the class cruises,&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate students participate on almost every RV Blue Heron cruise as research&lt;br/&gt;assistants and, sometimes, chief scientist. Additionally, we have hosted Chief Scientist Training cruises&lt;br/&gt;over the last four years, during which early career scientists (senior graduate students, post-docs, and 1st&lt;br/&gt;year faculty) are educated about UNOLS and directly immersed in planning and undertaking a scientific&lt;br/&gt;expedition. Dockside, we give tours to University of Minnesota students, undergraduates from other&lt;br/&gt;institutions and have established a dock-side monthly tour and seminar series for members of the general&lt;br/&gt;public. Over the last five years, approximately 4,500 members of the public have toured the vessel as&lt;br/&gt;part of the seminar series.&lt;br/&gt;Regarding specific broader impacts, Kelly's project (OCE/PO-1635560) will help improve the&lt;br/&gt;interpretation of numerical models used in coastal settings. Ozersky's project (OCE/CO-1737368) will&lt;br/&gt;create online content for educators and the public, and will host outreach events at Duluth's Great Lakes&lt;br/&gt;Aquarium, Milwaukee's Discovery World Science Museum and Chicago's Shedd Aquarium and Navy&lt;br/&gt;Pier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
