<AbstractNarration>On the main, this research project lies in the broad interdisciplinary area between geometric topology and quantum physics. Many of the motivating conjectures come from physics, and their mathematical solutions would be of interest to theoretical physicists. A second part of the project concerns the topological characteristics of biopolymers like DNA and proteins. This can be important from a pharmaceutical perspective, as some drugs can be designed to target topological characteristics which affect specific biological functions.   Besides its research goals, the project has a strong educational component.  Many of the proposed problems are intended for research with undergraduate students. Through her research, teaching and other outreach activities, the PI intends to expand the reach of mathematics, for example to historically under-represented groups and to other audiences not usually exposed to cutting edge mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore the extent to which the Kauffman skein algebra and its generalizations can serve as intermediaries between quantum topology and hyperbolic geometry.   The PI will study the representation theory of the Kauffman skein algebra, paying particular attention to the representation coming from the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev theory. The long-term, overarching goal is to construct and classify all representations of the Kauffman skein algebra, a goal which this project will advance. The project considers the algebraic structure of the Kauffman skein algebra and of its generalizations (e.g., ones that allow arcs on the surface).  In addition, the project includes problems investigating which types of topologically complex structures, like knots, links, and non-planar graphs, are possible in biopolymers like DNA and proteins.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Topology studies properties of shape that are unaffected by continuous deformations like bending and twisting. This project investigated applications of topology to two different scientific fields, quantum physics and molecular biology.   The PI and collaborators produced eleven articles in the field of quantum topology as a result of this project.   Nine of those articles were about the Kauffman bracket skein algebra and its generalizations, which are closely related to certain topological quantum field theories used to explain curved spacetimes.  The other two papers were about algorithms for a theoretical topological model of quantum computers that is believed to be particularly resistant to errors.  Thirteen undergraduate students were involved in the quantum topology research, and two of the eleven articles were coauthored with students.   This project also used topology to analyze the shapes of biomolecules like DNA and proteins, which are often entangled.   In particular, the PI and collaborators proposed a new folding pathway for knotted proteins based on their topology. This research has potential pharmaceutical applications, since problems during the folding of proteins is known to cause many human diseases. The PI and collaborators also organized a conference about the topology of biopolymers, which led to an edited book on that subject. The project funded research for four undergraduate students to study slipknotting in proteins.   A major part of the NSF grant was used to fund undergraduate students to conduct research during the academic year and over the summers, and to present their work at conferences.  Eight of the students went on to PhD programs in mathematics or closely related STEM fields, and four more are considering graduate school after they graduate.  The project also funded travel for collaborative research for the PI, her collaborators, and her students, and for them to present research results at a number of conferences, seminars, and departmental colloquiua.   Funding has also allowed the  PI to continue activities to promote mathematics, particularly through her mentoring of students and junior researchers, organizing four conferences to encourage research collaborations, and speaking about careers in mathematics at panels and other venues.
