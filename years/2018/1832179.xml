<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating piezoelectric ceramic science to fill the need for high performance sensors, actuators and transducers.  The piezoelectric effect is the ability of certain materials to generate an electric charge in response to an applied mechanical stress.  Piezoelectric ceramics are important because they play critical role in daily use devices including automobiles, aircrafts, medical instruments, food processing, and house-hold electronics. This project will result in scale-up of the manufacturing process of a particular type of piezoelectric ceramic: textured piezoelectric ceramics. Textured ceramics have the following unique features: three-to-five times higher transduction coefficients, thermal stability over high temperatures, and mechanical robustness as compared to randomly oriented polycrystalline ceramics. These features provide the following advantages: higher efficiency, resolution, cost savings, miniaturization, and power density. Textured ceramics can be synthesized using the same process as that established for random ceramics and thus do not require any new tooling or equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The sintering stages in achieving textured ceramics will be analyzed to identify the challenges associated with scaling the manufacturing process to ensure consistent production. This includes establishing the process for synthesizing the seeds in large quantities with adequate morphology and dimension, and tailoring the binder-burnout and sintering profiles. The effect of processing variables that play a deterministic role in achieving the large grain brick-wall like microstructure will be evaluated. Matrix/seed template interfaces in the microstructure will be investigated using high resolution microscopy to understand the nature of domain wall motion with applied electric field. This, in turn, will provide assessment of the processes controlling the mechanical and electrical aging behavior. In conjunction with the time-temperature dependent sintering studies, the field-stress dependent domain migration studies will provide a full understanding of the electromechanical behavior of the textured ceramics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduate and graduate students, will receive innovation and entrepreneurship experiences through Virginia Tech's Catalyst program, KnowledgeWorks entrepreneurship events, participation in the Nexus Conference, and participation in the iScholars program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages Harris Corporation, Prime Photonics, and the Virginia Tech Intellectual Property Office to augment the team's research capability, provide access to industrial testing and manufacturing environment, and guide commercialization aspects in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="Default">Piezoelectric materials provide two-way efficient conversion of mechanical to electrical energy or vice-versa. Owing to this unique ability, piezoelectric components are relevant in our daily lives and are part of commonly used electromechanical systems and appliances such as automobiles, medical imaging, house-hold appliances, cellular communication, musical instruments, motors, machining and drilling, energy harvesting, etc. In applications where high voltages are applied on the piezoelectric materials, such as ultrasonic cleaners, non-destructive testing, machining tools, underwater communication and motors, understanding the changes in magnitude of electromechanical properties under high electric fields and high temperatures becomes extremely important. Ideally, these changes should be small and electromechanical properties should maintain their starting values over the entire operating regime. This was the overarching goal of this program to develop piezoelectric materials with outstanding electromechanical properties and high stability under increasing electric field and temperature. Piezoelectric ceramic materials are generally synthesized with random microstructure, implying that grains in the ceramic have different crystallographic orientation. This averages out the overall electromechanical response. However, if the piezoelectric ceramics can be synthesized with prescribed crystallographic orientation, then the electromechanical response will be maximized. Piezoelectric materials with perovskite crystal structure have specific crystallographic direction along which the electromechanical response is maximum. Our team has implemented processing method that results in ceramics with specific grain orientation, called as textured ceramics. This processing method is termed as templated grain growth, where template seeds are utilized to drive the epitaxial grain growth. Textured ceramics have two-to-five times higher transduction coefficients as compared to randomly oriented polycrystalline ceramics, providing the advantages of higher efficiency, power density, cost savings, and miniaturization. Additional goals of this project were to: (i) scale-up the manufacturing process of textured piezoelectric ceramics, (ii) address the technology gaps in understanding the role of grain size and shapes towards controlling the magnitude of electromechanical coefficients in textured ceramics and (iii) provide manufacturing innovation and entrepreneurship experiences to the personnel involved in this project. Experimental results from the program demonstrated methodology to synthesize large quantities of template seeds with consistent dimensions and properties. Using these seeds, scalable manufacturing of textured piezoelectric ceramics was demonstrated. Piezoelectric compositions with high magnitude of electromechanical response were designed and evaluated for scalable manufacturing, high temperature and field stability, and mechanical strength. In-situ diffraction and electron microscopy were utilized to develop fundamental understanding of defect and domain engineering, and electric-field induced phase transformations.</p> <p class="Default">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this program, a ceramic manufacturing facility for conducting scaling experiments was developed at Innovation Park, Penn State University. This is a unique facility which allows university laboratory-based compositions and processing methods to be tested in manufacturing environment for scalable production and repeatability. The Innovation Park at Penn State houses several university-based start-up?s and small businesses, and it is expected that this manufacturing facility will provide them important resource for process and material development. A piezoelectric ceramic manufacturing-oriented industry workshop is being planned to be organized in Fall 2020 at this manufacturing facility. Several industrial outreach activities were conducted during program ranging from seminars to laboratory visits and tours to organizing industry-oriented workshops and conferences. Knowledge gained from the program was shared with industry and government laboratory. An early-career female research scientist was trained during the program on synthesis, characterization and modeling of piezoelectric materials. In collaboration with The American Ceramic Society, an international conference was organized in September 2019 in Falls Church, VA, which was attended by over 100 scientists working in the area of energy conversion. An online high school summer camp is being planned for summer 2020 to expose the students to smart materials at an early age.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/22/2020<br>      Modified by: Shashank&nbsp;Priya</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1832179/1832179_10501597_1587568458273_Characterization_PFM_textured--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1832179/1832179_10501597_1587568458273_Characterization_PFM_textured--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Domain Engineering"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1832179/1832179_10501597_1587568458273_Characterization_PFM_textured--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Domain Engineering"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Piezo force microscopy is used to measure the domain size and mobility.
