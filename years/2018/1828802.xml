<AbstractNarration>An award is made to the University of Hawai'i at M&amp;#0257noa to purchase a micro-computed tomography (&amp;#0181CT) instrument.  This type of instrument has become an important and widely-used used technology in basic research due to its ability to generate fast, reproducible, non-destructive 3-D imaging of a broad range of tissues. The new &amp;#0181CT system will significantly enhance a broad spectrum of local research programs, enabling researchers to initiate, continue, and expand studies of taxonomy in corals, insects and mollusks; sensory system evolution in arthropods and fish; morphology and physiology in frogs and sea spiders; and the impacts of ocean acidification on corals, among many others. This new imaging instrument will be accessible to life science researchers across campus, as well as graduate and undergraduate students, promoting the training of young scientists in advanced 3D imaging technologies.  By partnering with &amp;#0181CT users from both the University of Hawai'i and the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum in Honolulu, the PI and co-PI will build a Virtual Museum of 3D models of native Hawaiian biodiversity that will be accessible online to the general public and to researchers around the world.  These 3D scans of native fauna will also be used to create large scale, 3D models for biodiversity exhibits at the Bishop Museum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new &amp;#0181CT imaging system will be added to the University of Hawai'i at M&amp;#0257noa Center of Advanced Bioimaging Research (CABR) to develop a comprehensive, multi-modality research facility that will serve the local Hawaiian, and broader Pacific, research community. The location of the instrument affords researchers access to fast, affordable, easy-to-use, non-invasive imaging techniques in one of the premier hotspots of island biodiversity, allowing for studies of the unique, endemic, and rapidly declining fauna found in Hawai'i. The new instrument will support 3D microscopy of hard and soft tissue imaging, capable of mapping genome-phenome interactions, physiology, metabolism, and molecular interactions in living animals, and enhancing efforts to conduct place-based research. The new instrumentation builds on the initial strong investment by UH administration in imaging technology and will support interdisciplinary research, education, and training.  The multimodality capability created by the addition of a &amp;#0181CT imaging system to the University of Hawai'i imaging resources will make it unique among bioimaging facilities across the nation because of the access afforded to researchers and students engaged in basic science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
