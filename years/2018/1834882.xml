<AbstractNarration>This award funds student travel fellowships for U.S. students attending PETS 2018, the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium.  PETS addresses the design and realization of privacy services for the Internet and other data systems and communication networks by bringing together anonymity and privacy experts from around the world to discuss recent advances in, and new perspectives on, online privacy.  PETS topics range from privacy-oriented cryptography and formal definitions of privacy to addressing human behavior and incentives around privacy, and researchers come from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participation in conferences such as PETS is an extremely important part of the student experience for both undergraduate and graduate researchers, providing the opportunity to interact with peers and more senior researchers while hearing about leading edge work in privacy.  The support requested in this proposal will enable the participation of U.S. students who would otherwise be unable to attend PETS 2018, with a focus on supporting students from groups historically underrepresented in computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Privacy Enhancing Technology Symposium (PETS), established in 2000, brings together privacy and anonymity experts from around the world to discuss recent advances and new perspectives. PETS addresses the design and realization of privacy services for the Internet and other data systems and communication networks. The 2018 edition of PETS was held in Barcelona, Spain from July 24 - July 27, 2018; this project broadened student participation in the field by providing travel support for US students who would otherwise have been unable to attend PETS 2018.  In total, the project provided support for 13 students to attend the symposium; these students were selected according to their potential contirbutions to the privacy research community by a committee of five senior researchers and allocated funds based on need.  These students had the opportunity to network with peers, interact with leading researchers in the field of privacy enhancing technologies, and attend and engage with presentations of leading edge research in privacy.  It is expected that these opportunities will lead to increased collaborations and research contributions in the future.   The project helped to broaden participation in computing by supporting five students from under-represented groups.  Furthermore, nine of the supported students had the opportunity to present their research results at the symposium or the associated workshops, allowing them to receive valuable feedback on their work.
