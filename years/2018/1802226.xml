<AbstractNarration>One of Hurricane Maria's devastating impacts was a significant landscape change to Puerto Rico from the extreme winds and flooding rains.  As the island recovers, this project will provide funding for a research team to study how land surface changes may impact storm development and intensification in the Caribbean.  The award will provide funding for the refurbishment and replacement of some existing research infrastructure, and new instruments to measure the energy balance of the land surface.  Observations will be compared with numerical model simulations to answer questions about storm initiation and invigoration.  The long-term impact of this study will be an improved capacity to predict extreme precipitation, which has implications for public safety and water resource management.  The research team will also work with stakeholders in Puerto Rico to provide scientifically sound information to increase their resilience to natural disasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team plans to improve understanding of the role played by modified land-atmosphere interactions in storm development and intensification in the Caribbean.  The researchers believe that the land surface changes due to Hurricane Maria could provide a unique contrasting scenario to accelerate understanding of storm initiation and invigoration.  The team plans to update an existing observational network to include surface energy flux sensors and to repair some of the existing equipment that was damaged by Maria.  A comprehensive energy balance site will be established to record sensible, latent and carbon dioxide fluxes.  Two intensive observing periods will be conducted with radiosonde launches and an aerosol speciation sampler.  Varied land surface configurations will be conducted using the RAMS model and tested against the observations.  Four research questions are at the core of the project:  1) How does the modified landscape impact the local surface energy and water budgets? 2) How do the changes in local energy and water budgets impact convection during the rainfall seasons? 3) In the context of a changed landscape, how do the local land-atmosphere processes interact with large scale events like Saharan dust advection that influence cloud formation and rainfall? 4) How will these geophysical changes impact the recovering local community?  Particularly, how vulnerable are they to flooding and what are the challenges to the agricultural sector?</AbstractNarration>
