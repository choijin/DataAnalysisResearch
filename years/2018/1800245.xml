<AbstractNarration>Hydrogen is an essential building block for industrial and agricultural processes and a promising alternative carbon-free fuel. Currently, 95% of industrial hydrogen derives from unsustainable fossil-fuel cracking. As global demand for cheap energy grows, there is a need for sustainable alternative sources. One of the major challenges in this area is the development of efficient catalysts based on solid state and molecular materials that use electricity to produce hydrogen by splitting water. Platinum is the most efficient catalyst for producing hydrogen from acidic solutions. However, its practical use is severely limited by its scarcity and prohibitive cost. In this project, Professors Robert M. Buchanan and Gautam Gupta of the University of Louisville are developing new catalysts based on inexpensive, earth-abundant metals, such as zinc, copper, and nickel. The catalysts are inspired by the protein environment in the naturally occurring hydrogenase enzymes. Professors Buchanan and Gupta are actively engaged in outreach activities that promote engagement of undergraduate students in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines with an emphasis on under-represented minorities and first generation college students. Professor Gupta participates annually in 'Research Summer Camps' for high school students sponsored by the Conn Center for Renewable Energy at UofL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Drs. Robert Buchanan and Gautam Gupta of the University of Louisville (UofL) investigate the fabrication and analysis of modified surfaces with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts based on redox non-innocent thiosemicarbazone ligands. The study addresses the structure-function relationship of this largely underexplored approach to new HER catalysts. It includes modification of carbon electrode surfaces through physisorption and covalent/enhanced non-covalent attachment methods to improve durability and facilitate electron and proton transfer. The HER activity of a library of small molecule catalysts is being benchmarked with the best performing catalysts incorporated in 3D nanostructured catalyst supports to promote facile reactant and product transport, high electronic conductivity and enhanced activity. The broader impacts of this project include benefits at multiple levels. The project facilitates the development of sustainable materials for hydrogen evolution from water splitting with practical applications. At the university level, the project strengthens connections between the investigators and the Conn Renewable Energy Center at UofL, a network comprised of scientists, engineers, and industry leaders focused on interdisciplinary solutions to complex, large scale energy-related issues. At the participant level, two graduate students supported as research assistants learn a diverse combination of skills and undergraduate research students make contributions on a topic of interest and concern to many younger scientists-in-training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
