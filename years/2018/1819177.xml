<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project include development of a commercial proof-of-concept percutaneous directional microwave ablation (MWA) applicator which may provide medical practitioners a new approach for treating cancer. In clinical use, a directional MWA applicator will facilitate both procedural and technical simplification of MWA treatments, saving time and critical resources in hospitals, and ultimately improve quality of, and access to, cancer treatment for a broad range of patients. The research and development proposed in this project will enhance scientific and technological understanding of miniaturized MWA antennas capable of radiating with directional patterns. Specifically, special materials to reduce required antenna dimension and increase efficiency, and advanced antenna designs to maximize the size of directional ablation zones will be studied during this project. Commercial development of the proposed technical advances could expand their use for the treatment of other medical conditions or for applications in other industries such as wireless communications. This STTR Phase I project will contribute to the creation of technology jobs in Kansas, a region where there are few medical or technology companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a commercial proof-of-concept directional microwave ablation (MWA) applicator. MWA procedures offer cost-effective, minimally-invasive treatment options for localized tumors and other disease. These treatments are especially important to the large population of cancer patients who are poor candidates for surgery or other physically demanding therapies. However, currently available MWA systems employ applicators with omni-directional radiation patterns, which if not placed precisely may damage critical healthy tissues or result in disease recurrence. A directional MWA applicator can facilitate technical and procedural simplifications which to alleviate these current challenges. We will investigate: (1) alternative materials to shrink antenna cross-section and (2) novel antenna geometries to maximize the size of directional microwave ablation zones. We will employ an approach integrating multiphysics computational models, benchtop experimentation in ex vivo tissue, and experiments in animal models in vivo to design, optimize, and validate our device. Our anticipated technical results are the development of a MWA applicator that provides directional control of radiation pattern that can ablate to depths of greater than 30 mm, creating an ablation volume comparable to current clinical non-directional devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Microwave ablation (MWA) offers an established, cost-effective, minimally invasive therapy that can be used to treat cancer tumors, most times as an outpatient procedure. In general, MWA procedures are performed by using image guidance (typically CT and/or ultrasound) to insert a needle-like applicator, embedded with a microwave antenna, into a tumor and then energizing the antenna to heat and kill the tumor. In addition to being much less invasive and expensive than traditional treatments, it also provides a non-toxic, localized, and repeatable option. However, the fundamental technical problem to broader MWA clinical acceptance is that all currently available MWA systems can only produce a roughly spherical or ellipsoidal treatment zone centered on the tip of the applicator, which is not suitable for treating tumors with irregular shapes or those located near critical anatomy. It is therefore extremely difficult to reliably ensure the entire tumor is killed without also damaging adjacent critical anatomy. This limitation leaves doctors with a difficult choice of risking undertreatment and disease recurrence or risking overtreatment and damage to critical healthy anatomy that may cause pain or life-threatening complications.</p> <p>In Phase I, our team developed a directional microwave ablation (MWA) applicator with an overall diameter of less than 14 gauge (2.1 mm). It does not need to be inserted directly into the center of a target tumor, but could instead be placed alongside it. This enables a faster procedure with less chance of complications or disease recurrence that could also be adapted for treatment of an expanded range of medical conditions beyond oncology. Alternatively, if our directional MWA applicator was inserted into the tumor, different generator power and time settings could be used for treating different sectors of the tumor, enabling the creation of irregular ablation zone shapes by rotating the applicator. Clinical value comes from the ability to produce a more targeted, consistent, and predictable ablation zone than any existing MWA system.</p> <p>Our Phase I research activities consisted of a staged development approach to show technical proof of concept and to optimize the design of a directional MWA applicator suitable for clinical use. We began with computer model based simulation using finite element method (FEM) multi-physics software to test the feasibility of new design variants based on radiation pattern directionality and antenna impedance matching. We then developed methods and sourced materials to fabricate functional prototypes of the most promising designs. This design process was very iterative, and if the new design variants could be successfully constructed, the computer models were adjusted to include the actual material dimensions and measured material properties, where possible. Adjustable/tunable antenna parameters were further optimized using updated computer models. The final design candidates were evaluated and extensively characterized experimentally on the benchtop in <em>ex vivo </em>tissue to assess size and shape of ablation profiles as a function of applied power and ablation duration. Further, a pilot study was conducted in porcine liver <em>in vivo</em>. Based on <em>ex vivo </em>and pilot <em>in vivo </em>performance, ease of manufacturability, and durability, the best directional applicator was selected for more detailed evaluation in porcine liver <em>in vivo </em>evaluation ? the established animal model for pre-clinical evaluation of thermal ablation technologies ? including experiments designed specifically to test usability in clinical applications which critically depend on directionality.</p> <p>The technical research and development accomplished during Phase I advanced new concepts and methods within the field and resulted in a new US provisional patent application titled ?Minimally Invasive Microwave Ablation Device? filed on May 24, 2019 (No. 62852671).</p> <p>The results of the <em>ex vivo </em>and <em>in vivo </em>experimental testing and characterization of our new directional MWA applicator design, which demonstrate the clinical potential for this technology, are reported in a manuscript in preparation for submission to the <em>Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology</em>.</p> <p>Thanks in large part to Phase I funding, Precision Microwave was successful in achieving several critical technical development milestones towards commercialization of our directional MWA technology.

We are now more confident than ever that our technology will solve a significant clinical need and once in the hands of doctors will evolve to provide minimally invasive treatment to wider range of patients than we could currently imagine.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/08/2019<br>      Modified by: Austin&nbsp;Pfannenstiel</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div
