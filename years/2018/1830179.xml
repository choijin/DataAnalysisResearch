<AbstractNarration>This project aims to promote interest and learning about robotics, computer science, and other fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) among middle school girls. The project will engage students who are attending summer camps or out-of-school programs during vacation weeks in immersive simulations of how ubiquitous, collaborative robots can be used to provide relief to people impacted by natural disasters, such as hurricanes. A collaborative robot, or co-robot, is a robot intended to physically interact with humans in a shared environment or workspace.  The students will create and take part in an immersive simulation of a co-robotics enhanced emergency response to assist first responders and other recovery workers by using wheeled robots and flying, programmable drones.  Students will also discuss the social, economic, ethical, and legal implications of using ubiquitous co-robots in these settings.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Girls and students from populations underrepresented in STEM fields generally have less exposure, access, and experience with important domains of learning due to social barriers. This mixed-methods study is guided by the hypothesis that girls will positively respond to role-playing in immersive simulations of helping residents in a town recover from a natural disaster, and as a result, will exhibit greater engagement and interest in robotics as a field and possible career choice. Students will be separated into two groups: a) An experimental group that will receive a co-robotics curriculum contextualized by a real-world immersive simulation narrative of an emergency response to the recent Puerto Rico hurricane or a similar natural disaster, and b) A comparison group that will receive just the co-robotics curriculum. The goals of the project are: (1) Test the effectiveness of an immersive simulation educational strategy as an introduction to co-robotics; (2) Design, implement, and test the innovative middle school co-robotics curricula and assessments, including the social, economic, ethical, and legal implications of co-robotics as they are used in first responder situations; (3) Broaden participation in robotics, computer science, and STEM fields by engaging traditionally underrepresented populations, specifically Latinx girls, through an immersive simulation of disaster recovery where co-robotics technology is used to help people; and (4) Increase student self-efficacy, interest, awareness, and participation in co-robotics activities that could lead to future robotics, computer science and STEM careers. Student interest, and awareness will be assessed through pre-post self-efficacy, interest, and career awareness surveys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
