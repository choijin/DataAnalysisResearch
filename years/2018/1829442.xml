<AbstractNarration>Increased wildfire activity in the Western U.S. significantly increases the likelihood of rapid, highly destructive debris flows as well as contributes to rapid soil erosion and rockfall. Debris flows emanate from steep catchments where they entrain sediment and debris before entering adjacent lowlands, and thus, they pose an increasingly significant threat to human life and infrastructure. In September 2017, the Eagle Creek fire complex burned nearly 50,000 acres of steep, forested terrain along the southern margin of the Columbia River Gorge in Oregon. Data and field observations necessary to determine the relevance of post-fire geomorphic responses in the Eagle Creek fire region are lacking. This project responds to the severe urgency to collect data and field observations following the fire, and could impact management activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will inform process-based geomorphic models of debris flow potential and provide important constraints on the contribution of extreme events to regional erosion and sediment yield. The work plan includes raster and point-cloud based change-detection with lidar datasets. Lidar analysis documenting changes in the forest and sub-canopy structure between 2014 and 2018 will enable the team to quantify how the disturbance of different components of the vegetation mosaic contribute to sediment transport. Analysis of post-fire land surface change will enable the team to test how grain size and slope angle regulate transport distances owing to disturbance. Fieldwork in summer 2018 will occur before mitigation activities overprint post-fire geomorphic change. The team will identify hillslope sites with thick sediment accumulation that are likely to produce debris flows and identify damage to infrastructure.  Various state and federal agencies are involved and a graduate student will receive training from experts in lidar techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span>With increasing wildfire activity in the western USA, understanding the role this process plays in the geomorphic evolution of landscapes is becoming more significant. In September 2017, the Eagle Creek fire in Oregon burned through nearly 50,000 acres of steep vegetated landscape along the Columbia River Gorge. The incineration of vegetation can destabilize colluvium on steep slopes and alter soil properties causing landscapes to become more prone to highly destructive debris flows, rapid soil erosion, and rock falls. The Eagle Creek fire provides a natural laboratory to compare pre- and post-fire LiDAR data to assess how slope angle, soil burn severity, tree-coverage, and lithology influence post-fire erosion patters of a landscape of forested area underlain by basalt flows. The National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM) collected a new LiDAR data set over the burn area in May 2018 that we compare using raster and point-cloud based DEMs of difference (DoDs) with pre-fire LiDAR data sets (2005, 2009, 2010, and 2014) collected by the Oregon Lidar Consortium (OLC) and the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers (USACE). From these analyses we calculate the spatial pattern of post-fire erosion and deposition to quantify rockfalls and dry ravel and their contribution of sediment to channels and valley networks. Using basalt flow properties, hillslope morphology, and vegetation maps, we can characterize controls on post-fire erosion. By estimating the volume of post-fire erosion, we can determine the fractional contribution of long-term erosion that occurs in post-fire episodes. This work will better inform land management and ecological function in these landscapes given predictions of increased fire frequency due to climate change.</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/27/2018<br>      Modified by: Joshua&nbsp;J&nbsp;Roering</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
