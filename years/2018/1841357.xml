<AbstractNarration>Steady baseload power, based on renewable energy, requires widespread implementation of energy storage technology. This project is to develop a flame synthesis process for producing energy storage electrodes. Such flame-based fabrication can reduce production steps and improve sustainability. Rapid synthesis and dry production are key strengths of flame synthesis. The control and selectivity of flame synthesis will allow for fabrication of high-performing energy storage electrodes. It is anticipated that the flame-based method developed in this project will have the potential to produce energy storage electrodes on an industrial scale. This project will also lead to the creation of a course, "Scalable Manufacturing of Emerging Technologies", which will expose students to manufacturing methods relevant to emerging technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is focused on flame synthesis of manganese oxide and carbon nano-materials in a process that combines deposition into functional films. Relevant to energy storage electrodes, this work involves various fundamental studies, including a) thermodynamics and kinetics of manganese oxide and carbon nanoparticle flame synthesis, b) relationship between nano-material structure / film-morphology and electrochemical performance, and c) aerosol dynamics governing fabrication of multi-component films for energy storage electrodes. A new thermodynamic analysis for the surface energy effect at flame conditions will be applied and kinetics of Mn oxidation and carbon sp2 formation will be studied. Reacting flow simulations of flame synthesis in stagnation flow will be connected to aerosol dynamics of porous film deposition. A dual-flame CVD process for fabrication of Mn oxide / carbon films will be developed for energy storage electrodes having maximum ionic and electronic conductivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
