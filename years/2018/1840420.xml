<AbstractNarration>The Planning Grants for Engineering Research Centers competition was run as a pilot solicitation within the ERC program.  Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.  This award funds planning efforts to create the ubiquitous use of information technology with inherent security and controllable privacy, through development of a novel hardware and software ecosystem, where components are physically unique and security properties are based on this deeply embedded, physically unchangeable identity. The trustworthiness of components will be evaluated across a wide variety of embedded systems and potential threats.  The best ways to develop open hardware and software to allow broad analysis and a competitive ecosystem will be considered.  This award will be used to organize and run several planning meetings with potential participants and stakeholders.   An education and outreach program is also planned for this effort, ranging from new graduate and undergraduate courses to summer engineering institutes for high school students. The team will include students in the planning meeting to offer novel insights on educational opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research problems that will be tackled by the planning team will span from low-level integrated circuit design (e.g., development and use of physically unclonable functions and lattice-based cryptography) to system-level hardware and software problems (e.g., using physical chip characteristics to achieve security properties for program execution and data) to inter-device communication (e.g. secure network connections). The economics of open architectures, threats of reverse engineering and legal issues add human and societal dimensions that must be considered. The driving applications for this work aim to address society-scale challenges: secure processing and chain of trust for electronic voting systems, controllable dissemination of private data in healthcare systems, verifiable execution in embedded systems for defense, infrastructure and transportation applications.  A plan for new course work at the graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels will be developed, as well as a plan for a summer institute targeting high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This planning grant was used to explore, plan and develop a pre-proposal to the NSF ERC program in the interdisciplinary area of Embedded Security.  The Center for Unique Ubiquitous Embedded Security (CUES) was envisioned to perform convergent research with a strong multi-disciplinary team.  In addition to a core research program, novel programs were proposed for the other three foundational components of an ERC: Workforce Development, Diversity/Inclusion and Innovation Ecosystem.  This report summarizes the organization and findings of the CUES proposing team, culminating in a pre-proposal to the NSF in January 2019 that unfortunately was not selected for full proposal submission.  The team expects to leverage the knowledge obtained from the planning grant to explore other venues for funding portions of this research and workforce development, as well as continuing preliminary work and incorporating NSF reviews for another submission to the ERC program in the future.  The CUES team consists of four primary partners: University of Massachusetts Amherst, MIT, University of Michigan, and San Jose State University;  four affiliate partners: Cornell University, Virginia Tech, Boston University, University of California San Diego; and two international partners: ETHZ, Switzerland and Ruhr University, Germany.  The vision for CUES is to establish a new framework for the comprehensive and dependable security of embedded computing that is vertically integrated from hardware components to software development. Our goal is to develop a novel ecosystem of hardware and software security with controllable privacy, where components are physically unique and security properties are based on this deeply embedded, physically unchangeable identity.   A planning workshop was held at UMass Amherst in October 2018 with all academic partners attending either in Amherst or remotely.  In addition to the academic partners, six industrial partners participated (Google, Intel, Bosch, Raytheon, Rambus/CRI) as well as members of consumer advocacy organizations.  The tangible outcome of the planning grant was primarily the submission of the ERC pre-proposal.  Less tangible outcomes included the development of cross-disciplinary relationships and the identification of cross-disciplinary solutions to embedded security challenges across a wide range of societal scenarios in Autonomous Systems, Critical Infrastructure and Healthcare.   The research of the CUES ERC was structured as four tightly integrated thrusts and five Impact Areas where the research would be applied and refined.  Thrust 1. Hardware Foundations: Physical Attacks and Counter-measures, Hardware Primitives, Computational Primitives, and Design Security and Supply Chain.  Thrust 2. Cryptography Foundations Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE),  Multi-party Privacy-preserving Computation (MPC), and Verifiable Computation, and embedded implementations and vulnerability analysis of Post-Quantum Cryptography, Block-chain, Unique Identifiers and Random Number Generation.  Thrust 3. Embedded Architecture, Software and Network Three defensive mechanisms include: Device/component/module authentication, Strong isolation of software and hardware components, and Machine learning to detect anomalies/attacks. The thrust has four sub areas. Computer architecture, System software, Security analysis and Machine Learning.  Thrust 4. Ethics, Law and Social Impacts Ensuring that embedded computer systems, whether in homes, healthcare settings, on highways or in critical infrastructure, are secure and usable requires understanding and addressing the social, legal and ethical dimensions of these systems.     Testbeds were planned in five Impact Areas. Two technology-level Impact Areas (Impact Areas 1 and 2) demonstrate hardware and software enabling technologies to be applied in three system-level Impact Areas (Impact Areas 3,4,5) to explore societal issues and impact.  Impact Area 1: Secure Processor  Impact Area 2:  Secure Wearable  Impact Area 3: Autonomous Systems  Impact Area 4: Critical Infrastructure  Impact Area 5: Home Health Care     Workforce Development: CUES aims to develop a skilled and diverse workforce and train the next generation of innovators and leaders with broad, convergent expertise in secure embedded systems. The CUES workforce development (WD) program will leverage the ERC scale and diversity to create a model pathway from school to university to the cybersecurity workforce, informed by evaluation and educational research, and with a vision of a culture of full inclusion across technical disciplines as well as under-represented groups.
