<AbstractNarration>USENIX conferences gathers researchers from across the academic, government, and industry communities to foster cross-disciplinary approaches and to address shared research challenges. This cross-disciplinary emphasis makes it well-suited as a target for student participation, and the important topics addressed in these conferences encourage student research and collaboration in critical areas of&lt;br/&gt;advanced computing. The support requested in this proposal will enable the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend the conference, and extends the impact of research presented to a broad audience of young researchers from across the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help increase the representation and participation of these students, this proposal requests funding to assist approximately 20-25 US-based graduate students to attend each of the following events:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;15th USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI 2018).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;USENIX Annual Technical Conference (ATC 2018). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;USENIX Security Symposium (Security 2018).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;13th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI 2018). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge shared and advanced at these conferences has practical and meaningful applications to a broad variety of things used in daily life such as household appliances, cars, cell phones, airplanes and public transit, as well as to the ethical, cultural, and social ramifications of computing technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This grant provided travel support for 15-23 graduate students to attend each of four major research conferences, with total support for 81 students.    15th USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI)   2018 USENIX Annual Technical Conference (ATC)   13th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI)   2018 USENIX Security Symposium   These events brought together researchers and practitioners interested in the latest advances in computer systems, and presented an extremely valuable opportunity for students to attend, present, and network with advanced professionals in their respective fields of study. The student grant program at these events over the past 10 years alone has funded almost 2,500 students, and has played an important role in fostering the next generation of researchers, while expanding opportunities for those who otherwise may not have been able to attend. The NSF funds provided over the years have had significant impact across these events.    IMPACTS Intellectual Merit: USENIX events gather researchers from across the networking and systems community -- including computer networking, distributed systems, and operating systems -- to foster cross-disciplinary approaches and to address shared research challenges. This cross-disciplinary emphasis makes it well-suited as a target for student participation. Many student attendees are also co-authors on papers published at the conferences, or present posters of their original research.   Broader Impacts: Participation in ATC, NSDI, OSDI, USENIX Security 2018, and similar conferences is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience. It provides students with the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers in the field, and exposes students to leading edge work in the field. The support requested in this proposal made possible the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend.
