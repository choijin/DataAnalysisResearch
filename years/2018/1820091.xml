<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR project stems from the costs to U.S. food producers of outbreaks of animal diseases.  Producers of poultry, pork, and other food proteins lose more than $1B each year to infectious diseases, including some that are transmitted through the air.  For diseases having an airborne transmission route, protective technologies that are available are few and can be costly to implement and operate.  This project furthers the development of a new alternative technology, non-thermal plasmas, for the simultaneous removal and inactivation in air of the organisms responsible for the transmission of disease to livestock.  This project evaluates how conditions in the environment typically found near livestock affect the performance of non-thermal plasmas.  This project also pursues a technique for accelerating the process of improving non-thermal plasma performance, upon the completion of which new and improved non-thermal plasma devices can be developed for applications such as this more rapidly than is possible now.  Completion of the project will enable the development of lower-cost protective technologies for maintaining livestock health, making such technologies economically accessible to a larger segment of food protein producers, ultimately lowering food costs and increasing domestic food security.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase I project proposes to experimentally demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of a non-thermal plasma (NTP) as a means of preventing disease-carrying particles in outside air from infecting livestock housed in animal confinement buildings.   NTPs are stable electrical discharges that simultaneously contribute to the removal of airborne particles while also subjecting them to chemical attack capable of killing harmful viruses.  While NTPs have been demonstrated for disinfection of fixed surfaces, and to a lesser degree for the destruction of chemical contaminants or biological pathogens in air, the intellectual merit of this project stems from its evaluation of trace gases commonly present in the air around livestock, ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, and their potential to both enhance and diminish the performance of NTPs used in farm environments.   Additionally, this project will identify non-biological tracers suitable for use in NTP optimization testing which will accelerate the development of improved designs.  Two separate lab-scale NTP reactors will be used in the execution of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Conventional practices for protecting the health of livestock in agriculture are collectively called agricultural biosecurity.  Most of the established practices focus on objects that can be contaminated with pathogens, viruses and bacteria, such as worker clothing, tools, or equipment.  Relatively fewer protections are available against airborne pathogens carried into closed and sealed barns with ventilation air.   The goal of this project is de-risk the further development of a ventilation air treatment technology capable of protecting livestock against airborne pathogens with higher efficacy and lower cost than conventional particulate or HEPA filters.  Airborne viruses, bacteria, and spores are airborne particles that are biological in origin - bioaerosols.  This specific class of infectious bioaerosols have two defining characteristics:  their ease of transport in air (transport) and their ability to cause infection (infectivity).  Conventional particulate or HEPA filters only address aerosol transport.  Non-thermal plasmas (NTPs) are stable electrical discharges produced as a result of strong electric fields that protect against infectious aerosols utilizing both the transport and the infectivity characteristics.  Towards this end, the project had two technical objectives.  The first objective sought to quantify what effect odorous gases commonly found around animal agriculture might have, either positive or negative.  The results showed that small amounts of ammonia gas in air, typically from excreted animal urine, acted to reduce the amount of unwanted ozone produced by the NTPs and had minimal effect on NOx and particulate matter concentrations.  In this way, the omnipresence of such gases in ambient air around agricultural operations may present a uniquely ideal environment for the use of NTPs for protecting against airborne disease transmission. The second project objective evaluated a series of chemical compounds for their suitability as aerosol chemical indicators of plasma exposure.  The selected compound, disodium terephthalate, has favorable properties for its formation into an aerosol and it demonstrated a fluorescence that was both proportional to its plasma exposure and easily detectable by widely used analytical lab techniques.  Contributing to the intellectual merit of the project, to our knowledge, this was the first demonstration of disodium terephthalate as an aerosol chemical probe in air for indicating plasma exposure.   Contributing to the broader impacts of the project, is the potential presented by this aerosol chemical tracer to serve as a tool in ultimately understanding the mechanism by which airborne pathogens are inactivated by exposure to non-thermal plasmas.
