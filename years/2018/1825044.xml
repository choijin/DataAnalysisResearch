<AbstractNarration>In both bioarchaeological and forensic settings, scientists need to be able to establish the biological profiles of individuals based on their skeletal remains. In this EAGER research project, methods for determining whether a skeleton was female or male based on the chemistry of tooth enamel will be developed and compared to other methods of sex estimation.  The research will expand the available suite of tools for establishing biological profiles, with the aims of validating and improving protocols and expanding the range of time periods and environmental conditions in which skeletal sex estimation can be accomplished. Findings and protocols will be shared with researchers in anthropology, chemistry, and other disciplines, and the project will support undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral student training and mentoring across the three collaborative research sites.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The inability to accurately determine the sex of sub-adult and/or incomplete skeletons is a persistent problem in biological anthropology and forensic anthropology. Both osteological analysis and DNA-based methodology have particular strengths and limitations. This project seeks to develop a robust, reproducible, and sensitive method for bioarchaeological and forensic sex estimation based on the detection of sexually dimorphic amelogenin peptides in human enamel, the hardest and best preserved tissue in the human body. The investigators will optimize peptide extraction from enamel, increase the sensitivity and quantification of sexually dimorphic peptides, establish a uniform protocol that can be applied as broadly as possible to archaeological material, and replicate and build on other work done in the field. The approach developed will be statistically grounded and result in sex estimation with established error and false positive and negative rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><em>Proteomic Detection of Amelogenin Proteins for Biological Profiles</em>&nbsp;is a collaborative research project led by Glendon Parker (University of California-Davis, Award #: 1825022), Anne Stone (Arizona State University: Award #: 1825055), and Jane Buikstra (Center for American Archeology). The goal of the project is to develop methods for estimating the sex of ancient and modern skeletal remains through tooth chemistry, specifically dimorphic amelogenin peptides found within enamel. Current methods of sex estimation pose significant problems for biological anthropology, forensic anthropology, and bioarchaeology with regard to juvenile and incomplete remains. This project&rsquo;s approach addresses that challenge. Developed proteomic methods are also compared to osteological and ancient DNA (aDNA) methods for sex estimation. As a collaborator to this project, the Center for American Archeology (CAA) provided study samples (teeth) from archaeological sites representing several time periods of Lower Illinois Valley prehistory. Before inclusion in the study, metric and non-metric observations were made on all individual samples. All samples were digitally photographed and then scanned using a NextEngine 3D Scanner. Scanning data were used to create 3D models of sample teeth using RapidWorks modeling software. Resultant observation and digital documentation retains all observable information from samples used in the study. Data collected in the course of the project are retained with CAA collections. Sample selection, observation, photography, and 3D scanning were performed by Buikstra (PI) and CAA archaeologists, including a graduate student funded by this grant. Upon documentation completion, samples were submitted to collaborators at Arizona State University and the University of California-Davis for use in the larger project.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/04/2021<br>      Modified by: Jane&nbsp;Buikstra</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
