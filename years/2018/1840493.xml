<AbstractNarration>The Planning Grants for Engineering Research Centers competition was run as a pilot solicitation within the ERC program.  Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sharing economy can be characterized as a system of dynamic decentralized networks that enables the increased utilization of assets by directly and nimbly matching supply and demand. It is forecasted to grow from $14 billion in 2014 to $335 billion by 2025. Technology has enabled these new platforms to flourish, disrupting traditional businesses and transforming the future of transportation, lodging, computing, energy, and other services. The estimated impact of sharing economy practices on society is striking, directly affecting the lives of more than a quarter of the adults living in the USA. However, the rapid pace of change of new sharing economy technology and practices has resulted in limited understanding of the dynamic interactions of these platforms with the society. The lag in understanding is dangerous as disruptive changes continue to accelerate.  Further, while new technology alters the dynamic interactions in how services are provided and distributed, fair and appropriate regulations of the multiple emerging new ways of providing services has not kept up and adapted. SHARE's Vision is a world in which sharing economy platforms are intentionally engineered for socially desirable outcomes considering their long-term sustainability, cyber-security, resource usage efficiency, impact on the environment, workforce and community relations, interactions with public services, and value-creation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SHARE multidisciplinary team of researchers will take the first step toward enabling this convergent vision of a future economy; together with stakeholders, they will not only define the research challenges that will eventually underlie a unified framework for the sharing economy, but also develop the educational programming that must accompany the research to ensure the workforce is in place now and going forward in this key area. SHARE?s Mission is to maximize the positive impact of the sharing economy through integrated comprehensive, trans-disciplinary research that will document and explore changing dynamics, develop new technologies and algorithms for optimizing design, operation, incentives, and security, and identify and compare regulatory and data sharing practices that influence the real-world implementation of sharing economy platforms. We will organize a multi-disciplinary workshop to start what we believe is one of the first convergent dialogues on the sharing economy, to ultimately build a trans-disciplinary research team and a diverse stakeholder community that can synthesize the outcomes of the workshop into meaningful applied focus areas with significant societal impact and sound fundamental research thrusts. The proposed workshop will be formally documented via a report, which will serve as a roadmap for future efforts in this area by the investigators and other researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The interdisciplinary SHARE team worked together across multiple activities to develop and enhance the research and partnership building (https://web.northeastern.edu/rcshare/).  SHARE's activities over the project period includes the following:   SHARE Proposals:  Pre-proposal for NSF Engineering Research Center for the Sharing economy - focused on Humans, Automation, REsilience: SHARE, submitted in January, not invited for a full proposal.  For the NSF Future of Work Program a subset of the SHARE team members submitted: FW-HTF-RM: Collaborative Research: Regulating and Managing the Algorithmic Workplace: A Multi-Method Study for Comprehensive Optimization of Platforms, funded. SHARE team is selected as one of the two teams to submit an NSF NRT proposal in 2020 from Northeastern University, and is currently in the process of preparing this proposal.    SHARE conference:  We held the first multidisciplinary SHARE conference on campus in Spring 2019. The conference brought together stakeholders from academia, industry and governmental and non-governmental organizations. A summary of the conference can be found at https://web.northeastern.edu/rcshare/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NU-SHARE-2019-Conference-Report-.pdf  We plan on organizing a second workshop in 2020.  SHARE book:  A book contract with Cambridge University Press was awarded: Engineering Sharing, co-editors: Ozlem Ergun, Yakov Bart, Rashmi Dyal-Chand, and Babak Heydari.  This will be a multidisciplinary edited book serving as a template for convergent thinking &ndash; and convergent design &ndash; of sharing technologies, markets, and systems.  SHARE classes:  An undergraduate and a graduate class on the Sharing Economy were offered in Spring 2019:  HONR 3310-01: Enabling the Sharing Economy with Computing Technology and Digital Business Model Innovations, David Kaeli, EECE, COE, co-taught with Yakov Bart, D’Amore-McKim School of Business IE7374  Special Topics in IE: Sharing Economy Systems: Design, Policy and Governance, Babak Heydari, co-taught with Ozlem Ergun (OE) , MIE, COE, with guest lectures from the entire SHARE faculty, covering Engineering, Business, Social Sciences, Computer Science and Law schools            Last Modified: 12/20/2019       Submitted by: Ozlem Ergun]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
