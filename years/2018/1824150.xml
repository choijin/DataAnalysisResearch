<AbstractNarration>CBET-1824150&lt;br/&gt;PI: Bruggeman, Peter J. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will provide partial support for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and early career scientists to attend the 2018 Gordon Research Conference on Plasma Processing Science (GRC-PPS) that will be held from August 5 to 10, 2018, at Bryant University, Smithfield, RI, USA. This conference aims to provide a forum for highlight the scientific advances at the cutting edge of plasma processing science. During the meeting, new emerging topics and trends, with a focus on the mechanisms that contribute to the existing and future application of plasmas will be discussed.  Plasma processing is used in a wide range of established and emerging applications in the areas of energy, advanced materials, human health and environmental sustainability. The special format of the Gordon Conferences, with programmed discussion sessions and ample time for informal gatherings in the afternoons and evenings, will provide for a fertile atmosphere of brainstorming and creative thinking among all attendees.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the 2018 GRC-PPS is to identify common threads in different plasma sub-communities and to translate knowledge to enable technological breakthrough and accelerate innovations. Several sessions will focus on the translational common thread of different plasma processes with a strong emphasis on the fundamental mechanisms of plasma processes underpinning applications. Among the scientific sessions are sessions addressing novel developments in plasma diagnostics, modeling, material interactions and multiphase plasmas. Four new topics have been introduced: Plasma Catalysis, Plasma Combustion and Flow Control, Exploring New Plasma Regimes, and Plasma Agriculture. The planned activities focus on exploring creative and original concepts as well as transformative concepts in plasma processing science.  The scientific impact of attending the Conference will be significant for the junior researchers supported by this grant. Further benefits to society include the education of the future generation of scientists in plasma processing science and the advancement in technological important areas utilizing plasma technology. The Conference will include a mentoring session for graduate students and postdocs about career opportunities with experts from diverse backgrounds. The Conference will also feature for the first time a "Power Hour" intended to support the professional growth of women in the PPS scientific community and provide an open forum for discussion and mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
