<AbstractNarration>A Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) is being organized as part of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) 2018, the premier conference on the design, implementations, principles, and uses of functional programming. The conference will be held in St. Louis, Missouri. This award specifically supports students from underrepresented groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents to attend the mentoring workshop in addition to the ICFP conference. The impact of the award relates to broadening participation in computing, providing opportunities for students to receive mentoring from leading researchers, and building the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in programming languages and related topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop at the SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming was held on Sunday, September 23 in St. Louis, MO.  The workshop aims to encourage women and underrepresented minorities to join the programming language research community.  To achieve this goal, PLMW seeks to attract participants who would not normally attend ICFP.  This objective guided the selection of speakers and funded students.  In addition to the $15,000 in funding from the NSF, the workshop was supported by SIGPLAN ($20K), an anonymous donor ($20K), and Google ($1K).  This money was used solely to provide travel scholarships for students to attend the one-day mentoring workshop as well as ICFP, a three-day premier research conference on programming languages and functional programming.  The conference was co-located with StrangeLoop, a large industrial programming conference held annually in St. Louis.  There were 45 attendees, of which 40 were students, and 28 were supported with financial aid.  Of funded students, 50% reported being members of underrepresented minorities, 16.67% reported N/A.  36.67% reported their gender as female, 6.67% as nonbinary, and 6.67% as N/A. 60% of funded students were from the USA (and NSF funds were only used for US students).  In 2017, 24% of funded students self-reported as women, so 2018 represented a signficant improvement.  None of the scholarship recipients had previously been awarded support to attend a PLMW.  The program consisted of technical talks, mentoring talks, a social event, and a panel discussion.  Speakers represented a diverse collection of international researchers from both industry and academia, with a wide range of seniority.  Of the technical and mentoring talks, 62.5% of the speakers were women or members of underrepresented minorities.  To reach a broader audience beyond the in-person attendees, the program was video-recorded and made available online.  In sum, the PLMW @ ICFP 2018 project was successful in cultivating a new cohort of future programming languages researchers.  Scholarships were awarded to a diverse range of students, who were able to attend a mentoring worskshop with technical and career-oriented talks.  They socialized with eachother and accomplished academic and industrial researchers.  Participants also were able to attend one of the premier research conference in programming languages: ICFP.       Last Modified: 07/02/2019       Submitted by: David Van Horn]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
