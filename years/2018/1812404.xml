<AbstractNarration>Threats to scientific instruments and data that are accessible via the Internet are ubiquitous.  The SouthEast SciEntific Cybersecurity for University REsearch (SECURE) project helps protect the National Science Foundation's investments in scientific research while providing scientists with tools to safeguard intellectual property and ensure data integrity. The project team provides education, training, and selected cybersecurity services to NSF-funded researchers across the Southeast.  The team is multidisciplinary, comprised of cybersecurity experts (both research and practitioner), scientists, and experts in communication.  Team members are located in South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi, with strong representation from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU).  This program raises investigators' awareness of their essential role in creating a secure and trustworthy cyberspace and offers concrete assistance in risk assessment, vulnerability testing, and mitigation tailored to NSF-funded scientists' workflow and program size.  Through past collaborations, the team is well positioned to leverage both national and regional cybersecurity organizations and programs to effectively reach the target audience.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;SouthEast SECURE impacts the region by raising cybersecurity awareness; providing concise training, assessment, tools and one-on-one help; and assisting in preparation of select cybersecurity metrics.  Student interns are conducting many of these activities by means of practicum-based deployment and support, thus developing capabilities in the next generation of cyber professionals.  An online survey of NSF-funded investigators in the region will be conducted to learn about their primary cybersecurity challenges and concerns.  Training is then tailored to provide concrete and practical assistance in how to do right-sized risk assessment and mitigation.  A "toolkit" is provided to test and validate local cybersecurity, and measures of cybersecurity are created and field-tested.  The team's approach facilitates communication between research faculty and university IT/Data Security staff.  A long-term goal is building communities with common interests in cybersecurity and a commitment to helping others; and building connections with other regions and with national centers and programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Tool description  We developed an enhanced web-based tool that allows the user to add and test a list of websites for various types of potential breaches (such as Poodle 1 and 2, Drown, Heartbleed, and others).  The vulnerabilities for each root website and its active subdomains are recorded for further analysis. This tool also allows the user to save the collected information (such as IP addresses, all opened, filtered, and closed ports and subdomains) in its database to generate excel reports for additional analysis, as needed.  The user can observe the level of safety change in website over time (which can up and down, and even regress, in our experience).  Figure 1 shows the search results for a domain and its active subdomains.  The testing process starts when the user hits the start-testing button; the tool will notify the user when the testing is done, see Figure 2.  One of the challenges we faced was that we got false positives in the final report for some sites that showed zero open ports; these are cases where the report generator misinterpreted the output from the open-source tools that were used during the testing, We worked on fixing the mapping of the results and the passing of parameters from the embedded tools that have been used to the final reports' and, to solve this issue, we separated the final report generator part from the rest of tool to monitor the input and the output between the tool and the report generator. Also, we used the open-source tools to verify the result of the testing using our tool is correct.
