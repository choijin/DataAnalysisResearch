<AbstractNarration>Forests are important components of our natural world. They create habitats for other plants and animals and provide important services, such as reducing soil erosion and storing carbon in their trunks and roots. In recent years, large wildfires have become increasingly common in California and the American West, due in part to increasingly hot summers and droughts. This study will examine how natural disturbances, such as wildfires, influence the way that forests change over time. If some kinds of trees recover more quickly than others, for example, the types of trees that make up these forests may change and this change could affect the forest's ability to withstand future disturbances. Results of this study will inform our ability to understand, conserve and manage forest habitats. This project will train a postdoctoral student and junior college students from diverse backgrounds. This project will also engage the public and local land managers through public workshops, a website, and other efforts by the Pepperwood Preserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interaction between environmental disturbances and a warming climate will play a critical role in the way that plant communities will respond and change in the coming decades. In woodlands and forests the longevity and fecundity of mature trees exert strong priority effects that limit the establishment of new species. This priority effect may slow the rate of changes in the structure and composition of the forest relative to what might be expected given rapid changes in local climatic conditions. The 2017 Tubbs Fire in Sonoma County, one of the most destructive complex of fires in California's history, provides an opportunity to explore how fire, as a disturbance, influences the rate and trajectory of community turnover. More specifically, this research will test the hypothesis that community turnover in forests associated with cooler positions (i.e. north-facing slopes) will be greatest following the fire, but that the resulting changes in species composition may make them more resistant to future fires or drought as the community shifts to species that are better able to tolerant such disturbances. The research will take place at the Pepperwood Preserve field station where long-term studies of forest ecology were initiated prior to the fire, providing a unique opportunity to quantify the mortality, top-kill and regrowth of trees of different species. About 8,000 individual plants, from small saplings to large trees, will be assessed to determine fire damage and recovery, and species turnover across different forest types and positions on the landscape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

These diverse temperate woodlands are composed of a mix of species with contrasting post-fire regeneration strategies that are also correlated with their degree of drought tolerance. Responses to wildfire may therefore shape the future sensitivity of these forests to warmer and drier conditions. This research will ultimately test hypotheses of global importance on the impact of disturbance on plant communities and implications for resilience to future climate change.</p> <p dir="ltr"><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>On October 8, 2017, during an extreme wind event, multiple fires broke out in Sonoma and Napa Counties collectively burning 65,700 ha in total (Fig. 1a). The most destructive of these fires, the Tubbs fire, spread more than 15 km on the eve of ignition and eventually burned 14,895 ha (Fig. 1b). The Pepperwood Preserve, a research facility northeast of Santa Rosa Ca, was heavily burned with 85% of the 1263 ha site impacted (Fig. 1c). In 2013 the Pepperwood Forest Dynamics Project began with the establishment of a network of 50 forest plots 20x20m in size, designed to study effects of topography on forest dynamics, and to provide a baseline for responses to extreme disturbance events and climate change. All woody individuals were tagged, measured and recorded as saplings if &gt; 50 cm in height and with a diameter at breast height (dbh) &lt; 1cm, or as trees if dbh &ge; 1 cm, totalling 3900 individuals from 25 species. The top seven species comprise 98% of total basal area: coast live oak, Douglas-fire, Oregon oak, blue oak, black oak, madrone, and California bay. The Tubbs fire presented the first opportunity to use that baseline data to examine levels of post fire mortality, size dependence of fire impacts across species, the various recovery strategies of species present in the plot network, as well as to compare these responses in areas that burned at high, moderate and low severity.</p> <p dir="ltr"><span><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>In the summer of 2018 the first complete demographic resurvey of the 50 forest plots was completed and four new plots were established in the highest severity burn area.

The hardwoods (oaks, madrone, and bay) exhibited distinct strategies, from minimal damage in blue oak (which grows widely spaced), a mix of canopy survival and resprouting in the other oaks, and high levels of topkill and resprouting in madrone and bay (Fig. 2). Douglas-fir is a non-sprouting species, and individuals of these species were either killed or survived with a living canopy (Fig. 2). For saplings, which are exposed to higher fire intensity in the understory, all species exhibited high levels of mortality or (except for Douglas-fir) topkill combined with basal resprouting (Fig.3). The seven plots within the high severity zone of the first night of the fire were dominated by coast live oak, black oak, madrone, California bay, and Douglas-fir (Fig.4). Almost all of the hardwoods were topkilled, with high levels of resprouting, and little mortality. Douglas-fir incurred very high mortality of trees and 100% mortality of saplings (Fig. 4).</p> <p dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>These data will allow a test of the hypothesis that fire impacts will cause greater community change in cooler landscape locations, due to differential mortality of adults and regenerating saplings; this pattern is expected to lead to biotic homogenization of the landscape and a shift towards more warm-adapted tree communities.
