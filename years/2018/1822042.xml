<AbstractNarration>Living organisms have developed endogenous biological rhythms to predict and adapt to the oscillating environment (e.g. day/night cycles, seasonal variations). Biological rhythms touch upon all aspects of biology and ecology, with huge impacts on society, biodiversity and economy. Biological rhythms include circadian (or daily) rhythms as well as faster rhythms of seconds, hours or days in behavior and physiology on one end, and slower rhythms, such as those that relate to the annual environmental changes (migrations, seasonal changes in reproduction or physiology). Biological clocks are ubiquitous (from single-celled organisms to humans), and their interaction with systems at all levels of organization (from single molecules to ecosystems) have placed biological timing systems at a paramount node that impacts human society on many fronts, in part represented by the awarding of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine to pioneers in this field. Our growing knowledge of the basic science of biological clocks is changing decision-making in public health, education, labor and the environment. These are all questions addressed at the 2018 Society for Research on Biological Rhythms (SRBR) conference. The overall objectives of SRBR 2018 are to showcase new research directions, integrate newcomers in the field brought into our community through targeted recruitment, and design training and mentoring efforts directed to young and underrepresented investigators. All these initiatives will bring the biological rhythms field forward, enhancing the impact of this knowledge in multiple aspects of society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than ever, there is a need for collaboration between specialists of biological rhythms and scientists from other fields of science, and for increased awareness of the pervasive and crucial importance of biological rhythms. With this in mind, the 2018 SRBR meeting in Fernandina Beach, Florida, aims to build bridges between scientists of various fields, between generations of researchers, and with various end users and targets audiences. The meeting also embraces comparative approaches, using both non-model and model organisms, and laboratory as well as field studies. SRBR 2018, which has grown to attract over 700 attendees, focuses on the breadth of topics that represent key research areas in chronobiology, including molecular biology, genetics, cell biology, neurobiology, physiology, metabolism, behavior, sleep, and mathematical modeling. In particular, this award allows the meeting organizers to enhance meeting aspects directed towards trainee professional development as well as increasing attendance of underrepresented minorities and attendees from low-income countries. This is achieved by providing trainees and junior faculty with multiple professional development and mentoring opportunities (including our acclaimed full-day Professional Development Day). The organizers also stimulate attendance by underrepresented groups and researchers from low income countries via multiple initiative, including incentive funding and active inclusion of minorities in committees and scientific sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award helped to support the 2018 Society for Research on Biological Rhythms bi-annual meeting. Specifically, it helped to directly support training and professional developent for future scientists, educators, and policy makers.   Intellectual Merit  The SRBR meeting comprises a rich multi-faceted program including scientific sessions, discussion panels and networking events. The range of topics covered by the meeting is broad, touching upon all aspects of biological rhythmicity in humans, various vertebrate and invertebrate animal models, fungi, plants and bacteria. This includes circadian (daily) rhythms, but also faster (ultradian) rhythms of behavior and metabolism, as well as longer period rhythms such as seasonal rhythms in migration, reproduction and physiology. Approaches include molecular studies, behavior, physiology, systems biology, population studies, evolution, and mathematical modeling.   A special ceremony was held to honor the three 2017 Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine, Michael Rosbash, Jeffrey Hall and Michael Young, who were awarded this distinction for their seminal discoveries of the basic mechanisms of circadian clocks. The Pittendrigh-Aschoff Lecture, the highest distinction given by SRBR, was delivered by Charles Czeisler of Harvard University, a world leader in human chronobiology.  Broader Impact  In 2018 SRBR established a Public Advocacy Committee to oversee the dissemination of information about the meeting (and the field in general) through social media (a topic of a Trainee Day workshop) and the web. At SRBR 2018, the Rhythm Highlights series flagged selected symposia having high societal relevance, including interviews of symposium chairs broadcast on the SRBR's YouTube channel and media press releases. The intent was to increase the profile of the meeting, topics covered and their broader societal impact.   The Professional Development Day is a one-day pre-conference event that is a combination of two parallel events: the Junior Faculty Workshops and the Trainee Day. For the 2018 Trainee Day, we had over 215 trainees (students and postdocs) to take part in 25 workshops, with faculty members and scientists acting as discussion leaders. The day opened with the keynote lecture, which instead of being a simple history overview of chronobiology research as in previous meetings, was delivered by past SRBR President Paul Hardin, and included professional development and mentorship as a focus. We had different types of workshops (e.g. chronobiology "bootcamps" for new members of the field; workshops in analytical methods and experimental design; discussion panels with individuals pursuing careers in non-academia paths). A strength of the Trainee Day is the 38 faculty that generously volunteer their time to attend the meeting a day early (without any compensation) to work with eager trainees. The recurrent participation of faculty and trainees is a testament to the value which the community places on this endeavor.  New innovations this year included a social media workshop, that discussed tips of how to conduct outreach via this powerful mode of communication, methods to teach chronobiology using multimedia tools, and undergraduate-specific sessions on how to choose a graduate program and mentor. We held a "Back to the Future" event in which 4 senior scientists and 4 junior faculty who provided their thoughts to the entire group of trainees on the future of the field.    For networking, we held a "Positive Feedback Looping" speed networking for chronobiologists. It allowed trainees to meet new people and break the ice for the rest of the meeting.  Finally, we increased the components of the Trainee Day focused on diversity and inclusivity, particularly focusing on methods to increase diversity in chronobiology research, opportunities to engage with underepresented minority (URM) populations, and a specific session focused on improving retention of URM individuals at every level of our field.   Outcomes  The project had four major goals/outcomes, which are summarized below.   To provide a forum for the professional development of the next generation of biological rhythms researchers.  In large part because of this grant, we were able to welcome 335 trainees (undergraduates, gradaute studentes, and Postdoctoral fellows) to the meeting. Of those at least 215 attended the Trainee Day event.  To help trainees to integrate in the field and network successfully.   In addition to Trainee Day, SRBR 2018 included meet the professors coffee breaks and mentoring meetings.   To create an inclusive research community, open to underrepresented groups.  Several sessions during Trainee Day were dedicated to fostering an inclusive research community. In addition, conference organizers ensured a gender balance for all talks, as well as inclusion of URM scholars. This grant helped to support 15 TYDE (Trainee and Young faculty Diversity Enhancement) fellowships to help defray the costs of attending the meeting.    To stimulate attendance from low-income countries.   SRBR had attenties from all continents (except for Antarctica). Of those, about 10% were attendees from low to middle-income countries, including Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, India, China, Vietnam, Ukraine, and Mexico. This grant helped to support 7 Global Diversity awards to help defer some costs for attendees from these countries.
