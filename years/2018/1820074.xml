<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project extends from years of research into the impact of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), and yet there is still no direct, field assay for toxic cells. The identification of HABs is critical to determine their patterns of occurrence, to protect water and food supplies, and to alert the general public when there is a problem. Harmful Algal Blooms are a world-wide fresh water, brackish water and marine phenomena that occur in every coastal and inland country and annually cause significant economic damage and take human lives. The detection of HABs and their toxins is currently completed by complex, expensive, and time consuming microscopic analyses that do not necessarily provide the critical and timely information that water quality mangers require. Raman spectroscopy provides a strong and distinct fingerprint of HAB cells and their toxins without the need for sample preparation, and can be used on-site at beaches, drinking water reservoirs, or within distributed networks of Raman sensors all communicating through the cloud to provide managers immediate and spatially distinct information on the presence and concentration of potentially toxic cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop and market an in-situ 3D microscope with on-axis Raman spectroscopy to provide both morphological information and a chemical signature for identification of HAB cells to species, and in some cases specific strains, along with the presence and concentration of toxin on a per cell basis. The novel technical specifications include: 1) the use of Light Field (LF) microscopy to maximize the depth of field to allow for detection of low cell concentrations (&lt; 1 cell/ mL). LF microscopy also provides a 3D image for more complete and accurate morphological assessment of cells and particulates, 2) Advanced software for color and texture feature extraction and classification of cells using Gabor wavelets and a novel color angle feature, which provide 100% classification accuracy in many cases, 3) the use of Resonance Micro-Raman Spectroscopy (RMRS) to collect spectral fingerprints on the inorganic and organic content of cells, particulates and dissolved compounds, and 4) the integration of these technologies into sensor packages as part of the IoT cloud computing thrust that is sure to gain traction over the next few years, and will provide regional protection of both large and small drinking water reservoirs, globally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

While progress has been made in many research areas, there still remains no simple, precise, real-time technique to identify HAB cells and their toxins from seawater and freshwater samples.</p> <p>This Phase I proposal developed a novel sensor that identifies toxic plankton, specifically Harmful Algal Blooms, and toxic particulates (including microplastics) using in-situ Light Field (LF) microscopy, to provide a tremendous increase in 3D sample volume, coupled with Micro Raman Spectroscopy (MRS) to provide distinct species and toxin-specific fingerprints. The prototype sensor, contained in a water resistant case, provides real-time sensing with cellular communications, distributed, long-term monitoring of toxic contamination using networked arrays of instruments, and an Internet of Things approaches for tracking regional events.&nbsp;</p> <p>Results: Objective: 1) To produce an extensible library of MRS fingerprints from pure toxins, HAB cultures, mixed cultures and field samples to establish optimal conditions under which cells and their toxins may be identified against a noisy background. Currently in our image and Raman library, we have 22 marine toxic HAB species, six non-toxic marine species, and 28 potentially toxic fresh-water species providing a wide range of both toxic and non-toxic cells. We also have over 40 polymers and co-polymers along with 100s of mixtures of additives such as flame retardants and UV anti-oxidants.&nbsp;</p> <p>Objective 2) To combine MRS and LF into one imaging system using coaxial optics, short exposure, and advanced classification software using Deep Learning. We have converted one of our CPICS instruments using high magnification (20x objective) and coaxial 532 nm laser illumination into an imaging micro Raman spectrometer using appropriate dichroic, 532nm notch and sharp-cut long-pass (&gt;534 nm) filters, fiber optic focusing optics, and an Ocean Optics QEPro spectrometer. The result is an Imaging Micro Raman Spectrometer ready for deployment. We have used the prototype to collect data on our library of HABs and plastics along with natural coastal water around Woods Hole and in a local freshwater pond where the toxic cyanobacteria Anabaena and Microcystis were blooming.&nbsp;</p> <p>Objective 3) To integrate data output from the prototype instrument into a remotely distributed array of sensor packages. We are using low cost cellular IoT modules to allow for connectivity between our instruments and a server at our company. This deemed more cost effective than using a commercial cloud site such as Microsoft Azure or Amazon at this point in time.</p> <p>Dr. Donald Anderson, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and his lab members collaborated by providing ground-truthing on toxin and HAB culture identification and concentrations. In Phase II, we will propose multiple in-situ instruments to be developed and tested, followed by commercial manufacturing and marketing through our partners, Lockhead Martin and Polaris, Inc. We are striving to minimize costs while ensuring optimal performance to make this instrument widely available.</p> <p>This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project addressed several challenging solutions to real-time detection and quantification of particulate and soluble environmental toxins: (1) Integration of Light Field 3D microscopic imaging with Stimulated Raman spectroscopy had not been done, but is now providing an instrument of immense value to public health by bringing real-time toxin identification to the internet. (2) Low levels of toxins need to be characterized from a seawater and freshwater matrix against a background of complex chemical mixtures requiring new chemometric algorithms and novel data products using Deep Learning from distributed sensor arrays. (3) New Raman libraries have been developed at chemical-specific (algal pigments, fatty acids, carbohydrates, and microplastics) resonant frequencies to provide the strongest signals against complex backgrounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The U.S. EPA list of drinking water contaminants (CCL 4), includes toxins produced by freshwater cyanobacteria (Microcystis, Planktothrix, and Cylindrospermopsis) and marine algae and dinoflagellates.

In addition, the ability to detect and characterize microplastics (1 um to 1mm) to polymer type in real-time is the next critical issue in microplastics research.
