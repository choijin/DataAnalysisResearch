<AbstractNarration>This award will fund the participation of US-based junior researchers in the "TQFT and Categorification" conference to be held at the Institut d'Etudes Scientifiques de Cargese on April 15-20, 2018.  The subject of Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT) has provided a critical testing ground where ideas from theoretical physics inform rigorous mathematical frameworks that lay the foundation for a quantum theory of gravity.   TQFTs have been particularly well studied in 3-dimensions, bringing about unprecedented interaction between mathematics and theoretical physics. Since the world we live in is 4-dimensional (including time),  truly understand it requires an extension of the techniques of 3-dimensional TQFTs into 4-dimensions.  This enhancement of mathematical structures has come to be called "Categorification".    This conference will advance this ambitious program to understand 4-dimensional TQFTs, while proving important opportunities for the establishment of new collaborations and the scientific development of young scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "TQFT and Categorification" conference  aims to bring together researchers from different horizons around the central question of lifting the techniques from the study of 3-dimensional TQFTs to 4-dimensions.  The conference will be organized around three central themes: Heegaard-Floer homologies and symplectic geometry,  Algebraic categorification (including Khovanov homology, categorified quantum groups, and categorification at roots of the unity),  and  TQFT (including connections to physics,  super homologies, and non-semisimple invariants). The organizers expect this conference to be a catalyst for establishing lasting collaborations and new avenues of research. More information about this conference can be found at https://tqft.sciencesconf.org/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This NSF grant supported US participants for an international conference whose goal was to build the foundations of an ambitious program lying at the interface of modern mathematics and theoretical physics.  This conference was also supported by French and Swiss funding agencies.   We expect this conference to be a catalyst for establishing lasting collaborations and new avenues of research.    The international conference on TQFT and Categorification was held at the Institut D' Etudes Scientifques de Cargese (IESC) in Cargese, France, April 15th - 20th, 2018.  The conference had 52 participants from all over the world including graduate students and postdocs.  The conference had 21 lectures including invited and contributed lectures.    The opening day of the conference featured 3 introductory lectures spanning the broad themes of the conference.   These lectures set the tone for the rest of the conference, encouraging speakers to make their area more accessible to a broader audience.  Each day of the workshop featured a dedicated discussion time where interdisciplinary collaboration was strongly encouraged. Specific benefits resulting from the conference include: 1) Fostering an environment for the establishment of international collaboration. 2) Exposing graduate students, post-docs, and young faculty to new developments in mathematics and theoretical physics. 3)  Bringing together researchers with diverse approaches for utilizing tools to solve current and pressing mathematical problems.     The conference made a focused effort to bolster the interaction between junior and senior researchers through the introductory lectures and focused discussions.  The conference provided opportunities for research, teaching and mentoring in science and engineering related areas.  The organizing committee made a concerted effort to include underrepresented groups as speakers and participants at the conference.
