<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. Through this catalyst project, Prairie View A&amp;M University will initiate a comprehensive and synergetic forensic genomics program which will broaden awareness and access to the STEM workforce by engaging students in innovative interdisciplinary educational activities. The program will impact society by increasing minority representation and advancement in the forensic science workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities will advance knowledge and understanding within the field of Forensic Science as well as across multiple disciplines, both STEM and non-STEM at PVAMU and the surrounding educational communities. By enhancing the scientific exposure of students, they will graduate with a more well-rounded training that can improve competitiveness in the STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
