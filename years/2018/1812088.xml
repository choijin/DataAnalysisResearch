<AbstractNarration>The Third Workshop on Higher-Order Asymptotics and Post-Selection Inference (WHOA-PSI) will be held on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis from September 8-10, 2018.  Post-selection inference refers to the question of valid statistical inference performed after a model selection procedure has been utilized. Higher-order asymptotics provide the tools and insights needed to refine basic large-sample results for post-selection inference procedures and make them more accurate and powerful, even when the scientist only has access to small to moderate sample sizes. WHOA-PSI seeks to merge these fields, foster collaboration and discussion, and push forward the post-selection inference research frontier in the direction of higher-order accuracy and more powerful inference procedures. NSF funding will support junior researchers attending this conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop attempts to address the needs of applied statisticians utilizing model selection procedures who also need extremely accurate and powerful inference procedures with theoretical guarantees. Topics from post-selection inference include selective inference after variable selection, high-dimensional and post-regularized inference, inference after change-point estimation, and simultaneous inference. Some talks will focus on methods from higher-order asymptotics, which can yield insights and improvements to post-selection inference procedures, including series expansions, saddlepoint approximations, and bootstrap-based refinements. Additional talks will present important applied problems for which new post-selection methods are needed. Examples include statistical genetics, neuroscience, and finance. (See http://www.math.wustl.edu/~kuffner/WHOA-PSI-3.html)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

This was accomplished by bringing together researchers from the relatively new field of post-selection inference, and experts on analytic- and resampling-based refinements to large sample distribution theory. Other goals included advertising applied problems in need of post-selection inference procedures, and encouraging the higher-order asymptotics community to turn its attention towards the challenge of inference after model selection. Of the 89 total participants from 43 institutions, there were 23 were graduate students, 5 post-docs, and 24 assistant professors. The research program gave participants the opportunity to learn about the frontier of statistical inference methodology. The workshop included a broad selection of different viewpoints, which enhanced the participants' understanding of the challenges that are unique to post-selection inference.

This project provided financial support for 19 junior participants, including many from underrepresented groups. Of these 19 junior participants, 9 presented posters, and 3 were invited speakers. The NSF support for this workshop significantly increased the number of junior participants from other universities. The talks were followed by lively discussions, and frequent breaks for collaborative interactions. The junior participants had ample opportunities to interact with all of the senior researchers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/15/2019<br>      Modified by: Todd&nbsp;A&nbsp;Kuffner</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
