<AbstractNarration>This award is to assist US-based graduate students to attend the 2018 ACS/IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (ACS/IEEE AICCSA)) to be held in Aqaba, Jordan, October 28 - November 1, 2018.  Participation in AICCSA and similar conferences are valuable and important activities of the graduate school experience. It provides a venue that may expand the experiences of the participating graduate students to enable interactions with researchers in general from all over the world and from the Middle East in particular.  This may have an important impact on their career development and will give some experiences to participate effectively in the global economy and information services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference held in Aqaba, Jordan will span five days and will consist of technical paper presentations, industry participation, posters, a Doctoral Symposium and a Career Mentoring session.  It will also feature keynote speeches from leading researchers and practitioners.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student travel to conferences is an important activity. Funds will be dispersed with preference given to students who would not otherwise be able to attend the conference and students who are not already scheduled to present a paper, paying particular attention to provide opportunities to under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Title:   NSF Student Travel Grant for 2018 ACS/IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (ACS/IEEE AICCSA)  Overview:  The ACS/IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA) is the premier research conference covering all contemporary areas in computer systems and applications and hence it is an international forum for leading researchers and practitioners in this important and rapidly changing disciplines. The AICCSA conference is an excellent venue and a great opportunity for graduate students to share the results of their work with the community and interact informally with faculty and researchers.  In this spirit, our aim is to organize a doctoral forum as a concurrent track during the AICCSA 2018 conference. The theme of the PhD forum is ?How to prepare yourself for transitioning from graduate school life to professional life?. The primary objective of the NSF Student Travel Grant for 2018 AICCSA is to support PhD students from US based institutions to be able to participate in the doctoral symposium and also attend the main conference.  Intellectual Merit:  The doctoral symposium is meant to engage graduate students attending the symposium with interactions that provide the attendees with research and career mentoring. The primary objectives of the doctoral symposium are:  Provide a venue for graduate students to present their research during the PhD Forum and obtain feedback from experts in the area; and also participate with a poster  during the poster session of the main conference.  Provide mentoring from both industry and academic career path point of views with sound career advice.   The entire day of interactive sessions planned as part of the doctoral symposium involved two keynote speakers and  four faculty/industry mentors covering academic and industry aspects of career planning and transitioning from graduate school life to professional life.  Broader Impacts:  There is no reward better than having your intellectual work accepted by the experts in your field of research. The conference experience is an invaluable asset for a graduate student whose career goal is to become a faculty member and a leader in his/her research field.  There are several avenues for networking and publicizing your work, but there?s no substitution for meeting leaders in your field in a face to face setting during a conference and forming new relationships. Our aim is to have graduate students funded through the travel grant return from an international conference with invaluable cultural exchange experience, new perspectives, new ideas and approaches that will become a stepping stone for their future career.  The forum provides a venue for PhD students to present their research, receive individual feedback regarding their research project and career mentoring from a team of faculty and industry mentors to learn about their experience on applying and interviewing for faculty positions. Successful implementation of the 2018 AICCSA Doctoral Symposium is expected to have far-reaching impacts on computing systems research, and the mentoring and training of PhD students. The overall impact that such a meeting can have on PhD students, both early and late in their studies, can be invaluable towards building the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in this important research arena. The findings at the Doctoral Symposium will be made publicly available to increase the dissemination of the keynotes and the results of the Q&amp;A session on career mentoring.
