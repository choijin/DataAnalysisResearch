<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the most common computations in processing Big Data and performing real-time analyses on data streaming-in to enterprise data centers. For the same total cost, the technology advanced by the proposed project is expected to increase performance by a factor of 12. As part of this improvement, it is expected to reduce the energy per instruction by a factor of 25 times or greater. This frees businesses to apply more advanced analytics techniques and react more quickly to changing business conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the ever-growing need to process more data, but on a fixed budget. The objective is to provide accelerator technology for an increasingly critical set of applications that are currently underserved by generic CPU technology. The project aims eventually to deliver a PCIe accelerator card populated by silicon chips based on a new type of accelerator micro-architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intensivate Incorporated has successfully implemented a high performance, low power CPU for Enterprise class cluster-ready applications running in the Cloud.  It was measured to deliver equivalent performance to current generation Xeon processors on this class of application, at 15 times lower power, and 20 times lower die cost.  When deployed in the Cloud for cluster ready applications such as those built on top of Hadoop, Kafka, Spark, and so on, or when running multithreaded custer based code, such as high performance simultions, the end-user gets 12 times more computation per dollar spent.  And the environment sees 20 times less impact from completing the work.  The Phase I project has successfully implemented a measurement system, based on UC Berkeley's FireSim FPGA system.  With this, the instructions per cycle have been measured to average 1.8 across a suite of 12 benchmark applications that represent common Cloud compute intensivate workloads.  During the Phase I project, a layout of the core was also performed, which showed that the clock speed will reach 3.2GHz in a 16nm fabrication process.  Customer activity performed during Phase I has demonstrated strong interest from a variety of parties, including server vendors, custom solution providers, software vendors who provide cluster computing platforms, and individual Enterprise customers, not to mention SMB customers.  Together, these measurements give compelling evidence that the final silicon will deliver the benefits that the end-users are expressing such strong interest in.  The website http://Intensivate.com provides more information and a chance to contact the company to learn more.       Last Modified: 10/06/2019       Submitted by: Sean S Halle]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
