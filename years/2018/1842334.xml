<AbstractNarration>Collaborative argumentation - the building of evidence-based, reasoned knowledge and solutions through dialogue - is essential to individual learning as well as group problem-solving in STEM and other disciplines and a defining characteristic of 21st century workplaces. However, teaching collaborative argumentation is an advanced skill that many high school teachers struggle to develop. This EArly Grant for Exploratory Research explores the feasibility of improving high school teachers' understanding of collaborative argumentation and instruction through a computer-based system called Discussion Tracker. The prototype system draws upon recent advances in human language technologies (HLT) to provide teachers with automatically generated data about the characteristics and quality of their students' discussions. The system also provides individualized guidance for teachers on how to improve the facilitation of such discussions. The project has the potential to prepare a new generation of teachers and students for the productive collaborative argumentation they will need for future educational and workplace settings. Findings and products resulting from this study also contribute to research and technological innovations aimed at improving teacher learning and student discussions in high school English classrooms and other content areas, grade levels, and learning platforms. Additionally, the project's multidisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students is focused on increasing diversity in cyberlearning research and development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three stages of investigation are planned, First, a schema of the features of high-quality collaborative argumentation in high school English language arts (ELA) discussions is  created and tested in order to identify the most critical discourse features. Second, prototypes of the system's interface is developed that provide varied amounts and types of data visualizations and explicit guidance for teacher learning. Third, in order to analyze data on teacher learning, a series of  experiments are conducted to study how teachers interact with various prototypes of the system. In order to test optimal teacher learning, teachers will be assigned to one of two conditions: (1) Use of the system with a brief reflection guide, designed to document teachers' observations and prompt teachers' instructional changes, (2) Use of the system with an expert instructional coach. Teacher learning will be studied through reflective, qualitative think aloud protocols, pre-post questionnaires, and observations of instruction. Outcomes of the two experimental conditions will be compared using standard statistical methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of EAGER: Discussion Tracker: Development of Human Language Technologies to Improve the Teaching of Collaborative Argumentation in High School English Classrooms was to take the first steps towards developing Discussion Tracker, an educational technology that leverages recent advances in human language technologies (HLT) to provide teachers with automatically generated data about the quality of students' collaborative argumentation in their classrooms and to support teachers' learning about collaborative argumentation. Our project outcomes included (1) a complete schema and codebook for features of high-quality collaborative argumentation in high school English Language Arts (ELA) classroom discussions, (2) a prototype of Discussion Tracker that provided explicit guidance for teacher learning and data visualizations of student talk, (3) the results of "Wizard of Oz" experiments that documented how teachers learned about fostering collaborative argumentation by using Discussion Tracker. We audiorecorded 30 ELA discussions in the classrooms of 10 teachers and videorecorded 30 cogitive interviews with teachers as they used the Discussion Tracker system. We found that our theoretically-driven schema of features of high-quality collaborative argumentation (1. claims supported by evidence and reasoning; 2. specificity of statements; 3. students building on or challenging other students' ideas, and 4. talk that focused on the text) aligned with teachers' goals for classroom discussions. Our detailed codebook contributed to high inter-rater agreement on all discourse features (Cohen's Kappa, 0.70 - 0.89). Similar to our previous work, we found that students rarely voiced reasoning in support of evidence, specific/elaborated ideas, or disagreements, suggesting that there is much room for improvement in current ELA classroom discussions. Our study advances research in teacher learning by contributing knowledge of how teachers develop their understanding and instruction of collaborative argumentation through the visualization of individualized data (from their classes) and varying forms of guidance. Teachers noticed and reflected on more features of collaborative argumentation when using Discussion Tracker as compared to reflecting without Discussion Tracker. Similarly, teachers who received more human coaching made more observations and plans for improving future instruction. All teachers reported that the system was very useful to their instructional improvement. However, even though the quality of students' collaborative argumentation improved from the first to second discussions, the quality declined from the second to third discussions, suggesting that more than three uses of the Discussion Tracker system may be needed for longitudinal change. Our outcomes contribute to research in Human Language Technologies by making publicly available a unique, annotated corpus of 30 transcripts of collaborative argumentation in classroom discussions and demonstrating visualizations of language data that contribute to teacher learning. The broader impact of our work includes new knowledge about how teachers and students can improve collaborative argumentation, an important skill in educational and workplace settings of the future. Data visualization of students' argumentation and collaboration, both separately and combined, helped teachers notice and think of new ways to improve discussions. At the same time, the low frequencies of students' challenges to each other's ideas, evidence and reasoning to support claims, and highly specific utterances suggests that K-12 instruction needs to emphasize these skills more. Additionally, our coding schema and interface can be used to study and improve collaborative argumentation in other content areas (e.g., STEM) and learning platforms (e.g., MOOCs).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/30/2019<br>      Modified by: Amanda&nbsp;J&nbsp;Godley</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1842334/1842334_10562979_1577712904038_Overview_page--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1842334/1842334_10562979_1577712904038_Overview_page--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Discussion Tracker Overview Page"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1842334/1842334_10562979_1577712904038_Overview_page--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Discussion Tracker Overview Page"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Discussion Tracker Overview Page</div> <div class="imageCredit">Amanda Godley</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Amanda&nbsp;J&nbsp;Godley</div> <div class="imageTitle">Discussion Tracker Overview Page</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1842334/1842334_10562979_1577712967381_DiscussionTracker_transcript_colored--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1842334/1842334_10562979_1577712967381_DiscussionTracker_transcript_colored--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Discussion Tracker Annotated Transcript Page"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1842334/1842334_10562979_1577712967381_DiscussionTracker_transcript_colored--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Discussion Tracker Annotated Transcript Page"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Discussion Tracker Annotated Transcript Page</div> <div class="imageCredit">Amanda Godley</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Amanda&nbsp;J&nbsp;Godley</div> <div class="imageTitle">Discussion Tracker Annotated Transcript Page</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1842334/1842334_10562979_1577713033398_Collaboration_map_page--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1842334/1842334_10562979_1577713033398_Collaboration_map_page--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Discussion Tracker Collaboration Map Page"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1842334/1842334_10562979_1577713033398_Collaboration_map_page--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Discussion Tracker Collaboration Map Page"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Discussion Tracker Collaboration Map Page</div> <div class="imageCredit">Amanda Godley</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Amanda&nbsp;J&nbsp;Godley</div> <div class="imageTitle">Discussion Tracker Collaboration Map Page</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1842334/1842334_10562979_1577713102138_T126.EAGER.2.Mockingbird_history--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1842334/1842334_10562979_1577713102138_T126.EAGER.2.Mockingbird_history--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Discussion Tracker Discussion History Page"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1842334/1842334_10562979_1577713102138_T126.EAGER.2.Mockingbird_history--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Discussion Tracker Discussion History Page"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Discussion Tracker Discussion History Page</div> <div class="imageCredit">Amanda Godley</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Amanda&nbsp;J&nbsp;Godley</div> <div class="imageTitle">Discussion Tracker Discussion History Page</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
