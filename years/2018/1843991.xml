<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)&lt;br/&gt;project is to make unique properties of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) widely available to&lt;br/&gt;developers. In doing so, the company will empower developers to create novel distributed services with&lt;br/&gt;trustworthy and consistent shared state operations that will lead to more transparent business&lt;br/&gt;and governance practices. In the Phase I tools will lead to new innovative meat&lt;br/&gt;distribution businesses in Bozeman, MT. In the long term, we aim to build the fundamental tools&lt;br/&gt;for the growing ranks of blockchain developers, who need powerful and easy-to-integrate tools&lt;br/&gt;that access and manipulate DLT state. Ultimately, our suite of services will provide a unified&lt;br/&gt;interface to multiple DLT implementations and facilitate the trustworthy exchange of shared&lt;br/&gt;state among different applications to create a wide and consistent view of world state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to create an ecosystem of tools to operate on shared&lt;br/&gt;application state stored on DLTs and to roll out these tools as they mature. The ultimate goal is&lt;br/&gt;to provide a unified API much like that of leading cloud service providers, which consists of&lt;br/&gt;several incrementally introduced services.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the services planned to provide are:&lt;br/&gt;1. Blocky Valve - A JavaScript API that simplifies DLT read and write access.&lt;br/&gt;2. Blocky Pipes - A DLT data delivery microservice based on message queues connected&lt;br/&gt;to Blocky Valve.&lt;br/&gt;3. Blocky Loading Ramp - A continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service&lt;br/&gt;of smart contracts.&lt;br/&gt;4. Blocky Cement - An oracle service for exchanging data across DLTs using&lt;br/&gt;consensus-based provenance. Cement will also enable interaction between smart&lt;br/&gt;contracts across different DLTs.&lt;br/&gt;5. Blocky Crates - A database-like query interface to data stored on DLTs. Crates will also&lt;br/&gt;enable smart contracts to interact with up-to-date shared application state stored on&lt;br/&gt;DLTs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
