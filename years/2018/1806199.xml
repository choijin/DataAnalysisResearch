<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the workshop Energy Storage 2017: Opportunities and Challenges for Electric Grid, Wave, Hydropower and Other Sustainable Energies at Oregon State University on November 5-6, 2017. The objective of this workshop is for researchers from academia, national laboratories, and industry to discuss the fundamental and applied research needs for energy storage with renewable energy including wind, wave, and solar. The workshop will include topics on the fundamental issues of the use of battery packs for electric vehicles; and of large storage capacity systems to handle grid interconnections. The discussions will be focused on how robust these systems and electric grids are. The resilience in energy storage technologies will affect the choices of storage systems and their implementation with a given energy resource or application. The workshop will also address issues related to the commercialization and manufacturing of energy storage systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;National Science Foundation will provide travel funds and registration to support approximately 20 undergraduate and graduate students to attend the workshop. The organizers will emphasize broadening participation to encourage women and underrepresented minorities in STEM attendance. The students will have an opportunity to attend talks and poster sessions and network with faculty and national laboratory and industry researchers. The outcome of the workshop is a strategy to increase collaboration across universities, national laboratories, and industry for fundamental and applied research supporting energy storage for sustainable transport and electricity generation.</AbstractNarration>

The conference was held at Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, from November 5 to 6, 2017. In this two-day conference, there were 84 registered attendance (actual participants are more than 100 if considering sessions open to public), of whom were 16 invited speakers (8 from Companies, 5 from Universities, 2 from National Labs, 1 from US Army Research Lab) and 22 poster presenters (2 from University of Washington, 20 from Oregon State University). In addition to invited talks, the conference also has a panel (with speakers from National Lab, University, US Army Research, Nissan North American) to discuss urgent needs in next generation storage systems for Oregon, Pacific Northwest and USA in different fields (academia, industries, and defense), a poster session, and an open introduction lecture for undergraduate students on energy storage.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong>This conference brought a diverse group of speakers from academia and industry to provide participants in general with ideas on where to focus research to best impact the field and address challenges in resilient electric grids and sustainable energies.

They all got benefited from the talks and discussions in the conference.

The conference has identified the current challenges in academia and industrial, which help us hone our message and work more collaboratively with each other. Another major emphasis of this conference is inclusion of underrepresented students as participants in the Symposium. With NSF support, we sponsored 24 graduate and undergraduate students, of whom are 20 US citizen (4 international), 11 undergraduates (13 graduates), and 10 underrepresented students (6 female and 4 minority). The conference ensures a diverse audience who will form the energy storage workforce of 2020. This conference also increases the awareness of the importance of sustainable energy and helps the development of suitable and scalable energy storage systems to efficiently handle different forms of energy, thus remedying the gap between fundamental research and commercial applications.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/28/2018<br>      Modified by: Zhenxing&nbsp;Feng</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1806199/1806199_10524991_1543373728334_conference_graphic--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1806199/1806199_10524991_1543373728334_conference_graphic--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Conference flyer"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1806199/1806199_10524991_1543373728334_conference_graphic--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Conference flyer"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The conference flyer</div> <div class="imageCredit">Keith Hautala</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zhenxing&nbsp;Feng</div> <div class="imageTitle">Conference flyer</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
