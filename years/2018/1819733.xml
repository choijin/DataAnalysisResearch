<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will address the pedagogical and evaluative problems caused by our current inability to measure core outcomes beyond information recall. The proposed innovation makes important educational outcomes such as deep understanding, cognition (thinking skills) and awareness of thinking (metacognition) measurable. Reliable assessment of these outcomes has broad significance to education and society writ large, as many employers struggle with skills gaps between high school and college graduates and the professional, personal and societal demands on adults in the 21st Century. This research combines cognitive science, epistemology, systems science, and complex systems with new developments in artificial intelligence, including machine learning and neural networks, and aligns well with the NSF's mission to promote progress in science and advance national prosperity. This project not only has the potential to impact core tenets of educational practice - including how teachers teach, how learners learn, and how we measure and understanding knowledge - but also may have impact on science through increased ability to map and analyze patterns and common structures in knowledge and generally for Americans to increase their developmental skills and abilities. Beginning in an educational market valued at $8-15 billion, this project has the potential to catalyze significant job creation and have significant commercial impact across a range of related industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project introduces a visual grammar for mapping ideas in a canvas-based environment, and provides a neural-network based mechanism for quantitatively comparing expressions of complex ideas along many dimensions to facilitate a new approach to thinking, learning, and assessment. Maps of ideas will be tokenized and serialized and then fed through a recurrent neural network model to produce encoded numeric vector representations that are meaningfully comparable in their encoded form. Once in this form, vectors will be compared and evaluated for content and structure similarity, and insights offered in many dimensions: depth of detail, understanding of relationships, and numerous other meaningful measures. These vectors enable scalable, consistent, constructive assessment in a way not previously possible. In the mapping environment, teachers and students will create maps either on their own, or collaboratively together in real-time. As users create maps, we use the generated vectors to analyze both content and structure, and then prompt users to think about their subject matter from new perspectives. As a means of evaluation, teachers will create mapping activities for students to complete, and then student maps will be quantitatively compared to the standards and target maps which represent the complete understanding of the topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The NSF/SBIR phase 1 funding project demonstrates the value and feasibility of  an assessment tool for K-12 education that enables educators to scalably measure information recall; student?s development of metacognitive skills; and  students? deep understanding of core subjects.  We created a viable way to measure thinking as a critical piece of learning. A scalable measurement tool can drive pedagogical change and classroom practices. Our mapping technology (and corollary teacher training) shifts pedagogy away from mastery of content, by offering scalable assessments of a student?s metacognition (thinking skills) embedded inside of deep mastery of course content. We demonstrated the value of metacognitive mapping for curriculum and assessment and also as a key part of  a new blended online learning management system.  Notably, the metacognitive mapping tool provides both robust quantitative assessments of the content and thinking skills in a given lesson, and also provided visual scaffolding for the development of metacognitive awareness.   Our work showed that metacognitive mapping (SCAA) technology can easily be implemented as an online learning tool in K-12 education. In the longer term,  this tool also applies to higher education and corporate university environments.  Importantly, our tool shifts the paradigm of education away from relying solely on a teacher lecturing and drawing on a board, while students passively listen, and attempt to answer questions --- to a blended approach of in-person and online learning.  Metacognitive mapping provides immediate feedback to the learner on their depth of understanding, and makes online learning in any subject area experiential and engaging.  This applies to all subjects in which students need to build knowledge; including (but not limited to) english, history, science, math, language, or life skills. Metacognitive maps are built on the cognitive "code" humans use to build meaning and can therefore be easily taught to teachers and students. Using Metacognitive maps, teachers and  students actively construct knowledge in any topic together.  Teachers expressed that this tool gets students started learning about any topic and guides them through mapping information and thinking. Teachers also highlighted the importance the tool had in helping students think through relationships, and assessing if students were making key relationships. Several teachers liked that students could unlock different viewpoints (perspectives) on the same topic/project using the mapping tool. Results from user tests and in depth interviews with K12 teachers show;   86 % of teachers were confident this tool could improve their teaching.   90% of teachers were confident students would engage with the tool in the classroom.    90% of teachers would use the teaching tool in their daily work.    "This product would provide students with a useful source of feedback that helps students to understand their own thinking and keeps them working, rather than having to wait for a teacher?s feedback (saving teachers time and effort)... and will enforce the idea that there is not only one right answer to questions/problems." In sum, teachers thought it had great value as a thinking tool for students to help them clarify, verbalize, and understand their own thinking. A majority of students (92%) said the tool would be highly beneficial in a classroom environment to make learning more comprehensible, transparent; and also to provide an opportunity for instantaneous feedback on their understanding of the lesson content. "This tool is a revolutionary tool that would allow you to breakdown a lengthy and troublesome topic that without it may result in some confusion. It gets you to think through something thoroughly yet accurately. Lastly, it's simple. Rather than sketching, erasing, jotting, and burning your way through pencils, you can simply use this mapping tool to ease your way into any topic/subject" Student Participant The purposeful integration of metacognition into the effort to master content was the crux of our work, and yielded significant results and  benefits to all learners. Of particular importance is that we saw that metacognition can be purposefully developed when it is made an explicit part of instruction, assessment, and educational practices. This work resulted in a shifted focus away from using our  technology for assessment only to developing into an interactive tool for integrating, learning, teaching and assessment for BOTH teachers and students to use in the classroom.
