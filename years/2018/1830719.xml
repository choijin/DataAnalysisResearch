<AbstractNarration>Under the direction of Dr. Patrick Ryan Williams, Marie Elizabeth Gravalos will investigate shifting trade relationships through the lens of food consumption in households. Previous research on prehistoric trade relations has centered on the analysis of prestige commodities at political and religious centers, demonstrating long-distance economic interaction. But what does it mean when small communities gain access to new goods and how does this affect wider social distinction and authority? How do small-scale social entities contribute to shifting political economies? Archaeology is well positioned to examine these questions because of its emphasis on studying material remains from a chronological perspective. Although this research centers upon one case study, findings will be compared to regional datasets to contextualize site-level findings within a broader political economy. As a collaborative effort between colleagues in the US and Peru, this project has already had significant broader impacts through the employment of rural community members living near the archaeological site of focus as well as the education of undergraduate and graduate students. Additionally, the researchers will co-curate a temporary museum exhibit in Peru to display findings to the public. This research also supports US and Peruvian women in science and leadership roles. This research will result in one Ph.D. dissertation as well as multiple conference papers and academic publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gravalos and her team will evaluate the material remains of food consumption from every day eating and specialized feasts to identify differences in local authority, economic access, and cultural traditions through the lens of cuisine. Researchers will analyze and compare data from diverse household contexts at the archaeological site of Jecosh - a prehispanic village in the Callejan de Huaylas valley of highland Ancash, Peru. Established during the Early Intermediate Period (1-700 CE) near several intersecting trade routes within the valley, this community was likely engaged in new politico-economic networks that developed during the subsequent Middle Horizon (700-1000 CE). Researchers will examine various datasets to understand changes in cuisine and access across these time periods, including 1) macro- and micro-botanical, 2) faunal, 3) ceramic geochemical and mineralogical, and 4) architectural. By examining differences in food consumption across discrete architectural contexts, researchers will gain a detailed understanding of a small-village's participation or isolation from a regional political economy over time. Further, this diverse dataset will elucidate the daily lives of a small prehispanic village, contributing to broader understandings of the lived human experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project studied food and ceramic consumption at the prehispanic village of Jecosh, located in the Callej?n de Huaylas valley of highland Ancash, Peru. This case study sought to evaluate shifting trade relations and political economy during the first millennium CE, a time when early indigenous states expanded their economic networks and established colonies across the Andes. Archaeologists have often studied this era of transformation through the lens of prestige goods found at urban centers. This project expands our understanding of political economy and state expansion through the study of consumption practices at a rural village. What role do small-scale communities play in burgeoning political economies? How does access to new goods affect community social distinction?</p> <p>During 2018-2019, PhD candidate Marie Elizabeth Gr?valos examined these questions through specialty lab analysis of archaeological materials from the site of Jecosh. In 2018, Gr?valos traveled to Peru to collaborate on botanical and zooarchaeological analysis with Peruvian and Polish researchers. Botanical analysis revealed that Jecosh residents consumed an array of foodstuffs over time, dominated by quinoa and tubers. Surprisingly, maize was a dominant crop as well, which could not have been grown locally at the site due to its high altitude. Zooarchaeological analysis affirmed the species upon which Jecosh residents relied, such as cervids and camelids. These animals were not only food sources, but also served as valuable raw material for tool production. Discarded animal bone tools were isolated to one area of the site, suggesting heightened use or production in that area. To date, prehispanic bone tools have not been reported on for this region. Significantly, Gr?valos and her team did not observe a difference in taxa consumed across the site or over time, revealing a steady access to food resources for all households during the first millennium CE.</p> <p>In addition to research in Peru, Gr?valos exported ceramic and organic remains to the United States for further study, including compositional analysis (laser ablation ? inductively coupled plasma ? mass spectrometry and petrographic thin-section analysis) as well as radiocarbon dating. Compositional analysis conducted by Gr?valos at the Field Museum?s Elemental Analysis Facility revealed ceramic paste recipes and their geological sources, shedding light on where people at Jecosh may have procured raw materials and identified vessels that likely traveled long distances. This data, coupled with radiocarbon dates, demonstrates that Jecosh residents continued certain ceramic production practices over time but also supplemented their pottery consumption with new technologies and foreign goods. Radiocarbon data revealed a nearly 2,000-year occupation of the site, beginning around 300 BCE. In sum, the archaeological data demonstrate that Jecosh residents maintained their local cultural traditions while also adapting to and incorporating foreign influences. Future comparison of the Jecosh ceramics with other sites in the region will further situate Jecosh within the regional political economy.</p> <p>Further, this research contributed to cultural heritage engagement with the descendent community and the broader Ancash public. In consultation with local archaeologists and heritage officials in the city of Huaraz, Gr?valos and her team curated a temporary museum exhibit that displayed artifacts from Jecosh alongside explanatory posters. This exhibit, entitled ?Conociendo Jecosh: Un Sitio Arqueol?gico en el Callej?n de Huaylas? (Getting to Know Jecosh: An Archaeological Site in the Callej?n de Hualyas) was on display at the Museo Arqueol?gico de Ancash (Ancash Archaeology Museum) in Huaraz, Peru between July-August 2018. Local undergraduate students from the Universidad Nacional ? Santiago Ant?nez de Mayolo in Huaraz assisted in artifact cleaning and exhibit preparation. An opening reception was held on July 6<sup>th</sup>, 2018 and pamphlets were distributed to the public throughout the duration of the exhibit. After exhibit closure, the accompanying explanatory posters were donated to the local primary school in the town of Recuay, Peru near the Jecosh archaeological site.</p> <p>To date, this project?s conclusions have been disseminated in the form of conference presentations and academic workshops.
