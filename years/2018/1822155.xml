<AbstractNarration>Southern Illinois University Carbondale plans to work together with Arizona State University, the University of Arizona, the University of Southern California, and the University of Connecticut to form a new NSF Industry University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) for Networked, Embedded, Smart and Trusted Things (NESTT). The vision of the NESTT Center is to contribute to the development of an equitable, safe and secure connected world, focusing on creating holistic Internet of Things (IoT) solutions by integrating technology disciplines with expertise in other areas such as law, business, and humanities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning grant's objective is to organize with industry partners and the participating universities to outline a research agenda and explore industry commitment.  At the IUCRC planning meeting, SIUC faculty will present their interdisciplinary research interests, spanning the technology areas of embedded systems, networking, edge and cloud computing, smart grid, machine learning, data analytics, and security. Innovative high performance, trustworthy, and secure IoT solutions for transportation, smart cities, energy, and healthcare will be developed. Researchers in non-engineering disciplines, particularly privacy, trade secret rights, and contractual rights, may engage in the Center's activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the planning meeting is successful, the efforts of SIUC and partner universities in NESTT could help implement IoT solutions that will improve the quality of life and sustainability. Lowering the barriers to the adoption of IoT technologies through holistic multidisciplinary design and innovation in embedded, networked, trusted, and secure things, our efforts will help realize the full potential of the IoT, and deliver significant economic, societal and environmental returns. The planning meeting will explore ways to broaden the participation of underrepresented students. For example, SIUC will engage with the Success in Engineering through Excellence and Diversity program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The agenda, list of participants, and activities of the NESTT IUCRC planning meeting and workshops will be posted on SIUC's website for the Consortium for Embedded Systems (CES), https://ces.siu.edu. Once NESTT is established, CES will be merged with the NESTT site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Major Goals of the project     The goal of this project is to organize a workshop that will bring together researchers from academia and companies from a broad range of industries for the purpose to establishing a new IUCRC named NESST, ?Network-Embedded, Smart and Safe Things?.  Initially, it was proposed to call the IUCRC as NESTT, ?Networked Embedded, Smart and Trusted Things?. However, the name NESST title reflects better the IUCRC?s emphasis on the safety aspects in the IoT domain. The specific objectives of this project are:     to recruit companies from a wide spectrum of industries that can benefit from IoT,  to construct an efficient organization,  to establish well defined set of procedures for operating NESTT, and  to produce an industry-ranked set of proposals.      A proposal to establish NESST will be submitted to NSF at the conclusion of the planning phase. The vision of NESST is to contribute to the creation of an equitable, safe and secure connected world. The techno- logical, societal and business challenges outlined above will be addressed through the inclusion of faculty from the schools of engineering, business, law and humanities. The work in NESST will be focused along three major themes:     Mobile, Edge and Cloud Computing  Industrial, Medical, Retail IoT  Transportation and Infrastructure      The objective of the IUCRC to be proposed based on the outcome of the planning grant is to establish a multi-university, multi-disciplinary, collaborative effort of five universities to undertake industry relevant research and development of Internet of Things with safety as the primary theme and overarching driving force. The five universities are in alphabetical order): Arizona State University (ASU), Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIUC), University of Arizona (UA), University of Connecticut (UConn), and University of Southern California (USC).     Organizationally, the IUCRC will have five site directors: Dr. Sarma Vrudhula, Professor in the School of Computing, Informatics and Decision Systems Engineering (CIDSE); Dr. Spyros Tragoudas, Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at SIUC; Dr. Frederic Zenhausern, Professor in the College of Medicine at UA; Dr. George Bollas, Associate Professor, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Connecticut (UConn); and Dr. Bhaskar Krishnamachari, Professor in the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering at USC.               What was accomplished under these goals     Major Activities     The PI at Southern Illinois University used the planning grant to visit and recruit several potential members, and to invite SIUC faculty and PhD students at the NESST planning workshop that was held in Phoenix AZ. In particular, the PI visited the VOLPE US Department of Transportation (Boston, MA), the Southwest Research Institute (San Antonio, TX), General Motors Company (Detroit, MI), Intel (Sacramento, CA), The National Renewable Research Laboratory/ Innovation Corridor/ Intel (Denver, CO), and paid the travel expenses of 7 SIUC faculty and 2 PhD students to attend and participate at the NESST planning workshop.     The proposed effort involves five universities.  As such it was an extremely challenging task to organize the planning workshop.  Prior to the actual holding of the workshop, we spent nearly 8 months preparing for the event.  This included continuous on-going activities including     Weekly directors meeting for 1 to 2 hours that involved discussions on      Recruiting efforts by directors and faculty; Mission, the areas of research, mechanisms to undertake collaborative projects; Membership fees; Organization and administration; Membership agreement and MoU among the universities; The organization and execution of the workshop; Research projects      Creation of a full marketing campaign including:    Design of the event flyer Working with IT group to establish an interactive website; Online registrations; Event newsletter;      Organizing the workshop    Negotiating with hotels for optimal pricing Preparing workshop literature including presentations, posters, registration materials, arranging for food and beverages, preparing literature for out-of-town visitors, and organizing transportation for some individuals.      Launch Workshop    1 ? day planning grant meeting held on May 16-17, 2019, Phoenix, AZ @ Hilton Garden Inn      Specific Objectives: As described earlier.     Significant Results: As described earlier.
