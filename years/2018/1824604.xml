<AbstractNarration>This grant will enable students to attend the Verification Mentoring Workshop (VMW 2018) which will be co-located with the International Conference on Computer Aided Verification (CAV), to be held in Oxford (UK), July 13-17, 2018. CAV is one of the premier conferences in computer science, dedicated to the advancement of the theory and practice of computer-aided formal analysis methods for hardware and software systems. The purpose of Verification Mentoring Workshop is to provide mentoring and career advice to early-stage graduate students, to attract them to pursue research careers in the area of computer-aided verification. Funded students will benefit greatly from the opportunity to engage in the critical technical, professional, and social exchanges that both conferences foster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer-aided verification covers a broad range of applications, from ensuring the correctness and safety of computer systems, to improving design and development productivity. The funded students will attend CAV, a top conference where they will learn about current research problems and interact with leaders in the field, and the VMW workshop which will focus on mentoring and career advice specific to early-stage graduate students who aim to pursue research careers in the area of computer-aided verification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The goal of Verification Mentoring Workshop (VMW) is to attract early-stage graduate students to pursue research careers in the area of computer-aided verification. Since this area is at the intersection of other traditional areas in computer science such as theory and logic, systems, programming languages, compilers, etc., students often have insufficient exposure to the broad range of research problems and career options that exist in the area. The workshop aims to fill this gap by focusing on mentoring and career advice, while providing an opportunity for participants to attend CAV, a top conference where attendees can learn about current research problems and interact with leaders in the field. Participation of women and under-represented minorities will be especially encouraged.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>VMW complements other summer schools that have been successful in this area, such as Marktoberdorf Summer School (https://asimod.in.tum.de/) and Summer School for Formal Techniques (http://fm.csl.sri.com/SSFT17). These summer schools provide an excellent opportunity for graduate students to learn about basic as well as state-of-the-art techniques in the form of in-depth lectures and courses. VMW is intended to focus explicitly on mentoring and career advice, along with an opportunity for participants to attend a top conference. The previous three VMWs were co-located with CAV 2015 (San Francisco, USA), CAV 2016 (Toronto, Canada), and CAV 2017 (Heidelberg, Germany), respectively. Through the generous support of NSF for VMW 2015, we supported the travel of 17 US-based students, of which 6 were women and 3 were from underrepresented minority groups (including one woman). In 2016, we supported 17 US-based students with support from NSF, of which 4 were women. In 2017, we supported 11 US-based students with support from NSF, of which 6 were women. All three VMWs received positive feedback from students and other attendees.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>CAV 2018 was held on July 14-17 in Oxford, UK, as part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC) which brings together 9 major international conferences related to mathematical logic and computer science, as well as and 79 workshops.

The mentoring workshop was named Verification and Deduction Mentoring Workshop, and took place on July 13, one day before the CAV and IJCAR main conferences.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We are very grateful to NSF for their generous sponsorship of VMW 2018. This sponsorship supported the travel of 11 US-based students to VMW and CAV 2018, at an average reimbursement of about $2800 per student.
