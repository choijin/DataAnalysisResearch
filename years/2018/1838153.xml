<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) supports conferences that seek to increase the research capacity of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty at HBCUs. Virginia Union University will host a one-day workshop to provide information on STEM funding opportunities to faculty and administrators from non-research intensive HBCUs and community colleges in the mid-Atlantic region. The workshop will include NSF program officers from various directorates to engage with faculty, administrators and sponsored program officers from institutions typically underrepresented in NSF funding to discuss funding opportunities and grant management strategies. The proposed date of the workshop is September 21, 2018 and 100-150 participants are expected to attend. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HBCUs are a group of approximately 100 institutions of higher education across 20 states and the District of Columbia that make a disproportionately positive contribution to the diversity of the STEM workforce. Despite the significance of the relationship between HBCUs and STEM, HBCUs and community colleges, as a group, are underrepresented in the federal funding streams intended to support STEM activities. This workshop will allow NSF program officers to engage with faculty and staff from institutions typically underrepresented in NSF funding, while generating discussions on how to improve the overall funding rates of these underrepresented institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF Outreach Day Workshop brought together a diverse group of faculty, administrators, and sponsored research officers primarily from non-research intensive regional HBCUs.  This resulted in a powerful moment for the faciitation of high-quality and informative grantsmanship technical assistance. In the context of grantsmanship at institutions underrepresented in NSF funding streams, faculty, administrators, and sponsored research offers were able to express thei challenges and conerns relative to the lace of grans awarded to HBCUs in contrast to other higher education institutions. A major observation was they agreed that HBCU faculty did participate in grantsmanship at NSF; however, they witnessed faculty not receiving gan awards; while their higher education counterparts were consistently being awarded.  They also agreed that many of them participated in NSF funding streams that focused on HBCU-UP grants.  Their hesitation to apply for other NSF grants were often characrterized by ongoing rejections even after their careful review of the critiques and reapplying the following year.     The NSF Outreach Day Workshop allowed for a diverse set of HBCU faculty, administraors, and officers from the Sponsored Reserch and Programs industry who typically are underrepresented in NSF funding streams to have a day-long opportunity to engage in robust discussion that support STEM and STEM education research initiatives.  A myraid of PowerPoint presentations were used to deliver and provoke conversation about what real grant funding activities looked like and those that appeared to present with major challenges that lead to non-approvals, especially in the HBCU-UP Research Initiation space.  To encourage deeper discussion about the plight of STEM related research, faculty, administrators, and Sponsored Research and Programs officers were identified for concurrent sections that allowed for a NSF representative to lead the discussion with the intent to flush-out grant procurement problemmatic areas.The activity helped faculty to learn about NSF funding opportunities while administrators and sponsored research officers learned strategies for successfully mnaging grants and advocating for faculty success at their institutions.  The activity placed emphasis on the two-way nature of the dialogue and recognized the value of the HBCU communities helping to build awareness within NSF of these institutions' accommplishments and contributions to the STEM enterprise. Further, faculty, administrators, sponsored research officers and NSF representatives engaged in round-table conversations with scholars from vaqrious HBCs that lend itself to breaking down obstacles that faculty experienced when applying for NSF grant initiatives. The activity provided a bi-directional knowledge exchange that engaged a variety of stakeholders.  Similary, the faculty, administrators, and sponsored research officers were placed into groups to exchange conversation among each group to discern their NSF experiences and how they were able or not able to secure a grant award.  Moreover, a deeper dive into NSF funding opportunities lead to the learn more about the contributions smaller HBCUs made to the STEM enterprise and improve their understanding of how to better serve the needs of these members of the scientific community.  From the intellectual lens, the research and evaluation supported throught his project advanced the community's understanding of HBCU's decision making, behavior, and perceptions in the context of NSF grant submissions and merit review.  While limited data on Black scientist and engineer behavior within MSF merit review exists, the inquiry supported by this grant was intended to add to the understanding of why HBCU faculty participate less than and differently than non-Black peers.  The inquiry also added to the understanding of the impact of NSF outreach activities on participant knowledge and behavior.  The findings had particular significance to NSF personnel as well as sponsored research and programs development professionals since they invoved a population of STEM faculty who are historically underrepresented in MSF funding streams. The broader impact is that evident in that the NSF outreach workshop targeted historically Black institutions to broaden their participation in NSF activities to include additional scholars from institutions currently underrepresented in NSF funding streams.  The workshop also sought to help break down obstacles to faculty success in NSF grant activities by providing a bi-directional knowledge exchange that engaged a variety of stakeholders.  Faculty learned about NSF funding opportunities while administrators and sponsored programs officers learned strategies for successfull managing grants and advocating for faculty success at their home institutions.  The synergy of NSF representatives and the participants helped to create meaningful relationships that will ultimately prove viable as new NSF grant opportunities emerge. As the emergence of new grants are discovered, this body of professionals are now reaching out to other HBCUs and PWIs to seek collaborative and partnership STEM grantsmanship experiences.  The nature of the experience reinforces the need for ongoing technical assistance that provokes NSF awareness of the vitalness of HBCUs in the STEM and research spaces.
