<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project derives from its promise to positively affect not only consumers, but also enhance efficiencies in the electric energy marketplace as a whole. The basic functionality of matching users to optimal electric plans will result in both higher consumer satisfaction, and result in Retail Electric Providers (REPs) offering more competitive rate packages.  Identifying the actual usage profile of appliances over time and providing actionable information to consumers will enable consumers to take informed decisions on appliance purchases, as well as manufacturers to optimize designs with real-world inputs.   The platform will enable the solution of system-wide problems faced by utility companies like peak period demand surges to be countered through demand response initiatives such as incentivizing customers to modify their usage patterns to smoothen the load curve.  Each function of the proposed system is geared toward addressing a specific source of friction in the electric energy marketplace, and consequently also possesses commercial potential.  Thus, the overall economic impact will be on consumers, REPs, utility companies and appliance manufactures, while promoting a greater knowledge and engagement among the electricity consumers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project explores the value of creating a bundled energy management system aimed at residential users.  The system uses machine-learning-based analytics of the customer's daily, weekly, monthly, and seasonal energy usage trends to offer potential savings through (1) recommending the best retail energy service provider plan matching the customer's usage patterns, (2) incentivizing customers to enable full integration with smart home devices, including smart thermostats, (3) identifying and predicting the electricity consumption of different appliances and providing actionable information on their optimal usage and maintenance, and (4) services to allow customers to navigate through the process of switching plans. A smartphone app available for the iOS and Android platforms forms the customer interface to the system.  The key novelties of this project lie in the development and integration of machine learning tools and behavioral economics ideas into the domain of residential energy management.  The project is founded on research into the design, development and validation of such tools in contexts such as predicting residential energy usage over time, disaggregating usage on a per-appliance basis, and experimentation on how best to motivate users to engage in energy usage behavior that induces efficient grid operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to explore the major value propositions and identify the relevant customer segments for a bundled energy management system with backend analytics that learns daily, weekly, monthly, and seasonal trends of energy usage to offer optimized choices of service plans for individual customers.   The aim was at determining the value of providing analytics of the customer's energy usage trends, and offer potential savings through (1) recommending the best retail energy service provider plan matching the customer's usage patterns, (2) fully integrating and communicating with the customer's smart home devices, including smart thermostats, (3) identifying and predicting the electricity consumption of different appliances and providing actionable information on their optimal usage and maintenance and (4) services to allow customers to navigate through the process of switching plans.   We took a systematic approach towards this goal under the I-Corps framework under which we conducted over a hundred interviews with a variety of  stakeholders ranging from retail energy providers, utility companies, public utilities commission run agencies, to end consumers to carefully evaluate their value propositions and major concerns from an impact viewpoint, as well as a monetization viewpoint.  The ultimate finding was that the total addressable market is of the order of $840 million, and the highest value to end users is on plan selection in states that have retail choice.  The project also informed and educated both students and the broader society with integration of ideas discovered from the project into the curriculum.  The students who engaged in the I-Corps program also were able to depart from their comfort zone and obtained valuable entrepreneurial experience.  Towards the end of the poject, we took concrete steps to instantiate the technology in collaboration with institutional partners, and to explore their use cases in real-world scenarios.  The project also informed and educated both students and the broader society with integration of ideas discovered from the project into the curriculum.  The students who engaged in the I-Corps program also were able to depart from their comfort zone and obtained valuable entrepreneurial experience.  Towards the end of the poject, we took concrete steps to instantiate the technology in collboration with institutional partners, and to explore their use cases in real-world scenarios.
