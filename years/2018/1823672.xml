<AbstractNarration>Title: Doctoral Dissertation Research: Legal and Regulatory Inconsistency at the Community Level&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many professions in the U.S exist in a legal context of regulatory inconsistency across the various jurisdictions in which the practice operates, leading to a lack of stability regarding the legality of those professions. A prime example concerns how childbirth occurs in the U.S, as more families seek alternatives to standard hospital-based, obstetrician-attended medicated birth, such as home birth. Certified Professional Midwives, the professional providers specifically trained to provide care to the growing community of families choosing home birth, are regulated by enormously varied laws and policies. This project will investigate the legal setting of home birth midwifery in the context of varied communities of practice and their responses to differing regulatory frameworks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using mixed-methods to analyze the inconsistent legal environment of home birth, the project will employ an ethnographic approach, including in-depth interviews and analysis of archival data collected across varied jurisdictional contexts. The study will investigate responses to a lack of stability about state treatment of expertise that characterizes the regulatory context of home birth. The research design includes participant observation centered around the practices of home birth professionals in several field sites. Ethnographic research will be supplemented by interviews with officials charged with regulating the practice of home birth midwifery and with other members of the professional networks of home birth midwives. Findings will contribute to an understanding of the relationship between legal consciousness, regulatory arrangements, and the politics of expertise and professionalization. Additionally, the project will provide implications of existing regulatory strategies by illuminating how practitioners respond to the various models of licensure currently in use across the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award enabled me to undertake comparative research towards a dissertation examining homebirth midwifery.  Over a 12-month period, I conducted ethnographic fieldwork in the practices of four Certified Professional Midwives, who are the only perinatal care providers who train and practice exclusively in out-of-hospital settings.  CPMs today practice in the context of both crisis and rapid change in United States perinatal healthcare.  While popular attention to high rates of perinatal morbidity and mortality in the U.S. has skyrocketed, parents have chosen out-of-hospital birth and care from providers trained outside of medical settings at ever-increasing rates.  In each of four primary field sites spanning seven states, I worked in the practice of a CPM.  I attended prenatal and postpartum appointments, births, regional meetings of midwives’ organizations, regulatory board meetings, courses, study groups, and workshops. I also conducted ethnographic interviews (n=90) with additional midwives, homebirth clients, midwifery students and educators, childbirth educators, doulas, regulators, billers, collaborating physicians and nurse-midwives.  Field sites were selected to represent key sources of variation: I conducted research in areas with both close and challenging relationships between homebirth midwives and other area healthcare providers; in urban, suburban, and rural areas; in multiple regions of the United States, including the South, Northeast, and West Coast.  Because the homebirth and homebirth midwifery communities are distinctively ideologically diverse, I also conducted research with midwives and parents who were conservatives, feminists, liberals, leftists, and libertarians, and with both those who were religious and those who were not.   In the proposal, I noted another important source of variation in this community: the enormous inconsistency of the regulatory environment faced by homebirth midwives.  Some states, as I noted, license and regulate non-nurse or homebirth midwives. Yet the persistence of laws in other states criminalizing the practice, combined with a total lack of regulation in other states and enormous state-by-state variation in content and enforcement of existing licensure regulations, results in enormous inconsistency in the legal treatment of homebirth midwifery.  I also selected comparative sites with an eye to maximizing variation in regulatory environments. The proposal focused on responses to this kind of regulatory inconsistency.  What happens, I asked, when communities of practice encounter a lack of the kind of stability about state treatment of expertise and medical knowledge that has generally characterized United States health care in the late twentieth and twenty first century? I hypothesized that the response would be twofold: first, I hypothesized that I would find relativism in legal consciousness in the community, and second, I hypothesized that I would find a kind of legal pluralism, with parents and midwives turning to alternative normative systems.  What I found was somewhat more complicated.  I found that rather than turning to externalnormative systems, midwives frequently turned to what I call the normative epistemology internal to their field. I found that an ethic of informed choiceguided homebirth midwives’ understandings of their work, and of what made their work distinctive in the field of perinatal care.  In the dissertation, I will describe informed choice both in clinical scenes, and as a distinctive way of approaching knowledge that privileges engagement with multiple knowledges. I will demonstrate how this approach has drawn on upon social scientific critiques of expert knowledge production, objectivity, quantification, and expertise.  I will then argue that the work of facilitating informed choice&mdash;and the programmatic management of theories of knowledge required to do so&mdash;is the set of tasks over which contemporary homebirth midwives seek to establish professional jurisdiction.  Professionalizing around a commitment to epistemic pluralism has demanded a distinctive relationship to law.  Faced with both regulatory heterogeneity anda legal system at odds with epistemic multiplicity, I argue, law’s hegemony is shaken and practical definitions of law expand to incorporate its paradoxical abilities to both protect or facilitate choice and to limit choice.  Unable to assume that good practice will always mean following the law, midwives become active managers of law, making, breaking, and dodging laws to uphold their commitments to informed choice.    This study is poised to provide robust investigation of the effects of existing midwifery licensure laws by illuminating how practitioners of contemporary natural and homebirth actually use active models of licensure. As the proposal noted, the rapidly shifting licensure landscape for homebirth midwifery makes this information particularly timely.   Substantively, the project also contributes to understandings in the law and society literature of how private rule-systems and policies, as well as local and community-specific values, contribute to the ways communities narrate and use law.
