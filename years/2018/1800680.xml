<AbstractNarration>The project will develop new mathematical methods and establish new connections between diverse areas of mathematics. The project will focus on connections between Logic, on the one hand, and Topology and Combinatorics, on the other. It will aim at connecting Fraisse theory, an amalgamation theory from Logic, with deep questions on homogeneity of the generic continuum and with possible development of a homology theory. Further, it will aim at establishing connections between Ramsey theory, a branch of Combinatorics, with Topological Dynamics, Algebraic Topology, and certain orders playing an important role in parts of Set Theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop a presentation of Ramsey theory in terms of algebraic topological notions - simplicial&lt;br/&gt;complexes and simplicial maps. This presentation should incorporate both finite and infinite Ramsey theory, and it should capture Ramsey theoretic statements associated with amenability of subgroups of the permutation group of the set of natural numbers. The project will also uncover implications of the dynamics of monoid actions to Ramsey theory. The project will also explore an approach to certain problems in topological dynamics and topology that uses purely combinatorial/model theoretic methods. Some important compact topological spaces are obtained as canonical quotients of generic inverse limits of families of finite structures - projective Fraisse limits. Topological homogeneity questions will be investigated using such presentations. Another aim will be to develop the right notion of the simplex and the boundary operation for homology theory of projective Fraisse limits. The test case here is the development of universal Menger compacta through projective Fraisse limits. Another goal of the project is to explore connections between a fixed point property of group actions, concentration of measure phenomenon, and geometry of submeasures.</AbstractNarration>
