<AbstractNarration>The Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR) is an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) focusing on the development of technology, such as biometrics, for the automated recognition of individuals. Application domains for this technology include cybersecurity, border security, healthcare, banking, law enforcement, forensics, access control, autonomous vehicles, consumer electronics, e-commerce, robotics, e-voting and national ID cards. CITeR seeks to strengthen the fundamentals of Identity Science whilst addressing practical challenges encountered by operational systems in the field. Besides embracing a cutting-edge research agenda, CITeR will also engage in various educational and outreach activities to a diverse audience.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michigan State University (MSU) will expand the research portfolio of the Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR) by leveraging the expertise of its faculty in multiple areas including AI, machine learning, computer vision, security, forensics, biosensors, mobile computing, autonomous vehicles, genomics, and medical imaging. To facilitate this, MSU will work with industry and government stakeholders whose partnership will be instrumental in furthering the frontiers of human identification technology. This collaborative framework will broaden CITeR's leadership role in transitioning biometric research into practice and influence the development of policies, including those related to the security and privacy of personal data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The active involvement of graduate and undergraduate researchers will ensure the development of a strong workforce in identification technology - consisting of visionaries, leaders, educators, researchers, professionals, and administrators. Collaboration with experts from other fields such as forensics, anthropology, nanotechnology, literary neuroscience, bioinformatics, and health sciences, will expand the domain-of-influence of the technology and create novel opportunities for inter-disciplinary research and education. MSU researchers involved with the Center will promote the participation of underrepresented groups in research and education by launching new programs. In addition, researchers will be encouraged to showcase their findings to middle school and high school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CITeR products such as research portfolios, peer-reviewed publications, public-domain software, datasets, and opinion articles will be maintained at the following URL: https://citer.clarkson.edu/. This website will also host resources such as tutorials about the technology; demos and videos to enhance public awareness of the technology; information about various CITeR-related activities, including community programs; and schedules of lab tours to engage school students with the technology. The website will also facilitate focused dialogues with stakeholders in order to further the impact of CITeR. This is expected to generate an ecosystem where the technology intersects with the community in a useful manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
