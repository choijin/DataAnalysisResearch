<AbstractNarration>This project concerns research in number theory, which studies properties of the whole numbers and is at the core of modern cryptography. One central theme in number theory is to study the relationship between algebraic and geometric objects and special values of L-functions (generalizations of the Riemann zeta function introduced by Euler in the eighteenth century and studied extensively by Riemann in the nineteenth century). A motivating example is the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer, which relates rational points on elliptic curves (one of the simplest classes of polynomial equations) to the analytic property of L-functions. This research project explores several topics in number theory and aims to deepen understanding of these relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to study the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and its high dimensional generalizations, one of which is the arithmetic Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture for unitary Shimura varieties.  The investigator previously discovered a relative trace formula approach to study the first derivative of certain automorphic L-functions and intersection numbers on Shimura varieties, and recent work of the investigator and collaborator extends the idea to higher derivatives for L-functions for the general linear group of rank two over function fields. This research project aims to extend the relative trace formula approach to more general settings, for instance, to L-functions for the general linear groups of higher rank.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As one of the oldest mathematical areas, finding solutions in integers or rational numbers of polynomial equations in several variables dates back to Diophantus in the 3rd century. This central subject in mathematics has seen contributions made by many mathematicians including Fermat, Euler, and Gauss. Modern study of Diophantine equations in the early 20th century started with the theory of quadratic forms by Hilbert, followed by the remarkable discovery of the local-to-global principle of Hasse and Minkowski.    The PI’s project studies a new analog of  the local-to-global principle,  i.e., the connection between algebraic cycles (a natural high dimensional generalization of the concept of rational solutions to Diophantine equations) and their connection to the special values of L-functions over both functional fields and number fields. Our work is expected to shed new lights to several long standing conjectures in mathematics, including  the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (B-SD) conjecture for elliptic curves and its generalization (the Beilinson-Bloch conjecture) to higher dimensional varieties. One pioneering example was the theorem of Gross-Zagier when the analytic rank of the Hasse-Weil L-function of an elliptic curve is one. In a joint work with Zhiwei Yun, we prove a "Higher Gross-Zagier formula" over function fields, which provides a geometric interpretation of the higher derivatives of L-functions of elliptic curves over function fields. In another direction, the PI with collaborators have advanced our understanding of  the arithmetic Gan-Gross-Prasad conjectures which is a generalization of the Gross-Zagier theorem to  the product of unitary Shimura varieties in higher dimensions.  While proving these results, the PI developed the theory of Jacquet’s relative trace formula for automorphic representations as well as techniques in harmonic analysis of reductive groups over local fields, and discovered new construction of algebraic cycles on Shimura varieties and their function field analogs.   The PI has actively disseminated the outcome in peer reviewed jourbals and  various venues such as conference/seminar talks. The PI supervised several graduate stduents. The PI organized or co-organized several workshops/conferences.             Last Modified: 08/15/2020       Submitted by: Wei Zhang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
