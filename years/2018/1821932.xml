<AbstractNarration>Dr. Thomas Garrison, of Ithaca College, together with a multidisciplinary team of American and Guatemalan scholars, will undertake archaeological field research aimed at developing a better anthropological understanding of the contexts, causes, and outcomes of intra- and intercultural conflicts. Warfare and violence between civilizations of diverse religious and cultural backgrounds continue to shape the societies immersed in these antagonistic interactions. By looking to the past, archaeology has the ability to reveal complex examples of ancient aggression, giving insight into the long-term effects of large-scale and endemic violence on human societies. While it would be easy to focus on the negative aspects of warfare, which are prevalent and varied, there are also contexts in which warfare has acted as a stimulus for cultural florescence. The present project builds upon the sensational discovery of multi thousand new ancient Maya structures in the Guatemalan jungle, detected by laser-based, lidar remote sensing technology, to investigate just such a case. The multi-layered conflicts seen between Maya city-states, as well as contemporary foreign cultures, are reminiscent of the complex conflicts that affect different areas of the globe today, and archaeology can inform upon the long-term societal impacts caused by these clashes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Garrison and his team will focus their investigations on the newly discovered, ancient fortress of La Cuernavilla. Situated between the great Maya city-state of Tikal and the smaller neighboring kingdom of El Zotz, the fortress appears to date to the late 4th century; the very beginnings of Classic Maya civilization (AD 300-900). Preliminary studies indicate a link between La Cuernavilla and the foreign, central Mexican city of Teotihuacan, which invaded and conquered Tikal in AD 378. Using a combination of archaeological, environmental, and chemical analyses the researchers will conduct field and laboratory investigations to unpack the complex cultural milieu present at La Cuernavilla and in its surrounding landscape. Studies of local environmental conditions in the past, as well as available ancient dietary resources will show to what degree the site was a true fortress, able to withstand long-term attacks and advance a political and military agenda. Archaeological investigations will discern the complex cultural sequence that involves two Maya cities at war during the time of a foreign occupation. These analyses and comparisons with other case studies will be used to interpret to what degree places like La Cuernavilla contributed to the rise of cultural complexity and the florescence of Maya civilization, hopefully serving as a model for understanding similar situations across time and space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
