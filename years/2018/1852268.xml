<AbstractNarration>The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory will continue its long-running summer REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) program. In addition to a 10-week summer research internship working with scientists at the Harvard/Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), students will engage in numerous professional development activities, including computer tutorials, research-training seminars, and directed meetings with astrophysicists at all career stages. Students will also attend group discussions on the ethical conduct of research, graduate school life, admissions, available fellowships, and career opportunities after graduation. Since 1994, over half of the interns have been female, and a small but increasing number from underrepresented groups. During this renewed program greater emphasis will be placed on recruiting students from underrepresented groups as well as from colleges with limited resources for astrophysical research. This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each summer, eleven students will spend ten weeks conducting leading-edge research with their mentors at CfA. Scientists at the CfA are involved in virtually every area of astrophysics and have access to a large number of modern scientific instruments, so students have a broad range of projects to choose from. The student research experience will be completed by a trip to the winter AAS meeting, where each intern will present a poster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This is the project outcomes report for the NSF-funded program entitled "REU Site: Undergraduate Research In Astrophysics at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory," which operated from May 2019 to July of 2021 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.   This REU site supported two cohorts of 11 undergraduate interns each during the summers of 2019 and 2020.  Our students, who came from all over the country, were matched with research advisors at the Center for Astrophysics, and carried out real-world research projects during their 10-week internships.   The research topics were drawn from all six science divisions of the Center for Astrophysics, and thus reflect a diverse range of subjects ranging from cosmic reionization, Martian atmospheres, star formation, and black holes, to molecular emission from protostars and the evolution of galaxy clusters.  Both observation- and theory-centric projects have been carried out.  A major goal of our program is to strengthen the American scientific workforce by recruiting women and underrepresented minorities into Astrophysics.  Of the 22 students we hosted at our site, 15 were women and 7 were men.  Eight (36%) were members of underrepresented minority groups.  We were highly successful in our recruitment goal: of our 11 interns in the 2019 cohort, 10 have enrolled in Astronomy/Astrophysics PhD programs and the eleventh is currently working as adata analyst at a research institution.  Of the seven 2020 interns graduating in 2021, at least five have enrolled in PhD-granting Astonomy programs, and will begin their graduate studies in the fall of 2021.  A total of four students, two from each of the two cohorts, were awarded NSF's Graduate Research Fellowship in support of their planned graduate studies.  In short, our recruitment goals are continuing to be met.  Our program, now in its 28th year, emphasizes professional development as well as scientific research.  Our students therefore spend time on activities such as: hosting weekly colloquia covering a broad range of scientific topics, attending workshops on paper writing, graduate school life, the graduate school application process, non-academic careers, a student-led scientific ethics workshop, and various other things.  Because the CfA hosts several other internship programs (including an NSF REU program devoted to Solar Physics research, and another NSF REU program under the aegis of the Event Horizon Telescope project), our interns meet and interact daily with many other undergraduate researchers.  There can be as many as 30-40 other summer interns present at the CfA, making for a vibrant social community.  Our program benefits greatly from synergy with these allied internship programs by sharing the responsibility and costs for hosting seminars and social events, such as the ice cream social that kicks off the summer.     Our program benefits the community in other ways, for example by providing relatively young PhD researchers, especially women, with opportunities to advise talented students, and to present their research to a diverse audience in our weekly colloquia.  Almost all of our speakers are at an early stage in their careers.  For the most recent grant, half of them were women scientists.  Our program places special emphasis on writing instruction.  All interns are required to document their research with a manuscript written at a professional level.  That manuscript is critically reviewed by the program directors and the interns' advisors at several milestones during the summer.  This gives our students training in academic writing that they might otherwise never receive.  Our goal is to significantly develop writing their writing proficiency so that later, when they enter graduate school, they are able to efficiently write up and publish their work; our alums report that it is an aid to their later success.  It is also helpful for composing observing and funding proposals.  As a bonus, we publish a fraction of their summer project papers in the refereed literature.  In summary, the NSF Astronomy REU site at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory provides our interns with a rich intellectual and social environment in which they engage in real-world astronomy research.  It also gives them a strong boost on their way to productive careers in scientific research.  Going forward, we plan to continue running the SAO Site in a manner similar to our established practice, benefiting from a recently implemented, formal evaluations process to improve how we operate.
