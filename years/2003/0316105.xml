<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT:  EIA 0316105, CRA, B. York, PI&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for students and faculty from minority-serving institutions to attend and participate in "The Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference 2003", to be held in October 2003, in Atlanta, Georgia.  Organized by the Coalition to Diversify Computing (CDC), the theme of this conference is "Building Diverse Leadership in Computing". The conference program includes refereed papers, poster sessions and panels in addition to invited plenary talks by some of the nation's outstanding scientists.  The papers presented will be published in a proceedings journal.  In addition, a one-day doctoral consortium is included in which Ph.D. students will present and discuss their work before a panel of experts during which the students will receive constructive feedback as well as career guidance.  The conference is expected to be an unusual opportunity for the participants to interact with a diverse collection of world class researchers, be exposed to new concepts, ideas and state-of-the-art research, as well as to gain an understanding of the history of diversity in computing and to participate themselves in panels, posters and formal paper presentations.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
