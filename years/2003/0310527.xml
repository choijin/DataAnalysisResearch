<AbstractNarration>Title: Embedded Software for Domain-Specialized Platforms&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ingrid Verbauwhede, UCLA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops design methods for embedded software in the context of portable, &lt;br/&gt;integrated and secure platforms. An example of such a platform is a key-chain &lt;br/&gt;or a next-generation smart-card with integrated electronics and embedded&lt;br/&gt;fingerprint sensor. The key-chain allows to use biometrics as a personal key in &lt;br/&gt;electronic payments or access control. The software for this platform is complex and &lt;br/&gt;draws from multiple application domains, including signal processing, &lt;br/&gt;cryptography, and protocol transaction processing. &lt;br/&gt;Moreover, this software must integrate encryption and fingerprint signal &lt;br/&gt;co-processors.  Thus, the design method for such software must allow for&lt;br/&gt;multiple design paradigms to coexist, and at the same time must also make&lt;br/&gt;optimal use of the constrained, embedded form factor to which it is confined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design method is based on two principles. The first principle is the&lt;br/&gt;use of virtual machine specializations. A virtual machine allows for a&lt;br/&gt;smooth, write-once run-everywhere development concept, while the&lt;br/&gt;specializations allow native support of domain-specific co-processors. The&lt;br/&gt;second principle is that of flexible interconnect, which allows to shape&lt;br/&gt;the target architecture to the application at hand. Both of these methods&lt;br/&gt;are genuine innovations in embedded software design context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a broader scale, these design techniques are applicable to a wide range &lt;br/&gt;of portable, embedded devices that provide a tighter coupling of secure&lt;br/&gt;information infrastructure with the real world. For example, currently&lt;br/&gt;digital identities are insufficiently coupled to physical identities, &lt;br/&gt;resulting in identity theft becoming a large-scale problem. Software is a&lt;br/&gt;key enabler to combat this problem, and the design techniques from this&lt;br/&gt;project will have broad impact by allowing this software to migrate &lt;br/&gt;to the embedded context where it is required.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
