<AbstractNarration>The MIE Phase III project will fulfill the plan which builds upon Phase I and II accomplishments, raises UMET to the next level of capability, and completes the process of institutionalizing and disseminating its model and best practices to other institutions.  UMET will continue strengthening its academic program curriculum and disseminating the MIE curriculum development process to SUAGM SEM departments using institutional resources. UMET will continue hiring additional faculty with advanced degrees in selected areas, enhancing faculty content knowledge in SEM areas, delivering improved student-centered instructional programs, stimulating faculty research capability, developing an improved infrastructure for SEM research and educational improvement grants, improving its ability to assess faculty performance, and giving financial support to faculty completing doctoral degrees.    UMET will continue to improve the student support/research infrastructure by involving undergraduate students in research, providing pre-college students with a greater appreciation of the benefits of careers in SEM and the academic preparation needed to pursue SEM studies, conducting a coordinated set of activities to attract better prepared students, and providing sufficient academic support services to retain them through graduation. UMET will construct a new science laboratory building and enhance the computer networking capability for all SEM faculties in SUAGM. UMET will build on the comprehensive foundation established during Phase I and II of the MIE Project by completing the institutionalization.   At the conclusion of Phase III, UMET will have an institutionalization process in place that guarantees full funding for each of the components initiated by MIE. These include: the academic program, curriculum development and evaluation, faculty development and support, Student Support Center, pre-college programs, scholarships, student internships and undergraduate research, and laboratory upgrades and maintenance. UMET will have the capability to disseminate the NSF/UMET/MIE model.   The project will be managed under the direction of Dr. Arratia, who reports to the Chancellor of UMET.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
