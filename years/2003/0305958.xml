<AbstractNarration>                   ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      Complexity of the objects of complex analysis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;                    (DMS-0305958)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;                    Steven R. Bell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Bell has shown that the most widely used kernel&lt;br/&gt;functions and metrics of complex analysis associated to&lt;br/&gt;certain finite Riemann surface are elementary combinations&lt;br/&gt;of only three, and sometimes even two, analytic functions of&lt;br/&gt;one complex variable related to special conformal mappings&lt;br/&gt;of the domain.  Bell will study deeper questions about&lt;br/&gt;complexity in complex analysis and potential theory posed by&lt;br/&gt;his recent findings and he will extend his results in the&lt;br/&gt;plane to quadrature domains and general finite Riemann&lt;br/&gt;surfaces.  Bell has formulated a unique continuation&lt;br/&gt;principle for the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations&lt;br/&gt;that he has shown yields information about the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;holomorphic mappings between domains in complex space.  He&lt;br/&gt;will apply this principle to some of the questions mentioned&lt;br/&gt;above and he will also use the property to try to gain a&lt;br/&gt;more geometric understanding of the Bergman projection in&lt;br/&gt;several complex variables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical objects of potential theory and conformal&lt;br/&gt;mapping are ubiquitous in Science, Mathematics, and&lt;br/&gt;Engineering.  They carry encoded within them a vast amount&lt;br/&gt;of information about geometric properties of regions in the&lt;br/&gt;plane.  Although these objects are familiar and well&lt;br/&gt;studied, they continue to be a source of interesting and&lt;br/&gt;applicable new mathematics.  Professor Bell will express the&lt;br/&gt;classical objects of potential theory associated to a two&lt;br/&gt;dimensional surface with holes in terms of much simpler&lt;br/&gt;analytic objects.  These results will give rise to new and&lt;br/&gt;practical methods for understanding and zipping the solutions&lt;br/&gt;to many problems in differential equations, conformal mapping,&lt;br/&gt;and potential theory that should be of interest, not only to&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians, but to scientists and engineers as well.&lt;br/&gt;Because humans best perceive higher dimensional objects by&lt;br/&gt;taking a series of two dimensional slices, the tools&lt;br/&gt;developed could find many applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
