<AbstractNarration>The standardization of Message Passing Interface (MPI) has resulted in a &lt;br/&gt;large number of applications being developed using MPI. The current MPI &lt;br/&gt;standard hides network details and provides a simple interface for communication. While these features ease the task of parallel programming, &lt;br/&gt;they limit communication optimization opportunities. Specifically,&lt;br/&gt;with the current MPI, communication optimizations can be performed &lt;br/&gt;either by the compiler or in the library implementation. In both cases,&lt;br/&gt;optimizations are limited. Optimizations performed by the compiler &lt;br/&gt;must be architecture independent since the library hides architectural &lt;br/&gt;details from the compiler. Optimizations in the library implementation &lt;br/&gt;are usually architecture dependent. However, such optimizations can &lt;br/&gt;only be applied to each individual routine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, we propose to optimize MPI programs through compiled &lt;br/&gt;communication. By simultaneously using the application communication &lt;br/&gt;information and the system architecture information to perform &lt;br/&gt;communication optimizations, compiled communication overcomes the&lt;br/&gt;limitations in the traditional communication system. We will accomplish the &lt;br/&gt;proposed work by developing systems that allow programmers &lt;br/&gt;to write regular portable MPI programs and enjoy the high communication &lt;br/&gt;performance achieved through compiled communication. The systems &lt;br/&gt;can also be used to optimize existing MPI programs. We will concentrate &lt;br/&gt;on two related parts of this research: extending the MPI standard by &lt;br/&gt;adding new routines to support compiled communication, and developing a &lt;br/&gt;restructuring compiler that analyzes an MPI program and transforms the &lt;br/&gt;program into one that employs the compiled communication technique. &lt;br/&gt;We will also develop techniques for applying compiled communication to &lt;br/&gt;irregular problems and investigate the interaction between the library &lt;br/&gt;and the compiler support for compiled communication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
