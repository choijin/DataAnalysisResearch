<AbstractNarration>DMS-0354924&lt;br/&gt;Roy Joshua&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will partially support a conference which will bring together &lt;br/&gt;many of the world's leading mathematicians to survey current developments, &lt;br/&gt;report on recent progress, and anticpate future developments in algebraic &lt;br/&gt;cycles, K-theory and modular representation theory.  The link between &lt;br/&gt;these topics is the blend of algebra and algebraic geometry, influenced by &lt;br/&gt;techniques and motivation from algebraic topology.  Progress in algebraic &lt;br/&gt;cycles, with related results in algebraic K-theory, has been dramatic.  &lt;br/&gt;The principal contributors to motivic cohomology which underlies this &lt;br/&gt;progress, Bloch, Suslin, and Voevodsky, have agreed to participate.  &lt;br/&gt;Related investigations include work of Lawson, Lichtenbaum, Walker, and &lt;br/&gt;Weibel, all of whom have agreed to participate.  Developments in modular &lt;br/&gt;representation theory involving cohomological techniques such as support &lt;br/&gt;varieties have also generated considerable excitement, and some of the &lt;br/&gt;leading researchers in this area (Benson, Nakano and Parshall) will also&lt;br/&gt;participate in this conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The occasion of this conference is the 60th birthday of  Eric Friedlander; &lt;br/&gt;the venue is Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, from Thursday, &lt;br/&gt;September 16- Sunday September 19, 2004.  Indeed, most of the lecturers &lt;br/&gt;will be mathematicians who have collaborated with Friedlander on aspects &lt;br/&gt;of the topics mentioned above.  The conference plans to support participation &lt;br/&gt;by a number of young people, at both the post-doctoral and advanced graduate &lt;br/&gt;student level, so that it will serve to stimulate increased interest and &lt;br/&gt;participation in these exciting mathematical topics.
