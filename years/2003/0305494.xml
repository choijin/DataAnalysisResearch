<AbstractNarration>This research is focused on the investigation of interfacial order in liquids.  Continuum hydrodynamics has been extremely successful at explaining and predicting the behavior of bulk liquids, but the fact that liquids are made up of atoms or molecules cannot be ignored in the vicinity of an interface.  Many experiments have shown that the properties of liquids near solid-liquid interfaces are often different from those of the bulk liquid.  Prior research with this project has shown that it is possible to use synchrotron X-rays to directly observe the interfacial liquid structure.  In the current project, normal (non-liquid-crystalline, nonviscoelastic, nonmetallic) molecular liquids will be studied.  The dependence of the observed interfacial ordering on substrate surface structure and shear rates will be investigated in detail.  The knowledge gained from such studies will help determine how and why liquids behave differently at interfaces, and thus ultimately help design specific interfacial liquid properties.  Since interfacial liquids appear in many everyday processes, such studies may ultimately lead to technological advances.  This project will integrate research and teaching by training graduate students in an interdisciplinary environment, and also by giving them experience in the use of cutting-edge synchrotron facilities.  The training will prepare them for a range of careers in academe, industry and government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is focused on the investigation of interfacial order in liquids,.  Many experiments have shown that the properties of liquids near interfaces are often different from those of the bulk liquid; this implies that the arrangement of liquid molecules changes near interfaces.  Recent work from this group has shown that it is possible to use synchrotron X-rays to directly observe these rearrangements.  In the current project, order in molecular liquids near interfaces will be studied, and the dependence of the observed ordering on substrate surface structure and shear rates will be investigated in detail.  The knowledge gained from such studies will help us better understand how and why liquids behave differently at interfaces, and thus ultimately help design specific interfacial liquid properties.  Since interfacial liquids play crucial roles in many familiar processes such as lubrication, adhesion, filtration, oil recovery, wetting/spreading/coating, etc., such studies may ultimately lead to benefits to society from improvements in these processes.  This project will integrate research and teaching by training graduate students in an interdisciplinary environment, and also by giving them experience in the use of cutting-edge national synchrotron facilities such as the Advanced Photon Source and the National Synchrotron Light Source.  This training will prepare them for a range of careers in academe, industry and government.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
