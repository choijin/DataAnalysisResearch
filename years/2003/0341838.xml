<AbstractNarration>Te Circum-Arctic Environmental Observatory Network (CEON) is an international research effort that has emerged as a primary need for advancing understanding of the variability and long-term change within the terrestrial Arctic. CEON has been in development since 2000 as an independent and multilaterally-derived realization amongst nations, disciplines and established networks. This proposal supports US participation in the international planning effort to develop and implement CEON. This proposal aims to: scope, develop and initiate a science implementation strategy for CEON; represent CEON and solicit input about CEON at a selection of key meetings, conferences and workshops representing multiple disciplines, existing networks, countries, organizations and interest groups; convene an international workshop of prominent Arctic researchers hosted by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; and create an interim science steering committee to help direct and facilitate these efforts by building on discussions at the workshop to draft a science implementation strategy. The science implementation strategy will be circulated for peer  before being delivered to the Forum of Arctic Research Operators (FARO; parent organization of CEON) at Arctic Science Summit Week (ASSW) 2004. A CEON website will advertise developments within CEON, which will also be published in widely distributed arctic environmental research newsletters and electronic list-servers. It is foreseen that these products will provide the scientific basis for various international CEON stakeholders to sequester autonomous funding to support their participation in CEON. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this project include the implementation of international, terrestrial observation platforms in the proposed multi-agency program, the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH), increased international collaborative opportunities for US Arctic researchers and education of postdoctoral and undergraduate personnel affiliated with science management of this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
