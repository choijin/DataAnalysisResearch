    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project will address the needs of future intelligent optical networks. The simultaneous satisfaction of both enhanced technical performance and price parity as compared to fixed wavelength devices will allow the proposed laser technology to proliferate. This project, entitled, Frequency Agile Laser for Configurable Optical Networks. (FALCON), will develop a rapidly tunable laser operating around 1550-nm. This laser is based upon an innovative configuration of intra-cavity electro-optic components that provide rapid tunability from a narrow-linewidth (&lt;5 kHz) source. Truly innovative is the specific design to allow for sloppy, passive alignment tolerances, thereby enabling low-cost devices to be realized. This approach to low-cost manufacturing will also allow for this technology to compete with current fixed wavelength lasers. It is anticipated that this laser, will result in a self-fiber-coupled high-power (&gt;50 milliwatts), widely tunable (&gt; 40-nm) laser, capable of random access wavelength switching to any point in the sub-100 nanosecond regime. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the demand for voice, data, and video services, advances in optical networks, together with the laser technologies required to support those networks, continues to be a major focus. Development of advanced, more intelligent optical networks is generally accepted as the path to being able to provide these services at economically viable price points. One major step in this direction will be the commercial availability of rapidly tunable lasers for prices that are competitive (equal to or less than) with today's fixed wavelength devices. The proposed technology offers to meet this demand, with its innovative approach towards manufacturing of tunable laser sources.</AbstractNarration>
