<AbstractNarration>Dr. Zhou, the principal investigator proposes to develop theory and methods &lt;br/&gt;which can be implemented by numerical algorithms for efficiently and stablely &lt;br/&gt;solving multiple saddle point problems. The PI proposes to&lt;br/&gt;(1) establish local characterizations of Unconstrained or Constrained saddle &lt;br/&gt;points in Hilbert, Banach spaces for various multiple solution problems;&lt;br/&gt;(2) develop numerical algorithms for finding multiple saddle points; &lt;br/&gt;to carry out numerical tests on various model problems and make codes available &lt;br/&gt;to other researchers;&lt;br/&gt;(3) do convergence and error analysis of the algorithms; develop techniques to &lt;br/&gt;enhance stability, efficiency and convergence rate of the algorithms;&lt;br/&gt;(4) develop tools that can be numerically carried out for investigating &lt;br/&gt;instability and maneuverability of multiple saddle points;&lt;br/&gt;(5) study important multiple saddle point problems in applications, such as,&lt;br/&gt;an eigen-pair problem in nonlinear optics and the elliptic sine-Gordon equation &lt;br/&gt;in condensed matter physics for multiple solutions and their instabilities &lt;br/&gt;and maneuverabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stability is one of the main concerns for system design and control. &lt;br/&gt;Conventional theory and numerical methods are designed to find stable solutions.&lt;br/&gt;However, in many applications, PERFORMANCE or MANEUVERABILITY is more desirable,&lt;br/&gt;especially in system design and control of EMERGENCY machineries for MISSION &lt;br/&gt;CRITICAL SITUATIONS. On the other hand, many problems in applications possess &lt;br/&gt;multiple (unstable) solutions with different performance, maneuverabilities &lt;br/&gt;(an ability to shift from one solution to others) and instabilities. An &lt;br/&gt;unstable solution is a transitional solution which exists only in a certain &lt;br/&gt;time period. An unstable solution may have much higher performance and &lt;br/&gt;maneuverability than others. Finding multiple solutions enables one to select &lt;br/&gt;the best solution. However, due to unstable nature, those solutions are very &lt;br/&gt;elusive to numerical computation. There is virtually no theory in the &lt;br/&gt;literature to devise an efficient and stable numerical algorithm for this &lt;br/&gt;purpose until recently (2001) when the PI and his student developed a New &lt;br/&gt;Method. With which a numerical algorithm is devised for finding multiple &lt;br/&gt;unstable solutions and has been tested on many multiple solution problems. &lt;br/&gt;Preliminary results are quite promising and show great potential. The projects &lt;br/&gt;described in this proposal are further developments of the preliminary results &lt;br/&gt;in several important directions. The outcome of the projects will greatly &lt;br/&gt;enhance people's understanding on unstable solutions, provide numerical &lt;br/&gt;algorithms for finding multiple solutions and promote more applications.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
