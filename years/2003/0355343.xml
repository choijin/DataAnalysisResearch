<AbstractNarration>With this renewal proposal the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support for the work of Professor David B. Collum of the Department of Chemistry at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY.  The research will extend the PI's work on structure-reactivity relationships and their correlation with important synthetic reactions in organolithium chemistry.  The research will focus on four major reactions:  1,2 additions, ortholithiations, Fries rearrangements, and benzyne formation.  A combination of NMR spectroscopic investigations, kinetic measurements, and computational chemistry will be used to probe the interplay between solvation, aggregation, and reactivity in these important reactions.  The proposed investigations are expected to provide synthetic chemists with much valuable information and allow extensions of ogranometallic chemistry into new applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since many of the reagents to be investigated in this project are also used to prepare some of the most pharmaceutically important drugs, these studies offer a unique interface between basic academic and applied industrial research.  Collaborations with pharmaceutical laboratories, in areas such as the preparation of anti-addiction drugs, will continue during this funding period.  This work will provide valuable professional preparation for students in an important field that bridges academic and industrial chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
