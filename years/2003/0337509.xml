<AbstractNarration>Two series of numerical experiments are used to study the deformation of a thin viscous sheet, an analogue for continental lithosphere, deformed by indentation by a rigid die, analogous to India's penetration into the rest of Eurasia. The experiments allow constraints to be placed on possible constitutive laws that govern the deformation of continental lithosphere. The first is studying the extent to which a strong inclusion with a thin viscous sheet localizes deformation near it.  The Altyn Tagh fault along the northern margin of Tibet separates the deforming Tibetan Plateau from an essentially rigid Tarim Basin north of Tibet.  The experiments address how both (a) the power relating strain-rate to stress in power-law creep and (b) the relative roles of strength and gravity, the Argand number, in resisting deformation lead to localization.  A comparison with width of the zone of deformation near the Altyn Tagh fault allows constraints to be placed on these quantities. The second is examining strain and vorticity (which is a measure of rotation about a vertical axis) near the eastern end of the Himalaya. Chinese GPS measurements show a flow around the syntaxis in a clockwise sense, and from these vorticity is being determined. Experiments are being carried out to study how the indented thin viscous sheet deforms for different values of n and Ar.  Bounds on these quantities are being determined through comparisons of the spatial distributions of vorticity.  The ultimate project goal is to understand the processes that control strength within continental lithosphere.</AbstractNarration>
