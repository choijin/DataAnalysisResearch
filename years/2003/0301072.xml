<AbstractNarration>Abstract for award of Haiman DMS-0301072&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Haiman works on problems in combinatorics related to&lt;br/&gt;algebra, geometry and representation theory.  Using new discoveries on&lt;br/&gt;the geometry of Hilbert schemes, he has recently proved the positivity&lt;br/&gt;conjecture for Macdonald polynomials and established a formula in&lt;br/&gt;terms of these polynomials for the character of a "doubled" version of&lt;br/&gt;the classical spaces of harmonics for symmetric groups.  Evidence&lt;br/&gt;suggests that these results fit into a larger framework in which&lt;br/&gt;Nakajima's quiver varieties play the role of the Hilbert scheme.  In&lt;br/&gt;his continuing research, Haiman hopes to establish the validity of&lt;br/&gt;this larger framework and further develop the connections between&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics, Macdonald polynomials and Hilbert schemes.  He also&lt;br/&gt;plans to work on unsolved problems connected with q-analogs of&lt;br/&gt;Littlewood-Richardson coefficients introduced by Shimozono and Weyman&lt;br/&gt;and the q-Schur functions of Lascoux, Lapointe and Morse.  Finally, in&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with Grojnowski, he will return to a study he initiated&lt;br/&gt;some years ago of Hecke algebra characters and their connection with&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial properties of immanants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics is the mathematical study of things that can be&lt;br/&gt;described, counted and manipulated in simple and explicit terms:&lt;br/&gt;things like trees, Young diagrams, or strings of symbols, that we can&lt;br/&gt;write on paper or encode in a computer.  In my view, what makes&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics interesting is that deeply abstract mathematical&lt;br/&gt;concepts--such as geometric spaces in many dimensions, or algebras of&lt;br/&gt;symmetries--tend to have an underlying combinatorial structure.  My&lt;br/&gt;current work connects the geometric properties of special spaces such&lt;br/&gt;as Hilbert schemes and quiver varieties with the combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;properties of Young diagrams and symmetric polynomials.  By&lt;br/&gt;understanding the connection, we can deal with these abstract spaces&lt;br/&gt;on a concrete level and get important new insights about both the&lt;br/&gt;geometry of the spaces and the rules governing the combinatorics&lt;br/&gt;associated with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
