    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will result in the design, development, and prototype of a portable device for nucleic acid detection and quantification for research and medical diagnostics applications. Currently, most of the conventional molecular detection platforms are complex, delicate and bulky devices. Additionally, the associated biochemical procedures are expensive, highly labor intensive, require skilled personnel, and often take days or weeks to complete. There is a need for the development of inexpensive techniques and portable biosensors for environmental, basic research and biomedical diagnostics. It is proposed to develop a prototype device consisting of a compact photo-detector, sensor array, and temperature controlled reaction chamber. An ultra-sensitive novel nucleic acid detection assay, Bioluminescence Regenerative Cycle (BRC), will be integrated into the proposed prototype instrument to overcome the drawbacks of current biological assays. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will ultimately result in a handheld device that is simple and easy to use for non-expert operators, even outside of the laboratory, for applications such as analysis of patient samples in a doctor's office or student research projects in a classroom setting. This device can also be adapted for consumer and industry-based environmental monitoring for applications requiring fast and sensitive detection and identification of biological agents.</AbstractNarration>
