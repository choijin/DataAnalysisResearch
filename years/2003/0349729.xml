<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This  Small  Business  Innovative  Research  Phase  II  project  will focus on developing  tunable  microwave  devices  that  utilize  ferroelectric  thin  films  for  their  electronic  properties.    Specifically, barium  strontium titanate (BST) thin films are being used to develop new classes of tunable microwave devices, including phase  shifters,  delay  lines  and  frequency-agile  filters.    Currently, these ferroelectric  devices  suffer  from  two drawbacks:  easily  formed  planar  devices  demand very  large  tuning  voltages  on  the  order  of 100 Volts , while easily  tuned  parallel  plate  devices  require  sophisticated  processing  techniques.    These  problems  have inhibited  the  development  of  commercially  viable  components.    The current project proposes combining silicon based circuitry with ferroelectric devices on the same substrate.  For example, a silicon  charge  pump  circuit  can  be  integrated  on-chip  to  provide  high  tuning  voltages  for  a  ferroelectric phase shifter.  The voltage will be isolated to the chip and less than 3 Volts would be needed to externally drive the device.  Combining silicon semiconductor technology with ferroelectrics will enable development of devices which take advantage of ferroelectric's  dielectric  properties  and  overcome  the  current  roadblocks  in  the  way  of commercializing these devices. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Commercially, a  great  deal  of  interest  has emerged in  the use of  ferroelectric thin  films in the wireless industry because of the material's ability to dramatically improve the functionality of existing devices.  For example, a ferroelectric duplexer is possible which has one third the size of existing duplexers, while using 40% less power.  Today's multiband handsets use up to four filters, so the potential for ferroelectrics is tremendous.  A key wireless handset manufacturer identified at least six applications for tunable devices inside their telephones. Overall, the  wireless  telecommunications  market  has  spawned  the  need  for  small,  low  power,  high  bandwidth microwave  components.    Over $50 billion of wireless handsets were sold  in  2002, with  $6  billion  being spent on RF semiconductor components.  With the trend towards highly functional wireless appliances like PDA's, the demand for wireless components will continue  skyrocketing. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
