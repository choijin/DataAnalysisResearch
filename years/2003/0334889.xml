<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Why do bureaucrats delay?  Why do regulatory choices made under identical&lt;br/&gt;administrative procedures exhibit highly varying decision times?  The&lt;br/&gt;investigator conducts a formal and empirical analysis of the duration of&lt;br/&gt;bureaucratic decisions, with applications to drug approval times by the&lt;br/&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The speed with which drugs are&lt;br/&gt;reviewed is now one of the most controversial issues in federal regulation,&lt;br/&gt;and is arguably the most salient case where the duration, more than the&lt;br/&gt;content, of bureaucratic decision making is at issue. While the political&lt;br/&gt;control of agencies has been well studied, relatively little is known about&lt;br/&gt;why agencies wait, and whether the duration of agency decisions is subject&lt;br/&gt;to political control and from what sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project tackles this problem through the elaboration of a&lt;br/&gt;generalizable formal model of the approval decision.  The investigator models&lt;br/&gt;product approval as an optimal stopping decision by an uncertain&lt;br/&gt;regulator subject to political demand for the drug.  The regulator seeks to&lt;br/&gt;preserve a reputation for consumer protection and sees drug approvals as&lt;br/&gt;irreversible (or reversible only at a significant reputation cost).  The&lt;br/&gt;payoff of approval is also a function of the political "demand" for drug&lt;br/&gt;approvals from consumers (patients) and producers (firms).  The model&lt;br/&gt;predicts that even under risk-neutrality, quick approvals are highly&lt;br/&gt;unlikely, not all drugs will be approved, and that larger firms receive&lt;br/&gt;"protection" (quicker approvals) even when firms are not politically&lt;br/&gt;organized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator tests this model using maximum likelihood&lt;br/&gt;duration analyses of FDA drug review times.  The formal model suggests that&lt;br/&gt;the proper hazard function for estimation is the inverse Gaussian&lt;br/&gt;distribution, which has a non-monotonic hazard function.  Drug approval&lt;br/&gt;times will be modeled as a function of political preferences, budgetary&lt;br/&gt;shifts, media coverage and congressional hearings on the diseases treated&lt;br/&gt;by the drug, and characteristics of the submitting firms.  Preliminary&lt;br/&gt;results on a partial sample of 67 drugs approved from 1985 to 1995 support&lt;br/&gt;the model's predictions, and also suggest that political "control" in drug&lt;br/&gt;approval occurs less through "principals" (Congress and the presidents)&lt;br/&gt;than through organized interests (patients and firms) and the media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
