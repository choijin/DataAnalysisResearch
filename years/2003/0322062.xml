<AbstractNarration>0218398&lt;br/&gt;Podila &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:  This award will enable participation by six American scientists in the US-India Workshop: Molecular Biology and Biotechnological Applications of Mycorrhizal Fungi.  Co-organizers G.K. Podila of Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI and Ajit Varma of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), New Delhi will convene a workshop at JNU, December 19-23, 2002 to discuss the beneficial effects of the soil fungi known as mycorrhizae on plants.  The goals include: 1) a reappraisal of the importance of mycorrhizae to the health, growth and well-being plants, and 2) a discussion of their positive influence on reducing plant disease and returning crop production systems to levels of sustainability without large inputs of pesticides or chemical fertilizers.  On this important topic, application technologies are being developed worldwide on biological diversity and the functioning of mycorrhizae in all ecosystems.             &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope:  This workshop is expected to raise awareness and appreciation of the role of  mycorrhizae.  For the U.S., the participants will become informed about the availability of mycorrhizal biodiversity from India and its potential applications in this country; for India, there is great potential to harness the usefulness of this type of soil fungi and positively impact economic development.  For both countries, it is hoped the discussion will inform the thinking and practices that guide management strategies in agriculture and forestry, result in a more comprehensive view of the important role of mycorrhizae on the well-being of all plants, and foster better scientific relations between the U.S. and India.  This activity is supported by the Indian Department of Science &amp; Technology (DST) under the NSF/DST joint program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
