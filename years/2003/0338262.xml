    <AbstractNarration>MUSIC (Math Understanding through Science Integrated with Curriculum) is an academic enhancement program designed to build on and refine an existing GK-12 program partnering the Duke University Pratt School of Engineering with four N.C. elementary and middle schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in its contribution to the inquiry-based instruction knowledge base through comparison of four types of training/models of implementing inquiry-based instruction (contrasting impact of teachers trained in inquiry-based instruction with and without NSF sponsored curriculum kits, and with and without inquiry-trained teaching fellows) on student achievement and teacher competence in inquiry-based instruction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this program includes dissemination of this curriculum through TeachEngineering.com, an NSF-funded searchable national digital library created by a consortium of first-cohort GK-12 recipients. In addition, mappings from the North Carolina Standard Course of Study to the National Standards will enable teachers in other states to use these lesson plans effectively. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of Prior Project: The initial GK-12 Engineering Teaching Fellows Program placed GK-12 Fellows with teachers in 7 elementary schools in 4 counties and served 1,700 students. Fellows provided assistance and expertise for teachers designing and delivering hands-on activities that teach the science and engineering competencies described in the North Carolina Standard Course of Study; and hosted "Science Nights," Discovery Days," and "Win a Day at Duke" contests. School superintendents, partner school principals, teachers, faculty and the Fellows jointly designed workshops for the Fellows on the delivery of grade appropriate information. Elementary school teachers conducted the workshops. Dr. Ybarra and the Fellows offered teachers monthly sessions, for Duke University Continuing Educational credit, on integrating technology into classrooms. Student impact included an increased confidence in science abilities in classrooms regularly employing Engineering Teaching Fellows, increased student rating of experiencing science as fun, and improved retention of science knowledge as evidenced on classroom tests. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is receiving partial support from the Directorate for Engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Track 2, GK-12 MUSIC: Math Understanding through Science Integrated with Curriculum &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Duke University &lt;br/&gt;PI/Co-PI: Gary A.
