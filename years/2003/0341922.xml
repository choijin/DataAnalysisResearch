<AbstractNarration>IMC is the primary venue for presenting new research results on collecting and analyzing mea-surements&lt;br/&gt;of the Internet. Last year's workshop, held in Marseille, France, had more than 100&lt;br/&gt;attendees, with a waiting list of additional people wishing to participate.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding to aid graduate students enrolled in institutions in the United&lt;br/&gt;States in attending this premiere conference. Attending conferences such as IMC is of paramount&lt;br/&gt;importance for graduate students pursuing research in the field. Authors have the opportunity&lt;br/&gt;to present their work and all attendees have a chance to interact with many others performing&lt;br/&gt;leading-edge research in the field.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This proposal will serve to widen the audience attending the Internet&lt;br/&gt;Measurement Conference, raising the level of interaction and the potential for new collaboration,&lt;br/&gt;new investigations, and higher quality research.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This proposal, by enabling students to attend who might not otherwise&lt;br/&gt;be able, will increase the dissemination of the conference's research results to a larger and more&lt;br/&gt;diverse audience. By giving preference in grant awards to women and minority students, we hope&lt;br/&gt;to widen the participation among these underrepresented groups. Furthermore, by advertising to a&lt;br/&gt;wide range of colleges and universities, participants from a more diverse set of institutions should&lt;br/&gt;be able to attend and benefit from the conference.</AbstractNarration>
