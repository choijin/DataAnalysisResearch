<AbstractNarration>RUI: A SURVEY OF THE MOSS DWELLING TARDIGRADES OF CHINA&lt;br/&gt;William R. Miller, Clark Beasley, and Marshall Crosby&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tardigrades or water bears are small moss dwelling animals that exhibit&lt;br/&gt;cryptobiosis, the remarkable ability to withstand extreme heat, cold,&lt;br/&gt;pressure and other severe environmental conditions. Generally less than 1 mm&lt;br/&gt;in length, the slow moving tardigrade resembles a cute miniature bear or&lt;br/&gt;caterpillar. They are found on every continent in the moisture trapped by&lt;br/&gt;moss, lichen, soil, or marine sediments. Their cryptobiotic life stage has&lt;br/&gt;been defined as the reversible suspension of metabolism and may last for&lt;br/&gt;decades.  While desiccated in cryptobiosis, tardigrades have been&lt;br/&gt;experimentally subjected to temperatures between -272 C and +150 C, to 6000&lt;br/&gt;atmospheres of pressure, to complete vacuum, to high radiation, to common&lt;br/&gt;gases, and still they returned to an active life stage.  These results&lt;br/&gt;kindle both physiological and evolutionary speculation, including the&lt;br/&gt;possible ability of the animal to be transported through space. Yet, the&lt;br/&gt;ecological requirements and life cycles of tardigrades remain little known.&lt;br/&gt;They are suspected of being carried around the world by the winds, but their&lt;br/&gt;global distributional patterns are very incomplete.  For example, only 47&lt;br/&gt;out of 950+ described species of tardigrades have been reported as occurring&lt;br/&gt;in China. By comparison over 500 species are known to occur upwind in&lt;br/&gt;Europe. Although water bears are often abundant, their contribution to the&lt;br/&gt;life web of the planet is still a mystery. This project will develop&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate research teams at Chestnut Hill College, Philadelphia, PA, and&lt;br/&gt;McMurry University, Abilene, TX.  The teams will conduct a survey of the&lt;br/&gt;tardigrades of China, and over four years, more than 20 student researchers&lt;br/&gt;will collect, identify and publish in the project.  First, the teams will&lt;br/&gt;extract tardigrades from the 10,000 moss samples collected by the Missouri&lt;br/&gt;Botanical Garden in their NSF-funded "Moss Flora of China" project.  Second,&lt;br/&gt;the teams will conduct an expedition to China in collaboration with a member&lt;br/&gt;of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and collect 2000 additional samples.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the teams will work at the Academy of Natural Sciences in&lt;br/&gt;Philadelphia to build and document a voucher collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The teams will contribute to the understanding of global diversity by adding&lt;br/&gt;possibly as many as 300 species of tardigrades to our knowledge of the&lt;br/&gt;Chinese fauna.  Our students will probably discover and describe many new&lt;br/&gt;and endemic species.  We will expand the understanding of the ecological&lt;br/&gt;requirements of the animals and test several hypotheses relative to local,&lt;br/&gt;regional, and global distributional and spatial patterns.  The data will be&lt;br/&gt;added to the new Tardigrade Reference Center web site for tardigrade&lt;br/&gt;education and research. The ultimate product will be a data based, digital,&lt;br/&gt;and printable catalogue to the Tardigrades of China, complete with&lt;br/&gt;descriptions, images, identification keys, geo-referencing, and&lt;br/&gt;bibliography.  Such a reference resource will aid taxonomists, ecologists,&lt;br/&gt;biogeographers, teachers, and students all over the world who will be able&lt;br/&gt;to use tardigrades in assessment studies, education, experiments, and&lt;br/&gt;discovery.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
