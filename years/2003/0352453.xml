<AbstractNarration>"Science in Global Issues" (SGI) joins the already published, "Science and Sustainability," to become a two-year integrated science course for grades 9 and 10 incorporating an issues-oriented, guided-inquiry approach to learning.  The course, to be available both as a full year course and as modules, focuses on the role of science in addressing the needs of modern society and the use of technology in advancing scientific knowledge.  In collaboration with teachers and scientists, specific learning goals related to the science standards are developed.  The assessment system, previously used in other SEPUP materials, serves as an indicator of learning, guides the development of activities, and is used as a basis for evaluation and research on how the instruction affects student learning and teacher practice.  Students are introduced to and examine key science concepts in the context of personal and societal issues.  A primary resource contains images of and data about countries around the world and links to existing simulations of processes.  Unit themes include "Tools for Exploring Earth," "Maintaining Diversity," "World Health," and "Fueling the World."  Content standards include interactions of energy and matter, matter energy and of living systems, evolution, the cell, structure of atoms and molecular basis of heredity.  With SGI, SEPUP has developed a sequenced science curriculum for grades 6-10.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
