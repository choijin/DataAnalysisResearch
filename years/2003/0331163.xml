    <AbstractNarration>0331163&lt;br/&gt;Thorson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is an extension of the highly successful book for children "Stone Wall Secrets," authored by the PI. It reflects a collaboration between the researchers at the College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences, the educators at the Neag School of Education at the University of Connecticut, and the teachers at the Dorothy Goodwin Elementary School in Storrs, CT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is producing a standards-based, integrated curriculum that directly addresses needs expressed by the Connecticut State Board of Education. The project will deliver research-based, field-tested educational materials that will be catalogued through the reviewed section of the Digital Library for Earth System Education, &lt;a href="http://www.dlese.org/"&gt;DLESE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three key goals: 1) to integrate geoscience research and education by enhancing the existing partnership between science and education at the University of Connecticut, 2) targeting K-8 schooling by developing, evaluating, revising, and disseminating a standards-based, integrated curriculum based on "Stone Wall Secrets" and a trans-disciplinary approach curriculum, and 3) leveraging the innovative, field-tested products after two years into alternative funding.</AbstractNarration>
