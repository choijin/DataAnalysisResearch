<AbstractNarration>This research project will evaluate the impact of government subsidies of investment in Internet and communication technology by schools in the U. S. (known as the E-Rate program. The investigators will use data on Internet investment,  E-Rate applications and student performance in California public schools.  In particular, the research will test whether E-Rate funds went disproportionately to low-Internet schools and whether the subsidy induced  an increase in Internet investment.  It will also test whether increased &lt;br/&gt;Internet investment in public schools led to improved student outcomes in higher test scores or better student performance as measured according to other dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research topic is important because the increasing economic significance of the &lt;br/&gt;Internet has led to concern among policy makers about the existence of a digital divide between those who use information technology and those who do not.  Schools are typically viewed as one of the only ways to reach the underserved population and the E-Rate is the largest federal school technology subsidy in history.  Understanding its effect is crucial for understanding the role of technology in schools and its effect on students' education.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
