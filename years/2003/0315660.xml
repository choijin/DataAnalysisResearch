<AbstractNarration>The relationship among behaviors, genes, neurons and neural function is of interest to many people.  Analysis of these interconnections involves choosing a system amenable to study at multiple levels.  The behaviors must be complicated enough to be interesting, but still simple enough that progress can be made at the level of nerves and genes.  The behavioral system must have a significant genetic component, and the organism must be tractable for classical and modern genetic and molecular genetic analysis.  Courtship and mating behavior in Drosophila is one such system.  Males and females have distinct sets of sexual behaviors, with well-defined courtship rituals involving both set behavioral patterns and variations based on interactions between individuals.  In addition, appropriate behavior involves input and appropriate processing of visual, auditory, and olfactory information.  Sexual differentiation and behavior are under genetic control.  The upstream genes in the regulatory cascade are well characterized.  This project focuses on the role of the retained gene in the control of behavior and neural development.  Retained-like genes are present in vertebrates.  Females lacking retained function resist normal male courtship and generate male-like courtship of other females.  Male behaviors are normal.  Retained is expressed in small numbers of nerves in the brain and in the thoracic and abdominal portions of the central nervous system, as well as in the photoreceptors of the eyes.  The projection pattern of retained-expressing nerves is altered in mutant animals.  Results from these studies will determine which portions of the retained-expressing nervous system contribute to various aspects of behavior, thus mapping the nerves and the connections within the brain involved in these behaviors and sub-behaviors, and will determine the regulatory and neuronal linkages between retained and other genes involved in sexual behavior and differentiation.  This renders critical information on complexity for generation of this and other behaviors.  This project synergizes with the Leadership Alliance (a national research opportunity program for underrepresented students) to bring new students into biological science research area.</AbstractNarration>
