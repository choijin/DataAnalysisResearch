<AbstractNarration>The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, the Milwaukee Public Schools, and the Milwaukee Area Technical College comprise the Milwaukee Mathematics Partnership. As a member of the Milwaukee Partnership Academy, a community-wide collaborative PK-16 effort among school, university, union, government, business, and community organizations, the Milwaukee Mathematics Partnership seeks to substantially improve mathematics achievement for the 100,000 K-12 Milwaukee Public Schools students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Partnership involves mathematics faculty and mathematics educators in collaboration with PK-12 educators in strengthening district curricula, student assessment measures, and re-designing pre-service and in-service teacher preparation focused on the needs of an urban district. Through this Partnership, the Institutions of Higher Education Mathematics Network, consisting of 2- and 4-year colleges and universities, will be established to focus on the mathematical preparation and continued growth of PK-12 teachers and to improve the transition of students to post secondary education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Partnership embraces four major goals in order to improve student achievement:&lt;br/&gt;Comprehensive Mathematics Framework: Implement and utilize the Comprehensive Mathematics Framework to lead a collective vision of deep learning and quality teaching of challenging mathematics across the Milwaukee Partnership. Strategies include PK-12 student Learning Targets and Model Performance Assessments, alignment of high school coursework with college expectations, and increased enrollment and success in challenging mathematics courses, including Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate mathematics courses.&lt;br/&gt;Distributed Leadership: Institute a distributed mathematics leadership model that engages all partners and is centered on school-based professional learning communities. Strategies include Math Teacher Leaders, school-based Learning Team, Principal Mathematics Leadership endeavor, and district mathematics leadership; &lt;br/&gt;Teacher Learning Continuum: Build and sustain the capacity of teachers, from initial preparation through induction and professional growth, to understand mathematics deeply and use that knowledge to improve student learning. Strategies include the IHE Mathematics Network; Design Teams focused on core mathematical preparation for all PK-8 teachers, an elementary mathematics minor, and a secondary mathematics capstone course; teachers on special assignment as Teachers-In-Residence at the university; teacher recruitment; content-focused induction; and school-based professional learning communities.&lt;br/&gt;Student Learning Continuum: Ensure all students, PK-16, have access to, are prepared and supported for, and succeed in challenging mathematics. Strategies include School Educational Plans, mathematics alignment for the Tutoring and Family Literacy Initiative, and Transitioning to College Mathematics effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, the Partnership will collect evidence of what is working, why, where, and for whom related to three major domains: Student Learning, Teacher Learning, and Collective Vision and Leadership for Mathematics. This includes measures of the degree to which a true effective partnership was established and identification of the defining attributes of such a partnership.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
