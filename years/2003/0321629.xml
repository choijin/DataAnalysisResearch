    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop a testing application for intermediate and full scale boron nitride (BN) composites for a wide variety of wear applications with a focus on aircraft brakes. Viability of this material was demonstrated in Phase I where 3-dimensional needled carbon fiber/C-BN hybrid matrix composites displayed an order of magnitude decrease in wear as compared to current carbon fiber/carbon matrix composites (C/C). The plan is to fabricate stable boron nitride composites from a unique pre-ceramic polymer (borazine) through a commercially viable technique, namely resin transfer molding process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial and broader impacts of this technology of a composite using BN as a matrix appears to provide the best opportunity of addressing the desired cost-performance characteristics (both a decrease in raw material components and in maintenance due to fewer brake overhauls). In addition, the improved properties of these materials over current aircraft brakes have the potential to increase passenger safety in emergency braking situations.</AbstractNarration>
