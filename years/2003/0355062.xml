    <AbstractNarration>Ever since the discovery that elementary particles have spin, it has&lt;br/&gt;been clear that the strength of the interaction between these particles&lt;br/&gt;depends on the relative orientation of these spins. Until now, however,&lt;br/&gt;with higher energy electromagnetic probes (photons) it has only been&lt;br/&gt;possible to study properties averaged over all possible spin&lt;br/&gt;orientations. Support for this proposal will allow the experimental&lt;br/&gt;nuclear physics group at The Catholic University of America to continue&lt;br/&gt;to develop and then exploit new systems which will permit the&lt;br/&gt;independent orientation of both the photon and the target nucleus. The&lt;br/&gt;research will address one of the major unsolved problems in hadronic&lt;br/&gt;structure, the nature and number of excited states of the proton and&lt;br/&gt;neutron. The spins of the individual quarks that make up the nucleon&lt;br/&gt;determine the properties of the excited states. There are many&lt;br/&gt;predicted excited states but only a few have thus far been unambiguously&lt;br/&gt;identified. The question remains as to whether this is due to some&lt;br/&gt;additional aspect of the theory not yet understood or due to&lt;br/&gt;experimental problems in detecting these excited states. Much of the&lt;br/&gt;experimental difficulty lies in the broad and overlapping nature of&lt;br/&gt;these excited state resonances. It is only by performing measurements&lt;br/&gt;that selectively excite only a few of these resonances at a time that&lt;br/&gt;the properties of the individual states can be cleanly studied. In the&lt;br/&gt;proposed studies we will use a newly commissioned polarized photon beam&lt;br/&gt;line and a new polarized target, along with a high-resolution,&lt;br/&gt;high-energy photon tagger to determine the photon energy, to initiate a&lt;br/&gt;number of detailed studies of these resonances. Such measurements will&lt;br/&gt;cleanly discriminate between competing theoretical models and lead to a&lt;br/&gt;much better understanding of the nature of the fundamental forces&lt;br/&gt;between the quarks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two areas where this research will have broader impact outside&lt;br/&gt;the study of fundamental quark interactions. The proposed research will&lt;br/&gt;provide training for postdoctoral associates, graduate students pursing&lt;br/&gt;an advanced degree, and undergraduate physics and engineering students. &lt;br/&gt;These training activities will cover a large range of experimental&lt;br/&gt;activities including experience with cryogenics, high-speed electronics,&lt;br/&gt;particle detectors, vacuum systems, and data processing. This training&lt;br/&gt;will enhance the pool of scientifically and technically trained talent&lt;br/&gt;available in this country. Most of the research that will be conducted&lt;br/&gt;within this proposed program will involve the development of&lt;br/&gt;instrumentation and experience with the use of energy-tagged polarized&lt;br/&gt;photon beams. These activities will lead to improvements which will be&lt;br/&gt;essential to the future experiments, including those at higher energy,&lt;br/&gt;now being planned.</AbstractNarration>
