<AbstractNarration>CAREER: Next-Generation High-Sensitivity Damage Detection and Sensing Based &lt;br/&gt;on Enhancing Nonlinear Dynamics and Phase Space Pattern Recognition &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Most vibration-based damage detection methods are designed for linear &lt;br/&gt;vibrations while far fewer apply to nonlinear systems. Many of the &lt;br/&gt;current nonlinear methods have important limitations, e.g. difficulty &lt;br/&gt;tackling high-dimensional systems. This integrated research and &lt;br/&gt;educational program eliminates several of these limitations by using &lt;br/&gt;a radically different approach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The main research goal is to develop robust and highly sensitive &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear vibration-based techniques for sensing and detecting &lt;br/&gt;the location and level of multiple simultaneous damages in &lt;br/&gt;high-dimensional systems such as complex fluid-structural &lt;br/&gt;systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The main educational goal is the development of a program focused on &lt;br/&gt;enhancing engineering intuition with emphasis on nonlinear dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;The educational effort integrates research with a broad spectrum of &lt;br/&gt;educational and outreach activities, and includes: (a) integrating &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear dynamics into undergraduate courses in engineering, &lt;br/&gt;(b) developing advanced undergraduate and graduate courses on &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear dynamics, (c) implementing outreach activities for K-12 &lt;br/&gt;students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This integrated research and educational program will provide a new &lt;br/&gt;and comprehensive methodology for damage detection in &lt;br/&gt;high-dimensional nonlinear complex systems. This research will make &lt;br/&gt;significant contributions to the fields of structural dynamics, &lt;br/&gt;fluid-structure interactions, and sensing, and it has immediate &lt;br/&gt;potential to impact industry because it addresses important &lt;br/&gt;practical engineering problems in, for instance, aerospace, civil &lt;br/&gt;and sensing technologies. Also, this research represents a potential &lt;br/&gt;benefit to society at large, and it is strengthened by a broad &lt;br/&gt;dissemination to enhance scientific understanding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
