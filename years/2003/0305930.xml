    <AbstractNarration>This project is focused on investigating the mathematical structure &lt;br/&gt;of certain classes of variational conditions, and designing and &lt;br/&gt;analyzing effective computational algorithms to solve them. &lt;br/&gt;Success in the proposed work would permit analysis to be done &lt;br/&gt;more simply, with better insight, and with greater exploitation of &lt;br/&gt;problem structure, for a broad class of equilibrium problems &lt;br/&gt;having substantial practical usefulness as well as intrinsic &lt;br/&gt;mathematical interest. It would also produce better computational &lt;br/&gt;algorithms, and the means for justifying them. Sub-topics in this &lt;br/&gt;research program include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Gaining better insight into degeneracy and its effects through &lt;br/&gt;analysis of parameterized versions of variational conditions, &lt;br/&gt;with the aim of illuminating the effect of special structure on &lt;br/&gt;the sensitivity and stability behavior of the problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Developing new computational methods using approximate &lt;br/&gt;derivatives, justifying their convergence, and testing them &lt;br/&gt;computationally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Improving convergence analysis for methods of linearization &lt;br/&gt;type, and applying that analysis to, e.g., the computational &lt;br/&gt;methods discussed just above. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Analyzing specially structured variational conditions using &lt;br/&gt;methods of composition duality combined with the new &lt;br/&gt;stability and sensitivity information developed in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Applying knowledge gained in the above research to analysis &lt;br/&gt;of other promising areas such as quasi-variational &lt;br/&gt;inequalities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variational conditions are mathematical models of equilibrium &lt;br/&gt;problems. They are useful for a wide variety of problems from &lt;br/&gt;areas including economic policy studies, agricultural economics, &lt;br/&gt;structural engineering, transportation, materials science, game &lt;br/&gt;theory (that is, models of conflict), and others. One of the reasons &lt;br/&gt;why these problems are especially hard is that they model &lt;br/&gt;situations in which individuals or groups are not acting in concert, &lt;br/&gt;and indeed are often acting at cross purposes. For example, in a &lt;br/&gt;road traffic equilibrium problem each driver is trying to find a &lt;br/&gt;route that is best for him or her, but the effects of many drivers' &lt;br/&gt;independent choices can make conditions bad for everyone (e.g., &lt;br/&gt;by creating congestion on popular routes). The research that is &lt;br/&gt;proposed will try to develop more knowledge about how &lt;br/&gt;mathematical models can represent these problems, what the &lt;br/&gt;properties of those models are, and how to use those properties to &lt;br/&gt;compute numerical solutions to the models. With such knowledge &lt;br/&gt;the models could then be used to answer "what-if" questions and &lt;br/&gt;thus to design better management methods. For example, civil &lt;br/&gt;engineers interested in improving traffic flow might use such &lt;br/&gt;models to predict more accurately the effect of improving existing &lt;br/&gt;roads or of building new roads, and thereby determine how best to &lt;br/&gt;spend a limited budget to reduce traffic congestion.</AbstractNarration>
