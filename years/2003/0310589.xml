<AbstractNarration>DMS-0310589&lt;br/&gt;Karen Daniels, Daniel Klain, Koonstantin Rybnikov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a CARGO incubation award made under solicitation &lt;br/&gt;http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2002/nsf02155/nsf02155.htm.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will develop new techniques and algorithms for solving a &lt;br/&gt;collection of problems that address the verification and reconstruction of &lt;br/&gt;geometric objects from partial information.   The approach is to have two &lt;br/&gt;stages:  first, verify if the partial information is consistent with the &lt;br/&gt;desired outcome. Second, if the answer is positive, reconstruct the object.  &lt;br/&gt;If the answer is negative, find an approximation to the desired reconstruction.  &lt;br/&gt;The group will focus on four major types of problems.  The first type is a &lt;br/&gt;general class of NP-hard containment, covering and packing problems.  Although &lt;br/&gt;complete information about the objects may be available, partial information &lt;br/&gt;will be used due to the hardness of the problems.  In addition to &lt;br/&gt;strengthening existing algorithms for polygonal shapes, this work will &lt;br/&gt;design the first containment and covering algorithms using objects &lt;br/&gt;bounded by spline curves. For the other three problems only partial &lt;br/&gt;information about the objects is available.  The second problem is &lt;br/&gt;the verification of convexity and reconstruction of convex polyhedra &lt;br/&gt;and convex smooth shapes from partial data.   Reconstruction of &lt;br/&gt;convex polytopes from partial data is a fascinating classical problem &lt;br/&gt;going back to Maxwell, Steinitz, and Minkowski. While much work has &lt;br/&gt;been done on recognition and reconstruction of convex polyhedra &lt;br/&gt;from projections, reconstruction of smooth convex shapes with a &lt;br/&gt;given discrete set of parameters is a problem that has not been &lt;br/&gt;adequately addressed. Our work will emphasize reconstruction of &lt;br/&gt;convex smooth bodies using splines.  The third problem is that &lt;br/&gt;of statistical determination of topological properties of a body, &lt;br/&gt;such as the Euler characteristic, from a finite set of sample points.  &lt;br/&gt;The fourth problem, tightly related to the third one, is the determination &lt;br/&gt;of the topology of a non-convex body from its projections on a &lt;br/&gt;finite number of planes.  Dissection and subsequent use of valuations, &lt;br/&gt;i.e. finitely additive probability measures, will play an especially &lt;br/&gt;important role in the third and fourth problems.  The team of mathematics &lt;br/&gt;and computer science investigators will combine computational geometry &lt;br/&gt;techniques, mathematical programming approaches, methods of graph theory &lt;br/&gt;and discrete geometry, methods of convexity theory, and work on &lt;br/&gt;multivariate splines to design verification and reconstruction algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to their significance in the context of pure mathematics and &lt;br/&gt;theoretical computer science, these problems are important to applications &lt;br/&gt;of computational geometry and geometric software design. For example, &lt;br/&gt;verification of metric and topological properties of geometric software &lt;br/&gt;outputs is important for implementing and testing geometric algorithms.  &lt;br/&gt;Containment algorithms are useful in 2D packing and layout for manufacturing.  &lt;br/&gt;Containment for 3D shapes is applicable to modeling tasks such as molecular &lt;br/&gt;docking and to medical treatment planning. Covering problems arise in practical &lt;br/&gt;settings such as military sensor coverage and targeting, telecommunications, &lt;br/&gt;spatial query optimization, and graphics. Work involving splines is applicable &lt;br/&gt;to CAD and design of numerical methods.  Determination of the topology of a &lt;br/&gt;body from finite samplings, projections, and sections is a hard problem &lt;br/&gt;important for computer tomography and pattern recognition.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
