<AbstractNarration>As population growth and urban development continue to expand in the coastal margin, flooding poses a&lt;br/&gt;major threat to human safety and the integrity of the natural environment. To mitigate the adverse&lt;br/&gt;impacts of coastal flooding, decision makers are increasingly advocating watershed or ecosystem&lt;br/&gt;approaches to management. While it is argued that some of the most serious flood hazards are the result&lt;br/&gt;of a failure to understand the regional ecological context, little empirical research has been done on how&lt;br/&gt;growth and development patterns increase the threat of floods at the watershed level and how&lt;br/&gt;communities respond over time to repetitive flooding events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My career plan will address this need by implementing an interactive research and educational program&lt;br/&gt;on flood mitigation, sustainable watershed management, and policy learning. It will develop a framework&lt;br/&gt;for adaptive decision making for coastal flood hazards by integrating research, education, and information&lt;br/&gt;dissemination. The research component will focus on the impacts of wetland development on coastal&lt;br/&gt;watershed flooding and policy learning at the community level to mitigate the adverse impacts of flood&lt;br/&gt;damage to the human and natural environment. A two-phase longitudinal research design will employ&lt;br/&gt;both quantitative and qualitative analyses to investigate flooding problems in Texas and Florida. Phase&lt;br/&gt;one will use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to examine the spatial pattern of wetland&lt;br/&gt;development over a ten-year period and correlate this development with coastal watershed flooding.&lt;br/&gt;Phase two will identify thresholds of policy learning by examining how communities adjust and adapt to&lt;br/&gt;repetitive flooding. Both research phases will use multivariate analysis to measure the effects of wetland&lt;br/&gt;development on flooding and the effects of flooding on policy adjustment while controlling for&lt;br/&gt;socioeconomic, biophysical, and other contextual factors. The education component of the career plan&lt;br/&gt;will develop place-based learning modules on coastal watershed management and flood mitigation. A&lt;br/&gt;series of interdisciplinary, problem-based seminars will provide an authentic learning experience to&lt;br/&gt;prepare future scientists, teachers, and policy makers to address ecosystem-level hazards issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of Proposed Plan &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the research is based on advancing knowledge of the causes of coastal watershed&lt;br/&gt;flooding and showing how to adapt policy mechanisms to mitigate floods. Results will contribute to a&lt;br/&gt;decision-making framework for flood mitigation by increasing understanding of the specific type, size,&lt;br/&gt;and location of wetlands that mitigate flooding and provide guidance to watershed planners for managing&lt;br/&gt;adaptively over time. This understanding is critical given the continued development of coastal areas and&lt;br/&gt;the increasing vulnerability of human populations to coastal flooding. One of the unique features of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed research will be the utilization of data sources that have been underutilized in the analysis of&lt;br/&gt;wetland loss. The national wetland permit and USGS flood gauge databases offer important opportunities&lt;br/&gt;to conduct an empirical study on watershed flooding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of Proposed Plan &lt;br/&gt;While the project will contribute to scientific understanding and management capabilities, it will also&lt;br/&gt;promote teaching and learning on system-wide ecological problems. By building on participation in the&lt;br/&gt;University.s NSF sponsored Informational Technology and Science Program and Sustainable Coastal&lt;br/&gt;Margins Program, the project will integrate research on watershed management and flood mitigation with&lt;br/&gt;education and training to solve these issues. Interdisciplinary, place-based learning modules will train&lt;br/&gt;students and teachers to understand and act upon complex ecosystem management problems through&lt;br/&gt;problem solving, field experience, and the development of watershed case studies and associated&lt;br/&gt;websites. Courses during the academic year will target graduate students, while summer sessions will&lt;br/&gt;also include K-12 teachers. Another positive impact of the project will be recruitment and training of&lt;br/&gt;students from underrepresented groups. These individuals will play a vital role in both the research and&lt;br/&gt;educational components of the project. Finally, the dissemination of results will benefit the academic and&lt;br/&gt;policy making community. In addition to presenting research results at conferences and workshops, the&lt;br/&gt;information will be shared with public decision makers.</AbstractNarration>
