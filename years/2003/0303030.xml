    <AbstractNarration>To meet the burgeoning needs of the biotechnology industry for skilled production technicians, New Hampshire Technical Community College (NHCTC), Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC), and industry and community college partners are working together to develop a Northeast Regional Biomanufacturing Center. This project involves three components: working with partners to develop the foundation for a Center; determining biomanufacturing job competencies for technicians and supervisors; and beginning the development of a biotechnology equipment and supplies resource center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Northeast Region has a large, growing need for skilled biomanufacturing technicians. A 2000 survey by the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council predicted that between September 2001 and September 2002, the Massachusetts/New Hampshire/Rhode Island corridor would create over 1,000 new biomanufacturing jobs. The expansion of two facilities in Rhode Island by 2005 will produce an estimated 800-1000 additional biomanufacturing technician jobs. In Maryland, the 16,000 biotechnology work force is expected to double in size in a few years. To compound this situation, manufacturing supervisors report significant turnover rates of current manufacturing workers because they lack appropriate skills. A biomanufacturing education center is needed, and there needs to be coordination throughout the region. This project is beginning that process.</AbstractNarration>
