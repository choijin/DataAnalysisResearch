<AbstractNarration>Today's embedded computers are increasingly mobile and ubiquitous, are&lt;br/&gt;capable of interacting with the environment, and can communicate with&lt;br/&gt;one another over possibly vast and pervasive networks. While most of&lt;br/&gt;the wireless networks are not expected to be capable of controlling&lt;br/&gt;their own motion, new technological possibilities are emerging to&lt;br/&gt;provide small embedded devices with the means to propel themselves,&lt;br/&gt;with an energy expenditure that is comparable to the energy budget of&lt;br/&gt;communication and computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Controlled-Mobility Wireless Network (CMWN) is defined as a network&lt;br/&gt;of embedded devices endowed with computation, communication and motion&lt;br/&gt;capabilities. The purpose of this project is the development of a new&lt;br/&gt;conceptual framework for the design, development and operation of&lt;br/&gt;efficient and reliable networks with such characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objectives of the basic research proposed in this project&lt;br/&gt;are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The development of a conceptually sound, consistent and complete&lt;br/&gt;framework for the analysis of the interactions between competing&lt;br/&gt;computation, communication, and motion control requirements, arising&lt;br/&gt;in the design of CMWNs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. The design, analysis, and performance characterization of&lt;br/&gt;distributed algorithms and communication protocols for provably&lt;br/&gt;efficient and adaptive CMWNs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. The specification, implementation and verification of software,&lt;br/&gt;middleware and networking services for the deployment of&lt;br/&gt;representative CMWNs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
