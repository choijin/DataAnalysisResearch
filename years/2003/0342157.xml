<AbstractNarration>This award supports theoretical research in condensed matter physics.  The research includes investigations of the quantum and statistical mechanics of diverse important quantum phases of matter including such topics as: quantum magnets, quantum coherence in mesoscopic devices, novel correlated states of atoms in condensates and optical lattices, two-dimensional electron gases and bilayer systems.  Analytical as well as quantum and classical Monte Carlo and other numerical techniques will be applied to the study of these phenomena.  New numerical techniques with wide applicability will be sought, developed and investigated.  This work will advance our knowledge on these broad fronts and will make close contact with experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research has an interdisciplinary component which brings together ideas and methods used in the condensed matter and atomic physics communities and will help foster communication between these two groups.  Postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduates will all be trained in these areas.  Results will be disseminated widely including through the Boulder Summer School.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research in condensed matter physics.
