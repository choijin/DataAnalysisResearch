    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop a new "green" ultra-high-speed single-wafer ozone-water-based resist and heavy organic residue removal process for electronic device manufacturing. The drive to smaller feature sizes and larger wafer sizes in next generation device manufacturing has led to the growth in the use of single-wafer wet processing in lieu of batch processing. Initial measurements show that this process can achieve photoresist etch rates (removal rates) in excess of 20,000 Angstroms/ minute. Very high etch rate is critical to the achievement of practical throughputs using single-wafer processing. Initial data and analytical modeling indicates the potential of this process to increase etch rates to even higher levels. Five goals of this project are: 1) measure resist etch rate as a function of temperature; 2) measure the resist etch rate as a function of process chemistry flow rate; 3) evaluate the influence of process chemistry on resist removal; 4) demonstrate process performance using patterned test wafers; and 5) prepare a preliminary design for a process for further evaluation in Phase II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project will be in the manufacture of high density semiconductor devices. The successful completion of this research program will culminate in the development of the next generation of high density semiconductor devices which will not only increase performance and decrease costs, but will also provide significant environmental benefits through the use of environmentally benign chemicals in lieu of acids and solvents. The market for wafer wet processing equipment alone is projected to reach $3.1 billion by 2005. The ozone-water based process developed in the course of this research can not only be used in semiconductor wafer manufacturing, but also for magnetic disc manufacturing, optical disc manufacturing and flat panel manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>
