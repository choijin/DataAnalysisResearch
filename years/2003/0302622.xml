    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT: This project concerns two main topics: harmonic analysis on&lt;br/&gt;noncompact semisimple Lie groups and symmetric spaces, and unique&lt;br/&gt;continuation problems and absence of positive eigenvalues of Schrodinger&lt;br/&gt;operators on Euclidean spaces. The author's goal is to develop&lt;br/&gt;real-variable methods that could be used to study boundedness properties&lt;br/&gt;of certain natural operators on noncompact semisimple Lie groups and&lt;br/&gt;symmetric spaces. Some of the problems to be investigated are the&lt;br/&gt;following: sharp estimates related to the Kunze-Stein phenomenon,&lt;br/&gt;behaviour of the solution of the wave equation on symmetric spaces at&lt;br/&gt;large time, singular integral operators on symmetric spaces, transference&lt;br/&gt;principles for operators defined by Fourier multipliers on symmetric&lt;br/&gt;spaces, and maximal operators and applications in ergodic theory. The&lt;br/&gt;author made progress on these problems in certain special cases, mostly&lt;br/&gt;on Lie groups and symmetric spaces of real rank one. The second part of&lt;br/&gt;the project is aimed at understanding the absence of positive eigenvalues&lt;br/&gt;for Schrodinger operators with potentials in appropriate Lebesgue spaces&lt;br/&gt;and with certain decay properties at infinity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem of eliminating the possibility of positive eigenvalues for the&lt;br/&gt;Schrodinger operator associated to one or many particles comes from&lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics. One expects on physical grounds that such positive&lt;br/&gt;energy "bound states" cannot exist. This is indeed the case for a large&lt;br/&gt;class of Schrodinger operators associated to potentials which satisfy&lt;br/&gt;certain uniform decay conditions, such as the Coulomb potential.&lt;br/&gt;These potentials were studied in the 60's by T. Kato, S. Agmon, J.&lt;br/&gt;Weidman, B. Simon, and others. In the last twenty years there has been&lt;br/&gt;growing interest in extending these classical results to more general&lt;br/&gt;potentials in various Lebesgue spaces.</AbstractNarration>
