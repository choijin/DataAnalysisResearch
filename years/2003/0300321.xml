<AbstractNarration>DMS-0300321&lt;br/&gt;Boston, Nigel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Tree Representations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   The investigator and his collaborators are developing a theory of&lt;br/&gt;Galois group actions on rooted trees, in analogy to the well-established&lt;br/&gt;theory of such actions on p-adic vector spaces. The Fontaine-Mazur conjecture&lt;br/&gt;and generalizations of it predict that for Galois groups of number field&lt;br/&gt;extensions unramified at p the latter actions have finite image whereas  &lt;br/&gt;there should exist tree actions with infinite image. The investigator's&lt;br/&gt;program will identify these actions and hence these (as yet mysterious) Galois&lt;br/&gt;groups, allowing direct verification of Fontaine-Mazur in these cases.&lt;br/&gt;Possible spin-offs of this include improved root-discriminant bounds and&lt;br/&gt;a quantitative version of Fontaine-Mazur along the lines of Cohen-Lenstra&lt;br/&gt;heuristics, together with applications for the pro-p group theorists such&lt;br/&gt;as new families of branch pro-p groups.&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;   Number theory has been revolutionized in recent years by the use of       &lt;br/&gt;"Galois representations", most notably by Wiles in his proof of Fermat's&lt;br/&gt;Last Theorem. In particular his co-author, Taylor, has gone on to apply&lt;br/&gt;these techniques to many other longstanding problems. The only drawback&lt;br/&gt;is that these methods only work in one half of cases, the "p-ramified" ones.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal develops a new theory of Galois representations suited to&lt;br/&gt;handling the other half. The work of Taylor and Wiles proves cases of the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental Fontaine-Mazur conjecture, from which solutions to Fermat's&lt;br/&gt;Last Theorem and similar equations simply follow - in the other half&lt;br/&gt;the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture has many striking consequences and the new&lt;br/&gt;theory presents a program for verifying the conjecture and hence its&lt;br/&gt;corollaries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
