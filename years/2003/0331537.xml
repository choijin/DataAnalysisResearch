<AbstractNarration>California State University Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Program, Phase III &lt;br/&gt;nitiated in 1994, the California State University-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation &lt;br/&gt;Program (CSU-LSAMP) is a comprehensive, statewide program dedicated to increasing the &lt;br/&gt;number of students from underrepresented minority groups (URM) graduating from campuses &lt;br/&gt;of the California State University (CSU) with baccalaureate degrees in science, technology, &lt;br/&gt;engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The CSU-AMP Alliance includes 47 public &lt;br/&gt;postsecondary institutions: 19 CSU campuses plus 28 California Community Colleges (CCC).  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;With past NSF support, CSU-LSAMP contributed substantially to broadening participation of &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines.  If the annual number of STEM degrees awarded &lt;br/&gt;to URM students had remained at the 1993 pre-CSU-LSAMP baseline of 750, the total number &lt;br/&gt;of degrees awarded between 1994-95 and 2001-02 would have been 6000.  Instead, a total of &lt;br/&gt;11,601 degrees were awarded over the past eight-year period, an increase of 5,601 URM-&lt;br/&gt;STEM degrees. The potential for CSU-LSAMP to further increase overall participation of URM &lt;br/&gt;students in STEM is strengthened by projections for changes in the number and proportion of &lt;br/&gt;URM students graduating from California public high schools.  In Phase III, CSU-LSAMP &lt;br/&gt;proposes to engage approximately 2,000 URM students/year in activities that sustain or further &lt;br/&gt;improve individual student retention and progression rates achieved during Phase I and Phase &lt;br/&gt;II, and proposes to increase the number of URM-STEM degrees awarded from the 2001-2002 &lt;br/&gt;level of 1,485 to 2,528 in 2007-2008.  Hence, the CSU-LSAMP goal is to award over 1,000 &lt;br/&gt;more STEM baccalaureate degrees to URM students by the end of the project period.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Since California Community Colleges enroll approximately 63% of college-going students in &lt;br/&gt;California, partnership activities that improve transfer rates are critical to achieving the degree &lt;br/&gt;production goal.  Therefore, during Phase III, CSU-LSAMP will complete construction of &lt;br/&gt;.bridges. between CSU and CCC partners that facilitate student advancement through this &lt;br/&gt;critical decision point.  Since many of the strategies initiated in Phase I and Phase II for lower &lt;br/&gt;division students have already been institutionalized, CSU-LSAMP will also introduce activities &lt;br/&gt;in Phase III that are designed to enhance graduate school preparedness of upper division &lt;br/&gt;students with the goal of improving aggregate student progression to STEM graduate programs.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Phase III activities provided by each CSU campus will focus on four common objectives: (1) &lt;br/&gt;increasing transfer rates of URM students from the community colleges to STEM majors in the &lt;br/&gt;CSU;  (2) enhancing first and second year retention rates and overall academic performance of &lt;br/&gt;URM students in STEM majors to levels comparable to levels for non-URM students; (3) &lt;br/&gt;enhancing performance of URM students in math and science courses; and (4) increasing the &lt;br/&gt;number of URM students interested in pursuing graduate study in STEM disciplines, and &lt;br/&gt;enhancing graduate school preparedness of upper division URM-STEM students.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The types of activities that will be offered to support each objective have consistently been &lt;br/&gt;shown to facilitate retention and progression of URM students in STEM, and represent a set of &lt;br/&gt;well-established .best practices. for accomplishing the objectives. These activities include:  &lt;br/&gt;course articulation between CSU and community colleges; individual transfer agreements with &lt;br/&gt;community college students; advising/orientation programs; peer mentoring; faculty mentoring; &lt;br/&gt;intensive summer or academic year programs designed to prepare students to excel in calculus &lt;br/&gt;courses; supplemental academic year workshops designed to enhance performance in specific &lt;br/&gt;math and science courses; graduate information workshops; AY or summer internships and &lt;br/&gt;research experiences; GRE preparation workshops; participation in scientific and professional &lt;br/&gt;conferences;  interactions with other URM-STEM serving programs; and Interactions with URM-&lt;br/&gt;STEM serving prog ms at Ph.D. granting institutions.</AbstractNarration>
