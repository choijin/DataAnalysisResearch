<AbstractNarration>Engineering-Mechanical (56)  This proof-of-concept project is creating teaching modules and course materials that integrate probabilistic and statistical methods into introductory and capstone engineering design courses. The materials will bridge the gap between a pure "Probability and Statistics" course and engineering design courses by providing engineering students with the skills to apply probability and statistics to engineering design problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing a "Probabilistic Engineering Design" capstone course that covers basic probabilistic and statistical engineering design methods, such as Design of Experiments, Robust Design, and Reliability-Based Design. The investigators are working collaboratively with industry to develop a textbook titled "Probabilistic Engineering Design" with associated Matlab Toolbox and software; to evaluate the project; and to develop student projects. The Matlab Toolbox of Probabilistic Engineering Design being developed will help students understand probabilistic and statistical design methods and apply those methods in engineering analysis and design. Notes, supporting materials, projects, and exams are provided within the course website.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
