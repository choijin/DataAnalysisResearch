<AbstractNarration>All nations share a concern about how to best prepare the next generation of leaders who will be &lt;br/&gt;able to confront a complex set of social, political, technical, and health issues within a global &lt;br/&gt;setting.  There are many issues associated with globalization and doctoral education such as the &lt;br/&gt;ways in which technology enables a new level of international research and policy networks, the &lt;br/&gt;renewed interest in and commitment to understanding the changing labor market for highly &lt;br/&gt;educated professionals, and the production of PhD recipients as they represent the leading labor &lt;br/&gt;force for knowledge-based economies. Taken together these issues create a powerful motivation &lt;br/&gt;to share information about how to educate these new leaders. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To facilitate the understanding of forces and forms that shape doctoral education worldwide and &lt;br/&gt;interpret the emerging trends, the Center for Innovation and Research in Graduate Education &lt;br/&gt;proposes to bring together no more than thirty key players (policy makers, graduate education &lt;br/&gt;researchers, university administrators, industry representatives, and funders) from around the &lt;br/&gt;world in a three-day conference. Issues to be discussed include, needs of a highly educated labor &lt;br/&gt;forced for the 21st century, and the characteristics of this labor force, the impact of technology on &lt;br/&gt;research and education, the content and the pedagogy of doctoral education, the transition from &lt;br/&gt;doctoral education or postdoctoral appointment to stable employment, the changing &lt;br/&gt;demographics of the doctoral student body (i.e., gender, socio-economic class, race, and &lt;br/&gt;ethnicity), and financing graduate education, including the privatization of education throughout &lt;br/&gt;the world. Differences and commonalities among nations will be explicitly mapped out. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;We will commission a paper from each participating country describing the current state of &lt;br/&gt;doctoral education according to a common set of issues. The initial goal of these papers will be to &lt;br/&gt;create a common language and understanding of each country.s system of doctoral education. On &lt;br/&gt;this basis potential shared forces that drive doctoral education can be identified and categorized. &lt;br/&gt;And, the group will work together to investigate if the various reforms in doctoral education are &lt;br/&gt;converging toward a similar model as a result of global forces. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This series of conferences will have a number of important impacts. First, it &lt;br/&gt;will move a broad coalition of scholars, policy makers, funders, and administrators toward a &lt;br/&gt;better grasp of the issues of doctoral education across nations. Second, it will share among &lt;br/&gt;participants information on innovations and best practices currently shaping doctoral programs. &lt;br/&gt;Third, it will work toward establishing greater inclusiveness within in the realm of doctoral &lt;br/&gt;education of underrepresented groups. Fourth, it will work to develop of a comprehensive &lt;br/&gt;research agenda on doctoral education internationally. And, fourth, it will examine ways in which &lt;br/&gt;issues can be addressed in policy to foster the education and training of leadership for a &lt;br/&gt;knowledge-based society in a global economy. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: The intellectual merits of this series of conferences will include (1) &lt;br/&gt;furthering the research and training opportunities and international collaboration in doctoral &lt;br/&gt;education; (2) establishing an ongoing formal network of key players in doctoral education so that &lt;br/&gt;forces  (political, economic, technological) can be responded to in a manner most conducive to &lt;br/&gt;furthering the high quality and inclusiveness of doctoral education worldwide; and (3) providing &lt;br/&gt;a comprehensive foundation for setting research agendas in doctoral education through systematic &lt;br/&gt;knowledge exchange.</AbstractNarration>
