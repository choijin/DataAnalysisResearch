<AbstractNarration>0348512&lt;br/&gt;Rockne&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this research are to investigate how clean sediment caps, together with organic matter and/or anaerobic electron acceptor (EA) amendment affect the fate of contaminants in situ through the stimulation of microbial biodegradation and benthic animal activity in low energy (non-scouring) sediments. The combined activity of a stimulated microbial consortium able to degrade pollutants, along with the mixing action of bioturbation may facilitate mass transfer of the EAs (or oxygen through burrow structures) to the microbes where they are needed. In addition, the placement of a thin cap will allow mitigation of existing surface toxicity, potentially to levels acceptable to regulatory agencies. Key questions of this proposed treatment that will be answered by this proposal are how capping and amendments will affect the contaminant biodegradation activity and potential re-mobilization, as well as the microbial and benthic animal community structure in situ. These questions will be answered through a multi-phase investigation utilizing flume studies in conjunction with laboratory and field studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will study classes of common organic sediment contaminants that we have shown to be degraded anaerobically: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), petroleum hydrocarbons (PHs), and halogenated aromatics (HAs). Biological, chemical, and physical parameters affecting the bioavailability of these compounds will be investigated using sediment from sites with different characteristics obtained from sources spanning fresh to near marine conditions: Indiana Harbor Ship Canal (IN), the Grand Calumet River (IN and IL), Waukegan Harbor (IL), and the NY/NJ Harbor Estuary (NJ and NY). The PI has extensive experience working with sediments from these sites. These sediments will be incubated in microcosms in environmental chambers in the PIs laboratory, as well as the annular flume assemblies at the Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences at Rutgers University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will aid in the determination of whether this treatment approach is feasible and may represent a low cost, low maintenance remedial alternative without many of the deleterious environmental impacts of dredging. The practical aspects of this sediment remediation project make it an ideal conceptual platform for introducing and reinforcing the connection between fundamental science and applied engineering. This will strengthen the PIs educational goals of enhancing coursework at UIC in both undergraduate and graduate programs in environmental biotechnology and engineering education to explore the dynamic interactions within and among environmental systems and to provide enrichment opportunities for pre-college science teachers of inner-city students in the Perspectives Charter school in the UIC area through a teaching internship/module program.</AbstractNarration>
