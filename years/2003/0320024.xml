    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at the demonstration of a&lt;br/&gt;compact, Watt-level, single frequency fiber laser operating around 1550 nm. The laser will take advantage of proprietary, highly Yb: Er co-doped fiber allowing the total length of the fiber-laser cavity to less than 5 cm - a task impossible with conventional fiber approaches. Such a short cavity length is uniquely suited for extremely stable and mode hop free single frequency operation. High doping levels and a large optical mode field diameter will be used in order to reduce the influence of fiber non-linearities and allow for a short and compact linear cavity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high power and near ideal spectral (spatial output) at an eye-safe wavelength, where Er-doped fiber amplifiers and other fiber-optic components would be readily available. This would make such a laser very attractive for many commercial applications including coherent LADAR, distributed temperature and pressure sensing and frequency conversion. The project should ultimately result in a marketable product that will be used in a variety of civil and military applications.</AbstractNarration>
