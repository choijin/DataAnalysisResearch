<AbstractNarration>Abstract: NSF Proposal DMS-0307794&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Participant Funding: Applied Inverse Problems - Theoretical and Computational Aspects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Joyce R McLaughlin, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is for funding, primarily for junior participants, for the conference, Applied Inverse Problems: Theoretical and Computational&lt;br/&gt;Aspects, that will be held at the UCLA Lake Arrowhead Conference Center from May 18-23, 2003. Inverse problems is a growing active research area.  The conference will be on all aspects of inverse problem solutions including theoretical, modeling and computational aspects.  A wide range of applications will be represented including life science mathematical modeling, radar, inverse scattering, wavelets, baysian statistical methods, time reversal problems, x-ray tomography, optical tomography, geophysical imaging, astrophysical imaging and level set methods.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A prevalent feature of inverse problems  is that the measured data is indirectly related to the sought after solution.  Applications include medical diagnostics, medical imaging, advanced materials, sensing of remote topographies, biological modeling as in protein folding or molecular motor modeling, imaging in astrophysics, geophysical modeling as in oil prospecting or fault zone identification, etc.  The response to this Lake Arrowhead conference as been very enthusiastic.  A large number of leaders in the field will be active participants and the conference will also emphasize career development of junior researchers.  We expect 60-70 researchers in their early career out of an expected total of 160 attendees.  All participants will be active researchers and will have an opportunity to give a talk on their own work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
