<AbstractNarration>Description:  This award provides support for a delegation of US thermal scientists and engineers to visit India where they will participate in two research workshops and the biannual US-India Heat and Mass Transfer Conference, Bangalore, India, January 2004.  The Heat and Mass Transfer conference is the premier venue for the dissemination of research findings by the Indian thermal sciences and engineering community.  The American Society of Mechanical Engineers has cosponsored this event for nearly a decade.  The delegation will participate in novel initiatives designed to enhance mutually beneficial collaborations.  These include delivering state-of-the-art plenary and keynote lectures, building web based educational partnerships with India's leading science and engineering institutions, participating in two workshops, and visiting premier educational institutions and leading companies and laboratories with strong ongoing thermal science initiatives.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope:  India has several large communities of researchers actively involved in thermal sciences and engineering research and education at universities, government laboratories and industries.  The Indian Heat and Mass Transfer Society is the professional society representing the field of thermal sciences in India and its members interact closely with government agencies and industry to set the national agenda for this field and identify research issues of importance to industry.  The US delegates include junior, postdocs, and senior researchers including some of the most significant researchers in the field.   This activity is cofunded by the NSF's Division of Chemical and Transport Systems and by the Indian Department of Science and Technology (DST) under the NSF/DST joint program.</AbstractNarration>
