<AbstractNarration>DMS-0301282&lt;br/&gt;Poonen,  Bjorn M.&lt;br/&gt;(Croot, Ernest S.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: On a Reciprocal Tarry-Escott Problem, the Distribution of Roots&lt;br/&gt;         Of Polynomials Modulo a Composite, and Sieve Methods&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Proposer's research project has three goals:  &lt;br/&gt;He wishes to finish working on his results and methods on the &lt;br/&gt;Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem, which he will write up in one or more papers;&lt;br/&gt;he plans to continue and to write up in a paper his work &lt;br/&gt;with an undergraduate on cryptology; and, he wishes to continue to develop &lt;br/&gt;a new sieve method for determining the number of primes in thin sets of &lt;br/&gt;integers.  The proposer's work on the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem gives a &lt;br/&gt;new method for constructing solutions to certain systems of diophantine &lt;br/&gt;equations with many variables, and the method may lead to a solution of one &lt;br/&gt;of more unsolved problems in this area.  The work on cryptology centers around &lt;br/&gt;showing that certain algorithms for attacking public-key cryptosystems, that &lt;br/&gt;find low-height roots of polynomials modulo an integer q &lt;br/&gt;(such as Coppersmith's method), cannot be easily improved.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the proposer plans to continue developing a sieve method&lt;br/&gt;for counting the number of primes in a given set of integers, which allows &lt;br/&gt;one to use additional analytic information (besides the usual data used by the&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial sieve) about the set, in the hopes that the method will&lt;br/&gt;lead to the solution of one or another known, difficult, unsolved problems&lt;br/&gt;in prime number theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the time of the ancient Greeks, mathematicians have been trying to&lt;br/&gt;understand how the prime numbers are spaced; that is, how does the distance&lt;br/&gt;between consecutive prime numbers vary as one considers larger and larger&lt;br/&gt;primes?  Sieve methods were developed as a theoretical tool for answering&lt;br/&gt;this type of question; however, there are many natural questions about such &lt;br/&gt;spacings that they currently cannot answer.  One of the proposer's&lt;br/&gt;research goals is to finish developing a new sieve method which he hopes &lt;br/&gt;to use to make progress on some of these unsolved problems.  The proposer's&lt;br/&gt;work on cryptology was motivated by research with an undergraduate on&lt;br/&gt;a certain method (Coppersmith's algorithm) for attacking the &lt;br/&gt;RSA cryptosystem, which is a procedure for sending secure data via the internet.&lt;br/&gt;The proposer (and student) plans to continue his work&lt;br/&gt;on a related problem in number theory, the solution of which would show that&lt;br/&gt;this method of attack cannot be much improved.  Lastly, the proposer plans&lt;br/&gt;to continue his work on the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem.  This problem is  &lt;br/&gt;a longstanding unsolved question in number theory, and proposer is&lt;br/&gt;developing new methods to make progress on it and other, similar problems.</AbstractNarration>
