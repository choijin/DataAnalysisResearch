<AbstractNarration>DMS-0306062&lt;br/&gt;William Menasco&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator's research is focussed on understanding two&lt;br/&gt;important phenomena in low dimensional topology:   first, understanding &lt;br/&gt;exactly what is accomplished through the use of stabilization in &lt;br/&gt;relating two equivalent closed braids;  and second, understanding when &lt;br/&gt;there is the occurence of topologically essential surfaces inside a &lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional manifold, i.e. when is a 3-manifold Haken.  The classical &lt;br/&gt;stabilization result is "Markov's Theorem" which says that any two closed &lt;br/&gt;braid representatives of the same oriented link type in the 3-sphere are &lt;br/&gt;related to each other through a sequence of moves (isotopies): conjugation, &lt;br/&gt;stabilization and destabilization. Unforunately, the Markov Theorem only says&lt;br/&gt;a sequence exists, but understanding exactly what this stabilization sequence&lt;br/&gt;accomplishes has largely remained a big black box until recently.&lt;br/&gt;The first peek inside the stabilization black box is the "Markov Theorem &lt;br/&gt;Without Stabilization" (MTWS), a product of a long collaborative effort with &lt;br/&gt;Joan Birman.  The MTWS can tell one exactly what stabilization achieves in &lt;br/&gt;an isotopy between braids and one of the main goals of the project is to &lt;br/&gt;exploit this understanding in the areas of  link classification, link &lt;br/&gt;invariants and contact geometry. An essential surface inside a 3-manifold &lt;br/&gt;tells one about the geometry of the space.  Not all 3-manifolds contain essential&lt;br/&gt;surfaces, but it is possible that for a given 3-manifold M that is     &lt;br/&gt;lacking any essential surface there is another 3-manifold M' which has&lt;br/&gt;essential surfaces and M' "covers" M.  Understanding when a 3-manifold M&lt;br/&gt;has a such a corresponding cover M' is the focus of the "Virtual Haken  &lt;br/&gt;Conjecture".  The investigator in collaboration with Joseph Masters &amp;   &lt;br/&gt;Xingru Zhang is pursuing a new strategy for attacking this conjecture in &lt;br/&gt;a general setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 3-dimensional space in which we live is unique in its ability to retain&lt;br/&gt;information about the "knottest" of a collection of closed loops (think of&lt;br/&gt;a collection of tangled strands of pearls inside a jewelry box).  This phemomenon&lt;br/&gt;of knottest does not occur in any lower or higher dimensional space---the&lt;br/&gt;advantage of a 5-dimensional jewelry box is that a collection of&lt;br/&gt;strands of pearls can never be tangled.  Thus, as any micro-biologist working with&lt;br/&gt;DNA strands will tell you, knottest is an important feature&lt;br/&gt;of our 3-dimensional existence that needs to be understood.  Basic questions &lt;br/&gt;arise. When are different two knots (single strands) or links (multiple strands)&lt;br/&gt;illustrating the same type of knottest---that is, when is there a  sequence of&lt;br/&gt;motions of one link that move it around in 3-space so that it appears &lt;br/&gt;like that other link?  When is When is a knot which appears to be tangle in fact &lt;br/&gt;equivalent through motions a simple circle that can be laid flat in a plane?&lt;br/&gt;Motions can be very complex (think of trying to untangle&lt;br/&gt;a mass of fishing line).  The investigator's research has focussed on understanding&lt;br/&gt;and codifying these motions (in collaboration with Joan Birman, "The Markov Theorem&lt;br/&gt;Without Stabilization").  Also in trying to understand 3-dimensional spaces we&lt;br/&gt;can study "essential" surfaces that occur in them, i.e. surfaces that in the space&lt;br/&gt;can not be crashed down to a point.  Such surfaces can give us a type of  coordinate system&lt;br/&gt;for navigating in the space---astronomers are very interested in  determining if our&lt;br/&gt;universe has any essential surfaces.  If a 3-dimensional space has an essential surface&lt;br/&gt;then it is called "Haken".  Not all spaces are Haken, but some that are  not can be&lt;br/&gt;'painted over' or "covered" by ones that are, i.e. they may be "Virtually Haken".&lt;br/&gt;The investigator in collaboration with Joseph  Masters &amp;   &lt;br/&gt;Xingru Zhang is pursuing a new strategy determining when a 3-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;space is Virtually Haken.</AbstractNarration>
