<AbstractNarration>This CAREER award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports work by Professor Mohammad A. Omary to study luminescent materials of inorganic and organic compounds.  These efforts include: (1) establishing the spectroscopic and structural criteria for using selectively-targeted molecular and dendrimeric compounds for applications in photonics and optical sensing; (2) tailoring phosphorescent compounds that are suitable as the emitting layer materials in molecular light-emitting devices for flat panel display, or as optical sensor materials for the detection of volatile environmental pollutants; and (3) fabricating the devices and characterizing their performance.  The work will also probe how the metal-based luminescence in coinage-metal complexes may be dependent on metal-metal distances in the luminescent excited electronic state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New luminescent materials will be developed for sensors and light-emitting displays.  The educational component aims to improve graduate and undergraduate education by demonstrating how classroom material and modern research can be integrated and applied in various technological aspects in life.  Outreach efforts will be made toward educating underrepresented groups, including undergraduate and high school students, students from minority groups, school teachers, and people in the community.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
