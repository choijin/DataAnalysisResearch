<AbstractNarration>This funding action supports the acquisition of a Rigaku MSC wide angle X-ray diffractometer for structural analysis of polymer samples at Case Western Reserve University. This equipment is an essential in-house facility for a large polymer research center. It is also used to instruct undergraduates and graduate students in formal laboratory courses on polymer characterization. X-ray analysis is the method of choice for defining structural changes in many polymer systems that occur as a result of different processing conditions, environmental factors, physical/mechanical history, etc. Thus the diffractometer will be the workhorse for investigation of polymer structure, detection and identification of crystal structures, and determination of degree of crystallinity and crystallite size. The new equipment replaces a now obsolete diffractometer (purchased in the mid-1980s) and will have additional capabilities that make possible the routine rapid acquisition of X-ray data at different temperatures (-180 C to 300 C) and various controlled environmental conditions. The software package will automate determination of degrees of crystallinity, crystallite size and unit cell dimensions, and will permit Rietveld refinement of structure and X-ray data simulation. It will also have attachments that will allow the study of thin film structure and morphology including thin film pole figures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is clear from research projects described in this request that this instrument will have impact on a wide range of research. Graduate students and undergraduate students are involved in the described research. The interdisciplinary nature of the need for the equipment is indicated by the interest shown by university scientists (twelve members of the Department of Macromolecular Science, two members of the Department of Chemical Engineering, one from the Department of Electrical Engineering and two members of the Physics Department).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
