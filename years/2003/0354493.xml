<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consistent with EPSCoR's current guidelines, Rhode Island is eligible for the submission of a planning grant, since it receives 0.75% or less of the total NSF research funds to all sources within a state averaged over the past three years (NSF 02-027).  Therefore, the University of Rhode Island submitted proposal No. &lt;br/&gt;EPS 0354493, Drawing a Road Map to Research Excellence in Rhode Island.  It is aimed at initiating an 18-month planning process to improve the competitiveness of the state's research enterprise by substantially increasing its investment in research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed process builds on previous state planning that identified life science as the initial target of research infrastructure investment, triggering $180 million investment in facilities by the University of Rhode Island and Brown University-the state's two PhD-granting institutions.  It will also integrate Rhode Island's life science research enterprise with existing programs for workforce development and technology by increasing the pipeline of students into K-16 science programs and the impact of university research on state economic development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rhode Island has formed a state governing committee comprised of leaders in academe, state government, and the private sector to lead a statewide study of barriers and possible solutions.  It is expected that the proposed planning effort increases not only collaboration among the state universities, but also improves the educational experience of science and technology students, and increases the educational opportunities of underrepresented groups through the establishment of closer relationships between the primarily undergraduate schools and research universities.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
