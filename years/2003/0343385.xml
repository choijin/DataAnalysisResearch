    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Morin -- 0343385&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funds to cover travel expenses for 10 investigators to attend a workshop on "Experimental Model Systems in Community Ecology" to be held at the National Science Foundation Headquarters in Arlington, VA s in Fall, 2003. This workshop would bring together theoretical and empirical ecologists who use diverse approaches to study an assortment of different systems with the specific goal of promoting a broader appreciation within the research community for the value of model system approaches. The goal would be to address whether model system (e.g., microcosm) approaches to answering questions in community ecology are viable. Much of the current controversy concerns the ability of studies of relatively simple ecological systems (microcosms, mesocosms, controlled environment facilities, glass house systems, etc.) to inform us about the workings of much more complex natural systems. Some question whether study systems of reduced complexity and limited spatial scale, may overlook important processes (mixing, transport, fragmentation, environmental heterogeneity) that could drive patterns in nature. Other concerns hinge on whether artificially assembled systems or models may inadvertently omit critical species or processes. Other workers are more positive about the approach pointing out that some model systems, especially those based on microorganisms, permit studies of multigenerational duration that are essential to evaluate predictions about population and community dynamics over tractable spatio-temporal dimensions. And even though such systems are simpler than that seen in nature, this simplicity allows precise measurement of biological responses that become obscured by system complexity. This workshop would address and debate the benefits and limitations of using experimental model systems as a means of understanding community-level phenomena. A goal would be to more precisely prescribe how and when model system approaches could and should be used.</AbstractNarration>
