<AbstractNarration>The Athienou Archaeological REU Site in Cyprus has been investigating long-term culture change in central Cyprus since 1990. This multidisciplinary undertaking combines field training in archaeological methods (excavation and survey) with analyses of the natural and cultural contexts of ritual and secular use of the ancient and modern landscape. The specific problem that guides the project's research agenda is the degree to which rural areas were assimilated into regional and interregional economic, political, social, and religious networks of exchange. A focus on regions is essential to such considerations since it is only by comparison to events in other parts of Cyprus and elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean that past and present human activity in the area of Athienou makes sense. While the Athienou region and in fact Cyprus as a whole may be viewed as marginal in the evolution of western civilization, the project area&lt;br/&gt;can, nonetheless, be seen as a laboratory for the study of culture change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten outstanding undergraduate students are provided with the opportunity to join this Site and (1) receive instruction in survey and excavation techniques (e.g., remote sensing, computer-assisted mapping), record keeping and data management, and artifact analysis, (2) participate in seminars taught by specialists on archaeological method and theory and the cultural history of Cyprus and the Eastern Mediterranean, (3)&lt;br/&gt;visit archaeological sites and museums on the island, (4) plan and complete an independent research project bearing on the work of AAP, and (5) live in Athienou and learn about life in modern Cyprus.  A part of their experience with AAP, the students find themselves at the intellectual vortex created by the presence of many international scholars representing the fields of Social Sciences (archaeology and history), Humanities (literature, and art) and Natural Sciences (chemistry, geophysics and biology) working towards a common goal. Thus the students benefit enormously not only through their interaction with different disciplines, but learn the value of cooperation across disciplines and cross-fertilization of ideas. By the end of the 7-week experience students will have gained a deep understanding of the methods of archaeological theory and of field research, including most recent approaches to data collection and analysis. Their undertaking of independent research - sometimes on artifacts brought to light by themselves or their peers - and carry it through with the aim of publication will give them confidence in their abilities to work as scientists, and accomplish set goals. This mentally and physically demanding program prepares the students for productive careers in archaeology or related fields, or in whatever other career they pursue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Site's broader impact to society is manifest in many other ways. Through site tours led by the staff to K-12 school children, public lectures and articles in the media, the Project contributes immensely in educating people on the importance of archaeological remains and helps stem illicit looting for profit. The cross-cultural interaction between the staff and students on the one hand, and the local population on the other, helps forge lasting friendships and bridges of understanding between the US and Cyprus.  This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
