    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a national two-day meeting in Fall 2003 that will bring together researchers/educators supported in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate (MPS) and K-12 teachers who have been involved with the Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) activity in MPS. The purpose of this meeting is to (1) to exchange ideas and reports on the impact of the RET program on teachers, research scientists and K-12 students; (2) to examine the effectiveness of RET as a professional development program; (3) to extend RET opportunities to a more diverse range of teachers and schools; and (4) to expand the professional community of teachers and researchers engaged in RET design and evaluation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Research Experiences for Teachers activity provides enriching discovery-based learning experiences for in-service and pre-service K-12 teachers at MPS-supported REU Sites. RET was initiated at NSF in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate in FY 1999 and since then, more than 1,000 K-12 teachers have benefited from these research experiences. The proposed conference will focus on how the impact of RET should be measured, and builds upon the Spring 2002 Bringing Research into the Science Classroom (BRISC) conference that was supported under NSF award DMR-0135201.</AbstractNarration>
