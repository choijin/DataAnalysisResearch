<AbstractNarration>This grant supports a state-of-the-art scanning probe microscope (SPM). Recent advances in scanning probe microscopy technology make possible the direct imaging of a diverse range of nano- and micro-scale materials, including biological macromolecules and micro-organisms in their native solution environment. This appropriately configured AFM will allow imaging of proteins and DNA molecules, the structure of microorganisms such as phages and live bacteria, nanopore single molecule mechanics, the morphology of nano-composites of superconducting and metallic granules, and magnetic domain structures.. The AFM is capable of force measurements as diverse as inter- and intra- molecular interactions and magnetic forces. Exploring such a broad range of applications using a workhorse SPM platform shall enhance the research productivity of all participant investigators, while in the meantime providing essential research training in scanning probe microscopy to a large number of undergraduate and graduate students at Brown. The shared and coordinated use of the multifunctional equipment will yield significant savings for all participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of a multifunctional SPM facility will greatly enrich the training of a large number of student researchers over the next ten years, forming a cornerstone of their training in cutting edge materials science. Each year, NSF grants at Brown support the research of 10-12 graduate students and a comparable number of undergraduates. Many of these students come to Brown from under-represented groups including women, African Americans and Hispanics. In addition, the PIs have developed new biophysics and biomechanics courses and will incorporate the SPM in their associated laboratory portions. The PIs plan to offer training and research opportunities to local college and high school teachers in an effort to share the excitement of a cutting edge equipment facility with the broader community. The collaborative access to this multifunctional instrument shall likely facilitate new collaborations addressing a rich variety of scientific questions, and thus foster synergistic research activities and new research directions. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
