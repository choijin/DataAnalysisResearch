<AbstractNarration>This project allows San Juan College to plan and design a certificate, transfer degree and training program in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for the region that it serves.  Rich in natural resources, but sparse population, there is a need for the GIS technology to meet a current and projected shortage of faculty and highly skilled technicians. This multifaceted effort to meet academic and workforce needs is centered at San Juan College with support from educational, business and industry partnerships.  The project develops a program for rural education of undergraduate students, current workers, future technicians and teachers. Planning for training experienced instructors, the technical and transfer program, and utilizing practicing scientists and technicians as advisors, the project assists San Juan College in addressing the intellectual challenge of providing quality student learning. Important science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) principles, integrating the tools and concepts of GIS, and providing a means to technical education currently available only at great distance and expense are supported by this project. The intellectual merit of a systematic plan for developing faculty technological skills and gathering appropriate curricular materials creates a program of academic and outcome skills with relevant assessment across disciplines, application of practical skills and a problem solving focus that improves both student involvement and interest in learning with effective use of technology. Project outcomes are the effective planning for a new program and learning experiences of community college faculty, coordination of interdisciplinary GIS activities, partnership development with university programs, and providing collaboration among agencies and private industry for educational resources.  The broader impact of this project includes a model project for professional and program development provided to other institutions for the integration of GIS and other technology across disciplines. Evaluation of project goals and documentation of institutional change is disseminated to state and national GIS educators providing relevant materials for planning GIS education.  Technology utilized with both asynchronous and synchronous distance learning improves technological education available to educators who prepare undergraduate and secondary school minority students and the education of technicians who drive the economy.</AbstractNarration>
