<AbstractNarration>The Workshop aims to bring together the community of researchers, from all over the world, directly interested in the subject of partially hyperbolic dynamical systems, and related topics. It may be considered a follow-up to the International Conference held at Northwestern University in May 2001, and the possibility to turn this into a periodic series, with the next edition held in Dijon, France, in 2005, is under serious consideration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2003 workshop is organized by three of the best Brazilian mathematical research centers, IMPA, the Catholic University, and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, and will be attended by some 80 mathematicians, about half of them graduate students or recent PhDs. NSF support, combined with support from the organizers, has made possible a very substantial US participation, of more than 20 graduate students and both young and senior mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topic of partial hyperbolicity emerged in the early seventies as one main direction in which the theory of complicated ("chaotic") dynamical systems has been developing and extending much beyond the classical setting of hyperbolic dynamics, driven by the realization that many practical applications of dynamical systems to experimental phenomena do require a much broader theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The whole subject went through particularly remarkable progress over the last decade or so, to become one of the most active research areas in dynamics nowadays, as certified by its strong presence in scientific meetings around the globe and, in particular, in the program of the last International Congresses of Mathematicians.</AbstractNarration>
