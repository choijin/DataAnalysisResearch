<AbstractNarration>Notre Dame's logic group strives to train graduate students and&lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral associates who have experienced many aspects of professional&lt;br/&gt;life and are full members of the community of mathematicians. In particular,&lt;br/&gt;students should develop a strong individual research agenda, have experience&lt;br/&gt;in collaborative work with a variety of faculty and students, be able to&lt;br/&gt;view their work from the perspective of mathematics as a whole, and be able&lt;br/&gt;to communicate effectively with a variety of audiences. Under this award,&lt;br/&gt;skills will be developed by  integrating junior members into research-style&lt;br/&gt;groups involving Notre Dame  faculty and visiting faculty. Travel to&lt;br/&gt;meetings and research discussions with faculty around the world will be&lt;br/&gt;facilitated to accelerate their inclusion in the community and deepen their&lt;br/&gt;perspective on their work. In many activities the  connections with other&lt;br/&gt;disciplines in mathematics and philosophy are explored, to increase the&lt;br/&gt;breadth of the participants.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
