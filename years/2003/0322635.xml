<AbstractNarration>On-line approximation based control achieves stability and accurate reference input tracking for systems with unknown nonlinear dynamics by implementing approximations to the unknown nonlinear dynamics during the operation of the system. Theoretical analysis of the conditions for stability is a prerequisite for widespread military and commercial use of on-line approximation based control systems. The fact that on-line approximation based control is being seriously considered is demonstrated, for example, by the joint Air Force and Navy Intelligent Control Initiative (PRDA 01-03-VAK) for flight control which required both on-line approximation capabilities as well as analytic guarantees of stability and performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In applications of such systems for which stability results exist, the structure of the&lt;br/&gt;approximator is fixed a priori and the parameters of the approximator are adjusted on-line. The designer must therefore over design the approximator structure to guarantee that a desired approximation accuracy is achievable for the unknown nonlinearities. Definition of the approximator structure is currently the weakest link in the design of such (stability based) on-line approximation based control systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Self-organizing on-line approximation based control defines and adapts both the approximator structure and its parameters during on-line operation. Self-organizing on-line approximation based control offers the potential for increased performance with fewer computational resources, since the on-line algorithm can optimally define the approximator structure based on the data that is measured. Although statistically based algorithms for on-line specification of the approximator structure are beginning to emerge, the theoretical understanding of the stability and performance guarantees achievable for such self-organizing systems is still in its infancy. This project will utilize methods from the fields of nonlinear control, Lyapunov-like stability analysis, and nonparametric regression to develop stability and performance guarantees for self-organizing on-line approximation based control. To aid the clear dissemination of the theoretical outcomes of this project to students and the general technical community, the new methods will be demonstrated on academic examples. To aid the transition of this technology to relevant industry groups, application case studies of, for example, aircraft or robotic control problems will be presented.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
