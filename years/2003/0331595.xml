<AbstractNarration>We plan to study a variety of free boundary problems.  The first one deals&lt;br/&gt;with growing polymeric crystallines.  The unknowns are temperature in the&lt;br/&gt;melt and the growing surface.  The speed of the free boundary is a given&lt;br/&gt;function of the temperature, and free boundary points move in such a&lt;br/&gt;direction so as to minimize the travel time.  We wish to establish the&lt;br/&gt;existence of the solution and to determine the shape of the free boundary.&lt;br/&gt;The second problem deals with non-Newtonian jets.  We want to approach it&lt;br/&gt;via nonlinear perturbation of the linearized case, a case we have recently&lt;br/&gt;studied.  The next problem is to develop a general bifurcation theory for&lt;br/&gt;free boundary problems.  Here we expect to be guided by recent work that&lt;br/&gt;we have done dealing with special models that arise in mathematical&lt;br/&gt;biology.  In order to determine the stability of the bifurcation, we shall&lt;br/&gt;first study the asymptotic behavior of solutions of free boundary&lt;br/&gt;problems, including the Hele-Shaw problem and the evolution of viscous&lt;br/&gt;drops.  Subsequently we shall consider the more complicated problems that&lt;br/&gt;arise in mathematical biology, such as the evolution of tumors and of&lt;br/&gt;protocells.  Finally, we shall study the evolution of cracks in elastic&lt;br/&gt;media.  We expect to utilize formulas that we have derived for the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of the stress intensity factors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free boundary problems deal with solving partial differential equations in&lt;br/&gt;a domain, a part of whose boundary is unknown in advance; that portion of&lt;br/&gt;the boundary is called a free boundary.  In addition to the usually&lt;br/&gt;prescribed initial and boundary conditions, an additional condition is&lt;br/&gt;imposed at the free boundary, and one seeks to determine both the free&lt;br/&gt;boundary and the solution to the differential equations.  A seemingly&lt;br/&gt;small change in the conditions imposed at the free boundary often result&lt;br/&gt;in, technically, an entirely different problem.  Special examples have&lt;br/&gt;historically guided research in this field; some of the most commonly&lt;br/&gt;known examples are flow of liquid in contact with air, air streams behind&lt;br/&gt;an aircraft, solidification of steel, and melting of solid.  Special&lt;br/&gt;examples motivated by physical models continue to be a driving force in&lt;br/&gt;the development of the field.  The present proposal focuses on several&lt;br/&gt;different problems dealing with questions such as crystallization of&lt;br/&gt;polymers, jet flows for non-Newtonian fluid (e.g. inkjets), bifurcation of&lt;br/&gt;free boundary problems arising in biology, nonlinear stability, and&lt;br/&gt;propagation of cracks in elastic media.  In all these problems, the goal&lt;br/&gt;is to prove that there is a mathematical solution to the scientific&lt;br/&gt;problem and to determine properties of the free boundary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
