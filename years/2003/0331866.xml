<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support Dr. Clarence Gifford and his colleagues will conduct one field season of archaeological research in the Pambamarca mountains of northern highland Ecuador.  The study area, which covers 195 km of mountain peaks and rugged terrain along the northeast edge of the Quito Basin, is remarkable for the density of prehispanic walled fortresses that dominate the landscape.  The goal of the research is to ascertain the extent and preservation of 15 of the prominent fortresses and to test whether certain fieldwork methods can be used in the region.  To meet these objectives, a two-month archaeological project will be conducted with the assistance of hired fieldworkers and university students from Ecuador and the U.S.  The investigators will conduct three activities at each of the fortresses: first, they will evaluate and update site plans that were prepared in 1977 from tracings of aerial photographs; second, they will collect soil samples in an attempt to locate volcanic sediments that might provide an efficient means to chronologically date fortress occupation; and third, they will conduct subsurface surveys inside each fortress using three remote sensing techniques (electrical resistivity, magnetic, and ground-penetrating radar) to determine if any of these methods are effective in detecting cultural features in the subsurface deposits at Pambamarca.  Establishing the usefulness of these methods will allow the investigators to determine the feasibility of studying the imperial encounters that took place in Pambamarca between the Inka empire and indigenous Ecuadorian societies in the Late and Inka prehispanic periods (ca. AD 1250-1532).  According to historical accounts, these encounters along what was once the northern frontier of the Inka empire were notably fierce as the Ecuadorians successfully resisted the Inkas for 17 years.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will also be valuable on a much broader level.  In cooperation with professors and archaeologists from the host country, this project will continue to provide Ecuadorian university students with the opportunity to learn and train with foreign archaeologists.  In addition, the results of this research will be included in the pending application of the Instituto Nacional de Patrimonio Cultural del Ecuador to move the Pambamarca Prehispanic Fortress Complex from the Tentative List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites to the Permanent List.  Currently, Ecuador has four Permanent World Heritage Sites: The Islas Galapagos, the Parque Nacional Sangay, Ciudad de Quito, and the Centro historico de Santa Ana de los Rios de Cuenca.  Pambamarca would be the first entry from Ecuador to highlight in particular Ecuador's important prehispanic cultural heritage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
