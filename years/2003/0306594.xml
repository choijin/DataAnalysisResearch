<AbstractNarration>DMS 0306594- PI: Christopher Connell&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GEOMETRIC RIGIDITY FOR MAPS, FOLIATIONS, AND BOUNDARY STRUCTURES OF&lt;br/&gt;NONPOSITIVELY CURVED SPACES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to establish rigidity results for manifolds, foliations, and&lt;br/&gt;quasiconformal structures associated with nonpositively curved spaces.&lt;br/&gt;There are two main components of this project.  The first is to broaden&lt;br/&gt;the scope of Mostow rigidity by giving new characterizations of locally&lt;br/&gt;symmetric spaces of noncompact type. Our proposed methods focus on&lt;br/&gt;expanding the sharp relationship between volume, entropy and the degree&lt;br/&gt;of maps initiated in its current form by work of Besson, Courtois and&lt;br/&gt;Gallot. We then wish to extend weaker forms of this relationship to spaces&lt;br/&gt;admitting nontrivial maps into nonpositively curved targets. The second&lt;br/&gt;component involves understanding the connection between quasiconformal&lt;br/&gt;structures and special geometric measures which live on the boundary of&lt;br/&gt;most Hadamard spaces. The initial steps toward this goal also play an&lt;br/&gt;important role in the first component. In the effort to establish these&lt;br/&gt;results, we aim to significantly enhance our understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;interaction between the geometry, topology and geodesic dynamics of such&lt;br/&gt;spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on a long standing principle, researchers have come to expect that&lt;br/&gt;the most efficient solutions to analytic problems are often achieved by&lt;br/&gt;those objects which have the most symmetry.  For instance, the modern&lt;br/&gt;version of a conjecture by Pappus of Alexandria asserts that the circle is&lt;br/&gt;"rigid:" any other curve enclosing a region of the plane with the same area&lt;br/&gt;must have longer length than the circle. This was finally proved in 1841.&lt;br/&gt;In higher dimensions, the analogous result turns out to be true for the&lt;br/&gt;spheres of constant positive curvature. We can ask related questions about&lt;br/&gt;nonpositively curved spaces; these have the property that the sum of the&lt;br/&gt;angles of any small triangle does not exceed 180 degrees. We propose to&lt;br/&gt;show that most nonpositively curved spaces with a sufficient amount of&lt;br/&gt;symmetry exhibit similar rigid behavior, but of a more intrinsic nature.&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, we expect many nonpositively curved spaces which are not&lt;br/&gt;symmetric to also exhibit a sort of weak rigidity. From such results, we&lt;br/&gt;can partly determine the rough shape of many asymmetrical spaces,&lt;br/&gt;regardless of curvature, and even draw some purely algebraic conclusions&lt;br/&gt;related to their underlying structure. This naturally leads to dynamical&lt;br/&gt;information arising, for instance, from the physical interpretation of&lt;br/&gt;these objects as phase spaces.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
