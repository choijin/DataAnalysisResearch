<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0306628&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Huai-Dong Cao and Jon T. Pitts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has been held spring&lt;br/&gt;and fall since its founding in 1989, a total of 28 times.  The&lt;br/&gt;conference has become an extremely successful semiannual event in&lt;br/&gt;the Southwest. The next series of conferences will have six&lt;br/&gt;primary sponsoring universities: The University of Texas at&lt;br/&gt;Austin, Texas A&amp;M University, Rice University, the University of&lt;br/&gt;Houston, Texas Tech University, and Texas Christian&lt;br/&gt;University. The conference is designed to enhance both the&lt;br/&gt;educational and the research atmosphere of the growing community&lt;br/&gt;of Texas geometers and topologists.  The conference is committed&lt;br/&gt;to bring researchers of national and international stature to&lt;br/&gt;Texas to discuss their research and to interact with&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians from Texas and surrounding states.  Summaries of&lt;br/&gt;talks with notation of important results have been reported&lt;br/&gt;annually for some time and will continue similarly in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By design, the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has two&lt;br/&gt;high-impact foci.  First, the conference makes it possible for&lt;br/&gt;the community of geometers and topologists from Texas and&lt;br/&gt;surrounding states (a huge geographic region) to meet and share&lt;br/&gt;mathematics on a regular basis, which both stimulates individual&lt;br/&gt;research and generates productive cooperative efforts between&lt;br/&gt;schools.  Second, the conference is committed to the&lt;br/&gt;strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base.&lt;br/&gt;In order that there be no barrier to participation, the&lt;br/&gt;conference is widely advertised, participation is open, and there&lt;br/&gt;are no registration fees.  Graduate students, junior faculty,&lt;br/&gt;women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially&lt;br/&gt;encouraged to participate and to apply for support.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
