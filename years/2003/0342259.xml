<AbstractNarration>The term \emph{peer-to-peer}(P2P) came to the force very publicly&lt;br/&gt; with the rise and fall of Napster.&lt;br/&gt;Although there are prior systems in this evolutionary phase of distributed computing,&lt;br/&gt; P2P system first emerges as a significant social and technical phenomenon right after the&lt;br/&gt; deployment of Napster.&lt;br/&gt;Currently most of popular P2P systems are  aiming at the file sharing applications,&lt;br/&gt; where files are stored at some end-users' machines rather than at a central&lt;br/&gt; server in the traditional client/server model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wireless ad hoc networking is just a special case of P2P networking, where&lt;br/&gt; no infrastructure or celluar networking is needed for communication.&lt;br/&gt;Recent years saw a great amount of research &lt;br/&gt; in wireless ad hoc networks. These&lt;br/&gt;works involve a number of theoretical aspects of computer science, including&lt;br/&gt;approximation algorithms, computational geometry, combinatorics, distributed&lt;br/&gt;algorithms. However, there are still many challenges in wireless ad hoc&lt;br/&gt;networks. Due to the limited capability of processing power, storage, and&lt;br/&gt;energy supply,  many conventional algorithms are too complicated to be&lt;br/&gt;implemented in a wireless ad hoc networks. Some other algorithms did not take&lt;br/&gt;advantage of the geometry nature of the wireless networks. Additionally, most&lt;br/&gt;of the currently developed algorithms for wireless networks assumed a precise&lt;br/&gt;position of each wireless node, which is impossible practically. Majority of&lt;br/&gt;the algorithms developed in this area also assume all nodes have uniform&lt;br/&gt;transmission range. These algorithms will likely fail when nodes have&lt;br/&gt;disparity transmission ranges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, the wireless ad hoc networks requires efficient distributed&lt;br/&gt;algorithms with low computation complexity and low communication complexity.&lt;br/&gt;These algorithms are expected to take advantage of the geometry nature of the&lt;br/&gt;wireless ad hoc networks. Several fundamental questions should be answered:&lt;br/&gt;can we improve the performance of traditional distributed algorithms under&lt;br/&gt;wireless ad hoc networks? Does the position information of wireless nodes make&lt;br/&gt;difference in algorithms' performance?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to organize a workshop to solicit the recent research efforts on&lt;br/&gt;addressing these challenges. Specific topics include but are not limited to&lt;br/&gt;the following issues:&lt;br/&gt;Deployment for Connectivity,&lt;br/&gt;Deployment for Coverage, &lt;br/&gt; Throughput,&lt;br/&gt;Mobility,&lt;br/&gt;Channel Assignment,&lt;br/&gt;Power/Topology Control,&lt;br/&gt;Localized Routing,&lt;br/&gt;Cooperation Enforcement and Mechanism Design,&lt;br/&gt;Security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of junior faculty and graduate students from both domestic and&lt;br/&gt;international have been actively working on addressing some of these&lt;br/&gt;challenges. They will be the main component of potential attendees of this workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is intended to bring together researchers in mobile computing and&lt;br/&gt;distributed algorithms to foster cooperation. It is intended to be a lively&lt;br/&gt;meeting, covering many of the algorithmic and discrete aspects of this field&lt;br/&gt;going from operations research to radio engineering problems. It aims, in&lt;br/&gt;particular, at fostering the cooperation among practitioners and theoreticians&lt;br/&gt;of the field. We plan to hold this workshop on June 2nd, 2004 at Chicago,&lt;br/&gt;Illinois. Workshop papers will be published in workshop proceedings and&lt;br/&gt;selected papers will be published in a special issue of a journal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By organizing the workshop on the theoretic aspects of wireless ad hoc networks&lt;br/&gt; that addresses the a number of challenge and fundamental problems.&lt;br/&gt;The potential attendees of the workshop will be junior faculty and senir PhD students&lt;br/&gt; who had been actively working in the theoretic aspects of wireless ad hoc networks.&lt;br/&gt;Thus, a successful workshop will initiate more junior faculty and PhD students&lt;br/&gt; in the research of this area.&lt;br/&gt;Our own experiences in working with PhD students has been excellent.&lt;br/&gt;Our currently supported Ph.D. students have already&lt;br/&gt; contributed to considerable number of papers published in major theoretical&lt;br/&gt; and/or networking conferences.&lt;br/&gt;Exposure to this workshop organized by National Science Foundation will &lt;br/&gt; increase their productivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the proposed research activities involve  theoretical understanding&lt;br/&gt; and solving of practical questions from wireless networking,&lt;br/&gt; the proposed workshop will foster collaborations with faculties &lt;br/&gt; from other discipline,&lt;br/&gt; some researchers from industry to verify the developed theoretical methods in a&lt;br/&gt; more practical settings to see its practical performance.&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, since ad hoc networks support applications&lt;br/&gt; related to disaster relief, public event coordination, and military and &lt;br/&gt; law enforcement operations,&lt;br/&gt; the proposed research has vast societal impact.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
