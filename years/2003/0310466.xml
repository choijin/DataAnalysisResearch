<AbstractNarration>Complexity theory addresses the question of how much resource &lt;br/&gt;is needed to solve a given computational problem.  In recent &lt;br/&gt;years complexity theory has found connections and applications &lt;br/&gt;in many scientific and engineering disciplines.  This project &lt;br/&gt;plans to investigate complexity theory across a broad front.  &lt;br/&gt;The topics include communication complexity, decision trees, &lt;br/&gt;quantum algorithms, quantum cryptography, and other foundational &lt;br/&gt;issues in complexity theory.  Te goal is to gain deep insights &lt;br/&gt;into the nature of computation, so that one can most effectively &lt;br/&gt;perform computational tasks in any model.  It is expected that &lt;br/&gt;a variety of algebraic and combinatorial techniques will be &lt;br/&gt;called upon to explore these topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two of the most interesting scientific developments in recent years &lt;br/&gt;spring from the realization that complexity theory can be utilized &lt;br/&gt;for cryptography, and that quantum mechanics can be used for &lt;br/&gt;performing powerful computation.  Advances in these fronts have &lt;br/&gt;attracted interest from scientific communities at large, &lt;br/&gt;as their relevance is far-reaching.  The research of this project &lt;br/&gt;could lead to substantial further progress in these two areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the broader domain of public education, the Principal Investigator &lt;br/&gt;has given many speeches in recent years on various topics on &lt;br/&gt;complexity, cryptography and quantum computing.  Many of these talks &lt;br/&gt;are geared toward general audiences and often undergraduate students.  &lt;br/&gt;These lectures, if thoughtfully designed, can stimulate the &lt;br/&gt;intellectual curiosity of young minds and develop their interest &lt;br/&gt;in the computing sciences.  With further advances of research in &lt;br/&gt;these areas, one can expect that public awareness and interest &lt;br/&gt;will be further enhanced to the good of a stronger scientific education.</AbstractNarration>
