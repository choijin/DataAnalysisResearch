<AbstractNarration>0318547&lt;br/&gt;Faloutsos&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a two-year international collaborative research project.  The principal investigator for the project is Professor Christos Faloutsos at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and the Japanese collaborator is Hiroyuki Kitagawa at the University of Tsukuba in Japan.  They will be undertaking research on a data mining-based approach to semantic integration of stream data.  Recent progress of high-speed network, mobile communication, and low-cost sensor device technologies permit the continuous collection of stream data such as temperatures, stock prices and news feeds.  Stream data can be acquired from various sources, for example, sensors, cameras and information dissemination servers such as news delivery channels.  The goal of the research is to find patterns and outliers and strange behavior, such as - these temperatures are abnormally high given the respective humidities.  One of the problems in stream data is event detection.  They hope to develop data mining techniques to extract events and metadata automatically and efficiently, by analyzing the given streams.  They also propose to develop event-driven data integration techniques to take appropriate actions (e.g., issue alerts) according to the events detected.  They further hope to develop stream classification methods and data integration methods to merge stream information with traditional information sources such as relational databases.  Finally they plan to implement all of the above tools in a prototype system with a visual interface.       &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project brings together the efforts of two groups that have complementary expertise and research capabilities.  These joint efforts should have a positive impact in many areas such as (1) civil infrastructure - sensors on bridges and highways measuring wear and tear, number of cars and road conditions;  (2) military applications - with smart cheap sensors measuring ground and air conditions;  (3) environmental applications - with sensors measuring water and air pollution and contamination levels.  The project advances international human resources through the participation of graduate students.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  Results of the research will be disseminated at scientific meetings and in scientific journals.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
