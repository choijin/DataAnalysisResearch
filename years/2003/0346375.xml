<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to improve battery materials for use in lithium and lithium ion cells useful for a number of applications areas such as those in which high energy density, cell voltage and charge retention are critical. One aim is to develop composite solid electrolyte membranes useful for advanced lithium battery technology. Prototype lithium/water batteries will be built and tested with the goal of developing batteries with multiyear service lives. The composite electrolyte membranes will be applicable in other solid state lithium battery designs, and have superior processability. In addition to the development of composite electrolytes, the efficacy of certain nanomaterials such as solid electrolyte interphase stabilizers for the positive electrodes of lithium-ion batteries will be investigated. Success in this project would greatly enhance the service life of lithium-ion batteries, especially important in, for example, satellite communications, sensing and monitoring. The proposed research will train graduate and undergraduate students, including underrepresented minorities, in a multidisciplinary field of national importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Batteries play a crucial role in national security by providing power for many of the devices in service today and those anticipated in the future. Lithium and lithium ion cells are useful for number of these current and anticipated applications due to their high storage capacity, light-weight and long life. For example, prototype lithium/water batteries will be built and tested with the goal of developing batteries with multiyear service lives for oceanic applications.  The technology developed will then be extended to other advanced battery designs such as lithium/air. In addition to the development of advanced lithium batteries, nanomaterial additives to the positive electrodes of lithium-ion batteries will be investigated. The proposed research will train graduate and undergraduate students, including underrepresented minorities, in a multidisciplinary field of critical national importance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
