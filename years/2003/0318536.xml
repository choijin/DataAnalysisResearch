    <AbstractNarration>0318536&lt;br/&gt;Beckham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award is to support a cooperative research project between Dr. Haskel Beckham, Department of Textile and Fiber Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia and Dr. Mohamed A. Sharaf, Department of Chemistry, Helwan University, Helwan, Egypt. Nanoscopic-filler-reinforced polymer composites will be prepared for solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) investigation of the molecular structure and dynamics within the filler-polymer interphase. Polymers reinforced with nanometer-sized filler particles exhibit significantly enhanced strength compared to those reinforced with micrometer-sized fillers. Due to the small particle size, the interfacial volume is sufficiently high that advanced solid-state NMR techniques may be used for in situ studies. Silica particles will be prepared with controlled size and surface treatment for incorporation into a noncrystalline matrix of poly (dimethylsiloxane) and also into a semicrystalline matrix of poly (ethylene). The surface treatment will modify the intrinsically hydrophilic silica surface to varying degrees of hydrophobicity and compatibility with each of the two matrix polymers. Solid-state NMR will be used to examine the interfacial molecular structure and dynamics. The nanocomposites will also be characterized by microscopic methods and by mechanical testing methods. The results from this project will allow construction of molecular structure/property relationships in nanofilled polymer composites. Such relationships can be used to improve properties of existing materials (e.g., tires), and the design of new filler reinforced materials for novel applications (e.g., high-strength fibers in transportation or architecture). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This proposal deals with an important and current issue as the role of the interface in filler reinforcement is of interest to the elastomer and nanocomposite communities. There are many potential applications for polymers filled with nanoparticles. The facilities at both Georgia Tech. And Helwan University are adequate for conducting the proposed research and, through their collaboration, the investigators have the ability to prepare and study novel materials. The facilities and expertise to use solid state NMR are present at Georgia Tech. The research involves a very fundamental approach to the study of polymer dynamics but the PIs are knowledgeable in the technological aspects of the materials. The project will foster scientific collaboration between the US and Egypt. U.S. students will have roles in this project, and will further their preparation to be independent scientists. The project should result in well-trained, multi-disciplinary, students. This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.</AbstractNarration>
