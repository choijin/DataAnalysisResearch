    <AbstractNarration>This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project involves measurements of aerosol black carbon on a particle-by-particle basis using the Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) during the Coastal STratocumulus Imposed Perturbation Experiment (CSTRIPE). Airborne measurements for CSTRIPE will be made from the Office of Naval Research Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Studies (ONR/CIRPAS) Twin Otter research aircraft over three weeks in July 2003 off the coast of Monterey, California. Flights will also be performed over the heavily polluted San Joaquin Valley, California continental area to examine black carbon emanating from smoke and urban/industrial plumes. Particulate black carbon is highly absorptive, and suspected to be a major determinant of the radiative forcing due to haze and cloud layers. Results will improve our understanding of the microphysical and optical properties of transported aerosol layers and their influence on climate. Broader impacts of this project include a unique and interesting data set available to a wide range of researchers interested in the impact of highly absorbing black carbon on the radiative properties of aerosols and clouds, with potentially far-reaching implications for climate. The project also involves collaborations with researchers at private and public academic institutions in the U.S and Mexico, including hands-on graduate student participation.</AbstractNarration>
