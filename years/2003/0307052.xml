<AbstractNarration>AST 0307052&lt;br/&gt;Lang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Cornelia Lang will carry out an extensive observational program to investigate the astrophysics of the violent interstellar medium in the central regions of the Milky Way galaxy. The goal&lt;br/&gt;of this program is to use both recent and proposed multi-wavelength observations of the central&lt;br/&gt;200 pc of the Galaxy to put together a more complete picture of the interstellar processes in this&lt;br/&gt;physically-extreme region. In particular, she will (1) elucidate the complex physical arrangement&lt;br/&gt;and associations of stellar and interstellar components in the Galactic Center using a combination&lt;br/&gt;of high-resolution, atomic hydrogen absorption data from the Very Large Array and existing multi-&lt;br/&gt;wavelength datasets. (2) Secondly, she will investigate the relationship of the magnetic field in&lt;br/&gt;the Galactic Center to the diffuse interstellar components (e.g. ionized, molecular and very hot&lt;br/&gt;gas) and the role it plays in the transport of energy out of the nucleus using existing and future&lt;br/&gt;radio polarimetric and X-ray datasets. Comparisons between the magnetized and other interstellar&lt;br/&gt;components are crucial to determining the physical processes at work in this environment. The&lt;br/&gt;level of detail that can be observed in the central few hundred parsecs of the Galaxy vastly&lt;br/&gt;exceeds the resolution with which one can probe the nuclear regions of other galaxies. Ultimately,&lt;br/&gt;this type of investigation of the violent processes occurring in our own Galactic Center will provide&lt;br/&gt;insight as to the nature of violent processes occurring in the nuclear regions of other galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a key aspect of the research program, Dr. Lang will be working with the Women&lt;br/&gt;in Science and Engineering (WISE) program at the University of Iowa to involve traditionally&lt;br/&gt;under-represented female physics and astronomy students (both undergraduate and graduate) in&lt;br/&gt;an active research collaboration. In addition to carrying out the proposed observations and analysis&lt;br/&gt;of Galactic Center data, Dr. Lang and her students will create a web-based, multi-wavelength&lt;br/&gt;Galactic Center resource for members of the scientific community, teachers of all levels, and the&lt;br/&gt;general public.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
