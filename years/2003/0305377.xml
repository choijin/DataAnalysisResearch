<AbstractNarration>This project will exploit techniques recently developed by the PI at Clemson University for the efficient, high throughput investigation of new solids from high temperature hydrothermal solutions (up to 600 degrees C, and 3 kbar). These reactions often lead to high quality single crystals of new compounds that are otherwise difficult or impossible to prepare by any other technique. Many of these materials have very interesting optoelectronic properties. Specific emphasis will be placed in compounds crystallizing in acentric or polar space groups. The chemistry of metal complexes of several interesting oxyanion building blocks will be investigated, including borates, germanates and vanadates. New metal fluoride will also be investigated as well as several new fluoride-based building blocks such as BeF42- that show exceptional promise as reagents for new wide bandgap acentric solids. This work has substantial impact in terms of training of students particularly in specialty crystal growth. The growth of device quality crystals induces students to become involved with numerous collaborators, especially in industrial labs, using their new materials in real applications. This allows students to confront many of the issues they will face in their professional careers. This work has already led to the development of several short courses and tutorials, such as one for the NSF Solid State Chemistry Undergraduate Summer Program. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Many of these high quality crystals of new compounds have very interesting optical properties and can be used in next generation lasers, high-density data storage and high-speed optical communication. The technique mimics the methods used by nature to grow gems such as rubies and emeralds. This work has substantial impact in terms of training of students particularly in specialty crystal growth, a subject that is almost ignored in US university chemical curricula. It also induces students to become involved with numerous collaborators, especially in industrial labs, using their new materials in real world applications. This intimate exposure to real world industrial applications forces the students to develop the kinds of team oriented problem solving they will confront in their professional life. The development of several short courses and tutorials, such as one for the NSF Solid State Undergraduate Summer Program is having significant impact in meeting educational needs by providing new curricula. This project is jointly supported by the Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials Research.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
