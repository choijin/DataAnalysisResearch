    <AbstractNarration>0339459&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase I research project proposes to develop a new class of self-sensing composites. Self-sensing, self-monitoring composites will be engineered materials with embedded networks of miniaturized transducing and sensing elements, judiciously integrated within reinforcement morphology of a composite,&lt;br/&gt;that will acquire, process, and even respond to information crucial for determining the state of&lt;br/&gt;structural health. The goal of Phase I is to fabricate a proof-of-concept self-sensing composite without&lt;br/&gt;significantly diminishing its overall structural integrity. This will be addressed by developing&lt;br/&gt;techniques for integrating sensors, electronics and connecting elements within the braids of a&lt;br/&gt;typical fiber-based composite. All electronic components must be able to withstand typical&lt;br/&gt;processing techniques, including the moderately high temperatures and pressures. A composite&lt;br/&gt;with an embedded sensor network, interconnects, data acquisition and local processing will be&lt;br/&gt;fabricated. Its structural properties will be compared with conventional composite of the same&lt;br/&gt;composition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We anticipate that this work will result in development of self-monitoring composite materials. These composites will be capable of acquiring and processing information related to its structural health and responding to this information by self-correcting its behavior if needed. Self-monitoring capabilities will result in more efficient higher performance, tighter and more precise specifications for composite structures and greater flexibility in composite design. Adding self-sensing functionality to existing composites offers a unique means of improving structural performance without additional demands on mechanical properties. It will also enable wider use of composites in the remote, inaccessible and hazardous environments where conventional NDE is difficult or impossible to perform in real time. The real time monitoring capabilities will improve safety in the mission-critical composite application areas. The proposed research is expected to have a significant impact on structural and environmental engineering.</AbstractNarration>
