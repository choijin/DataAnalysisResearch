<AbstractNarration>DMS-0308985&lt;br/&gt;Grigorchuk, Rostislav&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Algebraic, Geometric, and Asymptotic Properties of Branch Groups&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on properties of branch groups.&lt;br/&gt;Branch groups are abstract mathematical objects that play an important &lt;br/&gt;role in solving major problems on the intersection of different parts of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics, such as Algebra, Number Theory, Analysis, Geometry and &lt;br/&gt;Probability Theory. The proposer will study these groups and their relation &lt;br/&gt;to a number of  important and long-standing problems in modern mathematics, &lt;br/&gt;such as the Burnside and Milnor Problems in Group Theory, Atiyah &lt;br/&gt;Conjecture in Topology, Kadison-Kaplansky Conjecture in Functional Analysis. &lt;br/&gt;The results obtained in this project have useful applications in Cybernetics &lt;br/&gt;and Computer Science, as well as Cryptography and Theory of Algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorial Group Theory is one of the most rapidly developing parts &lt;br/&gt;of modern mathematics. Starting with works by Poincare and Klein this &lt;br/&gt;area received contribution from some of the most prominent &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians of the twentieth century, such as von Neumann, Milnor and &lt;br/&gt;others. In recent decades Combinatorial Group Theory became an object of &lt;br/&gt;especially intensive research due to newly found connections with &lt;br/&gt;Statistical Physics, Quantum Chaos Theory and Computer Science. New &lt;br/&gt;promising directions of mathematical research have been developped, one &lt;br/&gt;of them being the theory of branch groups. This theory has strong &lt;br/&gt;connections to several mainstream open problems in modern mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;Tremendous progress acheived in recent years indicates that the &lt;br/&gt;exploration of these connections leads to most fruitful ideas and results.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
