<AbstractNarration>This research investigates a new method of assessing predicted performance&lt;br/&gt;characteristics of Object-Oriented software architectures. As scenarios&lt;br/&gt;represent the anticipated runtime behavior of a system, they can be used at&lt;br/&gt;a very early stage in the design to quantitatively predict aspects of that&lt;br/&gt;behavior. The proposed approach can be applied earlier than other existing&lt;br/&gt;methods such as simulations and executable designs, and does not require&lt;br/&gt;special analytical skills.  Early assessment is an important risk mitigation&lt;br/&gt;technique, that can contribute significantly to the task of building a&lt;br/&gt;distributed system with a greater degree of confidence in its ability to&lt;br/&gt;perform as required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research involves formally defining a set of scenario-based metrics and&lt;br/&gt;a corresponding system-wide dynamic metrics model.  A strongly typed&lt;br/&gt;traceability scheme is defined to support the definition and automated&lt;br/&gt;querying of relationships between performance requirements, scenarios, and&lt;br/&gt;architectural components.  Scenario invocation rates are specified within&lt;br/&gt;the context of typical usage patterns, and the relationship between&lt;br/&gt;scenarios is investigated to determine when performance requirements should&lt;br/&gt;be propagated from one scenario to another.  A supporting tool is developed&lt;br/&gt;and used to capture metrics and validate them against runtime and simulation&lt;br/&gt;measurements taken from a variety of distributed systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
