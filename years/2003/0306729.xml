    <AbstractNarration>This collaborative effort addresses two closure problems arising&lt;br/&gt;in fluid systems: the description of turbulent energy transfer&lt;br/&gt;through a large number of wave modes, and the determination of the&lt;br/&gt;amount of mixing at internal breaking waves in a stratified&lt;br/&gt;environment. The methodology proposed includes the asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;reduction of complex partial differential equations to simpler&lt;br/&gt;systems, the numerical simulation of dynamic equations, the&lt;br/&gt;critical analysis of physical principles, and the comparison of&lt;br/&gt;theory and computations with physical laboratory experiments. We&lt;br/&gt;anticipate that the work will yield both physical insights and&lt;br/&gt;interesting new mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turbulent energy transfer, dissipation and mixing are key&lt;br/&gt;processes in fluid dynamical problems ranging from the wind&lt;br/&gt;generation of water waves to climate dynamics. Ocean mixing ultimately&lt;br/&gt;determines the sea--surface temperature, which, in turn, affects&lt;br/&gt;atmospheric winds, temperature and humidity. Mixing by upward propagating&lt;br/&gt;breaking waves is known to play a significant role in the exchange of&lt;br/&gt;momentum between the lower and the upper layers of the atmosphere. In the&lt;br/&gt;ocean, turbulent wave action is responsible for the transfer of energy from&lt;br/&gt;the very large scales of storms to the small scales at which&lt;br/&gt;dissipation takes place. It is expected that the research proposed&lt;br/&gt;here will contribute to the understanding of fundamental physical&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms behind these important phenomena, and hence improve&lt;br/&gt;our capability to predict and quantify climate changes.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will also have a strong educational impact, through&lt;br/&gt;the training of graduate students, the development of a research seminar&lt;br/&gt;for undergraduate students, the teaching of challenging undergraduate classes,&lt;br/&gt;and by having undergraduate students participate in summer projects focused on&lt;br/&gt;the research.</AbstractNarration>
