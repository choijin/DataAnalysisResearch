<AbstractNarration>In this theoretical project, the principal investigator (PI) will study the dynamics of low-dimensional systems, including the dynamics of tunneling in time-dependent fields with and without noise and static random fields, the dynamics of hysteresis in the AC field, the dynamics of creation and annihilation of topological excitations such as skyrmions and bubble domains.  The PI will also extend his study of the heterogeneous ferromagnetic-superconducting systems to their transport properties and nucleation of new phases.  Also to be investigated is a new class of coherent phenomena appearing in anisotropic superconductors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These theoretical studies relate to a broad variety of physical systems: nanomagnets, magnetic dots and rings, thin magnetic films and wires, ferromagnetic-superconducting bilayers and multilayers, narrow thin stripes of anisotropic superconductors.  For all of these new physical phenomena are indicated that can be used in technology for creation of nano-scale digits in magnetic memory or elements of fast-acting electronics regulated by relatively weak magnetic fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the research has a more general character, specifically, the part related to tunneling processes and to hysteresis dynamics.  They relate to a much wider class of physical phenomena including chemical and biological reactions, electronic transitions at atomic and molecular collisions and surface phase transitions.  Research will be conducted in collaboration with experimental and theoretical groups throughout the USA and the world.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical research will be conducted on a variety of systems and phenomena that have both fundamental and applied aspects.  The common theme of these studies is their  dynamics, or behavior when driven by an external force.  Applications include various types of nano-scale magnetic configurations.&lt;br/&gt;***  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
