<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Modern engineering systems are very complex and comprise a high number of interconnected&lt;br/&gt;sub-components which, thanks to the remarkable development of communications and electronics,&lt;br/&gt;can be spread over broad areas and linked through data networks. The control of those complex sys-&lt;br/&gt;tems can only be achieved in a decentralized mode, by appropriately designing local controllers for&lt;br/&gt;each individual component or small group of components. Control and computational capabilities&lt;br/&gt;being distributed over the system, a steady exchange of data among the components is required, in&lt;br/&gt;order for the system to behave properly. While control, information theory and communication are&lt;br/&gt;to some extent mature disciplines, little effort has been put so far in understanding how issues in&lt;br/&gt;information theory and communication constraints affect the performance of a large-scale control&lt;br/&gt;system distributed over a communication network. The simplest case in which this situation may&lt;br/&gt;occur is when the control functions are performed by a local (decentralized) controller, situated at&lt;br/&gt;the same physical location of the controlled plant, and by a remote (centralized) controller, situated&lt;br/&gt;at a different location.&lt;br/&gt;Typical, in this scenario, is the situation in which a subsystem is required to perform a task&lt;br/&gt;which depends on the state of a system residing at a remote physical location. In this case, the&lt;br/&gt;local controller must embed some mechanism of prediction of the tasks to be performed which,&lt;br/&gt;depending on the states of remote subsystems, may be quite uncertain. The ability of successfully&lt;br/&gt;handle large uncertainties is one of the main, if not the single most important, reasons of being of&lt;br/&gt;automatic control. Little attention, though, has been paid so far to the fact that uncertainties may&lt;br/&gt;also affect the task that the control system is asked to accomplish. One of the main intellectual&lt;br/&gt;purposes of the proposed research activity is to show how problems in which control tasks are&lt;br/&gt;uncertain can be successfully addresses by embedding, into the controller itself, a tunable internal&lt;br/&gt;model of the systems on which the tasks to be performed may depend. The other main intellectual&lt;br/&gt;purpose is to show how this design philosophy is particularly suited to the control of large complex&lt;br/&gt;systems distributed over communication networks. In fact, the role of an internal model is that&lt;br/&gt;of generating, in real time, the precise feed-forward input which would be required to perform the&lt;br/&gt;actual control task. If the local controller contains an internal model of those tasks, the role of the&lt;br/&gt;remote controller would only be that of resetting (once in a while, possibly using little amount of&lt;br/&gt;information) the state of the internal model on the basis of the actual value of the regulated variable.&lt;br/&gt;This would provide a design philosophy which would much better cope with restrictions typical of&lt;br/&gt;a control system distributed over a communication network, such as bandwidth constraints, delays,&lt;br/&gt;loss of packets.&lt;br/&gt;Progresses in internal-model-based control design are expected to have a broad impact in var-&lt;br/&gt;ious areas of control technology. Experimental results have already shown, for instance, how self&lt;br/&gt;a tuned internal-model-based controller can automatically compensate for faults occurring in a ro-&lt;br/&gt;tating electrical machine, and the benefits which may derive to manufacturing industry from this&lt;br/&gt;specific application are quite clear. Another broad area of interest is that of satellite control for&lt;br/&gt;telecommunications. Typical problems occurring in this area are to have a communication satellite&lt;br/&gt;tracking a smaller, beacon satellite at a fixed distance in a circular orbit, or to have networks of&lt;br/&gt;small satellites ying in coordinated motion. Another application, in which preliminary simulations&lt;br/&gt;have shown impressive results, is the design of an autopilot to assist the landing of a rescue heli-&lt;br/&gt;copter on a ship in distress in high seas. Similar applications are automatic ship loading/unloading&lt;br/&gt;in adverse atmospheric conditions or remote control of submarine vehicles for automatic undersea&lt;br/&gt;cable or pipeline inspection.</AbstractNarration>
