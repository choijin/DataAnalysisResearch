<AbstractNarration>The College of Engineering and Applied Sciences (CEAS) and the College of Education (COE), Western Michigan University (WMU), were awarded a planning grant from the NSF Bridges for Engineering Education program in August 2002 to build collaboration between the two colleges.  This proposal leverages this partnership to create a Design Center for K-12 Mathematics and Science Learning for CEAS and COE students to continue collaboration throughout the four years of undergraduate learning.  Students will experience professional practice in design, teamwork, communication, and leadership skills, and will produce exemplary instructional "hardware" and "software" to support the needs and specifications of K-12 mathematics and science teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center will provide a structure and an environment for engineering and technology students to develop and grow through design courses.  The collaborative activities between students and faculty from CEAS and COE will result in a Center that supports K-12 teachers and WMU pre-service education students to bring the excitement of engineering and technology into teaching mathematics and science.  By exposing engineering and technology students early in the first year to the joys of creation through design and hands-on experimentation in ENGR 101, and a summer design institute for high-school juniors, they can be recruited and retained in the programs. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The community service nature of the Center will motivate students, particularly females and ethnic minorities, to remain in engineering and technology.  About 51% of Kalamazoo Public Schools students are ethnic minorities, who are traditionally underrepresented in the study of college-level mathematics, science, and engineering disciplines.  Two of the project service sites are the Boys and Girls Club and the Northeast Academy, a charter school serving primarily students from low-income families.  About 400 WMU students per year participate in volunteer activities through the Student Volunteers Office, with 50% coming from the COE.  The Center can add value to the services of these education student volunteers by partnering them with engineering students to develop and implement after-school activities at these two sites to stimulate interest in mathematics and sciences.   This project will also initiate new collaborations between WMU faculty, students, and the local community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
