<AbstractNarration>This proposal is to plan for a new multi-university I/UCRC that aims to promote a research program of interest to both industry and universities on technologies for wireless internet. This new multi-university center will be able to have a broad impact on the industry through having its existing resources enhanced by the addition of the partner that is also being recommended to receive a planning grant.  The two partners are this University and Polytechnic University of New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center's goal is to work on two overlapping  categories: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Information delivery focussing on software development, addressing security and robustness, and&lt;br/&gt;- Data transmission related to management of radio resources and the management of competition and cooperation between  different technologies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal deals with an area of significant need and by assembling the two institutions into one research team, the breadth and depth is enhanced &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
