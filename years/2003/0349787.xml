    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop a new, low-cost methods for direct fabrication of metal parts at near-net shapes (NNS). This technology is critical for many industries and in particular, for manufacturing parts of expensive metals and alloys such as titanium. Such technologies have an impact on many industries because of the potential to quickly manufacture complicated parts with minimal waste. Currently used methods typically involve melting and solidification, which can cause high residual stresses, undesirable phases, and other problems. To solve the problems described a new method for spray forming is being used. This method is based on using the cold spray process avoiding undesired material, chemistry, and phase properties associated with thermal spray-forming methods. Studies conducted during Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of the cold spray process for rapid prototyping and direct fabrication of spray form shapes of Titanium alloys. The anticipated result of this activity is to deliver a technology yielding superior material properties of sprayed material and reduce cost of manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of cold spraying near net-shapes technology could be very important technology for aerospace, including aircraft, military aircraft and spacecraft. This technology is promising for many other industries including automotive, medical, power, chemical, sport goods, and others. The proposed research activity will enhance scientific and technological understanding of the spray processes based on using high-speed particle flow.</AbstractNarration>
