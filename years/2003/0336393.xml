<AbstractNarration>During the Fall semester of 2003 the Mathematical Sciences Research&lt;br/&gt;Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, California will sponsor a special program in&lt;br/&gt;Discrete and Computational Geometry. The organizers for this semester-long&lt;br/&gt;program are Jesus De Loera (University of California at Davis), Herbert&lt;br/&gt;Edelsbrunner (Duke University), Jacob E. Goodman (City University of New&lt;br/&gt;York), Janos Pach (New York University), Micha Sharir (Tel Aviv&lt;br/&gt;University), Emo Welzl (ETH Zuerich), and Guenter Ziegler (Technische&lt;br/&gt;Universitaet Berlin). The program will have many activities, including&lt;br/&gt;public lectures, research for undergraduates, mini-courses, weekly&lt;br/&gt;seminars, and three workshops. This award provides funding to help cover&lt;br/&gt;lodging and travel expenses for participants in the workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Introductory Workshop is designed to introduce a broad range of&lt;br/&gt;computer scientists, mathematicians, scientists working in related fields,&lt;br/&gt;and others interested in the topics of the program to current research in&lt;br/&gt;these areas. The second workshop, on Mathematical Foundations of Geometric&lt;br/&gt;Algorithms, is intended more as a forum for researchers in computer&lt;br/&gt;science and mathematics to discuss their recent work with other active&lt;br/&gt;researchers. This workshop will focus on the design and analysis of&lt;br/&gt;geometric algorithms, and on the mathematical and algorithmic techniques&lt;br/&gt;needed to make these algorithms efficient. The third workshop, on&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorial and Discrete Geometry, will study discrete geometric objects&lt;br/&gt;(polyhedra, geometric graphs, sphere packings, tilings, lattices, and so&lt;br/&gt;forth) and their combinatorial structure, stressing the connections&lt;br/&gt;between discrete geometry and algebra, combinatorics, and topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Introductory Workshop in particular will extend the impact of the&lt;br/&gt;program well beyond the core of recognized researchers in this particular&lt;br/&gt;area. MSRI's Human Resources Advisory Committee established the&lt;br/&gt;introductory workshops in 1992 as a vehicle for making the material of&lt;br/&gt;MSRI's major programs available to a broad scientific audience,&lt;br/&gt;particularly women and minorities who are still much too underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;in the scientific enterprise. Through outreach activities such as a&lt;br/&gt;special weekend on geometry at Howard University in September 2002, MSRI&lt;br/&gt;has recruited participants from underrepresented groups to participate in&lt;br/&gt;its 2003-04 programs and particularly the introductory workshops, and will&lt;br/&gt;work with these participants to help make the material of the workshops&lt;br/&gt;useful for their endeavors at their home institutions. The PI and co-PI&lt;br/&gt;for this grant have already recruited several participants for these&lt;br/&gt;workshops who are from historically Black colleges and universities, and&lt;br/&gt;who have expressed a strong interest in bringing material from these&lt;br/&gt;workshops into contact with students in their undergraduate research&lt;br/&gt;programs and classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
