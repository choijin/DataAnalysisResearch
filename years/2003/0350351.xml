<AbstractNarration>PI: Laura Lowes, University of Washington &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to solicit support for an international seminar on "Finite Element Analysis of Reinforced Concrete Structures Under Extreme Loads." The seminar will be organized by  Professor Hiroshi Noguchi of Chiba University in Japan and Professors Laura N. Lowes of the University of Washington, Filip C. Filippou of the University of California and Kaspar Willam of the University of Colorado in the United States. A counterpart proposal for the joint seminar will be funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. The workshop will be held 2-4 November 2003, in Makena, Hawaii on the island of Maui. It will bring together researchers from the U.S. and Japan as well as Canada and Europe. The objectives of this seminar are to 1) review recent developments in state-of-the-art material constitutive models, finite element analysis techniques and numerical methods and 2) to identify research needs to enable accurate,&lt;br/&gt;robust, efficient simulation of the response of reinforced concrete structures under extreme loads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The seminar will provide an opportunity to discuss research activities in the broad range of topic areas that support the finite element modeling of reinforced concrete structures. The afternoon of the first day will be dedicated to discussion of experimental investigation of the behavior of reinforced concrete structures, experimental data sets for use in model development and benchmark studies. The second day will focus on modeling the mechanical behavior of reinforced concrete structures including constitutive models, element formations, component models and computational techniques. The morning of the last day of the seminar will be devoted to analysis of structural systems, software tools and numerical methods that can be used&lt;br/&gt;facilitate and enable analysis in the post-peak regime. The seminar will conclude with a group discussion to identify future research objectives. The seminar will have both oral presentations of written papers and group discussions. The technical papers, summary of discussions and resolutions will be published in a technical report, which will be distributed to the research and engineering communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;It is expected that the seminar will help identify future research needs in the areas of 1) benchmark studies and experimental data to support improved simulation, in particular data that may be generated by testing performed at NEES facilities, 2) constitutive modeling and element formulations, 3) finite element methods, 4) numerical and computational methods to enable analysis in the post-peak regime and 5) software to support model building and analysis of reinforced concrete structural systems. Additionally, it is expected that participants from the U.S., Japan, Canada and Europe will identify potential collaborations that leverage the strengths and accomplishments of the individual research groups around the world.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
