<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;AST-0307291&lt;br/&gt;Haiman&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop observational diagnostics that, when applied to future data, will lead to an understanding of how and when the first generation of stars and quasar black holes emerged in the universe, and what impact these sources had on the proto-galactic gas between redshifts six and thirty.  There are three main thrusts, all at the frontiers of current research: 1) what physical processes determine the nature of the first sources of light, 2) how did the earliest massive black holes form, and 3) when and how was the Universe reionized.  The results of this research, from semi-analytical and numerical techniques, concentrating on observational tests capable of distinguishing between competing theoretical models, will be indispensable in the interpretation of the results from a wide array of current and planned ground-based and space-based instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the work will be carried out by a graduate student from an under-represented group, and the project will strengthen ties between the geographically separated institutions involved in the collaboration.  Research results will also be incorporated in the many and varied public outreach programs of the Hayden Planetarium.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
