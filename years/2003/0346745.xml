<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Richard A. Loomis of Washington University will investigate the dependence of intermolecular interactions and chemical reaction dynamics on the relative orientations of the reactants.  A combination of supersonic expansion methods, frequency- and time-resolved spectroscopy, and time-of-flight ion imaging spectrometry will be used to characterize the intermolecular potential energy surfaces that direct the outcome of bimolecular encounters.  Initial work will focus on the inelastic, non-reactive dissociation dynamics of the He + ICl(B) and Ne + ICl(B) pairs to establish a foundation for the chemical reaction work.  The initial list of bimolecular reactions to be studied includes electronically excited ICl(B) with F2 and H2.  This research will be conducted with graduate students and interested undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Loomis' educational activities will focus on giving undergraduate students hands-on exposure to difficult and advanced topics early in their careers in an effort to interest more students in chemistry and chemical science. Quantum mechanical wave packet projects will be incorporated into the undergraduate Quantum Chemistry course.  In addition, Prof. Loomis will participate in outreach programs aimed at 1) exposing students in local elementary, middle, and high schools to chemical phenomena and learning, 2) through visits to small undergraduate colleges and universities in the Midwest give students an opportunity to learn about novel research topics and techniques, and 3) lecturing to international science writers whose interest span broad areas and concerns in science.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
