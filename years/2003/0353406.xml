<AbstractNarration>The goals of this five-year project are to (1) develop, implement and study the impact of a subject matter-focused, Problem-based Learning professional development model; and to (2) design ways of incorporating Problem-based Learning (PBL) into key subject matter and teacher preparation courses taken by pre-service teachers, and study the impact on pre-service teachers' learning.  The in-service component of this project will be designed with and for teams of K-12 science and mathematics teachers from school districts of mid-Michigan and will be developed over a five-year period.  The pre-service component will work with faculty and students in the teacher preparation programs at Michigan State University and Lansing Community College. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the applicability of using PBL to assist (1) teachers in analyzing and changing their instructional practice; (2) faculty in incorporating PBL into pre-service and in-service courses; and 2) professional developers in the design of effective professional development.  This project will contribute to the knowledge base on factors critical to effective professional development and examine essential elements of PBL that develop teachers' content knowledge and subject-matter knowledge for teaching. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This model of incorporating PBL into subject-matter-based professional development for teachers to examine their practice has not been used in this way to date.  The framework, diagnostic processes, feedback system and teaching cases will be made available nationally to teachers of science and mathematics to use in their schools and to faculty in institutions of higher education.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
