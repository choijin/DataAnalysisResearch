<AbstractNarration>With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Luther College will acquire a gel permeation chromatograph (GPC) and ReactIR instrument for polymer characterization. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the development of a) novel plant-based polyesters derived from naturally-occurring terpenes; b) plant-based poly(ester amides) derived from morpholine-2,5-diones; c) novel lactone polymerization catalysts based upon titatnium (IV) alkoxides; d) novel plant-based polyolefins derived from naturally-occurring fatty acids; and e) novel optically active, late transition metal olefin polymerization catalysts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) is an extremely powerful technique used for the separation and analysis of complex mixtures, in which components are separated based on their size. It is the standard method in both academia and industry to accurately determine the molecular weight and polydispersity index of a polymer sample.  The ReactIR is an in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer that allows real-time monitoring of chemical reactions.  These instruments will substantially strengthen scientific research at this primarily undergraduate institution and will allow for the incorporation of polymer and material sciences into the research and teaching programs. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
