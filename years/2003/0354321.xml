<AbstractNarration>                              Abstract for RTG award DMS-0354321 of Haiman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this project is to bring together U.C. Berkeley's&lt;br/&gt;research faculty in the areas of Representation Theory, Geometry and&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics, along with a group of postdoctoral associates and&lt;br/&gt;graduate students, in order to promote collaborative research and the&lt;br/&gt;training of young people for future work.  The three branches of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics addressed by this project are connected in profoundly&lt;br/&gt;important ways.  In every one of these areas, many of the most&lt;br/&gt;exciting current research advances involve the interconnections&lt;br/&gt;between them, so that serious study of any of them requires strong&lt;br/&gt;knowledge of the other two.  A central goal of the project is to&lt;br/&gt;provide an environment in which postdocs and graduate students are&lt;br/&gt;given the time, opportunity and collaborative atmosphere needed to&lt;br/&gt;master a full range of techniques in all three areas.  The project&lt;br/&gt;will establish two new seminars, to meet throughout the academic year,&lt;br/&gt;one concentrating on instruction in specialized topics not usually&lt;br/&gt;found in standard courses, and the other a joint seminar on current&lt;br/&gt;research.  The project will also hold an annual week-long intensive&lt;br/&gt;summer workshop, featuring series of 5--6 lectures on advanced topics&lt;br/&gt;by distinguished outside visitors and U.C. faculty members, intended&lt;br/&gt;for a graduate student to postdoctoral level audience.  We will&lt;br/&gt;welcome and facilitate participation by young researchers from other&lt;br/&gt;institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exciting recent mathematical developments lie at the intersection of&lt;br/&gt;representation theory, geometry and combinatorics, with much more to&lt;br/&gt;be done in the future.  The faculty members forming the core of the&lt;br/&gt;research group (Profs. Haiman, Reshetikhin, Borcherds, Frenkel,&lt;br/&gt;Givental, Knutson, Serganova and Wolf) have extensive overlapping&lt;br/&gt;interests, each using techniques from all three areas in his or her&lt;br/&gt;own work.  Specific research interests common to multiple members of&lt;br/&gt;the group include topics in quantum field theory; representation&lt;br/&gt;theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras; quantum groups and&lt;br/&gt;canonical bases; Gromov-Witten invariants and mirror symmetry; and&lt;br/&gt;geometry and combinatorics of Schubert varieties and flag manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;The activities of the project are designed to foster research&lt;br/&gt;collaboration and above all to equip young mathematicians in training&lt;br/&gt;with the broad range of intellectual tools needed to reach the&lt;br/&gt;frontiers of research on such topics such as those mentioned.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
