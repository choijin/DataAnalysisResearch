<AbstractNarration>This project will study how enforcement institutions affect a firm's ability to raise funds. Recent empirical studies have documented a link between legal systems and the ability of firms to raise capital. Currently, there is no integrated model that organizes these empirical observations and can quantify the impact of proposed reforms. This research will develop a computable contracting model, which includes the legal system as an essential element, and will show how legal and other institutions affect a number of key variables that relate to firm finance. Specifically, whether a firm raises funds via loans or equity, the loan size or interest rate, the likelihood that a firm will default on a loan, and whether a firm can obtain funds at all. We will focus on two important aspects of most legal codes:  1) the amount of protection that the code grants: for example, inherent in most bankruptcy codes is an important tradeoff. If creditors are favored in the bankruptcy process relative to debtors, then interest rates will be lower and it will be easier for existing firms to raise finance. However, entrepreneurs will be more reluctant to start new ventures. 2) The cost to enforce the rights that the code grants: This cost will affect the types of contracts written and the incentive to "settle out of court" (i.e., avoid the formal legal system). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to use the computable contracting model to determine the overall impact of these aspects of the legal system on firm finance (i.e., access to credit, loan interest rates, bankruptcy rates, and the composition of firm credit). The inability of firms to obtain adequate finance is a significant problem for many firms, particularly those that are small, young and/or located in emerging markets. The computable contracting model that we will develop will be used to quantify the effects of alternative policy proposals for institutional reform. For example, a recent trend in bankruptcy reform is to institute legislation to lower bankruptcy by decreasing debtor protection. The economic impact of such legislation is unclear because of the tradeoff noted above. High levels of debtor protection in a bankruptcy code encourage default, thereby raising bankruptcy costs and increasing the cost of finance for all firms. However, better debtor protection may encourage entrepreneurs to start small businesses, which are an engine of growth in most economies. This research project will provide a model that will be used to quantify these tradeoffs in a systematic way, allowing policy-makers to evaluate the effects of alternative policy proposals on key economic variables. The ability to conduct these types of policy comparisons is essential for an informed debate about legal and other types of institutional reform. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
