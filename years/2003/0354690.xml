<AbstractNarration>The investigators address the mathematical underpinnings of compressing large data sets using sparse representations over rich dictionaries and develop a foundation for classifying these problems in terms of their algorithmic complexity.  The investigators also find efficient algorithms for computing high-quality sparse representations of data over sophisticated, commonly used dictionaries that provably perform as claimed with respect to both efficiency and correctness of output and are particularly well-suited for massive data set applications.  The research proceeds at multiple levels of abstraction.  It considers general factors of a representation class that guarantee or preclude such algorithms, it considers algorithms for specific common representation classes, and it finds algorithms for representation classes adapted to specific common (and diverse) applications, such as solutions of partial differential equations, image processing, and database query optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past ten years there has been a dramatic increase in data gathering mechanisms, as well as an ever-increasing demand for finer data analysis in applications that rely on scientific and geometric modeling.  Each day, literally millions of large data sets are generated in medical imaging, surveillance, and scientific acquisition. In addition, the internet has become a communication medium with vast capacity, generating massive traffic data sets.  The usefulness of these data sets rests on our ability to process them efficiently, whether it be for storage, transmission, visual display, fast on-line graphical query, correlation, or registration against data from other modalities.  The current state of the art in data processing is far from providing the efficient and faithful representations required in emerging applications.  With few exceptions, previous work has not provided algorithms whose efficiency or output quality, though typically validated experimentally, has been analyzed rigorously and thoroughly.  The investigators carry out fundamental mathematical and algorithmic research to significantly increase our capacity to process and manage large data sets.  The research makes significant mathematical progress in providing rigorous algorithmic results that are of great need in this field.  The research also makes significant improvements through highly efficient algorithms in the sizes of data sets that are analyzable and in the types of data processing tasks that can be carried out.  Finally, the investigators create a library of software for massive data processing applications.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
