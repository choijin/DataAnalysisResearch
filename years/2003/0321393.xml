<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Impact: The Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico's MRI/RUI for Equipment&lt;br/&gt;Acquisition to Increase Network Engineering Laboratory Capacities for Hispanic Engineering&lt;br/&gt;Students will significantly impact three institutional goals: (1) Improving access to and&lt;br/&gt;increasing the use of modern research and research training instrumentation for our Hispanic&lt;br/&gt;students and faculty in Computer Engineering; (2) lessening the technological and research gap&lt;br/&gt;experienced by the institution's 1,330 Hispanic students in Electrical Engineering and directly&lt;br/&gt;over 300 Hispanic students studying Computer Engineering; and, (3) integrating education and&lt;br/&gt;research in Computer Engineering. These three institutional and departmental goals are&lt;br/&gt;consistent with the NSF-MRI program and the RUI program. The Hispanic faculty to be&lt;br/&gt;impacted includes 19 full-time EE faculty members and specifically 6 faculty members in&lt;br/&gt;Computer Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;Research: The research activities utilizing the Network Engineering Laboratory will be&lt;br/&gt;centered on Open Learning Objects and Inner Metadata. These include the design of Open LO&lt;br/&gt;(OLO), which is based on Open standards, mostly XML markup languages and their related&lt;br/&gt;tools. It exposes an interface to export the results of LO-to-Learner interaction, and for LO&lt;br/&gt;adaptation. Inner Metadata is the collection of layered meta-data mechanisms that are used to&lt;br/&gt;describe the OLOs, their adaptive features, and the Learner interaction tracing. LO objects&lt;br/&gt;designed according to this architecture still retain the encapsulation and modularity required to&lt;br/&gt;abstract those implementation aspects of a LO that researchers can investigate for future&lt;br/&gt;enhancement and growth, yet they provide a systematic and consistent interface for extracting&lt;br/&gt;the results of the interaction with the Learner and for LO adaptation.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity: The proposed research project advances&lt;br/&gt;knowledge and understanding within the field of Computer Engineering and explores creative&lt;br/&gt;concepts. Several organizations most notably the IEEE and the IMS Consortium, have proposed&lt;br/&gt;standards for describing Learning Objects. While these efforts substantially advance the goals of&lt;br/&gt;interoperability, they fall short at addressing the need for accessibility to the internal composition&lt;br/&gt;of the Learning Objects (LO). Under present standards, the LO remains an opaque entity from&lt;br/&gt;which valuable information cannot be easily gleaned or harvested, nor introduced or adapted.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact of the Proposed Activity: Research in this area will fully integrate&lt;br/&gt;education and research activities by utilizing the IDEAL eLearning environment as a platform to&lt;br/&gt;test and explore these and similar issues from a unique perspective; that of a potentially very&lt;br/&gt;large learner pool as available through the web. The research activities to be undertaken in the&lt;br/&gt;enhanced Network Engineering Laboratory will equally serve to expose PUPR to collaborate in&lt;br/&gt;Computer Engineering research with other engineering colleges and universities in the United&lt;br/&gt;States.</AbstractNarration>
