<AbstractNarration>Patient-Adaptive Feedback Controllers for Heart Assist Devices&lt;br/&gt;A. Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;Heart transplant candidates often wait long periods (300 days or more on the average) before a suitable&lt;br/&gt;donor heart becomes available, and many of these candidate die while awaiting heart transplantation.&lt;br/&gt;Consequently, the medical community has been placing increased emphasis on the use of mechanical&lt;br/&gt;devices that can substitute for, or enhance, the function of the natural heart. A Ventricular Assist Device&lt;br/&gt;(VAD) is such a device. This device if often used as a bridge to mechanically support a patient while&lt;br/&gt;awaiting heart transplantation, or while their natural heart recovers. But the ultimate use of this device is as&lt;br/&gt;a long-term iocurelr for heart failure. In either case, the goal of a VAD is to provide the patient with as close&lt;br/&gt;to a normal lifestyle as possible. The goal for all concerned is to allow patients to return home and return&lt;br/&gt;to the workforce.&lt;br/&gt;An important challenge facing the increased use of VADs is the development of an appropriate controller&lt;br/&gt;for these devices. The latest generation of VADs, based on turbo-dynamic pumps, requires a controller that&lt;br/&gt;can adjust the speed of the rotor (pump impeller) to meet the circulatory demand of the patient. Therefore,&lt;br/&gt;in addition to being robust and reliable, such a controller should be able to adapt to the daily activities and&lt;br/&gt;the physiological changes of the patient. In this project we propose to investigate the theoretical and&lt;br/&gt;fundamental issues associated with the development of such a controller. More specifically, (1) we will&lt;br/&gt;continue our ongoing work on the development of a generalized model of a rotary blood pump that, when&lt;br/&gt;coupled to existing model of the human cardiovascular system, will serve as a simulation model for further&lt;br/&gt;development; (2) we will develop a robust optimal feedback control algorithm that provides the flexibility&lt;br/&gt;to incorporate various sensor inputs as available, and (3) we will implement the control algorithm into a PC&lt;br/&gt;platform and test its responsiveness in a mock circulating flow loop. The principal functions of this&lt;br/&gt;feedback controller will be: (1) to determine and maintain appropriate cardiac output, subject to constraints&lt;br/&gt;imposed by the device and the patients condition including avoiding ventricular suction; (2) to identify&lt;br/&gt;system variables and parameters to monitor the patient's condition, indicating when the patient's&lt;br/&gt;cardiovascular status is improving or deteriorating and detecting component failures; (3) to recognize&lt;br/&gt;different operating conditions and data environments, responding to changes in the signals available for&lt;br/&gt;measurement from the patient and the assist device; (4) to monitor the control strategy (algorithm) itself to&lt;br/&gt;avoid uncontrollable situations and inappropriate or dangerous control actions; and (5) to provide a fail-safe&lt;br/&gt;mode of operation by entering a preset open-loop operating mode when a hardware or algorithmic failure&lt;br/&gt;occurs.&lt;br/&gt;The primary intellectual merit of the proposed research will be to increase our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;fundamental technical issues related to the control of non-conventional complex systems, such as the&lt;br/&gt;VADs, that involve both electromechanical as well as physiological components. A truly interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;approach, with expertise coming from the electrical, mechanical, and biomedical engineering fields as well&lt;br/&gt;as the medical profession, is needed to develop the mathematical framework needed to be able to&lt;br/&gt;effectively control such systems.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed research will primarily be in improving the quality of life for&lt;br/&gt;cardiovascular patients awaiting heart transplantation. Any improvement in the existing technology of the&lt;br/&gt;ventricular assist devices will have a tremendous effect on the physical condition and ultimately the&lt;br/&gt;recovery of patients suffering from congestive heart failure. It is hoped that this study, leading to the&lt;br/&gt;development of a patient adaptive feedback controller, will provide an opportunity for these patients to&lt;br/&gt;leave the hospital, return home, and re-enter the work force while awaiting for a donor heart. Another&lt;br/&gt;important impact of this project is in training engineering graduate (and a few undergraduate) students&lt;br/&gt;from the electrical, mechanical, and biomedical, departments to work together as a team in this highly&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary field. This project will provide an opportunity for students to apply what they have&lt;br/&gt;learned in the control and signal processing courses to a realistic (but not very well defined mathematically)&lt;br/&gt;problem that has a tremendous societal impact.</AbstractNarration>
