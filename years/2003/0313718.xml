<AbstractNarration>This grant supports a study of the micrometeorology of the Hudson River Valley based on an intensive program of field observations and data analysis.  Phenomena of interest include the channeling of winds by the valley, the structure and thickness of the boundary layer as it evolves during the course of a day, the formation and structure of low-level nocturnal jets, and the development of atmospheric layers of strong directional wind shear.  A goal is to characterize these fine-scale features of the boundary layer in ways that will be useful for understanding and predicting the dispersion of pollutants in the highly-populated region upriver from New York City.  The approach consists of (1) integrating the information from existing surface and upper air observing stations in the region into a single database; (2) conducting special field observations during six weeks in the fall season of 2003 using local and national meteorological facilities including a dense network of surface meteorological stations, nine stations specially equipped for measuring the vertical flux of heat and moisture, a radar wind profiler equipped with a radio-acoustic sounding system for measuring temperature profiles, a tethered balloon sounding system, and, for one month, the Wyoming King Air research aircraft equipped for flux measurements.  Major collaborators on the project are Dr. Jeffrey Freedman of Atmospheric Information Services, and Dr. Kevin Knupp of the University of Alabama.  Results of the project will contribute to the understanding of boundary-layer processes in moderately complex terrain and provide guidance for pollution regulatory agencies.</AbstractNarration>
