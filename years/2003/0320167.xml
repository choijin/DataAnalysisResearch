    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop signal processing methods that allow for real-time sequence recovery of bio-molecules such as DNA. The idea is to use a single simple experiment and to shift the burden of analysis and identification to signal processing. The methodology allows for the use of simple instrumentation (platforms, detectors, sensors, etc.) and compensates for them by using advanced signal processing techniques, thereby making it ideally suited for many biotechnology applications. Although the problem encountered is mathematically one of blind de-convolution, what distinguishes the problem in its molecular biology applications is the sheer number of signature signals involved that form the aggregate signal. In this project, a novel solution based on statistical signal processing will be developed. The technique will explicitly exploit the large number of signals involved and will use a combination of the law of large numbers and Wiener filtering theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project is in the area of Genomics. The methodology will allow for inexpensive real-time DNA sequencing. Since the required instrumentation is relatively simple and the burden is shifted to signal processing and computation (which can be implemented directly in standard digital-signal-processing (DSP) chips), the detection method could be readily integrated into a hand-held device. Such a Point-of-Care (POC) device could be used for industrial and laboratory molecular diagnostics applications.</AbstractNarration>
