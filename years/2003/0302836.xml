<AbstractNarration>In response to the critical shortage of qualified science and mathematics teachers in Texas, Austin Community College (ACC) is developing a teacher education program, entitled Get an Education and Teach: Science and Math Articulation on the Right Track (GET SMART).  The program also involves articulation partnerships with area universities, including the University of Texas, Southwest Texas State University and the University of North Texas, Texas A&amp;M University, and St. Edward's University. The GET SMART program offers an Associate of Arts degree for pre-service teachers of high school biology, chemistry or mathematics or middle school mathematics. In addition to the core requirements for the major, students take three innovative education courses. The first, EDUC 1301, focuses on educational pedagogy and use of technology in the classroom.  The second educational course is split for prospective science teachers or mathematics teachers. The science II course focuses on preparing, conducting and assessing both laboratory experiments and field trips, as well as exploring the use of computer-assisted labs and virtual labs, especially for technologically advanced labs. The mathematics II course, modeled on a mathematics course developed for the University of Texas (UT) Uteach program, focuses on pre-calculus level functions and modeling from many perspectives. Students are exposed to several mathematical software applications and websites, as well as hand-held technology including data collection devices and graphing calculators. In the third course, students come together again to practice and improve on skills learned in the first two courses. Students in the GET SMART program serve as teaching assistants in university labs and as peer mentors in area high schools and middle schools. These activities also have the advantage of serving as recruiting tools for future students of the GET SMART program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential students are drawn from the 26 surrounding school districts, with particular attention to reaching non-traditional and underrepresented students.  Recruitment strategies for K-12 students include school visits, establishment of Future Teachers of America clubs, and a recruitment video and brochure. Community college students are recruited from ACC science and mathematics classes.  GET SMART works with the ACC&lt;br/&gt;Alternative Teacher Certification program to recruit teachers from the technology&lt;br/&gt;industry. Students are supported throughout their tenure at ACC both academically, through the strong ACC tutoring program and preparatory coursework, and financially, through scholarships and stipends. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
