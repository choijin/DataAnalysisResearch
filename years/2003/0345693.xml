<AbstractNarration>The focus of this project is to study how temporal changes in the isotopic &lt;br/&gt;composition of mammals are recorded in developing tooth enamel. Teeth form &lt;br/&gt;progressively from crown to root and act as recorders of seasonal isotopic variation in the &lt;br/&gt;animal blood bicarbonate reservoir.  This variation is in turn related to seasonal variations &lt;br/&gt;in climate, food availability, migration, ecosystem interactions, and other environmental &lt;br/&gt;conditions.  Isotopic signals are preserved in fossil tooth enamel, so teeth are important &lt;br/&gt;archives of ancient seasonality and environmental variation on short time scales.   &lt;br/&gt;Despite the wide usage of intra-tooth isotope approaches, there is considerable &lt;br/&gt;uncertainty as to how the measured signals relate to actual signals of variation within the &lt;br/&gt;animal reservoir.  This uncertainty stems from inadequate knowledge of the temporal and &lt;br/&gt;spatial patterns of enamel mineral deposition and accumulation in teeth that are &lt;br/&gt;commonly studied.  Although promising, the intra-tooth isotope method will remain &lt;br/&gt;compromised as a paleoindicator until these uncertainties are addressed. &lt;br/&gt;We will use micro-computed tomography (microCT) to investigate the temporal &lt;br/&gt;and spatial pattern of enamel mineral accumulation in developing teeth of animals of &lt;br/&gt;various ages from a range of species.  Maturation parameters determined from the &lt;br/&gt;microCT data will enable development of tooth- and species-specific models that &lt;br/&gt;describe how primary input signals are recorded as intra-tooth isotopic profiles.  Inverse &lt;br/&gt;models will be developed that allow estimates of primary input signals based on &lt;br/&gt;measured isotope data and knowledge of maturation parameters.  Comparison between &lt;br/&gt;model results and known isotopic changes in the animals studied will allow direct &lt;br/&gt;evaluation of the accuracy of these models. &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this study will provide maturation parameters for dentitions of &lt;br/&gt;Alpaca (alpaca), Capra (goat), and Bos (cow).  These animals underwent strictly &lt;br/&gt;controlled isotopic changes during tooth formation, and therefore this study will show the &lt;br/&gt;extent to which forward and inverse models based on maturation parameters allow for &lt;br/&gt;reconstruction of primary input signals.  These species span a range of diversity within &lt;br/&gt;the artiodactyla and will show whether general models can be applied to many species &lt;br/&gt;within this order. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit. This study will significantly increase the understanding of a &lt;br/&gt;basic tool used by a wide variety of researchers.  The microCT, forward modeling, and &lt;br/&gt;inversion modeling methods will be of immediate use to researchers using the intra-tooth &lt;br/&gt;isotope method.  Forward and inverse modeling learned by other researchers as a result of &lt;br/&gt;this study will broaden scientific background and benefit future studies.  Advances in the &lt;br/&gt;intra-tooth method owing to this study will help advance our understanding of ancient &lt;br/&gt;human environments and cultures, behavior and ecosystem context of extinct species, and &lt;br/&gt;ancient climates and environments. &lt;br/&gt;  Broader impact.  This research will form the Ph.D dissertation of Benjamin &lt;br/&gt;Passey.  He will be responsible for the design, execution, and dissemination of this &lt;br/&gt;research and will learn valuable skills in project management, laboratory practice, data &lt;br/&gt;evaluation, and professional communication.  An undergraduate student will be involved &lt;br/&gt;in laboratory aspects of this project.  This person will gain invaluable first-hand research &lt;br/&gt;experience and have opportunities to attend professional meetings to present results&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
