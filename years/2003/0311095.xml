<AbstractNarration>Project Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Systems are only as secure as their weakest point of attack.  Indeed,&lt;br/&gt;the only way to increase the security of a system as a whole is to&lt;br/&gt;improve the resilience of its most vulnerable component. Much&lt;br/&gt;successful research has focused on developing cryptographic protocols&lt;br/&gt;which are secure as long as some information (i.e., a key) is kept&lt;br/&gt;secret from the adversary. However, as such algorithms are&lt;br/&gt;increasingly deployed on inexpensive, mobile, and unprotected devices&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., laptops, mobile phones, and PDAs), the risk of key exposure is&lt;br/&gt;becoming a serious threat to the security of many real-world&lt;br/&gt;systems. This project aims to develop new paradigms and to design&lt;br/&gt;efficient algorithms for maintaining security even in the event of a&lt;br/&gt;key exposure attack. Among other topics, the project will focus on (1)&lt;br/&gt;forward-secure public-key encryption; (2) forward secrecy in&lt;br/&gt;key-exchange protocols; and (3) protecting signcryption schemes&lt;br/&gt;against key exposure attacks. The techniques developed as part of this&lt;br/&gt;research are expected to help improve the security of a number of&lt;br/&gt;different systems, from handheld devices to ad-hoc networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate students will be involved in all aspects of this project, and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate involvement will be encouraged as well. The techniques&lt;br/&gt;stemming from this research will be incorporated into undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;and graduate courses in cryptography and computer security. In these&lt;br/&gt;ways, the project will help train future scientists in the important&lt;br/&gt;area of information security.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
