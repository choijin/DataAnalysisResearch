<AbstractNarration>LGORITHMIC SYNTHESIS OF EMBEDDED CONTROLLERS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, microprocessors have invaded the physical world, resulting in &lt;br/&gt;sophisticated but complicated networked embedded systems that defy theoretical &lt;br/&gt;understanding, resulting in inadequate design tools for the modern embedded &lt;br/&gt;system engineer. Embedded systems require the development of new theories, &lt;br/&gt;methods, and tools providing the correct understanding of these systems and&lt;br/&gt;accelerated analysis and design methods in order to ensure safety&lt;br/&gt;but also substantially decrease their design time.   Embedded systems require very novel, very challenging specifications that have &lt;br/&gt;to deal with synchronization, sequencing, and temporal ordering of different&lt;br/&gt;tasks.  Mathematically formulating such desired specifications cannot be &lt;br/&gt;achieved using traditional mathematical formulations in control theory.  On the &lt;br/&gt;other hand, computer aided verification has popularized the use of several &lt;br/&gt;temporal logics to describe complex specifications. However, the emphasis has &lt;br/&gt;been on verification of these properties for purely discrete systems, and not &lt;br/&gt;on synthesis for systems with a continuous component.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, a novel approach for automatically synthesizing hybrid &lt;br/&gt;controllers is pursued in order to satisfy specifications that are expressed &lt;br/&gt;in temporal logics. In particular, methodologies are developed to extract &lt;br/&gt;finite abstractions of linear control systems, that will be used to design &lt;br/&gt;controllers meeting the desired temporal logic specifications.  Contrary to &lt;br/&gt;other approaches, this project considers specification dependent abstractions &lt;br/&gt;for continuous control systems as opposed to continuous dynamical systems. The &lt;br/&gt;proposed framework will provide algorithms and tools for the computation of &lt;br/&gt;discrete controllers, which by refinement will lead to embedded, hybrid &lt;br/&gt;controllers for the original system while providing performance and  &lt;br/&gt;correctness guarantees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational agenda of the proposal focuses on the development of a cross-&lt;br/&gt;departmental, undergraduate, signals and systems course that broadens the &lt;br/&gt;definition of systems in order to capture software and hardware systems in &lt;br/&gt;addition to traditional control or communication systems.  This course has been &lt;br/&gt;carefully coordinated with recent curriculum changes and aims at the &lt;br/&gt;educational uniformity of signals and systems concepts in both the discrete and &lt;br/&gt;the continuous world.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
