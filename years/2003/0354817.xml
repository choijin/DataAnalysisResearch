<AbstractNarration>Closing the Mathematics Achievement Gap of African American Students: &lt;br/&gt;A Conference on the Issues &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The National Alliance of Black School Educators (NABSE) and the Benjamin Banneker &lt;br/&gt;Association (BBA), in collaboration with The McKenzie Group (TMG), propose a four-month &lt;br/&gt;initiative to develop a broad-scale action agenda to improve mathematics teaching and learning &lt;br/&gt;for all students, but particularly students of African American descent.  As the first stage of a &lt;br/&gt;broader plan to improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) &lt;br/&gt;achievement nationwide, the mathematics initiative seeks funding to convene a conference of &lt;br/&gt;nationally recognized researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to develop an integrated, &lt;br/&gt;research-based design for closing the achievement gap, as well as a framework for implementing &lt;br/&gt;appropriate programmatic and policy strategies. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The project will advance knowledge and understanding of effective strategies &lt;br/&gt;and challenges for increasing K-12 African American mathematics achievement, as well as &lt;br/&gt;promote collaborate among the array of organizations committed to conducting action-research &lt;br/&gt;to close the African American mathematics achievement gap.  NABSE and BBA, two leading &lt;br/&gt;advocacy and professional development organizations committed to K-12 STEM reform, along &lt;br/&gt;with TMG.s prior experience with STEM technical assistance, provide a solid grounding for this &lt;br/&gt;research and development (R&amp;D) effort.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The development of formal post-conference discussion and concept papers &lt;br/&gt;will broaden the impact beyond the institutions and organizations represented by conference &lt;br/&gt;participants.  Furthermore, the combined memberships of over 7,500 African American &lt;br/&gt;educators from school districts throughout the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean will &lt;br/&gt;provide a powerful professional network for sharing the conference publications and findings &lt;br/&gt;and directly impacting classroom instruction. NABSE.s 98 regional affiliates that are located &lt;br/&gt;within BBA.s six regions will also provide venues for continuing dialogue and collaboration at &lt;br/&gt;the regional and local levels.  Both organizations will use their electronic communications &lt;br/&gt;networks that include websites and email listservs and their independent national conferences to &lt;br/&gt;further support these efforts. Finally, the overarching goal of increasing African American &lt;br/&gt;mathematics achievement will contribute to national education goals of improved K-12 student &lt;br/&gt;achievement in mathematics</AbstractNarration>
