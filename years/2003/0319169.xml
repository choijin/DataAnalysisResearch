    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project studies a new coding and implementation techniques for high-speed high-density optical disk data storage. It is well known that conventional optical disk storage is based on recording and readout binary data pits in an optical disk such as compact disk and DVD. The data storage density is thus limited by the size of these pits that can be recorded and readout optically due to diffraction limitation. This proposed research explores a new coding concept and uses an extended depth of focus diffractive optical element to facilitate recording and readout many bits of data in a single storage pit. The data storage density can thus be significantly increased. The novel approach can potentially reach 50 Gbits/in storage density using the same optical and motion scanning system as DVD and using a commercially available data recording material. Thus, the technology development can reach its near-term maturity. Phase I research will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed novel disk storage concept. Compatibility with existing data storage technology will also be demonstrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will develop a simple proof-of-concept high-density optical disk storage prototype based on a new coding concept. Implementation of such coding concept can significantly increase the disk storage density for commercial and military applications such as computer data storage, on-line storage, library archival applications, image storage and processing for medical applications, and military target identification and fast access to large intelligent database.</AbstractNarration>
