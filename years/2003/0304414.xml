<AbstractNarration>This proposal has three main projects.  The first, with Harold Widom, is to &lt;br/&gt;study the connection between the ``Airy process'' and integrable differential&lt;br/&gt;equations.  The Airy process is a stochastic process that is expected to &lt;br/&gt;describe a wide class of growth processes.  The distribution function for the&lt;br/&gt;Airy process at one single time is the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution &lt;br/&gt;function.  In this case the distribution function is represented as either a &lt;br/&gt;Fredholm determinant of a certain operator (the ``Airy kernel'') or in terms &lt;br/&gt;of a solution to a certain nonlinear ordinary differential equation called &lt;br/&gt;Painleve II.  The finite-dimensional distribution functions for the Airy &lt;br/&gt;process (at many different times) are also expressible as  Fredholm &lt;br/&gt;determinants of an integral operator (the ``extended Airy kernel'').  The &lt;br/&gt;goal is to find the corresponding integrable differential equations and to use &lt;br/&gt;these differential equations to analyze the Airy process.  The second project,&lt;br/&gt;again with Widom, is to complete earlier work on the asymptotics of &lt;br/&gt;solutions to the periodic Toda equations by determining the asymptotics &lt;br/&gt;on what are called the ``critical curves.''  The third major project,  with &lt;br/&gt;graduate student Momar Dieng, is to find explicit Painleve type &lt;br/&gt;representations for the distribution function for the next-largest, next-next &lt;br/&gt;largest, etc. eigenvalues in the random matrix models GOE and GSE.  &lt;br/&gt;These distribution functions will have applications to statistics. If time &lt;br/&gt;permits certain combinatorial sums involving Hall-Littlewood symmetric &lt;br/&gt;functions will be analyzed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The famous bell-shaped curve, known more formally as the Gaussian &lt;br/&gt;distribution function, is well-known due to its many applications in the&lt;br/&gt;social sciences, the physical and biological sciences, and engineering.  &lt;br/&gt;Mathematicians in the early part of the twentieth century gave precise &lt;br/&gt;conditions under which  one can expect to find the Gaussian distribution.  &lt;br/&gt;It is now common in these disciplines to apply these conditions (``sums of &lt;br/&gt;independent random variables'') to predict the appearance of the Gaussian &lt;br/&gt;distribution.  When  these conditions fail and we are dealing with strongly &lt;br/&gt;dependent random variables, we cannot expect to see the Gaussian.  &lt;br/&gt;Quite remarkably it has been realized in recent years that the distribution &lt;br/&gt;functions of the largest eigenvalues in various random matrix models &lt;br/&gt;describe new universal laws for a wide variety of problems appearing in&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics, growth processes, random tilings, queuing theory, the &lt;br/&gt;analysis of large data sets (``principal component analysis'') as well as &lt;br/&gt;applications to the physics of quantum dots.  These distribution functions, &lt;br/&gt;known as the Tracy-Widom distribution functions, are now realized in &lt;br/&gt;terms of a time dependent process called the Airy process. (The  Airy &lt;br/&gt;process plays the same role as Brownian motion does to the Gaussian &lt;br/&gt;distribution.)  One of the goals of this project is to find differential &lt;br/&gt;equations that characterize the Airy process.  These differential equations&lt;br/&gt;will facilitate analysis of the Airy process much in the same way that the &lt;br/&gt;ordinary differential equation (Painleve II) has aided in the description of &lt;br/&gt;the Tracy-Widom distribution functions.  A second project is to go beyond &lt;br/&gt;the largest eigenvalue distribution functions and to consider, for example, &lt;br/&gt;the next-largest eigenvalue distribution functions for a class of models &lt;br/&gt;called GOE and GSE.  The GOE case is  particularly relevant to &lt;br/&gt;multivariate statistics and these additional distribution functions can be &lt;br/&gt;expected to find applications to problems involving large data sets.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
