<AbstractNarration>This SGER award steps outside the traditional box of engineering education and recruitment in a major way. Instead of using one of the more traditional projects that have an obvious direct link to engineering to even the layperson, it utilizes the electric guitar, a project that for most laypeople do instantly connect with engineering. The course will be based upon parallel paths of building an electric guitar that the students will keep (i.e. project based) and simultaneously discussing/learning the physics behind the guitar. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics take the students from the fundamental physics of how musical &lt;br/&gt;instruments function to behavior of electronic devices, such as the electromagnetic pickups, filters, etc. The course will consist of 2 lecture classes during the week (with demonstrations and hands-on experiential learning opportunities) as well as an open laboratory on Saturdays for construction of the guitars. The class will be held on the Auraria Campus in Downtown Denver at CU-Denver and serve approximately 25 students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
