<AbstractNarration>During the last few decades, the introduction of reactive nitrogen (N) into the &lt;br/&gt;biosphere by food and energy production has been greater than rates of N fixation in native &lt;br/&gt;terrestrial ecosystems.  By far the largest uncertainty about the human domination of the N &lt;br/&gt;cycle on all scales is the amount of reactive N that is converted back to N2 during the last step &lt;br/&gt;of denitrification.  Without this knowledge, it is impossible to determine the rate of &lt;br/&gt;accumulation of reactive N in most environmental reservoirs, and thus impossible to assess its &lt;br/&gt;long-term consequences.  Nitrogen interacts with carbon and other nutrient cycles and has &lt;br/&gt;numerous cascading effects on water and air quality and climate.  An improved understanding &lt;br/&gt;of where, when, and how much reactive N is denitrified could contribute to finding solutions &lt;br/&gt;to the problems created by excessive reactive N in the environment. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, we have little knowledge about rates of denitrification across &lt;br/&gt;landscapes and waterscapes.  We know the environmental conditions under which &lt;br/&gt;denitrification occurs, but reliable quantification of N2 production in the field is still relatively &lt;br/&gt;rare.  There are three primary reasons for lack of knowledge about N2 production: (1) it is &lt;br/&gt;difficult to measure due to the high atmospheric background concentrations; (2) N2 &lt;br/&gt;production rates are very heterogeneous in space and time; and (3) there is a lack of synergy &lt;br/&gt;between the scientific communities that determine N2 production rates.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;We propose holding a 3-day workshop in May 2004 of about 35 participants to focus &lt;br/&gt;on quantification of N2 production via biological denitrification.  The objectives of this &lt;br/&gt;workshop will be: (1) to evaluate the state of our knowledge of denitrification rates in a wide &lt;br/&gt;range of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; (2) to compare methodologies that have been &lt;br/&gt;adopted by different scientific disciplines, with the expectation that collaborations across &lt;br/&gt;disciplines could yield methodological advances; and (3) to chart out the current weaknesses &lt;br/&gt;and the actions needed to address those weaknesses for an improved global assessment of &lt;br/&gt;where, when, and how much reactive N is converted to N2 in the biosphere.  Two important &lt;br/&gt;considerations will be superimposed over a matrix of ecosystem types and methodological &lt;br/&gt;approaches: (1) What are the appropriate scales over which N2 production can and should be &lt;br/&gt;measured?; and (2) How can models be integrated with the measurements to improve &lt;br/&gt;mechanistic understanding of the processes and permit estimation of fluxes at larger spatial &lt;br/&gt;scales, longer temporal scales, and across a range of forecasted scenarios?  The results of the &lt;br/&gt;workshop will be published as one or more synthesis papers in a peer-reviewed journal. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this activity include an effort to direct our scientific &lt;br/&gt;understanding of the N cycle toward finding solutions to society.s concerns about &lt;br/&gt;eutrophication of the biosphere.  The proposed workshop is being organized as an integral &lt;br/&gt;part of the International Nitrogen Initiative (INI), a joint project of SCOPE and IGBP.  The &lt;br/&gt;overall goal of the INI is to optimize nitrogen's role in sustainable food and energy &lt;br/&gt;production, while minimizing negative effects on human health and the environment.  Hence, &lt;br/&gt;this workshop is part of an effort that has board implications for society by contributing &lt;br/&gt;knowledge to future management the global N cycle to meet objectives of both food security &lt;br/&gt;and environmental quality. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
