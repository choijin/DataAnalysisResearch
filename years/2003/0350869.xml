<AbstractNarration>Symposium Q&lt;br/&gt;Mechanical Properties of Nanostructured Materials and Nanocomposites&lt;br/&gt;to be held at the 2003 MRS Fall Meeting&lt;br/&gt;Boston MA, during December 1-5, 2003&lt;br/&gt;The main aim of this Symposium is to provide a critical, up-to-date review and discussion&lt;br/&gt;on science and technology of nanostructured materials and nanocomposites, with&lt;br/&gt;focuses placed on a fundamental understanding of the relationships between their&lt;br/&gt;fabrication, structure, strength and ductility. The organizers aim to gather researchers&lt;br/&gt;who will review recent advances in mechanical properties of nanostructured materials&lt;br/&gt;and nanocomposites, assess the impact across materials science, and chart a course for&lt;br/&gt;future work in research, fabrication, design, and application. The Symposium covers&lt;br/&gt;nanoscience and nanoengineering of bulk and composite materials, thick coatings and&lt;br/&gt;thin films with enhanced mechanical properties for structural and functional applications.&lt;br/&gt;Particular emphasis is placed on bringing researchers working on theoretical and&lt;br/&gt;modeling aspects closer to those working on developing processing, fabrication, and&lt;br/&gt;characterization techniques in this new and rapidly growing area.&lt;br/&gt;Project/Abstract Summary&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide partial financial support of travel and registration fees for&lt;br/&gt;graduate students, Post-doctoral researchers and invited speakers to attend the MRS&lt;br/&gt;Symposium Q: Mechanical Properties of Nanostructured Materials and Nanocomposites,&lt;br/&gt;which will be held in Boston, MA, from December 1-5, 2003. MRS meetings promote a&lt;br/&gt;unique communication among materials researchers from academia, industry and&lt;br/&gt;government for the advancement of interdisciplinary materials research. Symposium Q&lt;br/&gt;creates a forum for researchers involved in nanoscience and nanoengineering of bulk and&lt;br/&gt;composite materials, thick coatings and thin films with enhanced mechanical properties&lt;br/&gt;for structural and functional applications. Invited speakers for the symposium include&lt;br/&gt;well-known researchers from academia, industry and national laboratories, providing a&lt;br/&gt;critical, up-to-date review and discussion on science and technology of nanomaterials&lt;br/&gt;and nanocomposites, with focuses on a fundamental understanding of the relationships&lt;br/&gt;among fabrication, structure, strength and ductility, and performance.&lt;br/&gt;Prepared: 8/23/03</AbstractNarration>
