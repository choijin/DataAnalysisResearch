<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to explore new classes of compounds that exhibit novel frameworks of electronic, magnetic and catalytic importance.  The scope of the proposed project covers a broad range of fundamental inorganic chemistry, including synthesis, structure, bonding, electronic structure, magnetochemistry, and materials chemistry. The significance of this research endeavor includes: 1) discovering novel solids containing nanostructured transition metal (TM) oxide frameworks of fundamental and technological importance in, for instance, quantum computing, 2) developing, via recently implemented salt inclusion reactions, new hybrid materials exhibiting unique chemical and physical properties and 3) collaborating with researchers in various disciplines and different research institutions, including national laboratories, to facilitate in-depth structure and property correlation studies.  This interdisciplinary research program will impact students in multiple ways, training and preparing them to fulfill the need for researchers with multidisciplinary backgrounds and the technical, professional, and personal skills essential to addressing the varied career demands of the future in solid state materials science.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to explore new classes of materials that exhibit novel frameworks of electronic, magnetic and catalytic importance.  A long-established area of scientific excellence in Europe, solid-state chemistry has emerged in the US in the past two decades as a field experiencing rapid growth and development.  Recent advances in technology and the need for new materials in device applications have continuously driven the rapid growth of solid-state science.  This proposed research is designed to nurture and train students to meet the need of globally prepared researchers who are well versed with multidisciplinary backgrounds and possess the technical, professional, and personal skills essential to addressing the varied career demands of the future. By equipping more chemists to pursue career positions in areas allied to materials chemistry, we will be enhancing the skill base in an area of vital importance to the US economy.  Funding of the proposed research program will support advanced materials research as well as the long-term health, vitality, and infrastructure of each discipline, as their skills and knowledge make a considerable contribution to the high technology materials endeavors in the US. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
