<AbstractNarration>Rathinam&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator develops efficient numerical schemes,&lt;br/&gt;software, and theoretical analysis of these schemes for the&lt;br/&gt;simulation of continuous-time discrete-state stochastic dynamic&lt;br/&gt;systems that exhibit "multiscale behaviour."  Examples of such&lt;br/&gt;systems include chemically reacting molecular systems, traffic&lt;br/&gt;models, and markets.  In principle such systems can be simulated&lt;br/&gt;exactly one "event" at a time.  But the computational costs are&lt;br/&gt;often prohibitive for large systems.  Continuous macroscopic&lt;br/&gt;models -- either stochastic or deterministic differential&lt;br/&gt;equaitons -- often prove to be valid approximations to such&lt;br/&gt;models and in that case several numerical methods exist for their&lt;br/&gt;efficient simulation.  However, some systems exhibit "multiscale&lt;br/&gt;behaviour" in the sense that only parts of the system may be&lt;br/&gt;approximated by such macroscopic models while the remaining&lt;br/&gt;components need to be represented by a discrete and stochastic&lt;br/&gt;model.  Motivating examples are found in intra-cellular gene&lt;br/&gt;transcription mechanisms, where the fluctuations of certain key&lt;br/&gt;molecular species present in very small numbers have a critical&lt;br/&gt;effect on the final state of the system.  The investigator aims to&lt;br/&gt;develop numerical schemes and theory that target such multiscale&lt;br/&gt;systems.  These schemes allow simulations to leap over several&lt;br/&gt;events while maintaining required level of accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;     Computer simulation methods and their theory are well&lt;br/&gt;developed for systems, such as a space craft in motion, that&lt;br/&gt;follow a deterministic and continuous motion.  However, in some&lt;br/&gt;complex dynamic systems, such as chemical reactions inside a&lt;br/&gt;cell, the behaviour of traders in a large market, and the&lt;br/&gt;internet traffic of data, the entities change in small jumps that&lt;br/&gt;occur randomly in time.  The investigator develops important new&lt;br/&gt;tools for the efficient computer simulation of such dynamic&lt;br/&gt;phenomena.  The impact of these tools is in the scientific&lt;br/&gt;computation of biological, social, and economic systems.  This&lt;br/&gt;project also provides opportunities for graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students to develop their skills in modeling and&lt;br/&gt;simulation of such phenomena, which are useful in financial,&lt;br/&gt;pharmaceutical, and biotechnology industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
