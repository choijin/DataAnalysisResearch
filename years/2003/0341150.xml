<AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is based on a recently completed CCLI proof-of-concept project that developed an undergraduate autonomous robotics class that was offered via the World&lt;br/&gt;Wide Web. In this project a full-development effort producing versions of the class for both (1) engineering and science undergraduates and (2) STEM educators and those studying for careers in STEM education is the focus. In addition to delivering these classes, tools and techniques that may be used to enable the offering of other types of science practica online are produced. Although all responsibilities are shared, primary responsibility for robots and software tools for the courses rest with Wright State University in Dayton, OH and primary responsibility for pedagogy and evaluation rest with Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH. This project directly addresses several of the NSF CCLI merit criteria and impact areas listed in the call for proposals. The work directly serves the educational needs of both science and engineering undergraduates and STEM educators. It also studies how project based courses can be offered online. Because many accrediting boards require project content, knowing how to manage project courses online is a necessary part of moving many degree programs online. This project contributes significantly both to a body of educational material and to the base of knowledge about how to develop effective online materials. The project significantly improves the content and pedagogical preparation of STEM educators. Further, the project is appropriate for and amenable to national distribution and adoption at a wide assortment of educational institutions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
