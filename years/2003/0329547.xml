<AbstractNarration>0329547&lt;br/&gt;Roselli&lt;br/&gt;The Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) Annual Meeting is scheduled to be held in Nashville, TN, October 1-4, 2003. The goals of the meeting are to present the latest research and development advances in the field of biomedical engineering, to provide students and industrial representatives an opportunity to discuss careers in biomedical engineering, and to serve as a focal point for discussions about the future of the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate and undergraduate student participation in the meeting is encouraged. Graduate student research awards are to be presented for outstanding research projects: a young investigator award stimulates careers in biomedical engineering; a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) poster session is included; and, a Career Fair and Career Workshop will be held. Annual meetings of the BMES Society provide an unusually good opportunity for students to learn about the newest scientific and engineering ideas in this rapidly growing field.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the meeting is high: the meeting is to advance knowledge and understanding within the field of biomedical engineering. Information presented at the meeting will have broad impact as many of the new techniques to be presented, both in education and in research, will be applicable to fields outside of biomedical engineering. The meeting brings together academic and industrial researchers, many of them women, at the same scientific sessions. This promotes collaboration between these individuals, and consequently impacts biomedical research in a broad sense. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstracts of presentations at the meeting will be placed on CD and distributed to participants and offered to key libraries. Inclusion of a large number of students at this meeting will ensure national dissemination of important scientific findings and career guidance.</AbstractNarration>
