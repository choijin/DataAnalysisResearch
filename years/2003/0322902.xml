<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Prop ID:  0322902 &lt;br/&gt;P I:  Bennett, Neil G.  et al&lt;br/&gt;Organization:National Bureau of Economic Research Inc &lt;br/&gt;Title:  The New York Research Data Center &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides initial support for a consortium of thirteen universities and research institutions to establish two new Research Data Centers (RDC) at Baruch College of the City University of New York and at Cornell University.  These RDCs will enable social science researchers in the New York Region to analyze a wide range of confidential Census Bureau data on firms and individuals without the need to establish long-term, long-distance research operations in another city.  The New York RDCs are interdisciplinary in structure and conduct, and hosts research emphasizing urban issues (such as housing and demographics) as well as international concerns (including immigration and the impact of trade).  &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  Research Data Centers enable researchers to analyze internal Census Bureau business data (such as the Longitudinal Research Database and the Censuses of Manufactures and Services) and individual-level data (including income data that are not top-coded, and geographic data down to the block level).   Notably, highly detailed data allow researchers to link information across time and data sources.  For example, RDC users can merge business data with longitudinal geographic information, or combine data on voting behavior with measures of individual economic well-being, or match individual records across Decennial Censuses to further the understanding of racial and ethnic identity.  As these examples suggest, the New York RDC will facilitate the conduct of research of significant scientific merit and policy relevance.  In addition, this research will fulfill the primary criterion for RDC-related activity-namely, that all projects aid the Census Bureau in improving the quality of either its data or its methods.  The New York RDC' s particular intellectual merits hinge on the breadth, depth, and strong policy orientation of the intellectual community that it will serve.  The comprehensiveness, diversity, and caliber of the sponsoring Consortium suggest that this RDC will be very active and productive.  The various policy centers represented in the Consortium also ensure that research will be policy-relevant.  Finally, the expected interdisciplinary focus on urban and international issues will introduce the benefits of the RDC program into new research and policy arenas. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  The opportunity to conduct research at the New York RDC will be especially advantageous to young scholars.  The intensive time investment required to master  RDC data analysis suggests that payoffs will be particularly high for RDC skills gained early in one's career.  The value of these skills and the research they promote are evidenced by the successful careers of many former RDC research assistants at prestigious academic and research institutions.  Thus, a New York Research Data Center is likely to specifically benefit research assistants and young scholars who pursue RDC research.  The high level of activity expected from the numerous Consortium members indicates that the New York RDC is likely to become a major training ground for empirical social scientists.  These beneficiaries will be drawn largely from the pool of staffs and students of Consortium members, which have unusually high numbers of historically underrepresented groups, such as minorities and women.   Furthermore, the New York RDC has the strong potential to provide a unique new forum to catalyze and promote collaborative, interdisciplinary research among New York area social scientists. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
