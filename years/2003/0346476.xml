<AbstractNarration>The Nebraska Research Infrastructure Improvement grant will continue development of the research and education infrastructure in genomics, cell biology, nano-materials science and mobile computing.  Infrastructure building will help to create the Metabolite Signaling Center (MSC) that will be used to study molecular response to metabolites using primarily genomic technologies and the Nebraska Center for Cell Biology at Creighton University that will be devoted to studying the dynamic behavior of cells using sophisticated optical imaging instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planning and development activities will be undertaken in nano-materials science and mobile computing - two state emerging research areas.  In nano-materials, the state seeks to coalesce its experience to create a nationally, competitive, multidisciplinary research team in an entirely new class of electronics and sensors.  The research area will also complement the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) in Nebraska that focuses on Nanoscale magnetic material research, with a limited device component.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In mobile computing, Nebraska proposes to stimulate economic development by forming partnerships with several local industries and establishing strong educational and research programs in this area.  The goal is to develop basic mobile computing infrastructure (hardware, software, and personnel) to increase the competitiveness for federal funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrative educational and outreach activities for K-12 students and teachers, undergraduates, graduates, faculty, and industry will be supported with funds from this project.  Activities will include Young Women in Science conferences, Young Nebraska Scientist (YNS) K-12 Summer Research Experience, Young Nebraska K-12 Classroom Modules, Community and State College outreach, faculty seed funding and fellowships, and university industry R&amp;D support.&lt;br/&gt;Institutions participating in the project include Nebraska's four research universities - University of Nebraska (Lincoln), University of Nebraska (Omaha), Nebraska Medical Sciences Center (NMSC), Creighton University (CU), Little Priest Tribal College (LPTC) two private, two public, and two community colleges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
