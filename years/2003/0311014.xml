<AbstractNarration>0311014&lt;br/&gt;Javier Garcia-Frias&lt;br/&gt;U of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves the study of communications systems consisting of multiple sources transmitting correlated information. The final objective is to exploit the correlation among the sources to reduce&lt;br/&gt;the total transmitted energy. The techniques developed in this research may have a broad impact in the area of sensor networks, making it possible to develop sensors requiring less transmitted power.  For example, a possible applications could be the development of less-power-invasive biosensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to reduce the total transmitted energy, the research will focus on the application of turbo-like codes, and specifically of linear codes with low-density generator matrix to i) achieve compression rates close to theoretical limits for a wide range of multi-terminal correlated sources (discrete or continuous, with and without memory) and ii) perform joint source-channel coding for a wide range of multi-terminal correlated sources and different channel environments. The proposed system is characterized by its simplicity at the encoder site. This simplicity facilitates the implementation of the proposed scheme in practical&lt;br/&gt;applications. Moreover, the encoding process is completely independent for each source, and it does not require knowledge about the correlation model or source statistics, which is of great interest in practical&lt;br/&gt;applications such as sensor networks and image/video compression. In order to achieve a performance close to the theoretical limits for source and joint source-channel coding, the statistics of the sources&lt;br/&gt;are estimated and exploited at the decoder in an adaptive fashion.</AbstractNarration>
