<AbstractNarration>This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Dr. Richard G. Finke at Colorado State University to distinguish between true homogeneous catalysts and hidden nanocluster or other heterogeneous catalysts.  Systems to be studied span a range of catalytic reactions where the question of whether the catalyst is homogeneous or a hetereogeneous nanocatalyst remains unanswered.  Reactions to be studied include: arene hydrogenation, alkane activation and functionalization, nickel-based polymer hydrogenations, sol-gel entrapped catalysts, and catalysis in ionic liquids.  This research group employs a 5-step method allowing the nature of the true catalyst to be established more rapidly and reliably.  This study endeavors to establish the "rules" whereby polymetallic nanocluster or other heterogeneous catalysts are formed from monometallic homogeneous precatalysts by investigating nanoclusters as a key conceptual bridge between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will impact discovery and understanding in the science of catalysis.  Teaching, training and learning will also be impacted by involving women and students from underrepresented groups in projects that emphasize experiments aimed at distinguishing between alternative hypotheses.  Partnerships with 4 researchers at other universities and with an industrial company are expected to enhance science and education infrastructure.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
