<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Carl Pollard will&lt;br/&gt;conduct two years of research on the specification and implementation&lt;br/&gt;of Higher Order Grammar (HOG), a new formal framework for theoretical&lt;br/&gt;and computational linguistics intended as a successor to Head-Driven&lt;br/&gt;Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG). The research is also expected&lt;br/&gt;to have significant consequences for other formal linguistic&lt;br/&gt;frameworks such as lexical-functional grammar (LFG), type-logical&lt;br/&gt;grammar (TLG), and possible-worlds semantics. HPSG, developed by&lt;br/&gt;Pollard and others in the 1980's and 1990's, is still one of the most&lt;br/&gt;widely employed formal linguistic framweworks, but has many&lt;br/&gt;undesirable features that arise from its highly nonstandard and&lt;br/&gt;idiosyncratic mathematical foundations, which make it unnecessarily&lt;br/&gt;difficult for nonspecialists to learn and use, and which create a&lt;br/&gt;barrier to collaboration with colleagues in adjacent disciplines&lt;br/&gt;(especially mathematics, logic, and computer science). While&lt;br/&gt;preserving the underlying model-theoretic (or constraint-based)&lt;br/&gt;approach characteristic of HPSG, HOG seeks to eliminate these problems by shifting to more established and better understood mathematical&lt;br/&gt;foundations, namely intuitionistic propositional logic (IPL) and its&lt;br/&gt;associated proof theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of particular interest in connection with meaning is the fact that the&lt;br/&gt;notion of POSSIBLE WORLD is definable in the HOL, enabling&lt;br/&gt;propositions to be treated as primitives and worlds as defined (the&lt;br/&gt;reverse of the situation in the standard Carnap-Kripke-Montague&lt;br/&gt;tradition); this setup gives us all the worlds we need (but no&lt;br/&gt;impossible worlds), while at the same time leading to novel and&lt;br/&gt;surprisingly simple solutions of longstanding semantic conundrums&lt;br/&gt;familiar to philosophical logicians (such as the logical omniscience&lt;br/&gt;(or granularity) problem and the Hesperus-Phosphorus problem). Attention will also be given to the syntax-phonology interface, working from the hypothesis that phonological interpretation can be treated as&lt;br/&gt;formally on a par with semantic interpretation (in terms of categorical&lt;br/&gt;logic,the syntax-semantics and syntax-phonology interfaces are both&lt;br/&gt;partial logical endofunctors).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
