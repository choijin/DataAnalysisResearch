<AbstractNarration>Vertical gene inheritance involves the transfer of genes from parents to offspring, whereas horizontal gene transfer (HGT) describes the exchange of genes between different species of organisms. This is a grant award to Drs. Barth Smets (University of Connecticut) and Tamar Barkay (Rutgers) to convene a scientific workshop on HGT-mediated gene flow in complex microbial communities to be held at Warrenton, VA on or about June 13-15, 2004. The purpose of the workshop is to initiate the integration of concepts and experimental approaches from diverse fields within the life sciences and engineering to understand the potential role of HGT in shaping the metabolic diversity and potential of microbial communities.  30 advanced-career scientists and 10 postdoctoral fellows active in the fields of evolutionary biology, molecular biology, and microbial ecology/environmental microbiology, with explicit expertise and interest in HGT will participate in presentations and discussions relevant to this very timely issue.  &lt;br/&gt;Data emerging from recent studies on microbial genome sequences and from molecular analysis of microbial communities from diverse environments suggest that HGT occurs far more frequently than imagined even five years ago.  HGT has a significant effect on microbial evolution, influences the genetic and metabolic diversity of extant microbial communities, and affects such processes as ecosystem function, the spread of antibiotic resistance, the emergence of new plant and animal pathogens, and the persistence of toxic and recalcitrant environmental contaminants.  As a result, HGT may have wide-reaching societal implications.  The proposed workshop, by fostering communication between scientists from seemingly unrelated scientific disciplines, is likely to spur new intellectual and conceptual frameworks for the integration of HGT into a greater understanding of microbial communities and their activities.  By including a significant number of early career scientists, as well as members of underrepresented groups in science, the gathering will also have a broader impact on education, training and diversity in the workplace.  A report summarizing presentations and discussions, and including recommendations for future research directions will result from this event.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
