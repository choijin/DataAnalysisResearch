<AbstractNarration>Proposal 0306752&lt;br/&gt;PIs: Carolyn Gordon, Scott Pauls, David Webb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: PROBLEMS IN GEOMETRIC ANALYISIS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the project will be inverse spectral geometry and&lt;br/&gt;analysis of Riemannian and sub-Riemannian geometries on nilmanifolds.&lt;br/&gt;Inverse spectral geometry is the study of the extent to which the&lt;br/&gt;geometry of a Riemannian manifold can be recovered from spectral data.&lt;br/&gt;Gordon and Webb will consider constructions of compact Riemannian&lt;br/&gt;manifolds with the same Laplace eigenvalue spectrum and compare their&lt;br/&gt;local and global geometry.  They, along with their collaborators, will&lt;br/&gt;also consider the spectrum of Schroedinger operators on line bundles&lt;br/&gt;over tori and spectral data for orbifolds.  For noncompact manifolds,&lt;br/&gt;the relevant spectral data are the scattering resonances and&lt;br/&gt;scattering phase.  Gordon, Webb, and Pauls, along with Peter Perry,&lt;br/&gt;will investigate possible constructions of Riemannian metrics with the&lt;br/&gt;same scattering data.  They will also consider isoscattering&lt;br/&gt;potentials for the Schroedinger operator and isoscattering obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;In the area of sub-Riemannian geometry, Pauls will continue working&lt;br/&gt;towards a better understanding of variational problems in Carnot&lt;br/&gt;groups, focusing on the regularity of minimal surfaces, the&lt;br/&gt;calculations of the best isoperimetric constant for the Heisenberg&lt;br/&gt;group, extensions of previous work to more general Carnot groups and&lt;br/&gt;on problems related to the spectral theory of the subLaplacian (joint&lt;br/&gt;with Doyle, Gordon and Webb).  He will also continue working with Mike&lt;br/&gt;Wolf (Rice University) on two fundamental problems in the theory of&lt;br/&gt;harmonic maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will address inverse spectral problems, inverse&lt;br/&gt;scattering problems, and sub-Riemannian geometry.  Inverse spectral&lt;br/&gt;geometry is rooted in spectroscopy, the problem of understanding the&lt;br/&gt;nature of a system from the characteristic frequencies of light or&lt;br/&gt;sound emitted.  The investigators will consider various constructions&lt;br/&gt;of objects (Riemannian manifolds such as planar domains, balls, or&lt;br/&gt;spheres) which have the same spectra and will compare their geometry&lt;br/&gt;in order to identify specific geometric properties that are not&lt;br/&gt;spectrally determined.  In the quantum mechanical description of a&lt;br/&gt;particle in a potential, one distinguishes between ordinary bound&lt;br/&gt;states and scattering states whose wave functions are nonnormalizable&lt;br/&gt;and whose energies can assume a continuum of possible values.  Inverse&lt;br/&gt;scattering theory seeks to understand as much as possible about the&lt;br/&gt;nature of a potential from the scattering behavior exhibited by&lt;br/&gt;particles interacting with the potential.  The investigators will&lt;br/&gt;address this problem by constructing and studying potentials with the&lt;br/&gt;same scattering resonances.  The investigations in sub-Riemannian&lt;br/&gt;geometry are motivated by a wealth of physical phenomena including&lt;br/&gt;problems in wheeled robotic control, satellite navigation and&lt;br/&gt;stabilization and thermodynamics.  At this point in time, relatively&lt;br/&gt;little is known about the general theory guiding these types of&lt;br/&gt;control phenomena.  Because of this, the investigators will focus on&lt;br/&gt;gaining a better understanding of the solutions to cost minimization&lt;br/&gt;problems on basic model spaces.  Specifically, the investigators are&lt;br/&gt;focused on constructing area minimizing surfaces in these settings in&lt;br/&gt;order to expose some of the fundamental geometric principles governing&lt;br/&gt;the solutions to these types of problems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
