<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program in the Division of Chemistry and the National Facilities Program in the Division of Materials Research, Linda Magid of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville is organizing a 3-day workshop at Florida State University.  The workshop has the following three goals:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a) To inform the chemistry and chem-bio communities of opportunities at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) and at the Center for Nanophase Materials Science (CNMS), both at Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL).  &lt;br/&gt;b) To query the community re: needs for instrumentation and sample environment development, among others.&lt;br/&gt;c) To develop concept teams that would be responsible for developing science cases and funding proposals for instrumentation, sample environments, supporting lab facilities, best practices for education of new users, and fellowship programs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide travel support and subsistence for 50 grad students, postdocs and/or junior faculty as well as 30 invited speakers.  The Joint Institute for Neutron Sciences (JINS), and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory at Florida State University are also providing partial support.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beamlines at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) should be operational in 2006.  Opportunities exist for scientific advances with neutron scattering and spectroscopic investigations there by chemists and by biologists working at the chemistry-biology interface.  However, the number of active neutron users in the US among these communities is woefully small.  This workshop will provide an opportunity to attract and inform potential new users in these communities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
