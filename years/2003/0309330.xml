<AbstractNarration>Rubenstein-Sundaresan Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Individual Behavior and Female Associations in Fission-Fusion Equid&lt;br/&gt;Societies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animal societies result from the sum of all relationships that develop among&lt;br/&gt;individuals within populations.  Many studies have demonstrated how&lt;br/&gt;environmental circumstances, both ecological and social, influence the benefits&lt;br/&gt;and costs associated with the various behavioral options available to&lt;br/&gt;individuals and thus how they these factors structure animal societies.  Yet in&lt;br/&gt;species where potential relationships are many and those that form are fluid,&lt;br/&gt;the link between environmental features and the relationships that develop are&lt;br/&gt;poorly understood. This project explores how ecological features, such as the&lt;br/&gt;distribution of food, water and predator-free sites, together with the&lt;br/&gt;demographic and social features, such as population density and sex ratio,&lt;br/&gt;shape individual relationships in the Grevy's zebra and wild ass, two&lt;br/&gt;evolutionarily closely related species exhibiting 'fissioning' and 'fusing'&lt;br/&gt;social systems. We have developed a novel model that predicts rules for the&lt;br/&gt;formation and breakdown of relationships in such 'open-membership' societies&lt;br/&gt;and forecasts the impact these rules will have on population-wide social&lt;br/&gt;patterns and processes.  Data will be gathered on two endangered equid species,&lt;br/&gt;Grevy's zebra and Onagers, from four sites. The four sites provide natural&lt;br/&gt;variation in the key environmental and social forces and will serve as an ideal&lt;br/&gt;system for testing the predictions of our model. The study will also provide&lt;br/&gt;useful information needed to improve conservation strategies for these species&lt;br/&gt;by educating students and the local populace and by demonstrating to natural&lt;br/&gt;resource managers how fundamental behavioral research can assist in designing&lt;br/&gt;effective management plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
