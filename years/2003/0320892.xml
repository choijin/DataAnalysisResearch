<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt; A closed-loop hydraulic loading and electronic data acquisition system will be acquired. The system will provide&lt;br/&gt;the  the capability to conduct load-controlled or displacement-controlled tests on structural&lt;br/&gt;materials and structural members under static, cyclic, or dynamic loading conditions. The data&lt;br/&gt;acquisition system will be used in conjunction with the hydraulic loading system and will allow&lt;br/&gt;for the simultaneous monitoring of eighty channels of data (strain, load, displacement, etc.). The&lt;br/&gt;equipment requested represents a significant upgrade from the testing systems currently used by&lt;br/&gt;the PIs. The current loading system is limited to static testing, and load can be applied but not&lt;br/&gt;controlled via the manual open-loop system. Current data acquisition equipment is limited in&lt;br/&gt;scanning speed and precision, and cannot accommodate dynamic testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The College of Engineering is implementing a seven year strategic plan, and&lt;br/&gt;Structural Engineering is categorized as a thrust area on which emphasis will be placed with&lt;br/&gt;respect to support and development of infrastructure. In conjunction with this plan, a new 9500&lt;br/&gt;square foot experimental laboratory for research and teaching in structural engineering is&lt;br/&gt;scheduled to open on campus in 2004. The testing system requested in this proposal was&lt;br/&gt;designed with this in mind, as the equipment will be usable in both the existing laboratory and the&lt;br/&gt;new facility. The systems designed are also easily upgradeable to accommodate long-term needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Through a variety of mechanismsl, undergraduates will have the opportunity to use the requested equipment to conduct&lt;br/&gt;research. Underrepresented groups will benefit as a result of the continued commitment  the College of Engineering toward providing opportunities for these groups in engineering education.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
