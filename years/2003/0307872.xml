<AbstractNarration>    ABSTRACT: Prop 0307872 (Conference on Ergodic Theory)                                                &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;                                                     ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a follow up of the successful workshop we organized on June 08-09 2002, we are&lt;br/&gt;planning a workshop on ergodic theory at the Department of Mathematics at UNC Chapel Hill on February 14-16, 2003. This academic year coincides with the retirement year of Prof. Hillel Furstenberg. Hence the main topic at the 2003 workshop will be on problems related to the nonconventional ergodic averages he introduced in his famous ergodic proof of Szemeredi's theorem on arithmetic progressions. We expect to bring together 20  invited speakers and 10-15 graduate students, Post Doc and junior faculty .Each speaker is expected to give in his/her talk a mix of new results and surveys.  Such talks allow junior researchers to be introduced smoothly to active and well known research areas in ergodic theory. We will also have talks in other areas of ergodic theory such as bifurcation theory, finite rank systems and topological dynamics. The list of those having already expressed their desire to participate includes Prof. H. Furstenberg, V. Bergelson, A. Leibman, B. Kra (Junior faculty), A. Tempelman to name a few. As in the first workshop, proceedings of the conference will be published with Contemporary Mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;     The workshop will be advertised broadly to the mathematics community. Advertisements have been made at Howard University. Others will be posted on the NAM and AARMS lists and web sites. We expect interested mathematicians from underrepresented groups to participate. &lt;br/&gt;  The workshop is partially supported by the Department of Mathematics at UNC &lt;br/&gt;Chapel Hill. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
