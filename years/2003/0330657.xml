    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Southwest Missouri State University under the direction of Dr. J. Greene to improve the Bull Shoals Field Station (BSFS) facilities by drilling a well, installing a sewage disposal system, and replacing the electrical wiring and plumbing in the current facility. An environmentally sound sewage disposal system is required because of the location of BSFS on the shore of Bull Shoals Lake and within the White River Basin watershed. In addition, such a facility will serve to educate the public regarding environmentally responsible wastewater treatment facilities. The replacement of the plumbing along with the new sewage disposal system will create a more sanitary and environmentally responsible facility. A new well must be drilled to provide potable water. In addition, electrical wiring must be replaced for safety purposes, and will allow for a reliable source of electricity for IT and laboratory equipment. Improved facilities will enable scientists to perform more research and analyses on site, dramatically increasing the number and quality of investigations that can be performed at the BSFS. The impact of these infrastructure enhancements will allow researchers, university classes, K-12 school field trips, and community groups access to a fully functional facility and allow for longer periods of stay. BSFS will also be used to educate the public about science and environmental stewardship.</AbstractNarration>
