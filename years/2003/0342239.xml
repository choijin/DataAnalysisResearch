<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Awards:  DMS 0342388, 0342239, 0342325&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigators:  Yang Kuang, Val Smith, Marilyn S. Smith&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This multi-campus team is studying processes within a single&lt;br/&gt;biological host that can be described by models inspired by ecological&lt;br/&gt;stoichiometry, the study of the balance of energy and multiple&lt;br/&gt;chemical resources (usually elements) in ecological&lt;br/&gt;interactions. These concepts have been broadened by their extension to&lt;br/&gt;biological stoichiometry, which has proven to be an important new lens&lt;br/&gt;through which we can view and understand complex biological&lt;br/&gt;interactions. Within this general theory, the cycling and utilization&lt;br/&gt;of energy and multiple nutrients by organisms and their constituent&lt;br/&gt;cells occupies a central position. With its emphasis on the flow of&lt;br/&gt;elemental matter, such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus,&lt;br/&gt;stoichiometric theory covers multiple biological scales. It also&lt;br/&gt;allows, via rigid physical and chemical constraints, the construction&lt;br/&gt;of robust mechanistic and predictive models. Originally formulated and&lt;br/&gt;verified in the fields of limnology and plant ecology, biological&lt;br/&gt;stoichiometry has recently been applied at physiological scales to&lt;br/&gt;such diverse areas as organism development and tumor growth. In this&lt;br/&gt;proposal we aim to synthesize and apply theoretical and empirical&lt;br/&gt;approaches to biological stoichiometry within the grand framework of&lt;br/&gt;internal disease.  Recent headline-grabbing findings that connect&lt;br/&gt;nutritional factors to disease dynamics indicate there is an&lt;br/&gt;increasing need for stoichiometry-based mathematical models of&lt;br/&gt;internal disease that track the effects of potentially limiting&lt;br/&gt;resources.  The proposed work weaves together threads of theoretical&lt;br/&gt;and experimental research. Our primary aim is the construction of&lt;br/&gt;predictive and verifiable theoretical models which can begin to&lt;br/&gt;explicitly deal with the effects of stoichiometric interactions in&lt;br/&gt;within-host disease dynamics. Such models will be built in a modular&lt;br/&gt;fashion, starting with simple deterministic models, and then&lt;br/&gt;progressively adding stochasticity, spatial heterogeneity, and&lt;br/&gt;genetics. At each step the models will be challenged, calibrated, and&lt;br/&gt;tested by in vitro laboratory experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will have a broad impact in both science research&lt;br/&gt;and education, and eventually in internal disease management and&lt;br/&gt;treatment. Regarding the former, our research team is truly&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary, with group members in mathematics, theoretical&lt;br/&gt;physics, ecology, and biomedicine. Our collaborative efforts will&lt;br/&gt;provide undergraduate and graduate students and junior scientists of&lt;br/&gt;diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds with first-hand educational&lt;br/&gt;experience in cross-disciplinary communication and exploration.  The&lt;br/&gt;current proposal is a step towards new ways to understand disease,&lt;br/&gt;aiming to develop robust and experimentally calibrated mathematical&lt;br/&gt;theories of disease-host interactions that can be applied to a wide&lt;br/&gt;variety of diseases. We firmly believe that such theories have a&lt;br/&gt;central role to play in present and future research. These grants for&lt;br/&gt;proposals submitted as a collaborative proposal from three&lt;br/&gt;institutions are made under the Joint DMS/NIGMS Initiative to Support&lt;br/&gt;Research Grants in the Area of Mathematical Biology.  This is a joint&lt;br/&gt;competition sponsored by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the&lt;br/&gt;Directorate for Biological Sciences at the National Science Foundation&lt;br/&gt;and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the&lt;br/&gt;National Institutes of Health.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
