<AbstractNarration>This award provides funds for student and postdoc participation in the 2003 Gordon Research Conference on Quantum Control of Light and Matter.  The field of Coherent Control has grown beyond the initial objectives of the control of uni-molecular processes to providing attractive strategies to solving scientific problems as well as paving the way  for new applications in a broad range of disciplines.  The objective of the conference is to bring together internationally leading scientists as well as young researchers and students active or specially interested in the field of quantum control.  The conference shall be a forum to present the newest research results and trends in this rapidly expanding field.  The interdisciplinary character of the field will be emphasized.</AbstractNarration>
