    <AbstractNarration>Gautier&lt;br/&gt;0331237&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal develops an undergraduate-level tool and associated extensible instruction centered around quantitative inquiry about climate radiative forcing. Climate radiative forcing is associated with enhanced greehouse effect gases, cloud and land surface changes, ozone depletion and aerosol concentration increases. The approach is to use the scientific inquiry process as the main vehicle to acquire understanding about radiative forcing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A research-grade radiative transfer model (SBDART, http://www.crseo.ucsb.edu/esrg/pauls_dir/), will be the centerpiece of this inquiry-guided instruction. Originally developed for research purposes, the model has been recently adapted for undergraduate instruction and tested by the PI in her classroom. An interrogative approach, similar to that used by scientists and scholars in the production of new knowledge is applied by students working to acquire and understand an important concept in climate studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of "big" questions are developed as a starting point for the pedagogical activities through which students develop further explanation-seeking questions. Quantitative answers, based on the application of the model, and qualitative answers based on scientific information gathered from the web, are collaboratively constructed by the students. The evaluation activity is designed to assess the transformation of students' questions, the quality and nature of information gathered, and the advancement of student competency and the level of understanding acheived through these activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The teaching tools produced by this grant are available through Digital Library for Earth Science Education (DLESE, http://www.dlese.org/) and the National Science Digital Library (NSDL, http://www.nsdl.org/).</AbstractNarration>
