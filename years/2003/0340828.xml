<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Indiana University under the direction of Dr. Peggy Schultz to investigate the role of the soil community in the restoration of the prairie plant community.  &lt;br/&gt;The project involves the investigation of the relationship between prairie plants and one group of soil organisms, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF).  AMF are an ancient lineage of fungi that associate with the roots of most land plants.  Typically they form mutualistic relationships with their host plants.  AMF take up soil nutrients and transport them back to the host plant roots.  In exchange host plants transport carbohydrates to the AMF.  Through this project, soil organisms that are likely to facilitate the establishment of prairie plant species in restorations will be identified and grown.  These organisms will then be tested to determine their benefit to a variety of prairie plant species and their growth in association with plants.  The project will also test the growth response of plants associated with AMF species isolated from undisturbed prairie as well as nearby disturbed plant communities.  In addition, she will develop molecular markers to identify AMF species within the roots of host plants.  Through these studies inferences into the role of the AMF community in plant community dynamics will be made. This research will contribute to basic knowledge of a ubiquitous group of soil organisms and may suggest practical approaches to accelerate the restoration of the diversity of prairie plant communities and perhaps other native plant communities.  &lt;br/&gt;This research will provide a framework to understand the role of the soil community in prairie restoration.  She anticipates that this work will aid restoration practitioners and shed light on the ecology of the soil community in tall grass prairie communities. Moreover, this project will allow the principle investigator to develop research and educational programs that promote an understanding of ecology, highlighting the ecological restoration of native lands. In addition, Dr. Schultz is currently developing an outreach program to primary and secondary schools to supplement the science curriculum by developing interactive research experiences for students.  She envisions establishing native plant communities at schools that students will help establish, monitor, and use for experimentation.  Dr. Schultz will be working with undergraduate and graduate students as well and faculty and staff at Indiana University to facilitate this outreach program. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
