<AbstractNarration> &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What was the nature of the first animals?  How have animals characteristics evolved since &lt;br/&gt;their origin?  How can we best utilize such knowledge?  These are a few of the questions that can &lt;br/&gt;be illuminated by comparative and evolutionary studies of animals.  Studies of  .worms and &lt;br/&gt;flies,. the best-studied invertebrate model systems of modern biology, have provided &lt;br/&gt;considerable insight into such questions.  Nevertheless, most recent phylogenies of animals &lt;br/&gt;suggest that nematodes (worms) and arthropods (flies) not only may be relatively derived animals &lt;br/&gt;but may also share some derived characteristics.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The same recent phylogenies (and older ones as well) generally agree that the basal, non-&lt;br/&gt;bilaterian metazoans are represented by four groups: sponges, placozoans, cnidarians, and &lt;br/&gt;ctenophores.  At this time, sponges would seem deserving of an entirely separate treatment, in &lt;br/&gt;part because they exhibit several primitive features and in part because their systematics is in a &lt;br/&gt;state of flux.  The remaining three groups include: (1) ctenophores, which are often considered to &lt;br/&gt;be the sister group of the bilaterians, (2) cnidarians, which include some of the best-studied basal &lt;br/&gt;metazoans, and (3) placozoans, which exhibit a number of unique and enigmatic characteristics &lt;br/&gt;including the smallest genome yet found in a metazoan.  In evolutionary and comparative studies &lt;br/&gt;it is often the character states of the basal taxa that have a decisive influence on interpretations of &lt;br/&gt;character state changes throughout the cladogram.  Without detailed knowledge of the basal &lt;br/&gt;metazoans, it is impossible to provide an effective comparative framework for animal evolution. &lt;br/&gt;Developing a clearer picture of character evolution in the metazoans requires both robust &lt;br/&gt;phylogenies and well-documented character states of these crucial basal taxa.  With the recent &lt;br/&gt;initiation of genomic projects using cnidarians (e.g. the hydroid EST project and the &lt;br/&gt;Nematostella BAC library project), it would be timely to consider what sorts of cnidarian model &lt;br/&gt;systems should be developed and how these systems can be used.  Considerations of how &lt;br/&gt;ctenophores and placozoans can complement and contrast to cnidarian models are also essential.   &lt;br/&gt;In this context, we propose a Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) &lt;br/&gt;symposium, .Model systems for the basal metazoans: cnidarians, ctenophores, and placozoans..  &lt;br/&gt;The goals of the symposium will be to bring together a diverse group of molecular, cellular, &lt;br/&gt;organismal, and evolutionary biologists to discuss appropriate basal metazoan models and the &lt;br/&gt;topics of integrative and comparative biology that these models are particularly relevant to.  A &lt;br/&gt;simultaneous SICB symposium, .Sponges: new views of old animals. will nicely complement &lt;br/&gt;our efforts.  To have a significant impact on the subsequent development of these models, these &lt;br/&gt;discussions must occur soon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every effort has been made to invite a diverse group of participants, including women, &lt;br/&gt;people of minority background, as well as graduate students, post-docs, and junior faculty.  A &lt;br/&gt;noteworthy feature of the SICB annual meeting is its emphasis on young investigators.  &lt;br/&gt;Typically, more than half of those in attendance are Ph.D. students, postdoctoral fellow, and &lt;br/&gt;young faculty.  Qualified undergraduates and high school teachers from the surrounding &lt;br/&gt;community are also welcomed.  SICB mounts an extensive program of discounted registration &lt;br/&gt;and subsistence support for Ph.D. students; literally every graduate student member who presents &lt;br/&gt;at the meeting and requests such support will receive it.  Thus, SICB symposium participants &lt;br/&gt;receive exposure to a broad cross-section of the relevant scientific community.  Symposium &lt;br/&gt;proceedings will be published in Integrative and Comparative Biology.</AbstractNarration>
