<AbstractNarration>0349610&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project addresses the development of&lt;br/&gt;Innovative Ultra-Broadband Ferrite Circulators/Isolators. A conventional 3-port ferrite&lt;br/&gt;stripline junction circulator involves a low-Q ferrite stripline resonator so that at the&lt;br/&gt;circulation frequencies standing-wave resonant modes are excited dumping microwave &lt;br/&gt;energy from the input port to the output port but not the isolation port. Operation of a &lt;br/&gt;conventional ferrite circulator is nonreciprocal, and the transmission bandwidth is &lt;br/&gt;roughly proportional to the inverse of the Q-factor of the resonator, due to the&lt;br/&gt;standing-wave nature of the excited resonant modes. A new picture of ferrite-circulator&lt;br/&gt;operation utilizing traveling-wave coupling of microwave signals at the circulation &lt;br/&gt;frequencies haa been discovered. This is in contrast to the operation of the conventional&lt;br/&gt;circulators employing standing waves for coupling. As such, ultra-broadband operation of&lt;br/&gt;the circulators results, whose bandwidth has been measured in Phase I to cover from 1.6 to&lt;br/&gt;16 GHz for a prototype device. It is not possible to acheive this bandwidth with a conventional&lt;br/&gt;circulator. This leads to a new generation of ferrite circulators or isolators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the LTCC technology facilitates mass production in large quantities. As such, generic &lt;br/&gt;microwave circulators and isolators can be fabricated at low costs suitable for universal&lt;br/&gt;applications covering across many frequency bands. Ferrite-circulator operation does not &lt;br/&gt;require a ferrite resonator anymore. This requirement has been constantly enforced by the&lt;br/&gt;operation of a conventional circulator for more than 50 years. There is always a tremendous&lt;br/&gt;need for circulators or isolators which are able to provide signal-path separation or protection&lt;br/&gt;over many frequency bands, as demanded by the measurement of a broadband signal and by a&lt;br/&gt;narrow electromagnetic pulse.</AbstractNarration>
