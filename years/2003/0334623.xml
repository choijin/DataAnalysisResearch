<AbstractNarration>The Information and Data Management Principal Investigators' Workshop (IDM03) is held September 14 - 16, 2003 in Seattle, Washington.  The objective of the annual workshops is bringing together researchers and practitioners to discuss the focus topics as well as to identify and elaborate on particular emphases for future activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IDM03 Workshop is focusing on bringing together IDM researchers as representatives of two communities; that is, information management (often referred to as database management), along with selected industry and government invitees, to: (1) cooperatively (i) analyze and focus on the research and development issues of problems that are fundamental in making progress towards this new challenge; (ii) specify areas where major breakthroughs appear possible; (iii) identify needed collaborations (e.g., inter-disciplinary, academic-industry); and (iv) identify research initiatives and facilities needed to meet this and future challenges; (2) share, provide demonstrations and interact with each other on the objectives, contributions and challenges of major research activities funded by the IDM Program and explore fruitful collaboration and synergism; (3) provide an opportunity to NSF program officers, other funding agencies, and industry representatives to learn more about the current research efforts and successes of projects funded by IDM, and for such officers to share their program highlights and concerns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IDM03 Workshop Web site (http://www2.cs.washington.edu/nsf2003/) will contain reports on all projects currently funded by the IDM Program, providing up-to-date project information searchable by different criteria, including information relevant to NSF's Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) goals (e.g., connections between discoveries and their use in service to society).  The IDM03 Workshop discussions will result in a report that will help in formulating future directions of research in IDM and related areas and will suggest promising modalities of research in academia and industry with an aim to foster innovation as well as technology transfer.  The Web site will also include links to other relevant material.</AbstractNarration>
