<AbstractNarration>PI: James K. Wight, Univ. of Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Merit: &lt;br/&gt;For most major earthquakes, the largest loss of life is typically caused by the total or &lt;br/&gt;partial collapse of low-cost housing units that have not been adequately designed and/or &lt;br/&gt;constructed to resist seismic forces.  The purpose of this proposal is to launch an &lt;br/&gt;exploratory investigation of the use of high performance concrete for the construction of &lt;br/&gt;low-cost seismic resistant housing units.  The high performance features to be studied &lt;br/&gt;include self-compacting concretes and the additional of a low percentage of steel fibers to &lt;br/&gt;the concrete mix.  Designs for both precast and cast-in-place housing units will be &lt;br/&gt;investigated.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;This proposal will be used to initiate a long-term cooperative research effort aimed at the &lt;br/&gt;development of a variety of standard designs for low-cost housing units in moderate to &lt;br/&gt;high seismic risk zones.  The development of such standard designs should prove to be &lt;br/&gt;very beneficial throughout Mexico, as well as other Central and South American &lt;br/&gt;countries that have access to similar construction materials for low-cost housing.  A &lt;br/&gt;short-term goal of this cooperative research effort will be the development of proposals to &lt;br/&gt;use the NSF-NEES facilities to dynamically test these standard housing units.  The long-&lt;br/&gt;term goal is the reduction in loss of life in future earthquakes.     &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
