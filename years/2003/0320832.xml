<AbstractNarration> Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University will design and&lt;br/&gt;build the `Region 2' tracking chambers for the Qweak experiment at &lt;br/&gt;Jefferson Lab.  This experiment will make a high precision measurement &lt;br/&gt;at very low momentum transfer of the proton's weak charge, which is its &lt;br/&gt;coupling to the neutral Z boson.  A high precision value of the weak&lt;br/&gt;mixing angle at low momentum transfer will be extracted, thus providing&lt;br/&gt;a sensitive test of the predicted energy scale dependence of this quantity&lt;br/&gt;in the electroweak standard model.  A failure to observe this expected&lt;br/&gt;behavior could provide evidence for physics beyond the presently accepted&lt;br/&gt;Standard Model.  There are many candidate extensions to the Standard Model&lt;br/&gt;that would generate observable effects in this experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The Region 2 wire chambers are an essential component of the particle&lt;br/&gt;tracking system, which is needed in order to precisely measure the&lt;br/&gt;kinematics of the elastically scattered electrons, as well as for&lt;br/&gt;critical studies of experimental backgrounds.  The chambers will consist&lt;br/&gt;of two sets of 50 cm x 50 cm horizontal drift chambers.  Each drift &lt;br/&gt;chamber will have a total of 6 planes of wires.  The expected resolution&lt;br/&gt;will be about 200 microns, providing an angular resolution of &lt; 1 mrad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The Region 2 drift chambers will provide quality educational experiences&lt;br/&gt;for both graduate and undergraduate students.  The timescale of the &lt;br/&gt;project is well matched to the typical timescale of a graduate student's &lt;br/&gt;time in graduate school, so the student will get to participate in all &lt;br/&gt;hardware and software phases of the project.  The tasks needed to &lt;br/&gt;complete the project include design and construction of the chambers, the &lt;br/&gt;front-end electronics, and the gas handling system, testing of the finished &lt;br/&gt;product, implementation in the Qweak experiment, and data analysis and tracking&lt;br/&gt;code development when the experiment takes data.  We expect to involve&lt;br/&gt;two graduate students and at least two undergraduate students in this&lt;br/&gt;effort, under the supervision of the faculty and senior research staff&lt;br/&gt;at Virginia Tech.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
