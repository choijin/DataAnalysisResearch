<AbstractNarration>Seshaiyer&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator organizes a symposium on mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;computational modeling of biological systems at Texas Tech&lt;br/&gt;University from November 6-8, 2003.  The conference consists of a&lt;br/&gt;series of lectures given by outstanding scholars who have&lt;br/&gt;contributed extensively to the central theme.  The talks cover a&lt;br/&gt;broad range of topics, including the mathematics of cardiac&lt;br/&gt;arrhythmias, past successes and future challenges in continuum&lt;br/&gt;mechanics of soft biological tissues, a 20 year retrospective of&lt;br/&gt;the Chay-Keizer model, tumor mechanics, computational biofluid&lt;br/&gt;dynamics, and computational models of cardiovascular surgery&lt;br/&gt;planning.  The main objectives of the meeting are to: (a)&lt;br/&gt;disseminate the most recent advances in mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;computational approaches in understanding biological systems, (b)&lt;br/&gt;increase the level of awareness in nurturing mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;computational research in biological systems, (c) to train senior&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral students and early career&lt;br/&gt;scientists in interdisciplinary aspects of problem solving, and&lt;br/&gt;(d) initiate and promote new collaborations between mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and all areas of science, engineering and science education.&lt;br/&gt;     The theme of the meeting is the opportunity to use&lt;br/&gt;mathematical and computational tools to understand biological&lt;br/&gt;systems.  The meeting includes experts giving lectures on diverse&lt;br/&gt;topics in the underlying theme, with the expectation to provide&lt;br/&gt;members of the mathematical and engineering community an&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to learn about new research venues.  Participants&lt;br/&gt;include undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;researchers.  The meeting provides a forum for the exposure and&lt;br/&gt;exchange of ideas, methods, and results in the underlying theme&lt;br/&gt;of the conference.  The conference provides an excellent&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to assess the current developments and future&lt;br/&gt;directions in this area.  Special efforts are made to encourage&lt;br/&gt;women and underrepresented minorities to pursue careers in&lt;br/&gt;science, especially in interdisciplinary areas that bridge the&lt;br/&gt;biological, mathematical, and computational sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
