<AbstractNarration>0323384&lt;br/&gt;Mukherjee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports research visits by Professor Biswanath Mukherjee, a postdoctoral fellow, and a graduate student of the University of California at Davis, to collaborate in research on Optical Networks with Professor Young-Chon Kim and his research group of Chonbuk National University of Jeonbuk, Korea. The two groups bring complementary expertise to their collaborative research.  Professor Mukherjee has worked in optical network architectures for many years, and has particular expertise in survivable optical networks for bandwidth provisioning (i.e., circuit switching) applications. Professor Kim has been conducting cutting-edge research on Optical Burst Switching (OBS) networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "Optical Internet "concept is gaining rapid acceptance. Next-generation optical networks are expected to provide users with more flexible and dynamic use of network resources according to the variation of traffic pattern and will support the rapid growth of Internet traffic. Optical networking is a high priority in Korea where there is deep penetration of fiber in the network infrastructure, and where industry, university, and government are working in unison to achieve the collective vision of the Optical Internet.  Optical Burst Switching with Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) is a promising approach to satisfy the bandwidth and flexibility requirements of future backbone networks. The collaborative research proposed by Drs. Mukherjee and Kim focuses on survivable network architectures and protocols that can combat various types of failures in OBS networks. This topic has received little attention in the literature so far. In addition, the joint research effort will provide tight coupling between network architectures (Mukherjee) and device capabilities (Kim).  Without a sound knowledge of device capabilities and limitations, one can produce architectures that may not be easily realizable; similarly, research on new optical devices, conducted without the concept of a useful system, can lead to sophisticated technology with limited or no usefulness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research include enhanced training and international experience for the participating graduate students. The research program at UC Davis is one of very few that is producing PhD graduates with expertise in optical networking (as opposed to optical communications). The proposed US-Korea research collaboration will provide valuable training to these graduate students, and prepare them well to handle the challenges of the future global telecommunications in general and the optical networking industry in particular.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
