<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks to address the governing physics - phase behavior and structure-function interrelationships - of functional block copolymers uniquely derived from living free radical polymerization techniques, and to exploit the physical properties of these novel materials in selected advanced applications.  Specifically, two classes of materials will be examined: polymers containing fluorinated blocks, and concentrated polyelectrolyte block copolymer solutions and gels. Fluorine-containing block copolymers provide the opportunity to explore the very strongly-segregated regime of the phase diagram at moderate molecular weights. Incorporation of a sacrificial block within these materials will produce nanoporous thin films with inherently low dielectric constants, making them attractive candidates for intermetal insulators in micro-electronics. As for concentrated polyelectrolyte solutions and gels, their amphiphilicity and ionic character render additional morphological richness and complexity. Adding moderate amounts of selective solvents (e.g., water) and adjusting pH can induce changes in microdomains sizes, and even transformations between ordered phases. The versatility of these materials will be further demonstrated through the construction of stimulusresponsive device and device components, such as mechanical switches and valves. An improved understanding of these materials - their nanoscale structures and how these structures affect macroscopic properties - will lead to the ability to engineer functional block copolymers with tailored properties a priori.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This research program is highly interdisciplinary; students involved will be fully immersed in polymer synthesis, structural characterization, device design, fabrication, and testing. The broad range of concepts and techniques they are exposed to will build self-confidence, and will provide flexibility in their future careers.  Central to the educational outreach component of this proposal is undergraduate and graduate curriculum development. Current and emerging research concepts, characterization techniques, and processing technologies relevant to the proposed work will be implemented in an undergraduate core Chemical Engineering laboratory course to accurately reflect the changing trends in the profession. A graduate survey course on polymer characterization that emphasizes hands-on experimentation with existing state-of-the-art facilities on campus will be developed simultaneously. One of the missions of the proposed educational program is to strengthen and solidify the science curriculum in Austin's public elementary and middle schools by encouraging hands-on, inquiry-based learning. The learning materials and assessment tools that are being developed will be published on the internet so they are accessible to elementary school science teachers elsewhere. To promote science and engineering awareness among school children, a Nano-Exploratory Exhibit will be set up in Austin's Children Museum. The PI and her group will also be hosting exchange students and teachers from UT Pan America, UT Brownsville, and UT El Peso through the "Nano@Border" Educational Outreach Program.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
