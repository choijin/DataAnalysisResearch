<AbstractNarration>The Nineteenth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles will be held at Bolton's&lt;br/&gt;Landing, Lake George, New York, October 19-22, 2003. For over 30 years SOSP has been the&lt;br/&gt;leading forum for innovative research in operating systems. Like its predecessors, SOSP&lt;br/&gt;2003 will bring together researchers from around the world to present and discuss the&lt;br/&gt;latest results. In addition to such traditional topics as the performance, functionality,&lt;br/&gt;and security of kernels, file systems, and networks, this year's conference will place&lt;br/&gt;increasing attention on such emerging topics as ubiquitous and mobile computing, sensor&lt;br/&gt;networks, overlay and peer-to-peer communications, and power management. Particularly&lt;br/&gt;noteworthy papers will be forwarded to ACM Transactions on Computer Systems for possible&lt;br/&gt;journal publication. There will also be poster and work-in-progress sessions for the&lt;br/&gt;presentation of promising preliminary work.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding to support the attendance of 20 US-based graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;Participation in leading conferences is an extremely important part of the graduate&lt;br/&gt;school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and&lt;br/&gt;to be exposed to leading edge work. The support requested in this proposal will make&lt;br/&gt;possible the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend.</AbstractNarration>
