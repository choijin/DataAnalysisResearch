<AbstractNarration>Prop ID: 0317699 &lt;br/&gt;P I: Feenstra, Robert C. &lt;br/&gt;Organization:National Bureau of Economic Research Inc &lt;br/&gt;Title: Research on Improved Methods of Estimating Production and Income Across Nations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a demonstrated demand for internationally comparable measures of purchasing power parities (PPP) and of national accounts aggregates across space as well as time. Systematic research on comparing PPP's across countries began with the UN International Comparison Project in 1968, where benchmark comparisons were jointly directed by Irving Kravis at Penn and continued under EU, OECD and World Bank direction. An extension of this work on the expenditure side is embodied in the Penn World Tables (PWT), which includes over 20 variables covering 170 countries for some or all of the years from 1950-2000, a widely used research and teaching tool. In a parallel fashion, studies on the production side have been carried out for a large number of countries at the University of Groningen and made available for the use of researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal is to a) more clearly distinguish conceptually and empirically between production and income of countries, drawing on the expertise of the investigators and consultants on international trade, prices, and productivity measures from the Center for International Data at the University of California, Davis and the Groningen Growth and Development Center in the Netherlands; and b) to improve the way in which price parities used in research are estimated and aggregated for expenditure and production categories, research that will additionally involve the School of Economics at the University of Queensland in Brisbane. These improvements will focus on clearly indicating the errors involved in the estimates, and providing new and/or improved measures of the economic structures of economies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the research will be to a) suggest estimation techniques that would improve temporal indexes like the CPI and spatial comparisons of prices, production, and income such as those contained in PWT and which other groups like the OECD and World Bank produce; b) the proposal involves improvements in the dissemination and coverage of PWT, including additional variables, preliminary current year estimates of PPP's that will have more policy applications, and the development of interactive software that will be of use to researchers and for students as a pedagogical tool; and c) as a by-product of the research, the research centers will develop an initiative to create an archive of international prices with associated product and outlet characteristics that would be made available for users on the web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
