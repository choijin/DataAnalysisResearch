<AbstractNarration>Within the social sciences much more attention traditionally has been paid to the study of violence, aggression, and warfare than to the multitude of ways that people use to deal with conflicts successfully without violence. Within anthropology the use of cross-cultural methods to study of conflict prevention, resolution, and reconciliation is practically non-existent. In this project an anthropologist will investigate various kinds of conflict management processes, specifically, conflict prevention techniques, nonviolent beliefs, conflict resolution mechanisms, and reconciliation processes used in numerous societies. The project will ask: do certain psychocultural mechanisms prevent aggression within and between societies?  Second, do beliefs favoring nonviolence contribute to low levels of internal and external aggression?  Third, do certain conflict resolution mechanisms contribute to low levels of aggression within and between societies?  Fourth, do conflict prevention and conflict resolution mechanisms have interactive effects?  Finally, are reconciliation processes inversely related to internal and external aggression? &lt;br/&gt;To address these research questions, the investigator will utilize the ethnographic data in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS), an established data base on 186 societies worldwide, carefully selected to represent culture areas. In this study, 42 new descriptive and independent variables will be coded for the societies in the SCCS.  These data codes then will be used to test specific hypotheses related to the central research questions. Published data codes for internal aggression (e.g., assaults, homicide) and external aggression (warfare) already exist for the societies in the SCCS and also will be utilized during data analysis. This study will provide new descriptive and cross-cultural frequency data on conflict prevention, resolution, and reconciliation mechanisms-topics that previously have received minimal attention-and also will advance anthropological understanding of conflict management by testing specific hypotheses regarding the effects of prevention mechanisms, nonviolent beliefs, conflict resolution techniques, and reconciliation processes on levels of internal and external aggression. The study is the first to examine reconciliation processes using cross-cultural data.  &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include new knowledge on conflict management and reconciliation that has relevance for preventing and reducing violence and war. The findings on how violence is prevented and conflicts managed without violence across a worldwide spectrum of societies should provide some generalizable principles that could be very useful to policy-makers concerned with reducing violence. By investigating the human ability to prevent and manage conflict in ways that do not entail violence, this study provides a balancing perspective to numerous writings that place a one-sided emphasis on the human capacity for violence and war-making. An overemphasis on aggression can become a self-fulfilling prophecy as people become discouraged about the possibility of developing alternative approaches for handling conflict at various social levels. By contrast, a broad cross-cultural perspective on conflict management may contribute to the creative application of new approaches and strategies for the successful prevention and resolution conflicts within and between societies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
