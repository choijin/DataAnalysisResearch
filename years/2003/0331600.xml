<AbstractNarration>This award provides continuation of support for the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR), which provides a critical service to the nation's research institutions by developing and disseminating guidelines for laboratory animal care, breeding, and use.  ILAR's goal is to improve the humane and scientifically valid use of laboratory animals, as well as the availability, quality and care of laboratory animals. ILAR accomplishes this goal through a core program, carried out by its staff, and a special-projects program, carried out by National Academies- appointed experts. Both programs are guided by the ILAR Council, a 15-member advisory council comprised of experts in laboratory animal physiology, genetics, behavior, medicine, bioethics, and related biomedical sciences. The ILAR publication "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals" is a standard resource for those responsible animal care throughout the world.  Periodically, ILAR issues reports on topics such as the humane and scientific use of laboratory animals, the education and training of scientists and technicians in the care and use of laboratory animals, the reduction of pain and distress in research animals, the occupational safety and health of employees, and nomenclature of inbred, transgenic, and other genetically defined animals. The ILAR Council meets three times a year to provide program direction and strategic planning; to oversee the communication and information programs (consisting of the ILAR web site and the ILAR Journal); to oversee special projects; and to direct ILAR's international programs (including participation as the US national member of the International Council of Laboratory Animal Sciences).  This award provides partial support for ILAR's  core activities, which include  maintenance of the web site, publication of the ILAR Journal, exhibits at scientific meetings, work of the ILAR Council, and general office operations.</AbstractNarration>
