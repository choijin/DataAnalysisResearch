<AbstractNarration>The proposal is an interdisciplinary research project with an educational emphasis in combinatorial theory and industrial engineering. The principle investigator proposes to substantially broaden her background in industrial engineering, specifically in manufacturing systems and supply chain management, to establish &lt;br/&gt;collaboration with researchers in engineering and industry, and to build an interdisciplinary research program on probabilistic combinatorics and applications in manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will spend the 2003--2004 academic year in the Department of Industrial Engineering (IE) at the Dwight Look College of Engineering, Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU). She plans to take several courses from &lt;br/&gt;IE and to interact closely with engineers and their graduate students by participating in seminars and projects. She plans to work on two projects, one is focused on new approaches for identifying and mitigating enterprise risk, and the other is concerned with the application of probabilistic combinatorics to stochastic model of supply chain networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposal is both research and educational. On the research side, the PI expects to establish a long term collaboration with researchers in engineering and industry, with results disseminated &lt;br/&gt;in both the mathematical and industrial engineering literatures, as well as directly to industry.  On the educational side, the PI will bring the experiences gained back into the Department of Mathematics. In &lt;br/&gt;addition to creating interdisciplinary courses and projects, the PI will contribute to the development of a new institute on Mathematical Applications in Homeland Security, which will greatly enhance &lt;br/&gt;the research and education program at TAMU. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).</AbstractNarration>
