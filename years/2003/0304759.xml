<AbstractNarration>The proposal has two parts. The main message of the first part is that for&lt;br/&gt;those Gorenstein singularities whose link is a rational homology sphere the&lt;br/&gt;work of Artin and Laufer on rational, respectively  on minimally elliptic&lt;br/&gt;singularities can be continued. The optimism is partly based on the author's&lt;br/&gt;work on Gorenstein elliptic singularities. For hypersurface singularities&lt;br/&gt;with rational homology sphere links the proposal addresses an even stronger&lt;br/&gt;conjecture: the link determines the embedded topological type (in particular,&lt;br/&gt;all homological package derived from the Milnor fibration), all the&lt;br/&gt;equivariant Hodge numbers  (in particular, the geometric genus), and the&lt;br/&gt;multiplicity (in particular, it predicts an even sharper property than&lt;br/&gt;Zariski's Conjecture). The second part is concentrated on a recent conjecture&lt;br/&gt;of L.I. Nicolaescu and the author  which states that a certain Seiberg-Witten&lt;br/&gt;invariant of a rational homology sphere link can serve as an ``optimal&lt;br/&gt;topological upper bound'' for  the geometric genus; and in the Q-Gorenstein&lt;br/&gt;case, it determines it. In fact, for a smoothing of a Gorenstein singularity&lt;br/&gt;it predicts that the signature of the Milnor fiber equals $-8$ times this&lt;br/&gt;Seiberg-Witten invariant. This conjecture generalizes an earlier conjecture&lt;br/&gt;of Neumann and Wahl  which connects, in the presence of a smoothing,&lt;br/&gt;the Casson invariant of the link and the signature of the Milnor fiber,&lt;br/&gt;provided that the link is an integer homology sphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the goals of the (analytic) singularity theory is to generalize&lt;br/&gt;the topological and analytical invariants of smooth analytic manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;A local singularity, in fact, is the zero set of some analytic functions&lt;br/&gt;From topological point of view, a local surface singularity is described&lt;br/&gt;by its link which is a 3--manifold (i.e. it is a cone over its link).&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand, it has many analytic invariants codifying interesting&lt;br/&gt;properties of the defining functions. The aim of the proposal is to connect&lt;br/&gt;these invariants. The final goal is  a ``lifting property'' which guarantees&lt;br/&gt;that many analytic invariants can be read already at the topological  level.&lt;br/&gt;The main topological ingredient is the recent Seiberg-Witten invariant.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal combines techniques of algebraic geometry with topology&lt;br/&gt;and sophisticated  combinatorial properties of some graphs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
