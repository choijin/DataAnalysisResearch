    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project is an in-situ and real-time composite self-sensing and structural health monitoring (SHM) system/technique development with application of the multifunctional properties of composite structural carbon (graphite) fibers. Composite structural damage sensing and SHM are accomplished by measuring electrical resistance (conductivity) changes in the carbon fiber structural composites the way they are designed and manufactured. Unlike embedded sensor applications such as piezo-ceramic (PZT), fiber-optic (FO) and micro-electro mechanical system (MEMS), this self-sensing composite SHM system/technique is applicable to fielded (currently in service) composite structures as well as new composite structures to be manufactured. The embedded sensor application presents sensor installation difficulties (applicable only to new composite structures to be manufactured), material (fatigue) property degradation due to foreign object material embedment in laminae, sensor repair-ability and reliability problems. Surface mounting sensor application also presents its own unique problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial applications include structural health monitoring/tracking technology for diagnosis and prognosis of the conditions of the mission/function critical composite structures in order to prevent catastrophic failures and to extend the lives of the critical composite structures. The technology will save substantial time and effort in maintaining the composite structures used in space station structures, spacecraft, aircraft and rotorcraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), rocket boosters, submarine composite structural components, pressure vessels, and civil composite infrastructures.</AbstractNarration>
