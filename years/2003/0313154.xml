<AbstractNarration>EIA-0313154&lt;br/&gt;Curtis Hill&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Valley City State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Accelerating Computer Science Education&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ITR small award provides support to study computer science education and learning using experimental curricular materials at a group of institutions in North Dakota. IT develops and evaluates a multi-user virtual domain built on the model of a virtual exploratorium of computing. The structure of the virtual world conforms to the pedagogical hyper-structure of a computing curriculum. However, the material is be organized in an organic fashion, held together by a role-based theory of education. Hence, the normal course boundaries and sequences are abandoned in favor of a goal-oriented structure. The target audience is freshman/sophomore level students with special emphasis on workforce training and outreach to under-represented groups. These materials are to be suitable for use as a distance-education mechanism or as a supplement to a traditional classroom course. The project includes a rigorous series of evaluation studies exploring an innovative approach to the assessment of student learning. It implements an interactive module for automatically evaluating student programming assignments, and develops a graphical user interface for algorithmic visualizations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project is derived from its focus on research and education. The project has a good conceptual framework on which to build. It extends a text-based prototype and provides rigorous, well-designed evaluation to assess the impact of the model. It is a collaborative effort from a team with the special expertise needed in both development, implementation in the classroom, and assessment. It includes development of innovative assessment methodologies that have promise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes several broader impacts. It develops materials and methodologies that are suitable for delivery through both distance and traditional methods. It tests these materials at a diverse set of institutions and populations, including one with a significant Native American population. Thus the project is both adaptable and transferable to other institutions and settings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates learning in a virtual context. It includes a formal comparison of approaches, contrasting classroom instruction with an anywhere/self-paced model, and a software tutored paradigm. It is a high-risk project, but with a high potential pay-off in terms of changing the way computer science is taught. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
