<AbstractNarration>With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic and Macromolecular Program supports the research of Dr. Dale F. Shellhamer of the Department of chemistry at Point Loma Nazarene College. The research examines the regio- and stereochemistry of the addition of electron deficient species to alkenes substituted with one or more fluorine atoms. The investigations will blend synthetic and mechanistic chemistry in order to answer fundamental questions concerning the reactivity of organic fluorine-containing compounds.  Since fluorinated organic compounds are important in contemporary medicine, industry and agriculture, knowledge of their diverse chemical behavior is quite important. In addition to adding mechanistic understanding, these studies will generate a new class of molecules that may prove useful in medicinal chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Shellhammer has designed research projects that can be accomplished by undergraduates after their sophomore year of chemistry.  These students will synthesize a large number of fluoro organics, use modern instruments to characterize these compounds, and present their findings at weekly seminars. A major goal is to generate enthusiasm for science among undergraduates and prepare students for advanced study in graduate school.  This innovative approach to undergraduate research will serve to challenge and prepare students as well as make significant contributions to organo fluorine chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
