<AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposed workshop is to develop potential approaches for the introduction&lt;br/&gt;of nanoscale engineering into the undergraduate and graduate engineering education process.&lt;br/&gt;Recognizing that nanoscale engineering is a very interdisciplinary activity, the correct approach&lt;br/&gt;to accomplish the education of future nanoelectronic engineers is not clear. The primary goal of&lt;br/&gt;this effort is to hold a workshop with a collection of individuals well versed in the various&lt;br/&gt;technologies that are necessary to accomplish advances in nanotechnology as well as individuals&lt;br/&gt;that have been instrumental in developing roadmaps for new curricula. The attendees will be&lt;br/&gt;primarily invited from the membership of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department&lt;br/&gt;Heads Association (ECEDHA). The co-located workshop will be held during the first two days&lt;br/&gt;of the highly successful IEC DesignCon conference, taking place January 27-30, 2003.&lt;br/&gt;DesignCon attracts more than 6,000 design engineers and managers and is also a draw for the&lt;br/&gt;academic community. The proposed program plan is to hold a one-day tutorial on the general&lt;br/&gt;topic of nanoscience and engineering that both the educators and the industrial participants of&lt;br/&gt;IEC DesignCon can attend. The second day will be focused on the development of an&lt;br/&gt;educational plan. The outcome of the workshop will be a report that outlines the possible&lt;br/&gt;approaches that should be attempted to support the development of the undergraduate and&lt;br/&gt;graduate nanoengineer. The workshop will be organized by ECEDHA, with board members&lt;br/&gt;serving as the organizers and workshop hosts.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity: This workshop will bring together for the first time&lt;br/&gt;educators in the general areas of Electrical and Computer Engineering with researchers in the&lt;br/&gt;areas of Nanoscience and Engineering to address the critical issues of education and workforce&lt;br/&gt;development relative to the emerging field of nanotechnology. This workshop will provide a&lt;br/&gt;unique intellectual forum to identify problems and bottlenecks in educating engineering students&lt;br/&gt;in this multidisciplinary arena.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity: The proposed activity represents only the&lt;br/&gt;first step in a broader program seeking to impact the engineering educational system in terms of&lt;br/&gt;new and emerging areas of science and technology. Since nanoscience and engineering are&lt;br/&gt;broadly interdisciplinary, the ideas relative to curriculum and education emerging from this&lt;br/&gt;workshop are expected have much broader impact in approaches to multidisciplinary education&lt;br/&gt;in other fields, such as information technology.</AbstractNarration>
