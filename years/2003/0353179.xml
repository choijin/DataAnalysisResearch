    <AbstractNarration>The award from the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Miami University, Oxford Campus for the summers of 2004-2006. Benjamin W. Gung is the site director and PI. Nine students will participate for ten weeks. Faculty members from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry will provide research projects in various sub fields, including analytical, biological, inorganic, organic and physical. The program targets under represented groups, women and minorities. The targeted institutions are undergraduate institutions where students do not have the opportunity for hands-on research. Interaction of faculty mentors and students from multiple disciplines in weekly meetings will expose students to different aspects of chemistry and biochemistry. Discussion topics will also include professional options in chemistry, graduate school, ethics, manuscript writing and preparation of oral presentations. The program will conclude with students presenting their work in a symposium. The program is evaluated using several criteria including analysis of student surveys, their professional development and career goals, and research productivity.</AbstractNarration>
