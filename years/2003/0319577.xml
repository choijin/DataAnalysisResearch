    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to develop a&lt;br/&gt;technique for the fabrication of large-area, high-density microdischarge arrays on flexible substrates. Microdischarge devices are a type of photonic emitter and detector in which a weakly ionized plasma is confined to spatial dimensions typically less than 200 microns. Microdischarge devices and arrays have the ability to operate continuously at atmospheric pressures with specific power loadings of the plasma of several tens of kW per cubic centimeter. In the proposed project, in order to evaluate the full potential of microdicharge devices for these applications they will be fabricated in higher densities on large, flexible substrates (as compared to the small arrays that have been previously demonstrated in the laboratory). Large-area processing techniques for deposition, patterning, gas filling, and lamination will be developed. In addition roll-to-roll processing techniques for the above mentioned steps, which is especially attractive for volume applications will be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially, the development of a new technology to enable the fabrication of large-area, highdensity microdischarge arrays would enable the construction of a wide variety of devices, including flexible sheet light sources for numerous commercial applications including chemical sensors, microdisplays, and large area emission sources. Further, if the microdischarge pixels are made to be individually addressable, it will be possible to develop a flexible plasma display panel (PDP). Finally, through the use of roll-to-roll processing, such devices could be manufactured economically in high volumes. Such devices would be ideal for lighting applications where portability, conformability, ruggedness, and low cost are required.</AbstractNarration>
