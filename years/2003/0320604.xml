<AbstractNarration>This research will develop new instrumentation based on a time-correlated spectrometer for simultaneous bulk-interfacial dynamics analysis.   The instrument simultaneously allows for interrogation of the interface between substrate and a bulk phase region, and the determination of the dynamics within the bulk phase region. This new instrument is based on principles and capabilities of inherent in the sensitive time-resolved fluorescence technique combined with the second order nonlinear optical (NLO) spectroscopy methods (second harmonic generation, SHG, and the vibrational sum-frequency generation, VSFG). The latter techniques continue to advance the understanding of interfacial phenomena; yet, remains blind to important bulk phase dynamics. The correlation between interfacial and bulk phase dynamics is critical to the understanding of such phenomena as polymeric film layer curing and adhesion. This new instrument leverages optical and detection components used with the NLO methods, with an enhanced design to directly probe bulk phase dynamics using a very sensitive and powerful time-resolved fluorescence technique. Using both, the SHG or the VSFG in a final apparatus design, and fluorescence probe signal to simultaneously monitor both interfacial and bulk phase dynamics will promote greater understanding, not only of the interactions of the molecular functionalities at interfaces, but the mechanism through which bulk phase dynamics influence those interactions.&lt;br/&gt; The capabilities, realized with the development of this new instrument, will be applied to address problems ranging from the science and engineering of polymeric films to the coating analysis and characterization as applied to the nanoparticles. The interdisciplinary research collaborations that will be facilitated by this new instrument combine the strengths of SDSM&amp;T in material science, organic chemistry, environmental and atmospheric chemistry and engineering. The new instrument design will afford participation from many different SDSM&amp;T departments, as well as, universities in the region; and therefore, enhance the educational opportunities at SDSM&amp;T. Optical train and detection design will provide a platform for including interdisciplinary participation from the science, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering departments. The enhanced capabilities will give students, at SDSM&amp;T and universities in the region, in chemistry, biology, environmental and material sciences programs a new tool to further advance the knowledge and accelerate the progress in a range of science and engineering disciplines.  Opportunities for significant enhancement of participation of students from underrepresented groups also exist.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
