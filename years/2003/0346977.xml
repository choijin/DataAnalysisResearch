<AbstractNarration>Future communication systems will be required to operate very close to&lt;br/&gt;their theoretical limits and achieve high performance with limited&lt;br/&gt;resources (e.g., bandwidth, energy, complexity). In order to realize&lt;br/&gt;these goals, the receiver of a communication system should be able to&lt;br/&gt;decode the digital data in the presence of channel uncertainty (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;unknown channel quality, interference, etc.). The current state of&lt;br/&gt;knowledge regarding the complexity of these receivers is that their&lt;br/&gt;complexity grows exponentially with the sequence length. This is&lt;br/&gt;unacceptable when practical implementation of these algorithms is of&lt;br/&gt;interest. A number of fundamental questions thus arise: (i) How&lt;br/&gt;accurate is the conventional wisdom that complexity grows&lt;br/&gt;exponentially with the sequence length?  (ii) What is the impact of&lt;br/&gt;the above question on the design of near-optimal, approximate&lt;br/&gt;algorithms suited for ultra-fast integrated circuit implementation?&lt;br/&gt;(iii) How can the complexity/performance tradeoff of these approximate&lt;br/&gt;algorithms be analyzed, and how can it be improved?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses the aforementioned fundamental questions&lt;br/&gt;using a novel approach in looking at the problem of joint data&lt;br/&gt;detection and channel estimation, consisting of two main thrusts: (a)&lt;br/&gt;On the theoretical front, the current state of knowledge is challenged,&lt;br/&gt;by investigating a broad class of communication scenarios for which&lt;br/&gt;the exact solution can be obtained with only polynomial complexity.&lt;br/&gt;(b) Utilizing the constructive proofs of the aforementioned statements,&lt;br/&gt;a family of novel receivers is investigated with near-optimal&lt;br/&gt;performance, linear complexity, and moreover, algorithmic structure&lt;br/&gt;that is suitable for high-speed hardware implementation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
