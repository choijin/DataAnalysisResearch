<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator has submitted a SGER proposal to develop an area of science and technology that non-invasively targets biologically active agents to localized regions of the Central Nervous System or NBS (Nonivasively-targeted Biomodulation System). In addition, the PI is proposing to explore the potential of his research to the Arctic research community. With the assistance of a highly credentialed science team, from Harvard and MIT, the PI's current research uniquely applies a multidisciplinary approach that combines "physics and software developed for focused transcranial energy deposition, intelligent - nanoscale science, and a biotech core based on the mechanisms of known neuropharmacological agents."  The PI is currently developing a proto-type that will incorporate biologically active agents into nanoscale systems that will remain dormant until activated by a noninvasive focused energy source. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the proposed research is not only to help fund the development of research on nanoscale science, but also to catalyze the application of this very innovative research among the high latitude researcher community. As such, the PI proposes to conduct a workshop in Alaska among high latitude researchers to explore the potential of the proposed research for the Arctic in the areas of bio-regulation in high latitude adaptation, efficacious and non-invasive delivery of bio-regulation compounds, medical applications for treatment of frostbite and trauma injuries, and others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
