<AbstractNarration>This proof-of-concept project is developing a prototype interdisciplinary undergraduate fuel cell (FC) laboratory. The development plan is being carried out through an effective implementation of innovative techniques in fuel cell technology to substantially improve the instructional capability of undergraduate education.  The goals of the project are being achieved through collaboration with several leading fuel cell manufacturers with extensive experiences in both stationary and mobile FC applications. Students from various engineering disciplines are benefiting from opportunities the laboratory provides in design, simulation, test and control of fuel cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is addressing simple and effective approaches for implementation of fuel cell technology and its applications through innovative industrial design techniques, which incorporate real-time sensory interfaces and control. The prototype fuel cell test station consists of three microcomputers, three data acquisition boards, several sensors and actuators and associate hardware with eight experimental setups. New courses are being offered in engineering curriculum to take advantage of this laboratory. Multi-disciplinary student groups from the senior design classes are also utilizing these resources for design projects and to interact and experience a real-world environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is directly impacting the undergraduate education by creating a focal point for interdisciplinary learning, a balance between theoretical and hands-on experience in undergraduate teaching, and application of these educational tools in a vibrant technology sector. An objective evaluation plan is being utilized to assess the implementation   of the proposed modules and determine the level of achievement for each stated outcome objective. The results of the project will be published in relevant journals and presented at appropriate conferences. Information will also be made available for possible users via a website hosted by the institution.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
