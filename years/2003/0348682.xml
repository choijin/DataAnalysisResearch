<AbstractNarration>Lu, Yunfeng&lt;br/&gt;Tulane University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; "CAREER: Synthesis and Device Applications of Continuous Hierarchical Nanowire/mesh Thin Films"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology is able to manipulate individual atoms and molecules to create large structures with improved properties and functions. In addition to the research, the continuous growth of nanotechnology requires nanotechnology education, workforce training, and public information on related issues. The research of this project includes the following goals and objectives: 1) to develop a general synthesis approach for the fabrication of nanowire and nanomesh thin films with controlled hierarchic structure and composition; 2) to examine their unique properties; and 3) to explore their applications, such as sensor and photovoltaics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;Nanoscale materials like nanowires often show novel and significantly improved physical, chemical, and tribological properties and functions. Current synthesis methods are often inefficient and synthesized nanowires often lack the macroscopic morphology control required for device applications. The most significant scientific impact of this project is the capability to fabricate metallic or semiconductor nanowires/meshes into the continuous, macroscopic, hierarchical thin films necessary for direct device applications. The findings gained from this project will contribute to the basic understanding of the nanoscale physical and chemical phenomena, providing insights into the design and fabrication of high-sensitivity sensors and high-efficiency photovoltaics. The fundamental studies of the confined electrodeposition within the mesoscale geometries will significantly contribute to current electrodeposition knowledge.  The research could develop a general synthesis method of fabricating continuous hierarchical metallic and semiconductor nanowire/mesh thin films, examine their unique properties, and explore their sensor, fuel cell, photovoltaic, and other applications. The proposed nanostructured sensors may possess the high-sensitivity needed for homeland security missions. The proposed photovoltaic devices could directly contribute to our national energy security by providing low-cost, high-efficiency energy devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of this career-development plan could have broad impacts on nanotechnology education in the southern region by providing workforce training, disseminating nanotechnology information, and nurturing the research infrastructure. This project could develop a highly integrated career-development plan in nanotechnology research and education. The PI will focus on improving education in this region through course offerings, research programs covering K-12 to graduate students, conferences, and industrial collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
