<AbstractNarration>This is a 10-week summer research program, designed the program for eight  undergraduates in  a  multidisciplinary  faculty  research  project  submitted jointly  from &lt;br/&gt;the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, and Geography and Geology and the Center for Water Resource Studies of the Ogden College of Science and Engineering of Western Kentucky University.  Each student will develop a research project in collaboration with one of ten faculty or professional staff mentors who have an active research program with an environmental focus in their respective disciplines.  All projects &lt;br/&gt;will  be linked  to environmental issues related to the karst terrain in the Mammoth Cave/ Upper Green River Basin in western Kentucky. This  REU  site  has  several  objectives:  1)  to  provide  the  student  participants  with  unique  and exciting  research  opportunities  in  an  area  of  environmental  research;  2)  to  provide  the  students  an opportunity to apply their knowledge to a real and current environmental problem in a meaningful way;  3)  to  enhance  the  critical  thinking  and  communication  skills  (including  written,  oral,  listening,  and computer-enhanced presentations) of the student participants; 4)  to introduce the students to a research setting that is .beyond the classroom.; 5) to develop the scientific maturity of the students while working  on  a  research  experience  that  is  ultimately  based  on  service  to  the  greater  community;  6)    to  increase interest  in  graduate  study  by  hands-on  experience  utilizing  state-of-the-art  instrumentation  and experimental  facilities;  and  7)  to  prepare  and  present  a  research  poster  at  a  regional  and  national  conference during the academic year.  A goal is to have more than 50% of the participants pursue post- graduate studies and/or pursue careers in an environmentally related profession.&lt;br/&gt; The  undergraduate  researchers  will  develop  a  mentoring  relationship  with  a faculty  mentor  while  participating  in  meaningful  research  activities. They will be exposed to a variety of research and instrumental techniques in each participating department through a series of hands-on training sessions.  During the academic year, regular contact between the mentor and student will be maintained in order to facilitate the students poster presentation at a national conference.  Mentors will also attend the conference with the student to provide on-site support, if needed.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
