<AbstractNarration>CNS-0347623&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Biologically Motivated Models for the Dynamics of Computer Networks: Performance, Growth and Pathological Conditions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biplab Sikdar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this project is to develop biologically motivated models for characterizing the dynamics of computer networks including their performance, growth and pathological conditions. In contrast to existing frameworks which typically focus on the steady state behavior, this work will develop models for the dynamic behavior of networks. The research focuses on three topics: (1) Models for the dynamics and propagation of network instabilities which encompass models for malicious worm attacks, network and human factors influencing them, and developing mechanisms to detect such attacks; (2) Models for the spatio-temporal aspects of performance metrics like traffic characteristics, delays and packet losses in large scale networks; (3) Models for the dynamics of wireless networks like growth patterns, battery consumption and network life, and spatial characteristics of cluster formations. Four groups of models from biological sciences including population models, genetic models, models based on pattern formation and epidemic models are used to address these research topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad impact of this proposal will be manifested through both its research and educational objectives. The demonstrations of the applicability and suitability of biological models to a wide range of networking issues has the potential to open a new perspective for modeling and developing control mechanisms in computer networks. The education program primarily focuses on outreach to local high school and K-8 students and leverages ongoing programs at RPI to motivate high school students towards science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
