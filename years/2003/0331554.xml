    <AbstractNarration>The issue of repairing and upgrading the existing civil engineering infrastructure has been&lt;br/&gt;one of great importance for over a decade. Deterioration of bridge decks, beams, girders&lt;br/&gt;and columns, buildings, parking structures and others may be attributed to ageing,&lt;br/&gt;environmentally induced degradation, poor initial design and/or construction, lack of&lt;br/&gt;maintenance, and to accidental events such as earthquakes. Recent developments related&lt;br/&gt;to materials, methods and techniques for structural strengthening have been various. One&lt;br/&gt;of today's state-of-the-art techniques is the use of externally bonded fiber reinforced&lt;br/&gt;polymer (FRP) composites.&lt;br/&gt;There are also many applications in the area of using prestressed FRP tendons and FRP&lt;br/&gt;bars to reinforce bridges and structures. Structural engineers view the use of advanced&lt;br/&gt;composites as highly promising in the construction industry currently.&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop is organized on the premise that the exchange of existing American and&lt;br/&gt;foreign experience in the area of utilizing FRP products in repairing existing structures is&lt;br/&gt;beneficial for both parties. The workshop will focus on the repair of ancient structures&lt;br/&gt;using FRP. Research related to composite materials has been carried out in the U.S.,&lt;br/&gt;Canada, Europe, Egypt, and Japan. However, there has been little communication&lt;br/&gt;between the American, Japanese, and European researchers. There is a need for an&lt;br/&gt;international exchange of advanced experience to increase the research efficiency and to&lt;br/&gt;insure that the United States is at the leading edge of engineering research. Experts from&lt;br/&gt;the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan, and the Middle East will identify the topics for&lt;br/&gt;future cooperative projects in the area of repair, reinforcing, and rehabilitation of&lt;br/&gt;structures using FRP. Site visits will be organized to historical structures in Egypt in&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with the Egyptian Ministry of Culture to investigate the possibility of using&lt;br/&gt;FRP to repair monuments and historical structures (several hundred years old).&lt;br/&gt;In order to ensure a productive workshop, the expected participation will be about 90&lt;br/&gt;specialists from universities, research centers, bridge authorities and consulting&lt;br/&gt;companies from around the world. Each participant will submit a written contribution on&lt;br/&gt;one of the topics. The discussions, additional contributions and final recommendations&lt;br/&gt;will be included in the Workshop Proceedings. The Proceedings will be widely&lt;br/&gt;distributed in the US to researchers and code writers. The presentations will also be made&lt;br/&gt;available at various professional meetings and conferences (ASCE, ACI) as well as in&lt;br/&gt;professional journals.&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop is scheduled for December 16-17, 2003, in Cairo, Egypt. Cairo is the&lt;br/&gt;capital of Egypt and is the largest city in Africa.</AbstractNarration>
