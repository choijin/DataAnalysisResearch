    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to establish the feasibility of a novel micro-array technology based on measurements of kinetics of hybridization of biopolymer molecules. By measuring kinetics of hybridization in real time, the perfectly and non-perfectly homologous DNA can be distinguished with much higher accuracy than by using conventional micro-arrays. An important innovative component of this technology is the labeling of target DNA by colloidal gold particles that are of the order of hundreds of nanometers in diameter. This labeling technique significantly increases the detection sensitivity and can be implemented using a very inexpensive detection system. Prior work has shown that the use of gold particles can increase the speed of hybridization to allow complete analysis in minutes, whereas conventional micro-array protocols require many hours. The proposed system is advantageous for many micro-array applications, including screening of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), when high hybridization specificity is required, and performing express micro-array analysis during time-critical medical procedures such as surgery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications of this project include drug screening, nucleic acid identification and sequencing, single base mutation screening, and gene expression analysis. The increasing applications of micro-arrays in medical research will create additional opportunities for introducing the proposed technology into routine clinical practice.</AbstractNarration>
