<AbstractNarration>0345375&lt;br/&gt;Friedman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under appropriate conditions the interaction between volcanic magma and surface water is explosive; however, volcanologists lack a fundamental understanding about the prerequisite phase mingling. With support from this grant, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth in collaboration with volcanologists from the University of Rhode Island will modify an existing particle image velocimetry (PIV) system to simultaneously capture laser induced fluorescence (LIF) images.  Mingling mechanisms will be determined by superposing phase boundaries (from LIF) with velocity fields (from PIV) under varying flow conditions and geometries.  LIF and PIV images are captured on separate cameras focused on a single image plane with the aid of a beam splitter and optical filters.&lt;br/&gt;The experimental upgrade has the potential to answer a broad range of additional questions of interest to NSF and Earth Sciences.  For example, dispersion of particles injected into the upper atmosphere is dependent on the settling velocity.  Research has shown that turbulent flow can either enhance or suppress the average settling rate.  By using small reflective particles to map the flow structure and larger fluorescent particles to simulate impurities, the apparatus could be used to study the effect of turbulence on mean settling velocity.  University of Massachusetts Dartmouth is a small university with a young but promising graduate education program serving the ethnically diverse communities of Fall River and New Bedford.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
