<AbstractNarration>Prof. Don Pfister at Harvard University with his associate Dr. Karen Hansen will be studying taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships among a group of so-called cup fungi mostly of the northern hemisphere, many suspected to form root-connections with surrounding vegetation, particularly in disturbed habitats following fires. The operculate cup-fungi (order Pezizales of the Ascomycota) are a relatively small group with slightly more than 1000 described species.  Several family-level taxonomic studies have been published, and the order is reasonably well known except for the largest group, that which includes the family Pyronemataceae (78 genera and approximately 500 species). The Pyronemataceae will be the focus of this study.  It is diverse family; species show a wide range of morphological and ecological traits. Using DNA sequence data from three nuclear gene regions and a full analysis of morphological characters, a solid backbone of phylogenetic relationships in the family will be established, which in turn will provide grounds for an improved natural classification of the group. Study of two generic complexes within the family will focus at the species level. &lt;br/&gt;This project is significant because it will provide a thoroughly documented sample of all the recognized genera within a major family of the Pezizales. The order then can be used as a model group for evolutionary, ecological and biogeographical studies. Although in many cases the biological activities of these fungi are not known, some of these fungi are saprobes, others are mycorrhizal and a few are parasitic on plants. In the broad ecosystem context these fungi play a part in establishing plants in disturbed habitats and extreme environments.   In this project graduate and undergraduate students will be trained and mentored. The research offers a particularly potent combination of training opportunities in traditional and molecular methodologies. The project also encourages cooperative activities involving scientists from the US, Norway, Denmark and other countries. As well, public audiences will be engaged through activities in the Harvard Museum of Natural History and local natural history organizations.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
