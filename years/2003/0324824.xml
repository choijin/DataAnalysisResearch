<AbstractNarration>PI:  Pearson    Institution:  Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Special Projects Office of the Division of Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Affairs of the Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate is supporting Dr. Willie Pearson of the Department of History, Technology and Society, Georgia Institute of Technology to organize and conduct a workshop entitled  "Postdoctoral Appointments: Roles and Opportunities".  Dr. Robert Lichter of  Merrimack Consultants, LLC and Dr. Geraldine L. Richmond of the University of Oregon are co-PI of the project.  The goal of the workshop is to explore the nature and merit of initiating a postdoctoral program in chemistry that may serve as a model throughout NSF.  Elements that will be considered include: 1) A better understanding of the processes, characteristics and outcomes of the postdoctoral appointment.  2) A statement of concepts, opportunities and priorities for activities at the postdoctoral level by the chemistry division, and the NSF more generally, that will strengthen the human resource base necessary to maintain leadership in science, mathematics and engineering.  The workshop will be developed by a ten-person steering committee that will oversee all phases of planning, development and implementation of the workshop, and drafting a final report.  The workshop will be attended by a demographically diverse group of approximately 60-70 participants.  Attendees will include academic and industrial administrators, representatives from national  labs, industrial labs, funding agencies and from undergraduate and graduate institutions.  The workshop report will inform the planning process for NSF supported activities at the postdoctoral level in the Division of Chemistry and the MPS Directorate.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
