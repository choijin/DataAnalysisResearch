<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate novel femtosecond laser machining techniques for manufacturing a variety of microstructures and components. The approach is to optimize all laser operation parameters; in particular, the temporal shape of laser pulses by synthesizing femtosecond pulse bursts (1 femtosecond = 1/1,000,000,000,000,000 second), which are not available in commercial laser machining systems. In these femtosecond pulse bursts, the energy of each laser pulse will be individually controlled, and the pulse-to-pulse separation time will be adjusted from femtoseconds to nanoseconds. This will allow high quality microstructures to be machined in almost any materials. Fundamental physical phenomena during femtosecond laser-matter interaction will be investigated to assist the design of the pulse bursts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work, if successful, will greatly advance the laser machining technology.  Despite many advantages of using femtosecond pulse lasers for micro-machining, clean and desirable structures are often not obtained due to melt ejection by laser irradiation and re-deposition of melt droplets. This work is aimed at solving common problems associated with laser micro-machining to achieve cleaner and higher precision machining results. The success of this work will impact many industries, including aerospace, automobile, microelectronics, and biotechnology where laser micro-machining is already widely used. The project will also contribute to education of the next generation high tech workforce. It will provide the students involved with cross-disciplinary trainings. The results of this research will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate curricula and disseminated to both academic and industrial laser processing communities.</AbstractNarration>
