<AbstractNarration>The Objective of the Proposed Activity&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to acquire the Polytec PI Micro Scanning Vibrometer (MSV-300)&lt;br/&gt;for research and educational use at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). The Micro&lt;br/&gt;Scanning Vibrometer (MSV) is an ideal instrument for mapping the deflections of&lt;br/&gt;Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) structures. Employing state-of-the-art laser&lt;br/&gt;technology and a computer software driven data acquisition system, the instrument can measure&lt;br/&gt;acceleration, velocity and displacement of points on tiny vibrating microstructures, and provide&lt;br/&gt;live 3-D animations of the response mode shapes of the microstructures. The MSV includes two-channel&lt;br/&gt;FFT data acquisition, a fiber-optic vibrometer sensor, microscope adapter, piezo-scanning&lt;br/&gt;system, remote control functions and specialized software.&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity&lt;br/&gt;Four laboratories in three engineering departments at UIC are actively involved in sponsored&lt;br/&gt;research projects on development of a variety of novel MEMS transducers, many of them in&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with various departments in the UIC Medical school, that correspond to over&lt;br/&gt;$3.5M in grants (either funded or pending) from various federal agencies including NSF.&lt;br/&gt;Examples of these novel MEMS projects include actuators and microfluidic devices for sub-retinal&lt;br/&gt;prosthesis, medical diagnostic vibro-acoustic sensors, multi-channel neural probes, and&lt;br/&gt;liquid drop actuated micro-mirrors. The feature sizes of these MEMS are on the order of a few&lt;br/&gt;micrometers and their resonant frequencies are on the order of a few Hertz to several MHz. A&lt;br/&gt;very important component central to all of these research projects is the identification of system&lt;br/&gt;dynamics, which presents many difficult challenges. Due to the micro scale of these structures,&lt;br/&gt;conventional dynamic characterization methods are not feasible. Coarse frequency evaluations&lt;br/&gt;may be possible in some cases using certain single-point optical sensors; however, they are not&lt;br/&gt;practical for obtaining detailed mode shape data of the test specimen. Additionally, they are&lt;br/&gt;limited by bandwidth and resolution. Currently no instruments are available at UIC or nearby&lt;br/&gt;institutions to fully characterize the dynamic behavior of MEMS structures in these projects.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of the Proposed Activity&lt;br/&gt;The proposed equipment will significantly impact the quality of research and education, and&lt;br/&gt;diversity programs at UIC, and also the advancement of local institutions and private companies:&lt;br/&gt;Research MSV would enable UIC researchers to acquire high quality modal data in MEMS&lt;br/&gt;structures that is not possible by any other technique, and thus, significantly enhance the quality&lt;br/&gt;of the ongoing and anticipated future research. It would also help catalyze new research activity.&lt;br/&gt;Education The equipment will be used to offer hands-on instruction in cutting-edge technology&lt;br/&gt;to supplement classroom theory taught in many existing and new courses planned in the areas of&lt;br/&gt;dynamics and MEMS testing at UIC; this will highly enrich the quality of education.&lt;br/&gt;Diversity UIC offers special programs at both the undergraduate and graduate level to attract and&lt;br/&gt;mentor members of underrepresented groups in the sciences and engineering. The availability of&lt;br/&gt;equipment would further enrich the education of students in these programs.&lt;br/&gt;Industry The Microfabrication Applications Laboratory at UIC is currently used by over 50&lt;br/&gt;external users from several local academic institutions and companies in the greater Chicago&lt;br/&gt;area. Many of the users have expressed interest and need for the proposed MSV. This equipment&lt;br/&gt;will foster more partnerships with local industry, promote innovation in MEMS/nanotechnology,&lt;br/&gt;and help local businesses to contribute to economic development in the Midwest.</AbstractNarration>
