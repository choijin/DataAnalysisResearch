    <AbstractNarration>The PIs will develop a method to improve the specification of sea surface temperature (SST) in coupled ocean-atmosphere models, specifically for the Community Climate System Model (CCSM). The issue is that various temperature sensing methods measure the ocean "surface" temperature at various depths; satellites at about 1 mm, in situ thermometers about 1 m, drifters about 5 m, and ships about 5-10 m. These disparate data are "blended" into a "bulk" SST data set to represent ocean temperature at 1 m. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, the air-sea fluxes that couple the domains of the ocean and atmosphere in nature occur at their interface and SST at the interface cannot be measured using current observing technologies. The best we can do is observe SST by infrared or microwave sensors at a few microns depth ("skin" temperature) or a few millimeters depth (sub-skin temperature).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will develop an adjustment algorithm to account for the differences in SST bulk and SST skin, to produce an SST data set that can be used as a lower boundary condition in the CCSM atmospheric model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project would result in improved model representation of important ocean-atmosphere coupling processes. Over 100 scientists and students use the CCSM to conduct their research. Furthermore, the CCSM is one of two U.S. climate models used in national and international climate change projections and assessments, and it thus provides scientific knowledge relevant for U.S. and international energy/environment policy deliberations.</AbstractNarration>
