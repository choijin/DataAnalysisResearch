<AbstractNarration>While researchers have made major breakthroughs in controlling nonlinear continuous time systems over&lt;br/&gt;the last two decades, more recently the research has started to focus on methods for controlling continuous&lt;br/&gt;time systems based on discrete time models and over digital networks, because of the need to control increas-&lt;br/&gt;ingly complex systems and because of the increasing computer power typically available. The proposed work&lt;br/&gt;aims to use previously developed nonlinear continuous time control methods as a springboard to develop&lt;br/&gt;new, high performance control algorithms for general nonlinear systems based on discrete-time models. The&lt;br/&gt;focus will be on developing algorithms that are robust, adaptive, and don't require full measurement of&lt;br/&gt;the system state. Applications of these results will include the development of optimal treatment schedules&lt;br/&gt;for HIV patients, leading to a non-progressive state where treatment is no longer needed. Other applica-&lt;br/&gt;tions will include control and calibration of automotive engines where state constraints, which are easy to&lt;br/&gt;incorporate into certain optimization-based control strategies but which often lead to non-robust control&lt;br/&gt;algorithms, play an important role. The proposed work also aims to give new, improved stability conditions&lt;br/&gt;for networked nonlinear control systems, especially those using protocols that don't necessarily guarantee&lt;br/&gt;transmission to every node of the communication network within a fixed amount of time. It is expected that&lt;br/&gt;these new stability conditions for networked control systems will give insight into the development of novel&lt;br/&gt;communication protocols which will, in turn, make networked control systems more successful and prevalent.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact:&lt;br/&gt;The work in this proposal has the potential for broad impact via the role that control plays as an enabling&lt;br/&gt;technology. As suggested above, the ideas that we will investigate may help lead the way to efficient drug&lt;br/&gt;treatment schedules for HIV patients leading to a non-progressive state, thereby eliminating the need for&lt;br/&gt;further drug therapy. In general, it should make it more feasible to rely on optimization-based automation&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for a wide range of engineering tasks that impact all of society. The proposal will support&lt;br/&gt;graduate students who will present their findings at national and regional conferences. The results will be&lt;br/&gt;made available, promptly, on the web and will be immediately incorporated into graduate courses at the&lt;br/&gt;proposing institution. The work will help to further shape UCSB's Center for Control Engineering and&lt;br/&gt;Computation, which is one of the leading programs in control education in the nation. It will strengthen&lt;br/&gt;interactions with international partners, e.g., in Australia, France and Italy, will foster novel collaborative&lt;br/&gt;efforts with theoretical biologists at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, and will further&lt;br/&gt;collaborative efforts with researchers at Ford Motor Company.</AbstractNarration>
