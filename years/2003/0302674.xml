    <AbstractNarration>The demand for technologically literate workers is increasing. However, many students are not being adequately prepared for technical careers. A program is needed that will take technical training into high schools, significantly raise the interest level among students and teachers for technology education, and then encourage more students to enroll in these programs at the college level. This project is accomplishing this mission by delivering an underwater robotics program to regional high schools. Alvin Community College recently received approval to offer both a one-year certificate and a two-year Associate in Applied Science degree program in Marine Robotics Technology. The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board recognized the need for this program to help supply a properly trained workforce for a demand occupation. The College is now expanding the delivery of this marine technology education into area high schools.&lt;br/&gt;This project is creating a marine robotics lab, complete with equipment and educational support, and delivering these materials to selected high school classes in 10 regional high schools. Teacher training is provided during the initial presentation and through follow-up visits in order to facilitate the integration of technology into the normal curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;High school Counselors and Career and Technology Education Directors are selecting appropriate sophomore and junior level high school classes to receive this training. We are specifically targeting under-represented groups as part of this educational experience, particularly minority and female students. The project is striving to implement innovative and highly technical instruction into regional high schools with the subsequent goal of producing highly skilled individuals to enter the marine robotics field.</AbstractNarration>
