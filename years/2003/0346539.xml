    <AbstractNarration>PIs: Anderson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are plant root-mycobacterium interactions beneficial in remediation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; PAH-contaminated soils pose environmental and health hazards. Phytoremediation is a cost effective method for on-site clean-up. It is well suited for large surface areas such as those designated as Brownfields within urban settings or sites where soil excavation and removal is difficult. This proposal focuses on understanding more of the ecology of the group of mycobacterium that has PAH-degrading potential. Currently there is little knowledge of how such mycobacteria interact with plant roots and whether this association has positive impacts on the metabolism of the plant and/or the microbe to promote bioremediation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hypotheses to be tested are: &lt;br/&gt;1) The presence of roots colonized by PAH-degrading mycobacteria improves the bioavailability of a model, recalcitrant PAH, pyrene.&lt;br/&gt;2) The mineralization of pyrene is enhanced by the interaction of the roots with the mycobacterium. &lt;br/&gt;3) Colonization of the root requires discrete interactions between the mycobacterium and root surface.&lt;br/&gt;4) Colonization of the root permits the expression of the gene in the mycobacterium encoding the first enzyme involved in PAH degradation, dioxygenase. &lt;br/&gt;5) Root phenoloxidases, which may participate in PAH-remodeling, are changed in activity in the roots colonized by mycobacterium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will involve the collaborative efforts of engineers and biologists at Utah State University. The undergraduates, graduates and faculty involved will be exposed to the theories and practices of both scientific disciplines. Strong involvement of minorities in the program will be supported through integration with the ADVANCE program at Utah State University recently awarded to Utah State University from NSF and GAANN grant, "Increasing the number of environmental engineering Ph.D. students at Utah State University with an emphasis on strengthening diversity." Already active in both colleges are summer placement programs for high-school students through engineering and the Biotechnology Summer Academy. Undergraduate involvement will be assisted by application to the USU Undergraduate Research Cooperative Program that will assist travel to meetings including national level conferences for presentation of data. Graduate mentorship will include regular group meetings and assistance from the USU Graduate School for tuition and for travel to national meetings. Research information will be conveyed through university publications, peer-reviewed journals and by presentations at national and international meetings. The findings will improve our abilities to predict and manage on-site phytoremediation of PAHs and will have national and international impact.</AbstractNarration>
