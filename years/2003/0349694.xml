    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II research project is to develop an improved magneto-optical (MO) visualizer based on a laser-scanning polarimeter and a MO imaging film (MOIF) utilizing surface plasmon resonance. In Phase I, the feasibility of substantial improvements in spatial and magnetic field resolutions and imaging bandwidth over existing methods were demonstrated. In Phase II, the MO material quality and sensor design will be further optimized. The visualizer will be adapted to maximize the many advantages offered by the improved MOIF material. Software will be developed to provide automatic system control and conversion of the acquired image into the quantitative spatial magnetic field distribution. The capabilities of the prototype systems and sensors will be evaluated in terms of magnetic field resolution, spatial resolution and speed through the imaging of electrical current patterns and data storage devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial market needs include sensors, instruments and systems for improved magnetic field imaging. Applications include magnetic character reading, magnetic code reading for security, superconductor research, spin valve and magnetic RAM research and manufacturing, integrated circuit electrical current imaging, structural composite stress imaging using magnetic and magnetostrictive materials, flaw detection in metals, biomedical tagging and identification of cancer and other cells, research and testing of MEMS actuators and devices.</AbstractNarration>
