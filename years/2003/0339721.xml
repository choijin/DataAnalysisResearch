    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to investigate and prove the feasibility of creating high-temperature multichip power modules that utilize silicon-carbide (SiC) power switches at temperatures in the range of 300- 600 deg C. By taking advantage of the key benefits of this emerging semiconductor (which includes high-temperature operation, low switching losses, very high switching frequencies, and high power densities) the entire field of power electronics has the potential to become completely revolutionized on multiple fronts. SiC power switches, with reduced switching losses, would improve the overall electrical efficiencies of power electronic systems. The ability to operate at high-temperatures would greatly reduce the size and weight of heat sinking strategies (perhaps by as much as an order of magnitude) and possibly remove the requirement for power module heat sinks all together. The project involves developing high-temperature (300-600 deg C) multichip power modules (MCPMs) that integrate control and SiC power electronics into a single compact module. Feasibility of such an approach to power electronics will be proven at the conclusion of the Phase I grant with the demonstration of a 3kW MCPM half-bridge power converter utilizing experimental prototype SiC power switches and operating at temperatures of 300 deg C. Since current silicon electronics are typically limited to approximately 150 deg C maximum temperature of operation, the high-temperature research in this SBIR Phase I project has the potential to greatly enhance scientific understanding of high-temperature failure mechanisms, thermal induced electronic packaging stresses, and long-term interconnect reliability issues in addition to technical advancement of state-of-the-art power electronics systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercialization of SiC based MCPMs has the potential to find benefit in nearly every electric motor drive, power supply, and power converter conceivable. The application of such MCPMs could save electrical energy consumption worldwide, due to the improved electrical efficiency of SiC power switches alone. Furthermore, an immediate commercialization application is possible in the development of high-temperature geological petroleum exploration instrumentation.</AbstractNarration>
