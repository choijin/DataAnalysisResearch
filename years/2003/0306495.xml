<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0306495&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Jose F. Escobar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Escobar plans to continue his research in linear and&lt;br/&gt;non-linear partial differential equations and its applications to&lt;br/&gt;Riemmannian Geometry. He will continue his study of solutions to&lt;br/&gt;Yamabe equations on compact Riemannian manifolds.  These are&lt;br/&gt;semilinear elliptic equations and in the case that the manifold&lt;br/&gt;has a boundary they satisfy a non-linear boundary condition.&lt;br/&gt;Applications of the existence theory for these equations are&lt;br/&gt;proposed to solve other problems in differential geometry and&lt;br/&gt;relativity. He also proposes to study Hamilton's Ricci flow on&lt;br/&gt;two and three dimensional manifols with boundary.  In the two&lt;br/&gt;dimensional case this is a scalar non-linear evolution equation&lt;br/&gt;satisfying a non-linear boundary condition, while in the three&lt;br/&gt;dimensional case is a system of nonlinear equations with&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear boundary conditions.  He will continue the study of the&lt;br/&gt;relation between the geometry of the manifold and the eigenvalues&lt;br/&gt;for the Steklov problem, which is the study of harmonic functions&lt;br/&gt;whose normal derivative is proportional to the function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The geometric objects that will be studied are the so-called&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian manifolds.  These are spaces endowed with analytical&lt;br/&gt;structures, like the metric which provide us with a way to&lt;br/&gt;measure lengths and angles.  It is natural to study deformations&lt;br/&gt;of these structures to realize what properties in the space&lt;br/&gt;remain stable under such perturbations.  The description of all&lt;br/&gt;these deformations is usually governed by differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;The curvature tensor of a Riemmannian manifold ( a measure for&lt;br/&gt;the "non-euclideanness" of a Riemannian space) usually makes such&lt;br/&gt;equations non-linear, although as in physics, most of them are of&lt;br/&gt;variational nature.  From the earliest days, conformal changes of&lt;br/&gt;metric ( multiplication of the metric by a positive function)&lt;br/&gt;have played an importntant role in surface theory.  The equations&lt;br/&gt;proposed appear in the problem of conformal deformation of a&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian metric and in relativity. The Steklov problem appears&lt;br/&gt;in mathematical physics, conformal geometry, spinor geometry,&lt;br/&gt;minimal surfaces, partial differential equations and harmonic&lt;br/&gt;analysis.  Geometry as well as topology involves the study of&lt;br/&gt;properties of the space.  But whereas geometry focuses on&lt;br/&gt;properties of space that involves size, shape and measurement,&lt;br/&gt;topology concerns itself with the less tangible properties of&lt;br/&gt;relative position and connectedness. In recent years Hamilton's&lt;br/&gt;Ricci flow has become a fundamental tool in the study of geometry&lt;br/&gt;and toplogy of manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
