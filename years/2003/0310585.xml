<AbstractNarration>Central schemes may serve as universal finite-difference methods for&lt;br/&gt;numerically solving hyperbolic conservation and balance laws,&lt;br/&gt;Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and related problems. Such schemes are not&lt;br/&gt;tied to the specific eigen-structure of the problem, and hence can be&lt;br/&gt;implemented in a straightforward manner for a wide variety of nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;equations governing the spontaneous evolution of large gradient&lt;br/&gt;phenomena. This project aims to further improve the family of Godunov-type central&lt;br/&gt;schemes, recently developed by Kurganov et al. The main ideas behind the&lt;br/&gt;construction of the new, less dissipative central schemes are to use&lt;br/&gt;more precise estimate of the smooth and nonsmooth parts of the solution&lt;br/&gt;by considering non-rectangular control volumes; to use a more accurate&lt;br/&gt;projection of the evolved data onto the original, non-staggered grid;&lt;br/&gt;and to avoid the loss of information when very accurate fully-discrete&lt;br/&gt;schemes are reduced to a much simpler semi-discrete form.&lt;br/&gt;The second main goal of the project is the application of central schemes&lt;br/&gt;to various multi-phase and multi-fluid flow models, the Saint-Venant&lt;br/&gt;systems of shallow water equations (which describe flows in rivers and&lt;br/&gt;coastal areas), multi-layer shallow water systems, models of transport of&lt;br/&gt;pollutant in shallow water, the Euler equations of gas dynamics subject&lt;br/&gt;to a static gravitational field, chemotaxis models, reactive flows (in&lt;br/&gt;particular, the models describing stiff detonation waves), extended&lt;br/&gt;thermodynamics, shallow water equations on a rotating sphere, acoustic&lt;br/&gt;wave propagation, heterogeneous elasticity, granular material flows.&lt;br/&gt;Naturally, these applications involve multiple space dimensions, complex&lt;br/&gt;geometries and moving boundaries/interfaces, This would require further&lt;br/&gt;development of the theory and implementation of central schemes. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, semi-discrete central schemes on unstructured and triangular&lt;br/&gt;meshes will be derived, and different adaptive techniques will be&lt;br/&gt;incorporated into the central framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent development of modern technology requires reliable, efficient,&lt;br/&gt;high-resolution methods for solving time-dependent partial differential &lt;br/&gt;equations (PDEs), including multidimensional systems of hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;conservation and balance laws, Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and related&lt;br/&gt;problems. In the past decade, a family of simple, universal,&lt;br/&gt;Riemann-solver-free finite volume central schemes has proven to be&lt;br/&gt;an appealing alternative to the more complicated and problem oriented&lt;br/&gt;upwind schemes. The advantages of central schemes are particularly&lt;br/&gt;prominent when they are used to solve complicated multidimensional&lt;br/&gt;systems of PDEs arising in such important fields including fluid&lt;br/&gt;mechanics, gas dynamics, geophysics, meteorology, magnetohydrodynamics,&lt;br/&gt;astrophysics, multi-component flows, granular flows, reactive flows,&lt;br/&gt;semiconductors, non-Newtonian flows, geometric optics, traffic flow,&lt;br/&gt;image processing, financial, biological modeling, differential games,&lt;br/&gt;and optimal control. This project is focused on the further development and improvement of&lt;br/&gt;central schemes, and on their practical applications. The new central&lt;br/&gt;schemes will be incorporated into a general-purpose adaptive mesh&lt;br/&gt;refinement (AMR) and adaptive moving mesh (AMM) codes, which will be&lt;br/&gt;freely accessible for the scientific and industrial communities. These&lt;br/&gt;codes will serve as a reliable and robust "black-box-solver" for a&lt;br/&gt;rather comprehensive class of time-dependent PDEs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
