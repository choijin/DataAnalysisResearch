<AbstractNarration>Nikolopoulos, Dimitrios&lt;br/&gt;College of William and Mary&lt;br/&gt;CCF-0346867&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research activity involves the design, development and deployment&lt;br/&gt;of a programming framework for explicit multilevel parallelization using a &lt;br/&gt;global address space model. The framework targets the upcoming generation of &lt;br/&gt;Petaflop-class supercomputers, which are based on architectural substrates &lt;br/&gt;with multiple levels of on-chip and off-chip parallelism and deep memory &lt;br/&gt;hierarchies. The research addresses the need for increased productivity and &lt;br/&gt;utilization of the National supercomputing power, by attempting to close the &lt;br/&gt;gap between computer architecture innovation and parallel programming &lt;br/&gt;practices. The main goal of this activity is to reduce the &lt;br/&gt;programming effort required for mapping algorithmic parallelism to &lt;br/&gt;hierarchical hardware components with heterogeneous means for parallel &lt;br/&gt;execution and assist programmers in deriving balanced designs of layered parallel applications.  The programming framework &lt;br/&gt;investigated in this research unifies parallel programming models and &lt;br/&gt;methodologies and enables faster adaptation of parallel code to new hardware &lt;br/&gt;platforms.  Concurrently, it forms a basis for education and training of &lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary student audiences in high performance programming. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The parallel programming component of this research is designed around &lt;br/&gt;standard C++ templates with notation for nested threads and iterators. &lt;br/&gt;The notations for parallelism are coupled with a templated representation of &lt;br/&gt;data, which allows for arbitrary partitioning, sharing, and coherence control &lt;br/&gt;at multiple levels of parallel execution constructs.  While the  programmer &lt;br/&gt;highlights nested parallelism, the orchestration and management of multigrain &lt;br/&gt;threads and data are delegated to the compiler and the runtime system. The &lt;br/&gt;research investigates novel methods for controlling the &lt;br/&gt;granularity of multilevel parallelism via vertical analysis of the program.  &lt;br/&gt;Periodicity analysis and selective runtime tracing are used as means to &lt;br/&gt;derive effective data distribution and layout schemes without user&lt;br/&gt;intervention. Alongside runtime analysis, new resource-driven scheduling &lt;br/&gt;strategies and novel microprocessor features, including on-chip &lt;br/&gt;multithreading, on-chip SIMD parallelism and speculative execution, are &lt;br/&gt;incorporated into the parallelization and program optimization processes. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
