    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CHE-0315412&lt;br/&gt;Bauer/Arizona State&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The improvement of the operation of three way catalytic converters for automobile exhaust remediation is the goal of the work carried out by Professor Bauer and his colleagues at Arizona State University. With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, he is applying low energy electron microscopy and x-ray photoemission microscopy to the study of model three way catalysts. In the presence of CO, O2, NO and SO2 reactants, oxide supported noble metal catalysts undergo morphological and compositional changes on the nanometer scale that can be monitored using these methods. Results of these surface kinetic and dynamic studies provide understanding for the improved design of these catalytic systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to continually reduce the emissions from automobile exhaust, improvements in catalytic converter technology must be made. This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, addresses the detailed dynamics of operation of the commonly used three way catalytic converter. Using state of the art microscopic methods, in situ studies of the reaction process, and direct monitoring of the operational catalyst, Professor Bauer and his coworkers are developing the fundamental understanding needed to improve catalyst design.</AbstractNarration>
