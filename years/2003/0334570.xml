<AbstractNarration>This U.S.-Brazil award will help to support the travel of students from the United States and several developing countries to the 2003 International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA) School/Workshop on Instrumentation in Elementary Particle Physics to be held.  The school will be held on the island of Itacuruca near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on December 8-19, 2003.  Organized by Dr. Marleigh Sheaff of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, together with Professor Joao dos Anjos of the Centro de Pesquisas Fisicas (CBPF), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the goal of this school is to encourage instrumentation skills by developing-country physicists at their home institutions, and to foster collaboration between U.S. physicists at an early stage in their careers with their peers from elsewhere in the world. It is expected that this workshop will provide researchers from the hemisphere with instrumentation skills useful for particle, nuclear, medical and other subdisciplines of physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The previous nine schools/workshops in the series have been held in Europe, Asia, and the Americas.  This activity helps foster possible future research and collaborations in elementary particle physics between young U.S.-based researchers and young researchers from developing countries.  Applications to medicine and industrial processes of the instrumentation discussed in this school include imaging, fast communication, and massive data acquisition and retrieval.  This award is funded by the Americas Program in the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Elementary Particle Physics Program in the Division of Physics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
