<AbstractNarration>Robotics and Human Augmentation Program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #0308056&lt;br/&gt;Title: Compliant Frame Modular Mobile Robotic Systems&lt;br/&gt;PI: Minor, Mark&lt;br/&gt;University of Utah&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compliant framed wheeled modular mobile robots are the subject of this research. The system consists of rigid differentially steered axle modules coupled by flexible frame modules that provide compliant roll, pitch, and yaw for suspension and highly controllable steering without added hardware. Modularity provides a structure that is easily scaled and reconfigured for a variety of applications oriented around dissimilar configurations. Preliminary studies focusing on a two-axle scout configuration have derived curvature based planning algorithms optimizing energy usage and control authority, developed a modular model structure for dynamic motion control, and established sensor hardware and fusion algorithms for improved postural evaluation.  More complex configurations, however, introduce complicated nonholonomic constraints and additional challenges for motion planning and dynamic stabilization. Hence, this research investigates scalable motion planning algorithms and dynamic controllers that provide functionality to modular mobile robotic systems. These algorithms must operate within a distributed modular environment where emphasis is placed on low-level stabilization and planning algorithms, which also requires further modularization of sensor fusion algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit of this research lies in the fact that it examines a novel, and previously unexplored, methods of realizing scalable mobile robotic systems.  The potential of this system to expand the service of mobile robotics in space exploration, military service, and even agriculture, mining, and forestry, are tremendous.  Broader impacts will be realized within the robotics community, the educational processes at the University of Utah, and engineering outreach activities within the state of Utah.  Impact on robotics research will be realized in motion planning, dynamic control, sensor instrumentation, and group behavior. Laboratory experiments and design examples will be derived for the undergraduate mechatronics curriculum, and graduate control courses will benefit from practical examples and experimental platforms.  Outreach activities where students interact with mobile robots and learn more about underlying technology have already been developed, and further advances will continue to be made.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
