    <AbstractNarration>Wisconsin Semantic Disks (WISE)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Wisconsin Semantic disks project (WiSe Disks), we will develop the core technology required to build semantically smart disk systems. Semantically smart disk systems will impact storage systems and information technology in two fundamental ways. First, by developing their storage innovations within a semantically smart disk, researchers will readily transfer next-generation storage technology into industry. Second, by deploying semantically smart disks, industry will compete on enhanced functionality within their storage products, and not simply cost-per-byte and performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this proposal, we focus on three core areas of research in semantically smart disk systems. First, we will develop the fundamental software technology required to automate information discovery within a smart disk. Second, we will study the hardware support that is required. Third, we will demonstrate via case study the power of placing semantic intelligence within a disk system, by increasing the availability, security, and performance of storage beyond traditional approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As storage becomes more central to the lives of everyday people, in the form of their digital photographs, home movies, and digital music, it becomes increasingly important to improve the availability, security, and performance of storage. For years, researchers in file systems have created new technologies, and yet many of these ideas have not been deployed in the real world. Semantically smart storage technology enables the widespread deployment of these innovations, thus allowing the everyday storage user to directly benefit from the wealth of previous and on-going storage systems research.</AbstractNarration>
