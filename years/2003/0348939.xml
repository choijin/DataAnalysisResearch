<AbstractNarration>This CAREER project addresses fundamental materials science issues in writable and erasable photonic crystal materials. The approach is based on the high sensitivity of  manganite materials to external fields, such as magnetic field, temperature, and optical illumination. A number of such materials exhibit unique photosensitivity properties. As a result, nanostructuring of these materials may be performed using well known optical holography techniques. It is proposed to overcome inherently weak refractive index contrast of holograms by using extreme sensitivity of the properties of manganites to external magnetic field and temperature. This sensitivity will be used to develop the holograms: application of the external fields is expected to result in substan-tial enhancement of the weak initial refractive index contrast of the holograms, resulting in the potential appearance of photonic band gaps. On the other hand, such photoinduced photonic crystal structures may be easily annealed using, for example, intense light of a CO2 laser, so that new structures can be written in the same region of the sample. Greater understanding of fundamental materials science processes and the ability to create unique writable and erasable photonic crystal materials are potential research outcomes.  &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses fundamental research issues in electronic materials science having technological relevance. The research project will advance broad areas of materials science and optical technology while simultaneously promote teaching and training via development of novel undergraduate courses at the Towson University, which is primarily an undergraduate institution. Physics majors will have access to state-of-the-art equipment during their Intermediate Physics Laboratory course and undergraduate research. Additionally, research will be brought to the classrooms of non-physics majors in a General Physics course. This research will promote further involvement of women and underrepresented minorities in a forefront research area. It is anticipated that this research and teaching program will provide Towson University students (who are more than 61% women and more than 16% minorities) with unique high technology skills.   &lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
