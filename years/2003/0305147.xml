    <AbstractNarration>This project addresses high-field carrier transient transport in nitride-based wide bandgap semiconductor nanostructures. The approach is to conduct systematic studies of transient electron and hole transport properties such as velocity overshoot and phonon dynamics in nitride-based wide bandgap semiconductor nanostructures by using time-resolved, sub-picosecond Raman spectroscopy. Goals are to achieve greater understanding of fundamental phenomena to define optimal device operation conditions, and to provide the basis for the design of a new class of high performance electronic devices. &lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;An important impact of the project is in education and human resource development through the integration of research and education. The proposed research program will enhance the PI's student mentorship activities and increase chances of attracting minority students pursuing advanced degrees at ASU. The proposed research program will further enhance the existing infrastructure of both nanostructured materials as well as wide bandgap semiconductors having advantages in computing and signal processing technologies. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
