    <AbstractNarration>The University of Massachusetts - Boston, located on Boston Harbor, is offering a ten-week REU program in Biology. The program provides opportunities to ten undergraduate participants each summer to become immersed in a positive research experience. Each student carries out an independent research project under the close guidance of a faculty advisor. The program stresses the integration of diverse fields of biology, demonstrating common themes across the biological sciences and especially the connections between cell and molecular biology on the one hand, and ecology and conservation biology on the other. Accordingly, student research projects will span a diverse array of problems in biology. The projects are designed to help students develop independence in making research decisions, understand the complexities of experimental design, and appreciate their broad field of research. In addition to carrying out research projects, students participate in enrichment activities designed to promote a sense of community, enhance communication skills, help students understand the issues surrounding modern biology, and prepare students for advanced work in science. These experiences occur during weekly discussions and workshops that focus on practical, personal, and ethical aspects of research. The program also features a three-day retreat at our Nantucket Island Field Station, other field trips in and around Boston Harbor, and final research presentations. The program will serve a culturally and ethnically diverse student population, thus broadening the participation in science of underrepresented groups. Close mentoring relationships, as well as collegial interactions among student participants, are key components of the experience. The program is designed to stimulate and support interest in biological research and to equip students to pursue research careers.
