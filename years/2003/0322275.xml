<AbstractNarration>Academic historians have treated the history of the automobile in America as a story of big business, mass production, and mass marketing.  A number of scholars have also sought to highlight some of the other critical themes and issues which emerge from a careful consideration of this history, including the construction of the Interstate Highways, the growth of suburbia, and the relationship between mass automobility and environmental degradation. Nevertheless, much work remains to be done on the role of the automobile user in the making of this history. This STS dissertation improvement grant supports field work for a dissertation which focuses on the pursuits of a particular subset of automobile users whose absence from the standard histories defies easy explanation: hot rodders, those who seek to modify their standard production automobiles for improved performance. NSF funding will support a series of trips to archival collections in California, Florida, and Washington, DC. These archival research excursions will help to flesh out the body of the dissertation by providing the principal investigator with evidence regarding the manufacture of speed equipment, the background and training of the industry's pioneers, and the relationship between the high-performance industry and governmental regulators which would otherwise be unavailable. In addition, funding will support oral interviews in California with the surviving pioneers of the speed equipment industry, interviews that will provide the principal investigator with first-hand insights which would otherwise be unknowable.   This dissertation will shed new light on the history of the automobile in America in four ways. It will highlight the survival of a flexibly oriented, consumer-driven automotive industry in the shadow of the Big Three. It will emphasize the lingering importance of technological enthusiasm in the evolution of automobility. It will use the experience of the speed equipment industry to reexamine and revise our understanding of the mistakes made by the Big Three in its dealings with governmental regulators in the 1960s and 1970s. And, finally, it will challenge the longstanding notion that the automobile had become a "black box" by the 1920s, documenting the extent to which the social constructivists "end-user interpretive flexibility" has instead remained quite strong throughout the history of the automobile. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
