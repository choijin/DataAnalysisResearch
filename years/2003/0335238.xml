    <AbstractNarration>In recent years, mobile computing has enjoyed a tremendous rise&lt;br/&gt;in popularity and has been used in various sectors of the society. &lt;br/&gt;Sensor networks, Ad hoc wireless networks, and Peer-to-peer networks &lt;br/&gt;(simply called SAP networks) play a central role in the development of &lt;br/&gt;emerging network paradigms. These three networks are characterized by &lt;br/&gt;their ad hoc nature without infrastructure or centralized administration.&lt;br/&gt;Unlike infrastructured networks, including cellular networks, where nodes &lt;br/&gt;interact through a centralized base station, nodes in an SAP network&lt;br/&gt;interact in a peer-to-peer fashion. As a result of the mobility (including &lt;br/&gt;join/leave the network) of their nodes, SAP networks are characterized by &lt;br/&gt;dynamically changing topologies. The applications of SAP networks range &lt;br/&gt;from civilian (file-sharing) to disaster recovery (search-and-rescue),&lt;br/&gt;and military (battlefield).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Workshop on Theoretical and Algorithmic Aspects of Sensor, &lt;br/&gt;Ad hoc wireless, and Peer-to-peer Networks brings an international forum on &lt;br/&gt;the recent development on theoretical and algorithmic aspects of three related &lt;br/&gt;fields. The workshop seeks to bring together different research disciplines&lt;br/&gt;to initiate a comprehensive technical discussion on theoretical and &lt;br/&gt;algorithmic approaches to three related fields. The objective of the &lt;br/&gt;workshop is to identify several common theoretical and algorithmic approaches &lt;br/&gt;that can address issues related to SAP networks. The central topic of the &lt;br/&gt;workshop revolves around the following two questions: What are the central &lt;br/&gt;technical issues in SAP networks? What are the possible solutions/tools&lt;br/&gt;available to address these issues? After identifying areas for research, &lt;br/&gt;the next focus of this workshop is on future research challenges. This &lt;br/&gt;workshop seeks a broad impact through a mix of theoretical researchers and &lt;br/&gt;practitioners (from local industry) and by helping to stimulate collaborations. We believe that theoretical progress on the research topic in the workshop will&lt;br/&gt;have a long-term impact on SAP networks. A major theme of the workshop&lt;br/&gt;is the integration of research and education. It is addressed through &lt;br/&gt;participation of graduate students, especially from regional universities&lt;br/&gt;in South Florida, which have a high percentage of Hispanic and Black students.</AbstractNarration>
