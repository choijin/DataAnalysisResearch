<AbstractNarration>The proposed research consists of 8 experimental studies designed to test a new, cognitive, theory of motivation. The basic assumption of the theory is that goals and means for their attainment are mentally represented, and in this sense they constitute cognitive entities that can be cognitively activated. Our preliminary research suggests that the degree to which goals are cognitively associated with attainment means promotes goal commitment and the degree to which goals bring other, competing, goals to mind detracts from goal commitment. Goal commitment, in turn, determines the individuals' persistence and quality of performance at various tasks. Four experiments are designed to explore those aspects of our theory. Our preliminary research also indicates that individuals may learn specific activation  patterns between low level momentary goals (referred to as temptations) in conflict with higher order, long term goals. An adaptive pattern is one in which (1) activation (e.g. via sight) of a temptation (say a fattening food for a dieter) immediately activates the superordinate goal (dieting) with which the temptation is in conflict and (2) activation of the superordinate goal (i.e., the concept of dieting) inhibits the mental activation of the temptation. Similarly, a maladaptive activation pattern is one in which (1) an activation of the superordinate goal (e.g. dieting, academic success) brings to mind the temptation (e.g., fattening foods, television watching), and (2) activation of the temptation inhibits the activation of the superordinate goal. Four experiments are testing the implications of this analysis for increasing the adaptiveness of people's activation patterns and examines the effects this has on persons' ability to exercise functional self control, hence increase their ability to resist temptations. &lt;br/&gt; The potential insights from the present research have important implications for a variety of basic psychological concerns. Goal commitment, a central variable in the proposed work is pertinent to such issues as the ability to commit to close relationships, or to succeed in one's chosen profession. Understanding the dynamics of commitment may improve our ability to induce commitment to realistic goals, and to reduce commitment to unattainable pursuits known to result in unhappiness and frustration. Furthermore, understanding the dynamics of overcoming temptations may increase our ability to train individuals in adaptive self control, and in this sense contribute to their success and personal life satisfaction. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
