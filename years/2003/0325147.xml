<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this proposal is to request funds from the National Science Foundation in partial&lt;br/&gt;support of the forthcoming Block Island Workshop on Cooperative Control which is scheduled to&lt;br/&gt;take place on June 10 and 11, 2003 at the Spring House Hotel on Block Island, Rhode Island.&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of this workshop is to bring together a small number of individuals from&lt;br/&gt;such fields as animal biology, robotics, automatic control, communications and sensor networks,&lt;br/&gt;artificial intelligence, dynamical systems, algorithms, etc. with interests in group coordination and&lt;br/&gt;cooperative control  not primarily to present their current work, but rather to delineate common&lt;br/&gt;ground and to identify fundamental unresolved problems in the rapidly evolving, cross-disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;field of cooperative control of natural and man-made groups.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding on the one&lt;br/&gt;hand, how various animal aggregations such as fish schools, bird ocks, deer herds, etc. coordinate&lt;br/&gt;their collective motions to perform useful tasks and on the other, how groups of mobile autonomous&lt;br/&gt;agents such as AUV schools, UAV ocks, etc., might be instructed to cooperate in a similar man-ner.&lt;br/&gt;In ecology and evolutionary biology, for example, it is of great interest to understand how&lt;br/&gt;natural groupings coordinate themselves and move so awlessly, often without an apparent leader&lt;br/&gt;or any form of centralized control. What kinds of signaling must they use? What role if any,&lt;br/&gt;does the physical medium, environmental context, currents, vortices, or other local environmental&lt;br/&gt;disturbances play in this process? Are there universal principles of coordinated group motion and&lt;br/&gt;if so what might they be? Could such principles be used in a robotic context to help enable a large&lt;br/&gt;group of autonomously functioning vehicles in the air, on land or sea or underwater, to collectively&lt;br/&gt;accomplish, in a safe and coordinated manner, useful tasks such as distributed, adaptive scientific&lt;br/&gt;data gathering, search and rescue, and reconnaissance? In broad terms, these are the questions to&lt;br/&gt;which this workshop is addressed.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This workshop will advance discovery and understanding while promoting&lt;br/&gt;teaching, training and learning by including student participation at the workshop. The work-shop&lt;br/&gt;will broaden participation of under-represented groups by encouraging such individuals to&lt;br/&gt;actively participate in the workshop. Without question, this highly interdisciplinary meeting&lt;br/&gt;will enhance infrastructure for research and education by significantly increasing the potential for&lt;br/&gt;cross-disciplinary research among participants and between parent institutions. The workshop will&lt;br/&gt;broaden dissemination to enhance scientific and technological understanding by means of a published&lt;br/&gt;proceedings and well as by consequential presentations and publications to a wide semi-technical&lt;br/&gt;community.</AbstractNarration>
