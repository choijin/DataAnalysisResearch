<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop an x-ray microscope capable of providing real-time, in-vivo images of specimens ranging from from mice to bacteria. The proposed technology combines visible and x-ray optics concepts to develop a completely new radiological imaging system capable of record x-ray-imaging resolutions. This microscope will be built using commercially available characteristic line x-ray tubes and high-resolution imaging detectors along with the company's previously developed x-ray lenses and optical system, making it an inexpensive, table-top tool. The Phase I work will provide a design for a commercial prototype to be built in the follow on Phase II project, and will answer critical technical questions including what narrowband x-ray flux can be delivered to the specimen and what image quality can be expected for a variety of biological samples. In addition, experimental work will demonstrate imaging using an x-ray tube source, both as a proof-of-principle and to confirm the accuracy of design calculations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project is in biological and medical research. The proposed x-ray microscope will be a valuable research tool for scientists, biotechnology and medical research companies and institutions. By allowing high resolution, in-vivo imaging of organisms and structures as small as 10 nm, the microscope is expected to be a valuable tool for molecular and cellular research. At larger resolutions, the microscope would allow imaging in small animals, particularly mice, allowing the tracking of biological processes, such as angiogenesis, without harming the mouse. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
