<AbstractNarration>OIA-0342159&lt;br/&gt;Haak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding is provided to the National Academy of Science (NAS) Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy and the Board on Higher Education and the Workforce to undertake a broad examination of the current status and role of international graduate students and post-doc scholars in the United States, a national science and technology policy concern. The committee will address several topics, including the desire to recruit the best domestic and international talent, examine the influence of international students on the Nation's labor force, economy and the science and engineering community. Results from this undertaking will help the committee formulate principles that should guide national policy regarding international students and provide a better understanding of the impact these students have on the STEM graduate education pipeline.  This study could help NSF, other federal agencies and private STEM foundations better plan for the Nation's science and engineering future and national security.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
