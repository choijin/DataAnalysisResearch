<AbstractNarration>Complex products requiring a large number of high-performance parts characterize the aerospace industry, but this product complexity is contrasted by an extremely low volume throughput.  For aerospace applications, advanced composite materials offer a number of advantages over metals including relatively high specific strengths and elastic moduli, which can lead to tailoring of shape and microstructure to meet performance requirements.  Unfortunately, the use of composite parts in this industry has been severely limited by the prohibitive fabrication cost and time of advanced composite component, along with the need to store and maintain many under-utilized molds at great expense.  In response to this need, the use of active discrete tooling (i.e., matrix of pins tooling that changes shape during the forming process based on electronically stored geometry) for composites forming is currently being considered. Recently, the PIs have successfully demonstrated that (1) composite forming using active tooling is possible and (2) it increases the number of components that can be successfully manufactured by the forming process.  In addition, mold development and storage is greatly simplified because a single reconfigurable tool is used.  &lt;br/&gt;This 3-year project sponsored by the National Science Foundation will seek to develop a fundamental understanding of composites forming process with active tooling, emphasizing particularly the effects of process variables on part formability and fiber reorientation.  The research will concentrate on process development and on developing mathematical models and numerical modeling schemes that relate the material deformation modes necessary to form complex shapes, to advanced forming techniques and geometric features. The project includes support from Northrop Grumman in the form of materials testing, expertise in composites forming, and access to a larger reconfigurable tool, resulting in more rapid technology transfer to the aerospace industry. In addition, the proposal includes involvement of undergraduates (REU) and the integration of the research into specific undergraduate and graduate courses as case studies, semester design projects, and laboratory exercises. Overall, the proposed research has the potential to significantly improve part formability and reduce process time and cost for low to medium volume forming of relatively large parts from composite sheet. This can extend beyond aerospace to specialized automotive, marine, and biomedical applications. The research will also lead to improved simulation of composites forming, which is currently a major barrier to expanded use of composites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
