<AbstractNarration>Quantum computation is often viewed as the next frontier in computing and communication. Consider the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Some quantum algorithms run asymptotically faster than their classical counterparts. The most striking example is Shor's number-factoring algorithm. This algorithm, in theory, can break the widely used RSA cryptosystem (used in "Internet codes") in polynomial time. Significant challenges remain to physically implement Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers, and it is currently unclear which technology is most promising.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Quantum cryptography provides fundamentally more secure communications. Quantum key distribution (QKD) has been demonstrated at distances over one mile in free space and over 100 miles in fiber. The Swiss company IdQuantique is selling QKD hardware and the U.S. company MagiQ Technologies has recently announced related products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Quantum computation can, in principle, be done at a much smaller scale than contemporary semiconductor devices. One molecule in liquid NMR technologies or one photon in optical implementations can perform quantum computation or store quantum information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Classical computation is commonly used to model numerous aspects of the physical world  - from sending mail and reproducing paintings to simulating natural disasters and armed conflicts. Yet, classical computation is fundamentally limited in its ability to simulate quantum-mechanical effects, such as photosynthesis, radioactive decay and nuclear fusion. Quantum computers may offer more efficient simulation in this context. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum circuits currently constitute a dominant model for quantum computation, and our proposed work addresses automatic synthesis of quantum circuits. This work applies to any quantum implementation technology, but it also can take into account specific constraints and optimizations entailed by popular technologies. In particular, practical implementations of known quantum algorithms may require minimizing the use of gates that are expensive, slow or especially faulty in particular technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum computations can be described by unitary matrices. In order to effect a quantum computation on a quantum computer, one must decompose such a matrix into a quantum circuit, which consists of elementary quantum gates connected by Kronecker (tensor) and matrix products. Those connections are often represented using quantum circuit schematics. The matrix and graph-based notations for quantum circuits are analogous to how classical logic circuits are modelled by Boolean polynomials, e.g., during logic synthesis. Classical logic synthesis uses algorithms for factoring polynomials, and we therefore guess that quantum synthesis algorithms will benefit from matrix factorizations. Our preliminary research shows that this is, indeed, the case. Motivated by our findings, we propose to take a deeper look at the algebraic theory behind matrix factorizations (SVD, QR, polar and others) and possible applications to quantum circuit synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
