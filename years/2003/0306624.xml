<AbstractNarration>The aim of this project is to extend the study of non-commutative &lt;br/&gt;differential geometry of deformation quantization algebras, and to apply it &lt;br/&gt;to symplectic geometry. A deformation quantization is a new multiplication &lt;br/&gt;law on an algebra of function on a manifold which depends on a formal &lt;br/&gt;parameter. When the value of the parameter is zero, then this product &lt;br/&gt;becomes the usual product of functions. All such deformation quantizations &lt;br/&gt;were classified by Kontsevich. The simplest examples of them arise from &lt;br/&gt;algebras of differential operators on manifolds. In our previous work, we &lt;br/&gt;computed for all deformed algebras basic invariants of non-commutative &lt;br/&gt;differential geometry (Hochschild and cyclic homology, etc.). We applied &lt;br/&gt;these results to prove generalized Atiyah-Singer index theorems. Our main &lt;br/&gt;tool was what we call non-commutative differential calculus, which is an &lt;br/&gt;extension of classical algebraic constructions with forms and multi-vectors &lt;br/&gt;to non-commutative setting. The new project is aimed at developing both &lt;br/&gt;non-commutative geometry and algebra of deformation quantization, in &lt;br/&gt;particular a theory of modules over deformation quantization rings, and at &lt;br/&gt;applying them to symplectic geometry, in particular to the Fukaya theory of &lt;br/&gt;Lagrangian intersections and to mirror symmetry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main aim of this project is to develop what we call non-commutative &lt;br/&gt;differential calculus. By this we mean an extension of the clasical &lt;br/&gt;multi-variable calculus to the case when the variables no longer commute, &lt;br/&gt;i.e. when the value of the product is no longer independent of the order of &lt;br/&gt;factors. Such situations arise very naturally in mathematics and physics; in &lt;br/&gt;quantum mechanics, the non-commutativity expresses mathematically the &lt;br/&gt;uncertainty principle of Heisenberg. We intend to apply the non-commutative &lt;br/&gt;calculus to so called deformation quantization, a geometric setup very much &lt;br/&gt;motivated by quantum mechanics. Our previous work in this direction yielded &lt;br/&gt;new proofs and generalizations of classical theorems about solutions of &lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations; our new project aims at applications to &lt;br/&gt;geometric questions of mathematical physics, such as string theory, mirror &lt;br/&gt;symmetry, and Lagrangian intersections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
