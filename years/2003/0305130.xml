<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL DMS-0305130&lt;br/&gt;LOW-DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY AND MONOPOLES&lt;br/&gt;P.Is: Yann Rollin, Gang Tian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the proposed project is to study a manifold with boundary, and&lt;br/&gt;some additional structure, in relation with the boundary values of the&lt;br/&gt;structure. This generic framework is a very natural approach to many&lt;br/&gt;important questions of differential geometry. Some typical cases are those&lt;br/&gt;of contact structures fillable by symplectic forms, complex geometry and&lt;br/&gt;Cauchy-Riemann boundary, Einstein geometry and conformal infinity. It is&lt;br/&gt;interesting to study how deformation theory of the boundary induces&lt;br/&gt;deformations of a filling. This problem is often related to some positive&lt;br/&gt;frequency condition, which is of particular interest for physicists. This&lt;br/&gt;will be used to study singular Yang-Mills connections of (a conjectural)&lt;br/&gt;Donaldson theory on Calabi-Yau 3-manifolds. More generally, we look at the&lt;br/&gt;picture of a moduli space on the manifold which projects on a&lt;br/&gt;corresponding moduli space defined on the boundary. Whenever it can be&lt;br/&gt;shown that the projection has a finite nonzero degree in some sense, we&lt;br/&gt;obtain a powerfull tool to prove the existence of fillings. Another way to&lt;br/&gt;tackle the questions of existence is to develop gluing theorems between&lt;br/&gt;moduli spaces. Some applications of gluing for Seiberg-Witten equations&lt;br/&gt;are already being developped thus giving new perspectives on contact&lt;br/&gt;geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A physical theory is defined by a configuration space, together with&lt;br/&gt;objects (for example a metric) verifying particular equations.&lt;br/&gt;The state of a physical system is constrained  by its configuration on&lt;br/&gt;the  boundary of the space, or, at infinity. Therefore, it is a&lt;br/&gt;natural question to ask wether a theory is rich or empty: is it&lt;br/&gt;possible to find a physical system with a given behavior on the&lt;br/&gt;boundary, and if so, do we have many solutions? In other words is the&lt;br/&gt;system soft or rigid? Beyond the physical flavor, this approach, known&lt;br/&gt;as a field theory, has deep implications in mathematics. First, it is&lt;br/&gt;required to elaborate original tools in analysis, called moduli space&lt;br/&gt;theories,  that have their own beauty. Secondly, the method relates&lt;br/&gt;very different problems. To illustrate that, we mention the following&lt;br/&gt;situation: we consider a 3-dimensional space (it could be the&lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional sphere) bounding a 4-dimensional space (like the ball&lt;br/&gt;inside the sphere). Then, we look at knots on the boundary (they could&lt;br/&gt;be  strands of DNA). These knots can be thought of as the boundary of&lt;br/&gt;a surface lying into the 4-dimensional space. Then, it can be shown&lt;br/&gt;that there is a subtle relation between the knot theory in dimension 3&lt;br/&gt;and the theory of surfaces lying in a 4-dimensional space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
