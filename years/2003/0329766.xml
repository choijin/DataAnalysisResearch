<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Populating our world with networks of sensors requires fundamental understanding of tech-&lt;br/&gt;niques for connecting and managing sensor nodes with a communication network in scalable&lt;br/&gt;and resource-e .cient ways.The proposed research involves a comprehensive program of sensor&lt;br/&gt;network architecture,design,evaluation,and implementation that integrates research expertise&lt;br/&gt;in the areas of wireless networking and multiuser communications and provides numerous op-&lt;br/&gt;portunities for enhancing student research and education in the area of sensor networks,at both&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate levels.&lt;br/&gt;The dominant trend in sensor network practice is to consider a dense collection of tiny sensor&lt;br/&gt;nodes with limited computation and communication capabilities,all connected via a .at,or&lt;br/&gt;ad hoc,wireless network.Yet theoretical studies in multiuser communications suggest that&lt;br/&gt;substantially improved performance can be obtained through sophisticated coordination among&lt;br/&gt;nodes,requiring more versatile radios,hierarchy,and perhaps even sparse wired connectivity.&lt;br/&gt;Thus,the objectives of the proposed research are to:1)identify network architectures that&lt;br/&gt;permit the implementation of sophisticated transmission schemes that have been theoretically&lt;br/&gt;studied,2)analyze such schemes in the context of sensor networks and design new ones adopting&lt;br/&gt;a cross-layer approach and 3)implement these schemes and verify their behavior on a real&lt;br/&gt;testbed.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in the improved understanding of an important&lt;br/&gt;emerging class of wireless networks,and in the attempt to unite theory and practice.Clos-&lt;br/&gt;ing the widening gap between theoretically proposed strategies and practically implemented&lt;br/&gt;ones is crucial to understanding and improving the performance and lifetime of these resource-&lt;br/&gt;constrained networks.Through a rigorous analytic approach,contributions to the emerging area&lt;br/&gt;of network information theory are expected,leading to substantial advances in energy-e .cient&lt;br/&gt;and delay-constrained protocol design.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact is manifested in part through an e .ort to integrate teaching and research.&lt;br/&gt;Experimentation on a hardware platform plays an integral role in both research and education.&lt;br/&gt;It will be used for veri .cation,as well as for undergraduate and graduate projects that provide&lt;br/&gt;students with hands-on experience in a real sensor network testbed.This project will enable&lt;br/&gt;the acquisition of the necessary hardware.Two newly developed graduate courses on multiuser&lt;br/&gt;communications and wireless networking will bene .t greatly from this project.It is anticipated&lt;br/&gt;that by such close linking,research and education cross-fertilize each other within the framework&lt;br/&gt;of this proposal.Further,since the proposed architectures and related issues carry over to other&lt;br/&gt;important classes of networks,the .ndings from this research will have an impact on a much&lt;br/&gt;broader class of wireless networks,including multihop cellular networks,that may soon become&lt;br/&gt;signi .cant for a major part of our society.The broader impact will also be felt through a broad&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of results and through current and future interactions with other universities.&lt;br/&gt;A-1</AbstractNarration>
