<AbstractNarration>Microencapsulation is the process of embedding an additive in a colloidal particle.&lt;br/&gt;This technology is widely used to provide extended release of entrapped compounds such&lt;br/&gt;as drugs or fragrances. However, microencapsulation may be used to produce composite&lt;br/&gt;particles with controlled optical, chemical, or physical properties for a wealth of&lt;br/&gt;applications. Current microencapsulation technology typically requires organic solvents&lt;br/&gt;that are difficult to remove from the polymer. Residual solvent is especially undesirable for&lt;br/&gt;food and drug applications where the maximum allowable concentration is very low. We&lt;br/&gt;propose to study the transport of additives into colloidal polymer particles dispersed in an&lt;br/&gt;emulsion of liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide and water in an effort to reduce or&lt;br/&gt;eliminate the need for organic solvents. At elevated pressures, carbon dioxide swells and&lt;br/&gt;plasticizes the polymer particles, facilitating mass transport. Surfactants are used to&lt;br/&gt;stabilize the emulsion of CO2 and water. The surfactants also adsorb on the surface of the&lt;br/&gt;particles to enhance colloidal stability. After depressurization, the polymer particles return&lt;br/&gt;to their original size and shape, entrapping the additive. The adsorbed surfactant remains&lt;br/&gt;on the surface and thus offers a route to controlling the surface chemistry of the particles.&lt;br/&gt;Biodegradable and biocompatible polymer colloids will be impregnated with drugs,&lt;br/&gt;chromophores, and luminescent nanoparticles with the aid of CO2, water, and non-toxic&lt;br/&gt;surfactants. In addition, we propose to couple CO2 processing with traditional&lt;br/&gt;microencapsulation techniques to lower residual solvent content and sterilize polymer&lt;br/&gt;particles. The proposed research will provide a flexible, biologically and environmentally&lt;br/&gt;friendly route to the production of composite particles used as devices for drug delivery,&lt;br/&gt;tracers and indicators for drug discovery and genomics, and other composite colloidal&lt;br/&gt;particles useful for catalysis, coatings, and optical materials. To broaden the impact of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed research, a computer based instructional module on microencapsulation&lt;br/&gt;technology will be developed and incorporated into the course 'Interfacial Engineering' at&lt;br/&gt;the University of Rochester with the assistance of a commercial educational software&lt;br/&gt;vendor. The software vendor has expressed interest in incorporating the module into their&lt;br/&gt;existing software for broader distribution. Undergraduate and graduate students from&lt;br/&gt;diverse backgrounds will be recruited to work on the project through existing programs at&lt;br/&gt;the University of Rochester.</AbstractNarration>
