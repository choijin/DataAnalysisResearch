<AbstractNarration>McBay &lt;br/&gt;OIA-0351139&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network, a non-profit organization, has been instrumental in improving the education of under-represented groups that have been historically underserved by the nation's educational system.  A successor to the Quality Education for Minorities Project based at MIT, QEM continues to develop effective strategies of STEM education for under-represented populations, and focuses on issues and barriers that prevent minorities from receiving a high quality education.  In order to offer competitive research and research training programs in STEM, it is imperative that all US faculty and students participating in the research enterprise have access to state-of-the-art instrumentation enabling them to perform high quality research. This award to QEM will continue previous efforts in providing technical assistance to minority -serving institutions; equipping faculty with the essential tools needed to develop competitive instrumentation proposals to NSF's equipment programs, including the Major Research Instrumentation Program.  As a result all US institutions will have opportunity to secure funds needed to facilitate their efforts in the quest to unravel the challenges presented by the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
