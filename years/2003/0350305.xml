<AbstractNarration>This SLC Catalyst activity seeks to establish a Science of Learning Center, the International Center for the Study of Problem Solving, that plans and implements a systematic research agenda on everyday and professional problem solving encountered in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics contexts.  Those problems are ill-structured and require substantially different thinking and reasoning processes from the well-structured story problems that students normally solve in secondary and higher education.  Better understanding the nature of problems that are solved in science and engineering contexts will focus research on the social and intellectual processes engaged by those problems.   That research will enable the development of instructional methods to better prepare students to solve the complex and ill-structured problems encountered in the workplace.  The project will begin to analyze and articulate the problem-solving demands of the workplace, set research agendas, assemble a collaborative team of international researchers and practitioners in medicine, engineering, manufacturing, military, agriculture, psychology, psychiatry, and other domains, and prepare a proposal for funding of a full center.  The ultimate goal of the Center will be to help change the paradigm of formal education from knowledge dissemination to meaningful problem solving.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In everyday and professional practice, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics professionals being prepared in universities are paid to solve problems. Although national standards for science and engineering students emphasize problem solving processes, they are too infrequently engaged in secondary and university programs. Although mathematics, science and engineering courses and curricula require students to solve problems more than any other curricula, most problems are well-structured story problems, whereas scientists and engineers in industry are required to solve complex and ill-structured problems. Recent research shows that learning to solve well-structured story problems does not help students learn how to solve complex and ill-structured professional problems. Yet, most of the research on problem solving has examined only story problems.  We need to better understand how workplace problems are solved in order to develop methods for preparing faculty members to teach their students how to solve different kinds of problems. A more skilled professional workforce will make science and engineering firms employing these graduates more productive and efficient at solving the increasingly vexing problems that face American industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SLC Catalyst activity will 1) organize, analyze, and articulate existing research in problem solving; 2) plan and conduct an international workshop in which a multi-disciplinary team of practitioners and researchers from diverse backgrounds will negotiate research agendas to be pursued by the Center; 3) publish the results of the workshop in a book; and 4) prepare a full proposal to establish the International Center for the Study of Problem Solving. The grant will begin to develop business and university partnerships where diverse researchers can generate and test more effective approaches to preparing students to become effective problem solvers. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
