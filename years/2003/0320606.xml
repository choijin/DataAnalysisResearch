<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dickinson College under the direction of Dr. &lt;br/&gt;John Henson to support the acquisition of a laser scanning confocal light &lt;br/&gt;microscope.  The ongoing renaissance in the use of light microscopy for &lt;br/&gt;research and education in cell biology, neurobiology and developmental &lt;br/&gt;biology has been fueled by the capabilities of confocal microscopy &lt;br/&gt;systems.  They have become the instrument of choice due to their ability &lt;br/&gt;to "optically section" cells and tissues and therefore allow for the 3D &lt;br/&gt;spatial resolution needed to define structural relationships, along with the &lt;br/&gt;temporal resolution needed to follow dynamic processes.  Dickinson &lt;br/&gt;College, an undergraduate institution with an excellent record of &lt;br/&gt;student/faculty research and an innovative science education program, &lt;br/&gt;will use this confocal microscope to support student/faculty research, &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate education, and community outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The confocal microscopy system will be equipped with a microinjection &lt;br/&gt;set up and will support a wide variety of student/faculty research projects.  &lt;br/&gt;The mechanism of cell motility and division will be addressed in &lt;br/&gt;experiments using sea urchin adult cells and embryos.  How the liver &lt;br/&gt;transports toxic waste will be the focus of studies using cultures of skate &lt;br/&gt;liver cells. The turning on and off of specific genes during embryonic &lt;br/&gt;development will be worked on using fruit fly embryos.  The neural control &lt;br/&gt;of metamorphosis in molluscan embryos and the localization of memory &lt;br/&gt;mechanisms in the brains of conditioned day old chicks will be subject of &lt;br/&gt;other studies involving the use of this instrument. Undergraduate &lt;br/&gt;research students will be integral participants in all of these projects, &lt;br/&gt;contributing to experimental design, execution and analysis as well as the &lt;br/&gt;presentation of results at meetings and the publication of the results in &lt;br/&gt;scientific journals. In terms of impact on undergraduate education, the &lt;br/&gt;instrument will be incorporated into the teaching of courses in cell biology, &lt;br/&gt;developmental biology, neurobiology, molecular genetics and &lt;br/&gt;biopsychology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The presence of a confocal microscope at Dickinson will have a number &lt;br/&gt;of significant and pervasive broader impacts. Importantly this instrument &lt;br/&gt;will serve as one of the underpinnings for a new interdisciplinary major in &lt;br/&gt;Neuroscience at Dickinson that will involve coursework selected from the &lt;br/&gt;offerings of the Biology and Psychology programs. In terms of service to &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented student groups, women undergraduate students &lt;br/&gt;currently make up roughly 75% of the Biology, Biochemistry and Molecular &lt;br/&gt;Biology and Psychology majors. We also envision making this instrument &lt;br/&gt;available to faculty and students at Gettysburg and Franklin and Marshall &lt;br/&gt;Colleges, the two other member colleges of the Central Pennsylvania &lt;br/&gt;Consortium, as well as using both the Pennsylvania Academy of &lt;br/&gt;Sciences and the American Society for Cell Biology meetings as fora for &lt;br/&gt;discussing applications of confocal microscopy in a small college setting.  &lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, we plan to write up research-oriented teaching labs that &lt;br/&gt;utilize the confocal for publication in the new on line journal Cell Biology &lt;br/&gt;Education. In terms of community outreach, the confocal microscope will &lt;br/&gt;be used in a Howard Hughes Medical Institute-funded program in which &lt;br/&gt;local high school teachers attend summer workshops in cell and &lt;br/&gt;molecular biology at Dickinson. The instrument will be used by teachers &lt;br/&gt;during these workshops and made available for use by visiting high &lt;br/&gt;school student groups during the academic year.</AbstractNarration>
