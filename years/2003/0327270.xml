<AbstractNarration>This research examines solar energy technology diffusion in rural Sri Lanka,&lt;br/&gt;one of the fastest-growing solar energy markets in the World. Solar&lt;br/&gt;photovoltaic systems produce electricity without emitting the pollutants and&lt;br/&gt;climate-changing gases associated with electricity production by more&lt;br/&gt;pervasive fossil fuels, and are beginning to find a niche in rural areas in&lt;br/&gt;developing countries that do not have access to grid electricity. This&lt;br/&gt;research will discover the social, infrastructural, market-related, spatial&lt;br/&gt;and environmental factors that best explain why solar home systems (SHS) are&lt;br/&gt;being adopted quickly in some parts of the country, and more slowly in&lt;br/&gt;others. It is essential that we understand what factors most influence&lt;br/&gt;acceptance and adoption of sustainable energy technologies in different&lt;br/&gt;geographic contexts, in order to create more effective policies that better&lt;br/&gt;meet all peoples' need for efficient, reliable and environmentally-sound&lt;br/&gt;energy services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will also discover the factors that affect how different&lt;br/&gt;individuals: come to know about SHS; develop opinions of SHS; decide to&lt;br/&gt;adopt SHS; implement the decision to adopt SHS; re-evaluate their decision&lt;br/&gt;after adopting SHS; and are differently impacted-upon by adopting SHS or by&lt;br/&gt;the SHS adoption process within their community. Factors that will be&lt;br/&gt;investigated to explain variation in SHS adoption behavior and in the&lt;br/&gt;impacts of SHS adoption among different people include: characteristics of&lt;br/&gt;their personal social networks; the level of trust in their relationships&lt;br/&gt;and in their community; the behavioral norms and the strength of sanctions&lt;br/&gt;on behavior within their social network and in their community; their wealth&lt;br/&gt;class; their ethnicity; their gender; their occupation (or livelihood);&lt;br/&gt;their access to outside information; availability of the technology; and&lt;br/&gt;their access to low-interest loans that facilitate SHS purchase.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the diverse adoption behaviors and experiences of the SHS&lt;br/&gt;adoption process among different types of people in a community will draw&lt;br/&gt;policy-makers attention to the fact that the diffusion of this innovation&lt;br/&gt;affects different people's lives in different ways. Energy service delivery&lt;br/&gt;programs and policies must therefore be crafted in light of detailed&lt;br/&gt;information at the personal level to ensure that all members of a community,&lt;br/&gt;especially those most disadvantaged, have access to and benefit from&lt;br/&gt;essential energy services. This NSF-funded research not only will produce&lt;br/&gt;knowledge that helps forward the interests of American companies active in&lt;br/&gt;Sri Lanka and other growing solar energy markets, but more importantly, it&lt;br/&gt;helps fulfill our responsibility to create opportunities that improve&lt;br/&gt;people's lives in a post-conflict state.</AbstractNarration>
