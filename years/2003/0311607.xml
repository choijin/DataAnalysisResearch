<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)   We are incorporating molecular modeling activities and experiments throughout the undergraduate chemistry and biochemistry curriculum to enhance student learning. We are adapting the Hope College's molecular modeling and computational chemistry model for our courses by implementing several published modeling activities and also developing our own open-ended exercises to integrate into the Principles of Chemistry course, honors General Chemistry course and the Physical Chemistry sequence.  We anticipate a four-fold program enhancement. First, the project is a strategic way to more effectively and meaningfully engage students in our introductory chemistry course. Second, molecular modeling enhances students' conceptual and visual understanding of the molecules that are at the heart of chemistry. Third, molecular modeling can improve student outcomes throughout the curriculum by providing a progression in the sophistication of computational chemistry as a thread and pedagogical resource. A fourth goal is providing majors with a realistic understanding of the underlying computational theory. The use of a Linux-based cluster acting as a Web server for a variety of Web-based molecular modeling tools in the project provides a unique opportunity to address these goals. Two summer faculty development workshops are conducted to add quality, quantity, and breadth to the project implementation. Further, specific curricular enhancements are also planned in the form of offering a new molecular modeling course. We expect that this project will enhance the chemical education of our students in the life sciences, many of whom will pursue graduate study. As well, we expect that exposure to computational chemistry will be particularly important for students, given its ubiquitous use in academic and industrial research in chemistry, biochemistry, and molecular biology.</AbstractNarration>
