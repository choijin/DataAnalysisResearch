<AbstractNarration>While exciting nano scientific discoveries stream continually from research laboratories, due to the lack of new manufacturing paradigms, scaling to industrial level production still faces critical challenges. The Center for Scalable and Integrated NAno Manufacturing (SINAM) embraces a vision for a new manufacturing paradigm that will transform laboratory science into industrial applications, in nano-electronics, biomedicine, and in traditional industries. We have organized an exceptional team of scientists and engineers from six institutions:  UCLA, UC Berkeley, Stanford, UCSD, University of North Carolina and HP Labs to embark on this important mission. SINAM proposes a nano-manufacturing paradigm that integrates an array of new nano-manufacturing technologies to address the above mentioned critical challenges. Proposed top-down nano-manufacturing technologies include:  a plasmonic imaging lithography (PIL) that uses engineered surface plasmons with extremely short wavelength, and ultra-molding lithography , both aiming nano manufacturing at the 1-10 nanometer scale. SINAM will further develop a novel hybrid approach, in combining the top-down and bottom up technologies to achieve massively parallel integration of heterogeneous nanoscale components into higher-order structures and devices.  SINAM will develop system engineering strategies to scale up the technologies developed and work with industry to develop next generation of nano manufacturing tools, which will be used for commercial product design and development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SINAM's broader impacts includes education and training for a high tech workforce, and societal outreach for general public benefits.   We will make special efforts with California schools to reach out to minority and female students. These educational activities include:  (1) Grades 7-12,  Discover Nanotechnology where SINAM researchers will create an inquiry module on Nanotechnology for students; (2) Nano-Manufacturing Summer Academy will provide a six weeks summer training for undergraduates students and K-12 grade school teachers; and (3) "Graduate Young Investigator (GYI)" and Industrial Internships for Graduate Students. To build awareness of the opportunities and impact of nano manufacturing, we will work with California Science Museums and the California State Economic Strategy Panel.  We also plan to work through professional organizations such as ASME, SME, and IEEE in organizing symposia. We will establish the SINAM Industrial Consortium to work closely with our industrial partners such as HP, IBM, etc, to transfer new technologies developed at SINAM to industrial applications. We have also developed partnerships with government laboratories as well as international top research centers in Europe and Asia. We have identified LARTA (Los Angeles Regional Technology Alliance, a non-profit organization) as our partner in technology transfer and economic development. SINAM's integrated research and education platform will have wide and profound impacts on human life experience through applications in computing, telecommunication, photonics, biotechnology, health care and national security. The new manufacturing paradigm to be developed will greatly impact the human society, its future and its history, just as the steam engine and the microelectronics revolution have done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
