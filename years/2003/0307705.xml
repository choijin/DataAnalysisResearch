<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST-0307705&lt;br/&gt;Burles&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the investigators will embark on a large survey of the high redshift intergalactic medium (IGM), by measurement of Lyman alpha absorption towards individual distant quasars.  Current results from this method agree very well with large numerical simulations and semi-analytic models, and to extend this progress,  a large number of quasar pairs and groups in close proximity on the sky will be targeted for deep follow-up spectroscopy.  Such a large sample can now be identified because of the results from the two largest redshift surveys, which are currently being completed.  In addition to their use for this plan, the spectra will be reduced, analyzed and made available to the community.   The foremost goal of the project is the geometrical distortion of the observed correlation function of the IGM, the classic Alcock-Paczynski (AP) test, which should measure the density of dark energy in the universe to a precision of five percent.   Combined with other datasets in preparation, the three-dimensional statistical correlations to be measured will introduce complementary constraints on cosmological parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves significant infrastructure enhancement, considerable student training, and broad dissemination of results of cross-disciplinary interest via MIT's OpenCourseWare initiative.  The investigators have preferred access to cutting edge facilities at the Magellan Observatories, whose influence on education they will try to maximize.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
