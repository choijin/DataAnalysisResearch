<AbstractNarration>The promise of producing a paradigm shift from traditional semiconductor devices to spin dependent devices to meet the sensing and storage demands of information technology in the 21st Century sets the criterion of combining spin electronics with nanoscience. To meet this criterion we offer a new method of fabricating nanowires using a self-assembly technique, while utilizing novel techniques to characterize arrays of nanowires. The spin transport properties of devices fabricated from self-assembled crystalline nanowire arrays will be studied to gain physical insight into the fundamental processes governing their behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a high-risk research activity, since the application of self-assembly to fabrication of spin electronic devices is untested. It is a high-payoff research activity, because a demonstration of the viability of this fabrication technique would enable experimenters a wider range of possible device configurations. Combining spin electronics and nanostructure fabrication techniques is essential for the development of technologically relevant devices and the technique of self-assembly is an enabling tool for making this combination possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research plan builds on the newly developed self-assembly process of glancing angle deposition to produce crystalline nanowire arrays which have spin valves incorporated in them.  The research plan thrusts are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;oNanofabrication of crystalline multilayered nanowires by self-assembly.&lt;br/&gt;oNanocircuit fabrication and performance testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These thrusts involve the application of advanced experimental techniques in which we have demonstrated expertise. The long-term goal of this research project is to investigate the details of the recently discovered spin transfer effect by studying the spin transport properties of nanoscale spin electronic devices. The first step toward realizing the potential of this fabrication technique is producing a magnetic field sensor that incorporates self-assembled nanowires in the sensing element. The main technical goal of this one-year activity will be to take the first step.  Successful fabrication of a working magnetic field sensor incorporating self-assembled nanowires will represent a significant advancement in the field of spin electronics and lead the way toward fabricating more complex structures using this promising technique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity include instructing and training the students and researchers involved in this technology development. The objectives are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;oEnhancing the graduate education program.&lt;br/&gt;oEncouraging active participation in the research by underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;oEnlightening researchers of spin transport phenomenon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These objectives originated from the mission of the Center for Materials for Information Technology at the University of Alabama, and progress toward them greatly enhances the research goals by insuring that the experiences are shared. The two graduate students working on this project will experience the excitement of working toward a goal that offers the opportunity of producing a breakthrough in nanofabrication and spin electronics technology development.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
