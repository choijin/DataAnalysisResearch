<AbstractNarration>Noiseless Data Compression is a key information technology used in innumerable&lt;br/&gt;data storage and transmission applications ranging from computer operating systems&lt;br/&gt;to modems to lossy compression standards.  Although the state-of-the-art has&lt;br/&gt;reached a certain level of maturity, with data compression algorithms that reach&lt;br/&gt;the fundamental information theoretic limits with linear computational complexity,&lt;br/&gt;they suffer from several shortcomings when used in packetized noisy channels.&lt;br/&gt;For this reason, no payload data compression is currently implemented in third-generation&lt;br/&gt;standards for high-speed wireless data transmission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we explore an alternative avenue to the conventional approach&lt;br/&gt;which seeks to design and analyze noiseless data compressors that are suitable for use&lt;br/&gt;in packetized data transmission through noisy channels while retaining the favorable&lt;br/&gt;properties of existing algorithms in terms of complexity and elimination of redundancy.&lt;br/&gt;The new approach is based on the use of modern capacity-approaching&lt;br/&gt;error-correcting encoding and decoding algorithms&lt;br/&gt;(such as low density parity check codes and  belief propagation, respectively)&lt;br/&gt;in a novel way that capitalizes on the recent discovery of a reversible&lt;br/&gt;transformation (block-sorting transform), which&lt;br/&gt;previous research by the PI and his collaborators has shown to transfer&lt;br/&gt;essentially all the memory redundancy present in ergodic&lt;br/&gt;discrete information sources to redundancy in the individual symbol outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;One of the most exciting applications of the new class of algorithms&lt;br/&gt;is the problem of joint data compression/transmission.  While Shannon's&lt;br/&gt;separation principle establishes no loss in asymptotic performance&lt;br/&gt;when compression and transmission are performed separately, it has long been&lt;br/&gt;expected that, in the nonasymptotic regime, gains may accrue by joint design.&lt;br/&gt;However, this promise has not yet been realized as existing schemes that take into&lt;br/&gt;account the source statistics at the decoder can only cope with very simplistic models.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
