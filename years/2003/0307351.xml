<AbstractNarration>AST-0307351&lt;br/&gt;Kandrup&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will continue a theoretical and numerical investigation of the role of chaos in galaxy structure and, especially, in galaxy evolution. It will attempt to explain three issues of fundamental importance.  Firstly, why is violent relaxation so effective?  Transient chaos triggered by large-amplitude oscillations may explain both rapid evolution and why the final state is comparatively insensitive to the initial conditions.  Secondly, could galaxies that reach near-equilibrium quickly, subsequently show slower systematic evolution?  And finally, the work will try to provide a dynamical explanation for correlations observed in the kinematics of early-type galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has broad inter-disciplinary implications for studies of non-neutral plasmas and charged particle beams, which will be explored in collaboration with charged beam dynamics experts.  It will also support a graduate student.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
