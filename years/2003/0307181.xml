    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is concerned with the study of a class of &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear differential equations arising in such diverse &lt;br/&gt;areas as fluid dynamics, cosmology, topological quantum &lt;br/&gt;field theory as well as theory of automorphic functions. &lt;br/&gt;These equations admit a large family of solutions in terms &lt;br/&gt;of modular forms and exhibit novel singularites in the &lt;br/&gt;form of movable natural boundaries in the complex domain. &lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this project is to characterize the &lt;br/&gt;complex dynamics of these nonlinear systems by analyzing &lt;br/&gt;their general solutions, symmetries and singularity structures&lt;br/&gt;in the complex plane. Various algebraic and geometric methods&lt;br/&gt;akin to the theory of completely integrable systems will be &lt;br/&gt;employed to carry out the proposed studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nonlinear differential equations are well known to have &lt;br/&gt;important applications in the modeling of complex physical &lt;br/&gt;phenomena arising in many areas of science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;This proposal is aimed to investigate the general solutions &lt;br/&gt;to a class of nonlinear differential equations, thereby shedding &lt;br/&gt;more light on the properties of the underlying physical systems &lt;br/&gt;described by these equations. The project will also explore &lt;br/&gt;the connection between these nonlinear equations and the theory &lt;br/&gt;of automorphic functions which traditionally arises in areas of &lt;br/&gt;pure mathematics such as number theory. The proposed research &lt;br/&gt;activities will be carried out in a primarily undergraduate &lt;br/&gt;institution. It is strongly anticipated that the proposed research &lt;br/&gt;will lead to undergraduate projects in several areas including &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear waves, dynamical systems, special functions and conformal &lt;br/&gt;mapping, all of which have wide ranging physical applications.</AbstractNarration>
