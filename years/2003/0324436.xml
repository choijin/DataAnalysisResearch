<AbstractNarration>The objective of this GOALI project is to develop a systematic methodology for the analysis and design of a vibration suppression technology damping augmentation using granular materials. Such damping mechanism has unique advantage for harsh environment applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced computational and experimental techniques will be developed to analyze/design granular damping, which include: (a) In order to efficiently and accurately characterize the granular damping mechanisms, a new Molecular Dynamics based simulation which is specifically tailored for granular damping analysis will be developed. (b) In order to further increase the computatuional efficiency and provide an effective analysis/design tool for complicated structures in practical applications, a novel approach will be taken. This approach involves a highly efficient improved Monte Carlo algorithm that can significantly reduce computational cost as compared molecular dynamics simulation.  This new method can prevent the occurrence of unrealistically high granular volume density at certain regions and can directly calculate the impact/friction forces that the granules act onto the enclosure/structure. (c) A systematic theory for contact mechanics model identification, computational complexity reduction, and damper-structure interaction analysis will be established.  Using these algorithms, we will have the ability to analyze granular damping for arbitrary multi DOF systems under various loading conditions. We will carry out a series of experimental investigations including benchmark case studies on laboratory plate structures and real blade damping analysis to be performed at GE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Granular damping can suppress vibration under extreme temperatures. The outcome of this research will benefit engine and propulsion, aircraft, and space industries. The algorithms developed and knowledge gained can be further utilized in various scientific resear4ch and industrial applications involving granularly analysis. The collaborative nature of this research will allow involved students to understand real-world engineering problems, and will bring industrial perspective to the university. This project will have a long-term impact on education through the planned curriculum development at both undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as in community education programs&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
