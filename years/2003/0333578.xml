<AbstractNarration>The goal of the research is to design, fabricate, test and evaluate an innovative&lt;br/&gt;panelized system for residential construction made from bio-based composite materials, which&lt;br/&gt;can be fabricated simply and inexpensively. The panels will be of a sandwich type construction,&lt;br/&gt;consisting of a foam core sandwiched between outer sheets or irskinsle. The panels will be&lt;br/&gt;designed with or without iiwebsld between the skins. The composite materials will consist of&lt;br/&gt;soybean based resins and all-natural reinforcement, such as recycled paper, chicken feathers,&lt;br/&gt;and Nano clays.&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of the proposed research are to:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Design a prototype, multi-function, bio-based composite panel suitable for residential&lt;br/&gt;construction&lt;br/&gt;(2) Develop low-cost processes for manufacturing large sandwich panels made from bio-&lt;br/&gt;based composite materials, and&lt;br/&gt;(3) Test and evaluate the panels for normal, in-plane shear, axial compression and bearing&lt;br/&gt;load capacity.&lt;br/&gt; The research plan is organized into three primary tasks. Task 1, Design of the&lt;br/&gt;prototype multi-function panel, will involve basic research to improve the performance of the&lt;br/&gt;resin and composite system, and design of a generic, multi-function panel. Task 2, Alternative&lt;br/&gt;low-cost fabrication processes for composite panel systems, will explore innovative methods for&lt;br/&gt;fabricating large composite panels. This will include an efficient VARTM process, and also what&lt;br/&gt;we term composite casting. Finally, in Task 3, Testing and analysis of the composite panel,&lt;br/&gt;panels will be tested in bending, in-plane shear, axial compression and bearing, to determine&lt;br/&gt;their stiffness, load capacity, ductility and failure mode. Analytical models of the panels will also&lt;br/&gt;be developed to be used in design and analysis of the system.&lt;br/&gt;The research will benefit society at large by providing an Advanced&lt;br/&gt;Panelized System for residential construction that is made entirely from all-natural, bio-based&lt;br/&gt;composite materials. The system will reduce our dependence on petroleum products and&lt;br/&gt;reduce deforestation. The research brings together expertise in civil engineering, chemical&lt;br/&gt;engineering, materials science and composites manufacturing: the multi-disciplinary nature of&lt;br/&gt;the research will provide a unique opportunity for students and faculty to learn from each other&lt;br/&gt;and explore, together this very interesting and quickly expanding of field. Results of the study&lt;br/&gt;will be made available to the community through archival journals and the World Wide Web.&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will use the resources of the RISE program at the University of Delaware to recruit and&lt;br/&gt;encourage the participation of minority students on the project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
