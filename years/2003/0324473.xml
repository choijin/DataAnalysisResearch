<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research:  Testing and Analyses of  Nonrectangular Walls Under Multi- Directional Loads -- CMS 0324504&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Cathy French, University of Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project represents a collaborative analytical, experimental and educational effort to investigate the &lt;br/&gt;behavior of nonrectangular structural walls subjected to the effects of multidirectional loading. &lt;br/&gt;Nonrectangular structural walls are often used to resist lateral loads and limit deformations in structural &lt;br/&gt;systems located in regions of moderate and high seismicity. Although such wall systems are intended to &lt;br/&gt;resist the lateral forces along the orthogonal axes of the building, past research has been limited to &lt;br/&gt;unidirectional studies of these systems due to limitations in experimental capabilities, as such the &lt;br/&gt;numerical models developed to describe their behavior have been calibrated to this limited data. The &lt;br/&gt;proposed project employs one of the first applications of an NSF George E. Brown, Jr., Network for &lt;br/&gt;Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) large-scale testing facility, the Multi-Axial Subassemblage &lt;br/&gt;Testing (MAST) System at the University of Minnesota, to achieve the multidirectional testing &lt;br/&gt;requirements. This facility is ideal for the investigation as it is capable of six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) &lt;br/&gt;control including the ability to specify moment to shear profiles about each orthogonal axis to simulate &lt;br/&gt;the distribution of lateral forces applied to the wall system. It is anticipated that multidirectional loads will &lt;br/&gt;have a significant impact on the behavior of these nonrectangular wall systems as they are intended to &lt;br/&gt;resist lateral forces and limit deformations along the orthogonal axes of the building. The collaborative &lt;br/&gt;team of researchers from the University of Minnesota, Iowa State University, University of Puerto Rico at &lt;br/&gt;Mayaguez and The Nakaki Bashaw Group, Inc., a consulting firm in Irvine, California, bring combined &lt;br/&gt;strengths and resources in experimentation, analysis, design practice and education, all of which are &lt;br/&gt;essential components of the proposed investigation. All collaborative researchers will remotely participate &lt;br/&gt;in the experimentation including the operation of the test which will reside with Iowa State University. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  This project builds on the combined strengths of the collaborative research team and &lt;br/&gt;newly available experimental capabilities to investigate a critical structural element for seismic regions, &lt;br/&gt;nonrectangular structural walls. The analytical and experimental studies developed in this project are &lt;br/&gt;expected to lead to improved understanding of the behavior, analysis techniques, and design of &lt;br/&gt;nonrectangular wall systems. The project will also recommend appropriate modifications to the design &lt;br/&gt;and detailing of nonrectangular wall elements suggested in the current building codes. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The project has a significant educational component through plans to incorporate the &lt;br/&gt;testing and simulation into the curriculum at the three collaborative universities including the &lt;br/&gt;participation of underrepresented groups. The involvement of the practicing engineer from the beginning &lt;br/&gt;of the project, who along with the Principal Investigator is involved in the development of the American &lt;br/&gt;Concrete Institute Building Code, ensures that the appropriate research findings may be translated directly &lt;br/&gt;into practice with improved detailing recommendations for nonrectangular structural walls. As such, this &lt;br/&gt;project will improve the nation's infrastructure in seismic regions. It is also anticipated that the results of &lt;br/&gt;this project will lead to valuable information for future remote users of the MAST system. This &lt;br/&gt;information will include documentation of any observed deformations of the reaction wall and crosshead, &lt;br/&gt;as well as the ability of the system to function under mixed mode control with large applied forces. The &lt;br/&gt;performance and userability evaluations of the remote participant capabilities within the MAST are &lt;br/&gt;intended to lead to an improved system for remote participation. The Co-PIs have a vested interest within &lt;br/&gt;this project to actively evaluate these capabilities as they are essential to their participation in this project. &lt;br/&gt;It is intended that the research data be made available to the research community through the NSF, &lt;br/&gt;George E. Brown Jr., NEES National Data Repository. Any hardware or instrumentation purchased at the &lt;br/&gt;University of Minnesota through this project will be available to future users of the MAST facility. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
