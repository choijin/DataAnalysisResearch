<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the complexity of problems in logics.&lt;br/&gt;The focus will be on results that classify the complexity of an&lt;br/&gt;infinite number of problems.  The first such result dates from 1978,&lt;br/&gt;when Schaefer proved his famous dichotomy theorem for generalized&lt;br/&gt;satisfiability problems.  He defined an infinite number of propositional&lt;br/&gt;satisfiability problems (nowadays usually called Boolean constraint&lt;br/&gt;satisfaction problems), showed that all these satisfiability problems are&lt;br/&gt;either in P or NP-complete, and gave a simple criterion to determine&lt;br/&gt;which of the two cases holds.  In recent years, quite a few dichotomy&lt;br/&gt;theorems have been shown about problems in logics.  Almost all of&lt;br/&gt;these problems have the following three properties in common: They&lt;br/&gt;are variations of satisfiability, they are problems in propositional logic,&lt;br/&gt;and they use Schaefer's constraint framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project's goal is to  extend the existing research in three&lt;br/&gt;different directions, seeking dichotomy theorems for problems that&lt;br/&gt;are not related to satisfiability, for problems in logics other than&lt;br/&gt;propositional logic, and for frameworks other than Schaefer's&lt;br/&gt;constraint framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through her school's commitment to, as voluntary cost-sharing,&lt;br/&gt;reduce the proposer's teaching load by one course per year,&lt;br/&gt;and through the direct support of her summer months,&lt;br/&gt;this grant will have the broader impact of helping support&lt;br/&gt;research at an undergraduate institution.  This harmonizes&lt;br/&gt;well with RIT's desire to become a more research-friendly&lt;br/&gt;institution.  The travel support will allow the proposer and&lt;br/&gt;her students to attend conferences to develop professionally&lt;br/&gt;via learning of new advances, and presenting their results to&lt;br/&gt;the broader theory community.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
