    <AbstractNarration>In this project, Dr. Diane Gifford-Gonzalez and students will &lt;br/&gt;undertake detailed analysis of fauna from one large and about 18 &lt;br/&gt;smaller archaeological sites on the Monterey Bay, in central coastal &lt;br/&gt;California. The aim of the study is to evaluate whether and how &lt;br/&gt;environmental processes affected people living along the coast over &lt;br/&gt;the last 6000 years. Today, global climate change threatens the &lt;br/&gt;livelihoods of people and the continued survival of animal species, &lt;br/&gt;along the Pacific Rim. Archaeological sites contain records of past &lt;br/&gt;climatic events and human responses to them. They are thus &lt;br/&gt;repositories of crucial evidence on how extreme swings in ocean and &lt;br/&gt;land productivity were in pre-industrial times. We know that, just &lt;br/&gt;as today, global climate change affected life on both land and sea. &lt;br/&gt;Although a major agricultural powerhouse in the United States and a &lt;br/&gt;tourist destination for those seeking abundant marine life, the &lt;br/&gt;Monterey Bay area's deeper history is as yet poorly understood. For &lt;br/&gt;about six years, Dr. Gifford-Gonzalez and colleagues from the &lt;br/&gt;Department of Earth Sciences have been researching the history of &lt;br/&gt;marine temperatures and productivity, as well as shedding light on &lt;br/&gt;the disappearance of northern fur seals from coastal California about &lt;br/&gt;1000 bp. The present project follows a three-year NSF-funded &lt;br/&gt;collaborative project that indicated that northern fur seals - a &lt;br/&gt;presently threatened species -- have radically changed their breeding &lt;br/&gt;and migratory behavior. Radiocarbon dates on their bones show their &lt;br/&gt;breeding colonies were not abandoned simultaneously along the entire &lt;br/&gt;Pacific margin. Research results indicate that NFS disappearance in &lt;br/&gt;central California did not coincide with changes in marine upwelling &lt;br/&gt;patterns that could have affected their food base, strengthening the &lt;br/&gt;odds that ancient people had a hand in their regional extirpation. &lt;br/&gt;However, so far, we have no detailed evidence that people were driven &lt;br/&gt;to wipe out fur seals due to hunger, whether the severe droughts &lt;br/&gt;during the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (800-1350 AD) could have &lt;br/&gt;affected NFS colonies themselves, or whether the droughts drove &lt;br/&gt;people to drive these animals extinct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Gifford-Gonzalez, graduate students in archaeology, and &lt;br/&gt;undergraduates chosen for special skills development will explore &lt;br/&gt;these questions with faunal remains from regional archaeological &lt;br/&gt;sites. One of these sites, the Moss Landing Site (CA-MNT0234) is a &lt;br/&gt;virtual untapped "Rosetta Stone" for regional archaeology, with &lt;br/&gt;components dating from 8500 years ago to Spanish contact. This site &lt;br/&gt;was well excavated and curated during FEMA-funded rebuilding of the &lt;br/&gt;Moss Landing Marine Laboratories after the Loma Prieta Earthquake. &lt;br/&gt;However, time demands of contract archaeology precluded the close &lt;br/&gt;analysis that the site deserves, to tell its full story of climate &lt;br/&gt;change, human resource use, and animal geography. This study will &lt;br/&gt;provide insights into the pre-modern human land use and interactions &lt;br/&gt;with food species over time. Our data on historical human and &lt;br/&gt;animal ecology will be available to wildlife and conservation &lt;br/&gt;biologists making management decisions about such species. It will &lt;br/&gt;provide excellent professional training for graduate students in &lt;br/&gt;archaeology and extraordinary, on-site research opportunities for &lt;br/&gt;undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>
