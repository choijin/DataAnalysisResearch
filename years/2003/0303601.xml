    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL DMS-0303601&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Liviu Nicolaescu, University of Notre Dame&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Monopoles and 3-manifolds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topology of isolated complex two-dimensional singularities has a&lt;br/&gt;built-in rigidity which is not manifested in any other dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;For example, in a large and clearly delimited family of&lt;br/&gt;two dimensional singularities, one can determine fragile analytic&lt;br/&gt;invariants of the singularity (such as the geometric genus, the signature&lt;br/&gt;of the Milnor fibers, the Minor number etc.) by performing robust&lt;br/&gt;topological manipulations. These are conveniently encoded by the&lt;br/&gt;Seiberg-Witten invariants. The investigator intends to investigate the&lt;br/&gt;reasons behind this surprising phenomenon by looking into the finer&lt;br/&gt;structure of Seiberg-Witten monopoles relying on an adiabatic deformation&lt;br/&gt;of the Seiberg-Witten equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the present proposal is to perform a micro-analysis of&lt;br/&gt;singularities, objects popularly known as `catastrophes'. One could&lt;br/&gt;visualise these as surfaces which are nice most everywhere except at&lt;br/&gt;few places where one sees forming `cusps' and `spikes', mathematically&lt;br/&gt;referred to as `singular points'. If an observer sits at a regular point&lt;br/&gt;and looks around, the `horizon' he/she observes is round, spherical. The&lt;br/&gt;`horizon ' of a singular point is an object mathematicians refer&lt;br/&gt;to as `the link of the singularity' and is shaped quite differently&lt;br/&gt;than the `horizon' of a regular point. In fact, the shape of this link&lt;br/&gt;alone contains a wealth of information about how the space in the&lt;br/&gt;vicinity of the singular point twists, bends and folds. This kind of&lt;br/&gt;information is carried in abundance by certain objects the&lt;br/&gt;physicists refer to as `monopoles'. These are similar in many respects to&lt;br/&gt;the electromagnetic waves, but they are more sensitive to the shape of&lt;br/&gt;the Universe they travel in. The investigator will analyze the&lt;br/&gt;structure of these monopoles by `looking at these singularities&lt;br/&gt;through a high resolution microscope', a process mathematically know as&lt;br/&gt;adiabatic deformation of the space. This technique has already produced&lt;br/&gt;encouraging preliminary results.</AbstractNarration>
