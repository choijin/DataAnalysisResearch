<AbstractNarration>The scientific objective of this project is to analyze the performance of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave (LIGO) detector using numerical simulation and actual data available at the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Using the end-to-end (e2e) simulation package developed by the LIGO Laboratory simulation group at the California Institute of Technology, various programs will be built to simulate the input optics (IO), the chain of optics located between the laser source and the interferometer. These programs will take floor motions and the electric field of the laser beam entering the IO part as inputs, and compute the resultant motions of the optics and the electric field of the output beam from the IO. To make the numerical simulation realistic, actual signals recorded at LLO will be used for the mechanical and optical inputs. The output of the simulation will be compared with the corresponding signal recorded at LLO concurrently with the input. On confirming the validity, these programs will be incorporated into SimLIGO, the e2e program currently developed by the LIGO Laboratory simulation group to simulate the whole LIGO detector. The current version of SimLIGO is not equipped with a dynamic model of IO. With the resultant program, numerical experiments will be performed to study lock-loss and other effects of the floor motion on the interferometer performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The involvement of Southeastern Louisiana University undergraduate students is an important element of this project. The educational objectives of this project will be realized in two broad ways: by actively involving undergraduate students as researchers and by using the products of the research as tools in the lecture classes. The goal of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the initiation of their study to understand the properties of the astronomical systems that produce them. This project will contribute to LIGO  in several ways. The developed simulation programs can be used to modify the design of the control systems, to obtain indirect measurements of properties of subsystems that cannot be measured directly, and to inform the development of other aspects of the simulation programs. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
