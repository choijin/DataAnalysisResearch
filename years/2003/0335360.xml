    <AbstractNarration>This one-year design study focuses on the use of information and communications technologies to enhance both pre-service education and in-service professional development programs within the MSPs. The project's five key tasks are to: (1) develop resources to inform the MSPs about approaches to online professional development, online enhancements for site-based professional development, and online tools and techniques to support professional learning communities; (2) provide consultation services for a set of MSP projects that decide to use online technologies in their teaching enhancement programs; (3) offer a capacity-building program that will enable MSPs to develop the capacity to incorporate effective online professional development within their projects; (4) collaborate with the evaluators of the MSPs that use online technologies to inform future practices of those projects, other MSPs, and the field of professional development in general; and, (5) assess the use and potential use of online supports for improving teacher quality across the MSP projects, to inform a possible follow-up proposal to expand technical assistance, evaluation, and research in this area, within the MSP Learning Network.</AbstractNarration>
