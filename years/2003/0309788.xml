<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0309788&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Kathryn Lesh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funding to partially defray travel&lt;br/&gt;expenses of U.S.-based mathematicians attending the conference&lt;br/&gt;"Invariant Theory and its Interactions with Related Fields"&lt;br/&gt;(Ingo2003), to be held in Goettingen, Germany, March 23-29,&lt;br/&gt;2003. Invariant theory, with roots in the 17th century, has&lt;br/&gt;proven to be a robust area of mathematical endeavor.  Over the&lt;br/&gt;course of the last 50 years, it has found new applications in&lt;br/&gt;algebraic topology, representation theory, algebraic geometry, as&lt;br/&gt;well as many traditional areas such as number theory and&lt;br/&gt;commutative algebra.  Professor Lesh is on the scientific&lt;br/&gt;organizing committee for Ingo2003, which is an initiative of&lt;br/&gt;research groups in Aberdeen, Manchester, and Goettingen working&lt;br/&gt;in the areas of algebraic topology, representation theory, and&lt;br/&gt;commutative algebra. These scientists have found that&lt;br/&gt;communication across narrow specialty boundaries can bring great&lt;br/&gt;scientific benefits. A central theme of the conference will be&lt;br/&gt;the many connections of invariant theory to other fields. In the&lt;br/&gt;past, conferences organized around the topic of invariant theory&lt;br/&gt;have tended to be rather specialized, for example, concentrating&lt;br/&gt;on computational aspects, or emphasizing interaction with at most&lt;br/&gt;one other subject area, such as algebraic topology. Ingo2003 is&lt;br/&gt;being organized with a much broader scientific base and will be&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary in a global sense, as well as having a specific&lt;br/&gt;focus on younger researchers. Some of the topics represented in&lt;br/&gt;discussions will be modular representation theory, coinvariants&lt;br/&gt;and the "hit problem," algebraic topology, and Hasse-Schmidt&lt;br/&gt;differentials and differential Galois theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One aspect of invariant theory is studying the question of what&lt;br/&gt;elements of a changing situation must in fact remain fixed. For&lt;br/&gt;example, the points along the axis of a spinning globe remain in&lt;br/&gt;the same position as the globe turns. The point at the center of&lt;br/&gt;the spindle of a tape player stays fixed while other points on&lt;br/&gt;the spindle turn around it. More surprisingly, rotating a circle&lt;br/&gt;around its center and then flipping the circle over any line&lt;br/&gt;through its center must leave a different line in a fixed&lt;br/&gt;position.  The search for such "invariant" or "fixed" elements of&lt;br/&gt;a situation can be very subtle, and it arises in a wide variety&lt;br/&gt;of mathematical problems and physical applications. The goal of&lt;br/&gt;the Ingo2003 conference is to allow mathematicians from differing&lt;br/&gt;mathematical disciplines to learn techniques from each other, and&lt;br/&gt;to disseminate sets of mathematical tools developed in one&lt;br/&gt;discipline to other disciplines that might find them useful.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
