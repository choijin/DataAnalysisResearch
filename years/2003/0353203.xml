<AbstractNarration>DMS-0138440&lt;br/&gt;James R. Arvo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most familiar principle of geometrical optics asserts &lt;br/&gt;that a ray of light impinging on an ideal mirror will emerge &lt;br/&gt;in such a way that the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence.    The trajectory of a photon (or a billiard ball, &lt;br/&gt;using another common metaphor), is thus completely determined &lt;br/&gt;by its initial conditions and the geometry of the mirrors it subsequently encounters.  The geometry of such trajectories &lt;br/&gt;has been of interest in numerous fields, including plane &lt;br/&gt;geometry, computational geometry, and computer graphics, &lt;br/&gt;yet they comprise a vanishingly small subset (a set of &lt;br/&gt;measure zero) within the class of all optical paths that &lt;br/&gt;fall within the purview of geometrical optics.  In particular, &lt;br/&gt;optical paths resulting from non-specular reflections &lt;br/&gt;constitute a vastly larger class. Moreover, they are of far &lt;br/&gt;greater importance to image synthesis as they result from &lt;br/&gt;physically realizable models of reflection.  Nonetheless, &lt;br/&gt;non-specular paths have thus far been largely overlooked as &lt;br/&gt;a source of interesting geometrical problems. The main &lt;br/&gt;objective of this research is therefore to launch an&lt;br/&gt;initial investigation into the basic geometrical properties &lt;br/&gt;of non-specular optical paths, both in the traditional &lt;br/&gt;combinatorial  sense, such as finding a optimal paths &lt;br/&gt;connecting two points, and in the continuous sense, such &lt;br/&gt;s finding extremal paths, or computing the measure of all &lt;br/&gt;k-segment paths connecting two regions.  A secondary &lt;br/&gt;objective is to explore connections with probabilistic &lt;br/&gt;methods, such as standard Monte Carlo visibility techniques &lt;br/&gt;and Metropolis light transport, which will likely be the &lt;br/&gt;first direct beneficiaries of this work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is expected to contribute primarily to the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical foundations of image synthesis by identifying&lt;br/&gt;optical paths as interesting geometrical entities in &lt;br/&gt;themselves, and by exposing some of their fundamental &lt;br/&gt;properties in terms of density, measure, and computational &lt;br/&gt;complexity.  Moreover, it is expected that this new &lt;br/&gt;perspective will ultimately be instrumental in studying &lt;br/&gt;the accuracy and computational complexity of realistic &lt;br/&gt;image synthesis in general, about which very little is &lt;br/&gt;known currently.  While the problems investigated here &lt;br/&gt;will invariably have much in common with previous work on&lt;br/&gt;direct and indirect illumination problems in computational&lt;br/&gt;geometry, the approaches taken will have a distinctly more&lt;br/&gt;continuous flavor, drawing heavily from fields such as &lt;br/&gt;measure theory, differential geometry, and geometric &lt;br/&gt;probability. Finally, it is expected that this work will &lt;br/&gt;serve as a segue into a longer-term investigation of &lt;br/&gt;computational complexity in computer graphics by &lt;br/&gt;establishing basic tools and connections with other disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
