<AbstractNarration>  The main objective of this project is to host QTS3, the third of a biennial international symposium &lt;br/&gt;entitled "SYMPOSIUM ON QUANTUM THEORY AND SYMMETRIES." QTS1 was held in Goslar, &lt;br/&gt;Germany, in 1999 and QTS2 in Krakow, Poland, in 2001. These symposia, which take place in odd &lt;br/&gt;numbered years are similar in format to and complement the well known biennial conferences, held in &lt;br/&gt;even numbered years, entitled "INTERNATIONAL COLLOQUIUM ON GROUP THEORETICAL &lt;br/&gt;METHODS IN PHYSICS(ICGTMP)". The Conference Boards for the two symposia have several &lt;br/&gt;common members.  &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;  An important intellectual merit of such a symposium is that its format brings together physicists and &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians from diverse fields to interact on topics on frontiers of mathematical physics. Previous &lt;br/&gt;such meetings have enabled the participants to identify and explore common mathematical themes that &lt;br/&gt;unify their research efforts in fields ranging from atomic and nuclear physics, gauge theories, string &lt;br/&gt;theories, and foundations of quantum mechanics, to group theory, quantum groups, quantum &lt;br/&gt;computing, and noncommutative geometries.  This is to be contrasted with the equally worthy and &lt;br/&gt;more frequently held symposia that are focused on a single subject such as QCD, neutrinos, &lt;br/&gt;supersymmetry, etc.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;  Among the broader impacts of this project, one is that it fills the vacuum for the conferences of this &lt;br/&gt;type in the United States. To our knowledge, the last of such conferences held in the United States was &lt;br/&gt;in mid 1980's. They are held frequently in Europe, Canada, Mexico, etc. As a result, young US &lt;br/&gt;theorists, such as postdocs and graduate students, who are financially more constrained, have had &lt;br/&gt;difficulty attending these conferences. To partially offset this trend, recently NSF provided travel funds &lt;br/&gt;for young US participants to a similar UNESCO conference, called International Conference on &lt;br/&gt;Theoretical Physics, held in Paris, France, July 22-27, 2002. One of aims of QTS3 is to facilitate the &lt;br/&gt;participation of young theorists from the United States. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To further strengthen the broader impacts of this Symposium and to make it a tradition, we have &lt;br/&gt;invited Professor Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Studies to deliver the Taft Lecture, &lt;br/&gt;sponsored by the Charles P. Taft Foundation. There will also be a public lecture on a topic of broad &lt;br/&gt;interest. We plan to make every effort to bring these lectures to the attention of the high schools and &lt;br/&gt;small colleges in the nearby Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana region and encourage their participation. &lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt; The five-day symposium will be held at University of Cincinnati, September 10-14, 2003. The local, &lt;br/&gt;organizing committee includes, Philip Argyres, Paul Esposito, Timothy Hodges, Alexander Kagan, &lt;br/&gt;Freydoon Mansouri (Chair), Joseph Scanio, Peter Suranyi, Rohana Wijewardhana and Louis Witten.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;   The funds needed to cover the expenses of the invited plenary speakers and the publishing of the &lt;br/&gt;proceedings of the Symposium is estimated at $42000.00. We already have a commitment of $20000.00 &lt;br/&gt;from University of Cincinnati and intend to simultaneously apply for $11000.00 from DOE. The &lt;br/&gt;amount requested from NSF is $11000.00. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
