<AbstractNarration>This action is to support a series of three workshops to initiate, develop, coordinate, and sustain the community effort for scenario simulations for tsunami hazard mitigation.  The simulations involve many elements, including tsunami generation, hydrodynamics, warning transmission, evacuation, human behavior, and social and environmental impacts.  The goal of the scenario simulation exercise is to give researchers in all aspects of tsunami science and hazards planning an experience similar to that obtained in a real field investigation.  In running the simulations and evaluating the results, critical problems will be identified for improvement in each specialized area.  The simulation exercise will provide a valuable common background from which to forge and maintain coherence in the broadly distributed multi-disciplinary tsunami community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea of tsunami scenario simulations was discussed by the tsunami community at an NSF workshop held in 2002 in Seattle.  The participants strongly recommended that an integrated tsunami scenario simulation be developed.  The aim of these three workshops is to implement this recommendation through a broadly distributed multi-disciplinary multi-community effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three workshops are planned, one each year for the next three years.  The first workshop will be designed to initiate the simulation effort, the second workshop will act as a catalyst to expand those activities, and the third will focus on the applications and the use of the developed system.  The first workshop is planned for June 2003 at Oregon State University.  A working group will be formed to organize and coordinate these workshops.  Because of the multi-disciplinary multi-community nature of the scenario simulations, the working group will consist of experts from a wide variety of disciplines.  Prior to each workshop, the working group will act as a steering committee.  After each workshop, the working group will analyze the workshop outcomes and issue a workshop report for further discussion with the community.  Such post- workshop discussions will take place on the Internet utilizing a web-based discussion tool.  The working group will also proactively seek participants in the simulation exercise from broader research communities, which will be kept informed via a public-access web page, and on which the workshop results will be posted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three workshops will provide a coherent integrated community collaborative arena through a common task of tsunami scenario simulations, and will induce synergistic advancement in a wide variety of the simulation models.  The ultimate goal of these workshops is to achieve a widely accessible platform for simulation of virtual tsunamis through a community effort.  When fully implemented, the tsunami scenario simulations will be useful for hazards planning in coastal communities, and for the coordination and development of scientific research.  In addition, the integrated, highly visual character of the simulations will be of great value for K-12 education on tsunami hazards, and for general public education in this area.</AbstractNarration>
