<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Bartz of Kalamazoo College will conduct a research program on the photodissociation of organometallic nitrosyl and N-O containing aromatic compounds.  Recent advances in ion imaging and polarized multiphoton ionization techniques will be used to measure the velocity distribution of nitric oxide (NO) photoproducts.  Analysis of the velocity images will reveal vector correlations, especially correlations between angular momentum and velocity, and between the transition dipole and velocity.  The results of this work will give new insights into the role of Jahn-Teller distortions in excited organometallic nitrosyl compounds, and into the dynamics of NO dissociation in aromatic species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is conducted in an undergraduate institution in which undergraduate students are partners in the research enterprise.  The project is among the forefront topics of current research in physical chemistry and the undergraduate students are uniquely placed in participating in an advanced research effort.  The PI of this project collaborates closely with another expert in the field, and this interaction will further enrich the learning experience of the students.  Through participation in this project students will be admirably prepared to engage in advanced studies in physical chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
