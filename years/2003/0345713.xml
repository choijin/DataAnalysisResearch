    <AbstractNarration>This research program will establish the broad-based utility of a series of group 2 organometallic compounds as reagents to perform a variety of synthetically important organic transformations. Magnesium bisamides will be developed as selective bases for enantioselective deprotonation reactions. Magnesium reagents will be explored which effect asymmetric induction in addition reactions to enolate anions and across carbonyls, in enantioselective reductions, and in asymmetric Wittig-type reactions. The related chemistry of homochiral heavier group 2 analogs (Ca, Ba, Sr) will also be studied. Reactivity studies will be complemented with structural and theoretical analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this new award, the Organic and Macomolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the work of Professor Kenneth W. Henderson, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Notre Dame. Professor Henderson is exploring the synthesis, structure, and reactivity of unusual compounds containing magnesium, calcium, barium, and strontium. These compounds offer promise for effecting highly selective organic chemical transformations while providing a number of practical advantages over more traditional reagents, including low toxicity, low cost, and effective function without the need for specialzied reaction conditions.</AbstractNarration>
