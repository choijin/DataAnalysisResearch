<AbstractNarration>Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Title: TOPICS IN LAGRANGIAN GEOMETRY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate the question of  the existence of &lt;br/&gt;special lagrangian submanifolds in Calabi-Yau manifolds using &lt;br/&gt;variational techniques and using mean curvature flow. The variational &lt;br/&gt;techniques involve the study of  constrained variational  problems &lt;br/&gt;for lagrangian cycles. These problems can be formulated in arbitrary &lt;br/&gt;Kaehler (or symplectic) manifolds and involve minimizing volume among &lt;br/&gt;lagrangians that represent a fixed homology class and proving optimal &lt;br/&gt;regularity of the minimizer. In particular the project hopes to show &lt;br/&gt;that if the ambient manifold is a Calabi-Yau $3$-fold then, for a &lt;br/&gt;suitably formulated problem, the minimizer is special lagrangian. It &lt;br/&gt;has long been known that the mean curvature flow of a lagrangian &lt;br/&gt;submanifold preserves the lagrangian condition if the ambient &lt;br/&gt;manifold is Kaehler-Einstein. The project intends to investigate the &lt;br/&gt;regularity properties of the mean curvature flow of a lagrangian &lt;br/&gt;submanifold of a Kaehler-Einstein manifold.  In  particular, it &lt;br/&gt;intends to investigate the conditions under which the flow does and &lt;br/&gt;does not develop singularities in finite time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variational problems with geometric constraints and mean curvature &lt;br/&gt;flow in codimension greater than one are on the frontier of &lt;br/&gt;mathematical analysis. These problems are natural in geometry but &lt;br/&gt;they are also important in many different applied problems. In &lt;br/&gt;material science a ``model'' problem asks to find a minimizer of &lt;br/&gt;``kinetic energy'' among area preserving maps between disks and to &lt;br/&gt;find the optimal smoothness of the minimizer. At present, the &lt;br/&gt;existence of a minimizer is known but nothing is known about its &lt;br/&gt;singularities. Parts of this project are closely related to this kind &lt;br/&gt;of  ``regularity'' question. In string theory  well known work &lt;br/&gt;conjectures the existence of a certain class of volume minimizing &lt;br/&gt;three dimensional surfaces called special lagrangian submanifolds. &lt;br/&gt;This project is a direct attempt to answer this question in the &lt;br/&gt;affirmative.  Mean curvature flow in various codimensions models many &lt;br/&gt;different physical phenomena. This project  attempts to exploit  the &lt;br/&gt;``lagrangian'' constraint to get an understanding of mean curvature &lt;br/&gt;flow  in higher codimensions. This subject is relatively unexplored. &lt;br/&gt;The techniques investigated in this project hold the promise of &lt;br/&gt;enhancing the interaction between geometry and various fields of &lt;br/&gt;applied mathematics and engineering and in bringing new results and &lt;br/&gt;techniques into these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
