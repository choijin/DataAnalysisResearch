    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will use the electro-optic (EO) effect, in which an electric field changes the index of refraction of a nonlinear material, in a novel manner to create a beam deflector with very favorable properties for laser beam scanning and steering. Large angle deflections have been achieved through new multi-stage designs, and 10-GHz scan rates have recently been demonstrated. These designs can now be executed in a commercial product using recent advances in fabrication to improved nonlinear materials. In addition to making commercial manufacturing possible, these new stoichiometric materials should impart favorable properties to a laser deflector, including improved power handling and increased infrared and UV transparency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is expected to advance the state-of-the-art with an electro-optic device that has so far not been commercially available. Electro-optic deflectors are predicted to compete quite successfully in the laser scanner market, offering superior performance in scan rate, deflection range, deflection efficiency, and power handling in a very small device. The fast scan rates and high power handling of the proposed EO deflector will be useful in for beam scanning in remote sensing applications. The deflector should be used to overcome existing limitations in free space communications and variable optical attenuators.</AbstractNarration>
