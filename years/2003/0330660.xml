<AbstractNarration>The Alabama Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ALSAMP) proposes to engage in a &lt;br/&gt;research project on departmental/institutional factors which promote retention and baccalaureate &lt;br/&gt;degree  attainment in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (STEM) fields and &lt;br/&gt;persistence to graduate study by members of underrepresented minority  populations at urban &lt;br/&gt;institutions.  The Alabama Alliance, established in 1991, is one of the six oldest National Science &lt;br/&gt;Foundation (NSF) Alliances in the nation and has been in the forefront  of efforts to increase the &lt;br/&gt;quantity and the quality  of underrepresented minorities receiving baccalaureate degrees in STEM &lt;br/&gt;fields.  Thus, because of this successful experience in developing and implementing programs that &lt;br/&gt;promote retention and baccalaureate degree attainment of minorities, Alabama is uniquely qualified &lt;br/&gt;to engage in a research project of this nature.  While  the Westat  Study  (March 2000) did an &lt;br/&gt;outstanding job of identifying LSAMP programs that work, the questions of why they work has not &lt;br/&gt;been addressed.  This project will be a follow-up the Westat Study and will provide a complete and &lt;br/&gt;comprehensive picture of LSAMP program activities.  The goal is to generate general information &lt;br/&gt;that builds on the Westat Report and logically extend this work in order to efficiently and logically &lt;br/&gt;guide effective implementation of best practices in diverse institutions.  The objectives include the &lt;br/&gt;following:  1. To determine departmental and institutional factors facilitating undergraduate access &lt;br/&gt;to science, technology,  engineering,  and mathematics (STEM) careers, including baccalaureate &lt;br/&gt;degree  attainment  and  persistence  to  STEM  graduate  study  by  members  of  traditionally &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented racial/ethnic groups ( specifically the keys to LSAMP success cited by the Westat &lt;br/&gt;Study), and  2. To generalize these factors and disseminate resulting findings and measures to the &lt;br/&gt;scientific and education communities. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Alliance will employ the services of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Center &lt;br/&gt;for Educational Accountability to  assist with the research.   The  Center  is  uniquely  positioned  to &lt;br/&gt;conduct the research activities of the proposed project.  The Center has a number of ongoing projects &lt;br/&gt;that relate  directly  to  the goals  of  the  project.   The  project  will  begin  with  an  in  depth review  and &lt;br/&gt;evaluation of 1. All LSAMP activities at each of the twelve ALSAMP institutions, and 2. Student &lt;br/&gt;performance data in SEM courses.  Appropriate surveys and interviews will be conducted, data will &lt;br/&gt;be analyzed, and research findings will be published in an appropriate Educational Research &lt;br/&gt;Journal.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit - The project is an important step in advancing knowledge and understanding of &lt;br/&gt;why the LSAMP programs for underrepresented minorities in science technology, engineering, and &lt;br/&gt;mathematics are successful.  Education faculty will work with mathematics and science faculty in &lt;br/&gt;this educational research project to find answers to these important questions by collecting and &lt;br/&gt;analyzing data resulting from surveys and individual interviews.  The research results will add to &lt;br/&gt;the knowledge base in educational research and evaluation.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts - The project broadens participation of underrepresented groups by the inclusion of a &lt;br/&gt;large  number  of  African  American  students  in  the  target  population  for  the  research  surveys  and &lt;br/&gt;interviews.  In addition, a large number of Historically Black Colleges and Universities are included in &lt;br/&gt;the  Alabama  Alliance  and  the  research  efforts  will  involve  a  diverse  pool  of  students  and  faculty.  &lt;br/&gt;Discovery  and  understanding  are  advanced  by  the  collaboration  between  disciplines  and  institutions. &lt;br/&gt;Evaluation  and  assessment  findings  will  be  documented  and  disseminated  to  other  researchers  in &lt;br/&gt;education and at national meetings.</AbstractNarration>
