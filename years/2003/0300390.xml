<AbstractNarration>A program of multidisciplinary research and education is proposed to address the scientific and engineering challenges associated with manipulating and injecting living cells using microfabricated devices. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated microfluidic chip-scale structure, employing Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology, to efficiently inject functionally useful material within living cells, and to separate these cells from those that experience unsuccessful insertions. Such a high throughput device would find application in several areas of biology and medicine. The incorporation of specific functional DNA segments into the nucleus of a host cell holds tremendous potential for gene therapy applications. Conversely, the device can be used in reverse to extract DNA from cells. Injecting contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or low-dose therapeutics enables the encapsulating cells to be re-introduced in vivo and immuno-guided (via antibody-antigen binding) to specific target locations to function as diagnostic cellular beacons, or for highly localized drug delivery. The device also has application in the agriculture industry for large-scale in vitro fertilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: In addition to the device development, this project will strengthen and broaden the education and training of physics undergraduate and graduate students in technologically advanced topics offered through the facilities of the Georgetown Advanced Electronics Laboratory (GAEL), located in the Physics Department, where the majority of microsystem development will be undertaken. This research will also foster interdisciplinary collaborations with Biology, Genetics, Pharmacology, and the Medical Center. The principal investigator has an established record of involving undergraduates in research, and this project will provide tangible examples of the applied physics involved in micro- and bio-engineering for improving the human condition. Plans are also underway to initiate MEMS short-course for local high school students and teachers, emphasizing state-of-the-art technologies with the opportunity of experiencing hands-on learning through device design and fabrication. Teachers from the Arlington County School District (Virginia) were contacted and expressed great interest in participating in such a program. Select participants will be actively involved in the proposed research during the summer months, while continuation of both student and teacher involvement beyond the summer will be encouraged, in particular for students interested in science fair projects. The experience gained by students and teachers alike will have a positive, long-term impact on education, especially in grades 9-12, in the areas of science and technology - both fundamentally important subjects for the future.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
