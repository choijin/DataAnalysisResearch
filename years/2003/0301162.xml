<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0301162&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Michael Rathjen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general topic of Constructive Set Theory originated in John&lt;br/&gt;Myhill's endeavour to discover a simple formalism that relates to&lt;br/&gt;Bishop's constructive mathematics as classical Zermelo-Fraenkel Set&lt;br/&gt;Theory (with the axiom of choice) relates to classical Cantorian&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. Constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory (CZF) provides a&lt;br/&gt;standard set theoretical framework for the development of constructive&lt;br/&gt;mathematics in the style of Errett Bishop. One of the hallmarks of&lt;br/&gt;constructive set theory is that it possesses a canonical&lt;br/&gt;interpretation in Martin-Lof's intuitionistic type theory which is&lt;br/&gt;considered to be the most acceptable foundational framework of ideas&lt;br/&gt;that make precise the constructive approach to mathematics. The&lt;br/&gt;interpretation employs the Curry-Howard `propositions as types' idea&lt;br/&gt;in that the axioms of constructive set theory get interpreted as&lt;br/&gt;provable propositions.  There are central questions that have guided&lt;br/&gt;researchers in classical Cantorian set theory over the last 50&lt;br/&gt;years. The objective of the research to be undertaken is to pursue&lt;br/&gt;similarly central questions for constructive set theory. Roughly&lt;br/&gt;speaking, these are questions addressing the independence of&lt;br/&gt;set-theoretic principles (via realizability notions and forcing over&lt;br/&gt;Kripke models), the role of large set axioms, and the formalization of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics within such a framework. The method of forcing featured&lt;br/&gt;prominently in Cohen's famous independence results regarding the axiom&lt;br/&gt;of choice and the continuum hypothesis. In a similar vein, forcing&lt;br/&gt;methods germane to the intuitionistic context, as well as&lt;br/&gt;realizability structures, will be employed to tackle problems of&lt;br/&gt;independence on the basis of CZF. The theory of large cardinals has&lt;br/&gt;dominated research in classical set theory for the last 40 years. In&lt;br/&gt;the context of intuitionistic set theories large cardinal axioms have&lt;br/&gt;to be replaced by large set axioms. A central part of the proposed&lt;br/&gt;research will be concerned with studying notions of largeness couched&lt;br/&gt;in terms of elementary embeddings. It is hoped that this project will&lt;br/&gt;also shed light on the role of large cardinals in devising strong&lt;br/&gt;ordinal representation systems in the area of proof theory called&lt;br/&gt;ordinal analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Constructive mathematics distinguishes itself from its traditional&lt;br/&gt;counterpart, classical mathematics, by insisting that proofs of&lt;br/&gt;existential theorems in mathematics respect constructive existence:&lt;br/&gt;that an existential claim must afford means for constructing an&lt;br/&gt;instance of it. The foundations of a systematic approach to&lt;br/&gt;constructive mathematics, known as intuitionism, were laid in&lt;br/&gt;Brouwer's response to the foundational crisis in mathematics at the&lt;br/&gt;beginning of the 20th century.  Nowadays, in computer science,&lt;br/&gt;constructive formal systems based on type theory, or on the&lt;br/&gt;Curry-Howard isomorphism have become increasingly widespread for&lt;br/&gt;program development and language design. The concepts of program and&lt;br/&gt;constructive proof are connected in a deep way. Via this connection&lt;br/&gt;proofs are used to support the development of reliable software&lt;br/&gt;systems.  The axioms of so-called Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory provide&lt;br/&gt;an accepted framework for formalizing classical mathematics whereas&lt;br/&gt;Constructive Set Theory (briefly CST) is a universal framework for&lt;br/&gt;developing mathematics from a constructive viewpoint.  This project is&lt;br/&gt;motivated by the desire to answer central questions regarding CST,&lt;br/&gt;questions that have shaped the research activity in classical&lt;br/&gt;Cantorian set theory for more than half a century. The work is&lt;br/&gt;expected to substantially enhance our understanding of models of&lt;br/&gt;constructive set theory and thereby enlarge the realm of&lt;br/&gt;constructivism.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
