    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: CTS-0339546&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL TYPE: INVESTIGATOR INITIATED&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS: HIROSHI HIGUCHI, SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THIRD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ADVANCED FLUID INFORMATION 2003 (AFI-2003) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Syracuse University will co-host the Third International Symposium on Advanced Fluid Information with Tohoku University, Japan in New York City on November 21-22, 2003. The symposium will focus on fluid informatics as applicable to biomedical and environmental quality issues. It will be attended by a group of world experts in the field as well as students in an intimate setting to enhance in-depth discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the banner of Advanced Fluid Information, new paradigms of fluid mechanics research and applications will be explored. Emphasis will be on integration of information technology, vast real-time and post data processing capability and increasingly sophisticated numerical simulations that incorporate fundamental theories. In particular, the emerging integration of mainstream fluid mechanics and biomedical research and applications is expected to drive the fundamental research as well as directly impact human health care. The transport phenomena in indoor and outdoor environments have impact on human health, but the engineering and medical research fields are just beginning to integrate their research efforts and knowledge. The intellectual merit of this mini-symposium lies in bringing international expertise in biofluids and environmental transport phenomena, and promoting new synergy in both basic and applied fluid mechanics research. The members of the advisory committee have advocated the concept of advanced fluid information and they will also bring in broader perspectives to this year's focal area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate students from US and Japan are encouraged to attend and present their research at a special poster session. Participants are expected to disseminate their experiences among their students and colleagues. Proceedings of the symposium will be published and will be made widely available.</AbstractNarration>
