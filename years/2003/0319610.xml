<AbstractNarration>This project provides travel support for U.S. participation in the XXIIIrd International Conference on Photonic, Electronic, and Atomic Collisions, which is to be held in Stockholm, during July 23-29, 2003. Support is limited to those U.S. scientists who are students or hold junior research positions in an academic, governmental, or industrial institution. Awards will be based on the anticipated contribution by the individual to the success of conference.  Due to the strong presence of non-US, particularly European scientists in this field, this award fulfills a critical need for students and young researchers in this area to meet and begin networking with their international counterparts</AbstractNarration>
