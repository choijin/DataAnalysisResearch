<AbstractNarration>DMS-0305113&lt;br/&gt;Marcus Banagl&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator proposes to further our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the topology of singular spaces. Numerous invariants relevant vis-a-vis&lt;br/&gt;the classification theory of stratified spaces are associated to self-dual&lt;br/&gt;complexes of sheaves, as such objects induce a generalized Poincare-duality&lt;br/&gt;on the level of cohomology. On spaces with only even-codimensional strata,&lt;br/&gt;orthogonal decompositions of self-dual sheaves have been obtained by&lt;br/&gt;Beilinson-Bernstein-Deligne and Cappell-Shaneson. The investigator proposes &lt;br/&gt;to pursue this question on spaces that include strata of odd codimension as &lt;br/&gt;well. Initial evidence suggests that in many situations the odd-codimensional &lt;br/&gt;strata do not contribute terms in the decomposition.  This new phenomenon &lt;br/&gt;leads to interesting consequences for associated characteristic classes and &lt;br/&gt;for stratified maps. In earlier work, the investigator has constructed L-classes &lt;br/&gt;of non-Witt spaces. He would like to explore the behavior and applications of&lt;br/&gt;these classes. In collaboration with S. Cappell, the investigator has&lt;br/&gt;obtained an Atiyah-type characteristic class formula for the twisted &lt;br/&gt;L-class of a singular space, assuming a ``transversality'' condition on the &lt;br/&gt;local system near the singularities.  One is interested in extending the &lt;br/&gt;results beyond this assumption. This problem is already interesting on &lt;br/&gt;manifolds together with a codimension 2 submanifold and a local system &lt;br/&gt;defined on the complement. Lastly, the proposer in conjunction with R. Kulkarni,&lt;br/&gt;has constructed self-dual strongly perverse sheaves on the reductive&lt;br/&gt;Borel-Serre compactification of Hilbert modular surfaces. These are &lt;br/&gt;non-Witt spaces. The investigator would like to analyze the resulting invariants &lt;br/&gt;(particularly with a view towards their number-theoretic content), as well &lt;br/&gt;as generalize the results to higher dimensional modular varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology is the study of geometrical objects focusing on the neighborhood&lt;br/&gt;relations between points rather than on measurement of distances. In the&lt;br/&gt;last century, considerable effort has been directed towards studying&lt;br/&gt;"manifolds" -- spaces that locally look uniform, at each point and in&lt;br/&gt;each direction. This effort has been immensely successful; a central&lt;br/&gt;insight was that crucial information about a manifold is carried by one&lt;br/&gt;number: its "signature," measuring intersections of geometric sub-objects&lt;br/&gt;within the manifold. In the last two decades, topologists have studied&lt;br/&gt;"singular" spaces with increasing interest, due to their numerous&lt;br/&gt;occurrences and applications within pure mathematics (algebraic geometry,&lt;br/&gt;number theory) and outside pure mathematics (mathematical physics). In&lt;br/&gt;contrast to a manifold, a singular space may locally look different from&lt;br/&gt;point to point. The proposed research tries to define, understand and&lt;br/&gt;compute a signature and other characteristic numbers for singular spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
