<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The Ohio Science and Engineering Alliance &lt;br/&gt;Summary &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Ohio Science and Engineering Alliance is a coalition of fifteen universities working together &lt;br/&gt;with federal, state, and community agencies1.  It will significantly enhance the STEM infrastructure &lt;br/&gt;within Ohio and will serve as a catalyst for change, innovation, and resource enhancement &lt;br/&gt;throughout the state.   &lt;br/&gt;The primary goal and broad impact of the Alliance is to double the number of underrepresented &lt;br/&gt;minority students who earn bachelor.s degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics &lt;br/&gt;(STEM) fields and to significantly increase the number who pursue graduate study in these fields.  &lt;br/&gt;This goal will be accomplished through the integration of new and existing campus-based and &lt;br/&gt;statewide programs; the monitoring of student progress through their undergraduate degrees and &lt;br/&gt;beyond; and the promotion of the Alliance to students, their parents, faculty, and the general public.  &lt;br/&gt;The Ohio Alliance will focus on a comprehensive series of effective recruitment and retention &lt;br/&gt;initiatives that address key transition points from undergraduate recruitment through preparation for &lt;br/&gt;graduate school.  These transitions include: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A.  Transition to College . Effective Coordination and Quality Programming; &lt;br/&gt;B.  First-Year and Beyond Student Programming; &lt;br/&gt;C.  Research Experiences for Rising Juniors and Seniors; and &lt;br/&gt;D.  Professional Development for Students, Faculty, and Staff. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;NSF funds will be used to support Alliance-wide initiatives (e.g., cooperative recruitment, research &lt;br/&gt;internships, professional development, Alliance Forum) as well as individual campus-based &lt;br/&gt;programs (e.g., mentoring, bridge programs, tutoring, supplemental instruction, drop-in centers, &lt;br/&gt;workshops).  Research faculty will continue to be involved in program planning and will play an &lt;br/&gt;active role in the selection of student participants, matching students with their research projects, &lt;br/&gt;mentoring, and assessing the quality of individual student performance.  STEM students who receive &lt;br/&gt;competitive funding will be referred to as Glenn-Stokes Scholars.   &lt;br/&gt;Ohio State University will serve as the lead institution on behalf of the Alliance, and President &lt;br/&gt;Karen Holbrook, a research scientist herself, will serve as the principal investigator and chair of the &lt;br/&gt;Governing Board.  Together with the Board, Steering Committee, and research faculty, she will &lt;br/&gt;provide intellectual leadership to the Alliance.  The co-PI, Susan Huntington, Dean of the Graduate &lt;br/&gt;School, will provide its organizational home.  The project director, Jean Girves, has served as the &lt;br/&gt;associate director of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC) for fifteen years, where she &lt;br/&gt;coordinated and raised funds for numerous collaborative projects among the 12 member institutions, &lt;br/&gt;including the Summer Research Opportunities Program (SROP) for minority students, the Women in &lt;br/&gt;Science and Engineering (WISE) Initiative, and the Graduate Minority Fellows program.  In 2000, &lt;br/&gt;she accepted the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering &lt;br/&gt;Mentoring on behalf of the SROP.</AbstractNarration>
