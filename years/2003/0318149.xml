    <AbstractNarration>0318149&lt;br/&gt;Voelker&lt;br/&gt;Under this agreement the U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD) will provide technical support services for a feasibility design study of a new generation icebreaking research vessel capable of operation in the ice-covered waters and open oceans of Antarctica. The effort will take into consideration the design and operational experience gained by existing U.S. and foreign vessels engaged in polar research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An initial set of science and operational requirements currently exist, and they need to be translated into vessel design criteria. Because of the many features desired in the vessel, a number of special studies will have to be performed to properly understand the full implications of certain requirements on the vessel design and cost. Current science and operational requirements include, among others, the need to conduct acoustic profiling and bottom mapping during icebreaking, the towing of nets and instruments from the stern during icebreaking and the ability to conduct AUV/ROV operations and geotechnical drilling from a moon pool. In addition to these requirements, the vessel should be acoustically quiet, have reduced air emissions from diesel engines and incinerator operations, have double hull protection, as well as enhanced icebreaking capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The feasibility design shall incorporate applicable U.S. and international regulations, including classification society rules that govern the design and construction of vessels for Antarctic operations. A preliminary cost estimate will also be developed. Deliverables include copies of reports or special studies that are to be conducted, vessel plans and characteristics and a design history notebook. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will be a multi-year effort. Program recommends funding in the amount of $150,000 for FY03.</AbstractNarration>
