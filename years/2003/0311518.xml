<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)  Materials-related investigations and products are prominent in recent technological advances, yet formal instruction in materials-related fields is typically absent from the undergraduate curriculum. With the acquisition of thermal analysis instrumentation (differential scanning calorimeter and thermogravimetric analysis (DSC/TGA) to support instruction of materials chemistry methods, we are in the process of formalizing instruction in materials chemistry by infusing materials-related content into existing undergraduate courses at several levels of our curriculum.  The classes impacted by this new instrumentation include General Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis, Bioanalytical and Forensic Chemistry, and a new course, entitled "Laboratory Methods in Materials Chemistry". Experiments from educational literature that make use of DSC/TGA techniques are being adapted and implemented in each of the above laboratory courses. For example, our general chemistry students use DSC to examine the crystallization behavior of the amino acid glycine. Other experiments, such as the effect of different plasticizers on the properties of polystyrene films and connecting the DSC measurements of glass transition temperature to the performance of some commercial polymers are being adapted in other laboratory courses. The "Laboratory Methods in Materials Chemistry" is a workshop style, laboratory intensive course that blends theory and application of preparative and characterization strategies used in materials science. The students utilize our existing equipment (IR, NMR, spin coater, tube furnaces, high vacuum lines, GPC) with the newly acquired DSC-TGA to provide an overview of methods used to synthesize and characterize useful solid-state materials. The new instruments are also used by our faculty in doing collaborative research with colleagues and undergraduate students. We anticipate that the DSC/TGA laboratories will add significantly to the technical preparation of our students, and better prepare them to teach, pursue graduate study, or seek industrial employment in materials-related fields.</AbstractNarration>
