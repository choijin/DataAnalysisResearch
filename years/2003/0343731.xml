<AbstractNarration>The primary objective of this research is to develop a proof-of-concept for the application of electrical sensor technology in geotechnical engineering. The focus of this work will be a comprehensive literature review and pilot laboratory experimentation. Simple electrical sensors will be used to obtain the internal soil properties of a soil specimen. These properties will be evaluated graphically using a three-dimensional tomographic image developed from spatial electrical resistivity measurements. Upon establishing the proof-of-concept for this technology using very simple sensors, more sophisticated electrical sensors will be investigated with regards to suitability for geotechnical applications. This research will be used to develop a fundamental understanding and investigate possible unique relationships that exist between electrical properties of soils and engineering behavior. The research will establish a base-line reference of applications and limitations of electrical sensors, from which additional laboratory and in situ applications can later be extrapolated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that electrical sensors will provide an efficient means of acquiring a broad spectrum of quality data as pertaining to the geotechnical properties and the expected engineering behavior of a soil mass, whether the mass is an individual laboratory specimen or the larger in situ media. Electrical sensors are routinely used in geotechnical engineering and geophysics for site characterization and some macro-scale characterization of soil samples (i.e. bulk porosity, degree of saturation, and density). However, only a few researchers have used electrical resitivity for micro-scale characterization of soil to investigated heterogeneity effects (McCarter and Desmazes, 1997; Abu-Hassanein et al., 1996). In addition, most of this research pertains to evaluating hydraulic flow behavior. This research will further investigate heterogeneity effects by using tomography and will expand the electrical soil sensor knowledge base to include strength and deformation behavior of soils. The particular emphasis of this research is to perform an experimental study on the factors that affect the electrical properties of soils and their measurements and relate those factors to behavioral responses.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
