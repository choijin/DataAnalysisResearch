<AbstractNarration>The focus of this research is in the development of practical applications for novel DNA-cleaving agents, the development of new polymeric materials, and for their organic synthesis.  This research provides a theoretical basis for the efficient control of known and design of new cycloaromatization reactions (Bergman cyclizations) proceeding through thermal, photochemical and radical-anionic pathways.  The mechanisms of these reactions will be studied experimentally to obtain a better understanding of factors controlling their efficiency, and the findings will be applied to synthesis of substituted triquinanes and new types of well-defined highly-conjugated carbon "ribbons".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Igor Alabugin of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Florida State University, Tallahassee.  Professor Alabugin will focus his research on the development of new ways to cleave DNA.  This research will contribute to the fundamental understanding of the principles governing the closure of carbon rings using reactive intermediates.  Chemistry students at the graduate, undergraduate and post-doctoral level will be trained in Professor Alabugin's laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
