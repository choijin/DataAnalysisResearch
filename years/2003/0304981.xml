<AbstractNarration>This project will study many-body effects in strongly interacting electron systems using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).  A major focus of the program will be the high-Tc superconductors.  However, other novel materials such as MgB2 and the C60 family of compounds will also be investigated.  Together, these materials represent a formidable challenge to develop new theoretical concepts, and thus an opportunity for spectroscopic experiments to play an important role in helping the development of theory.  With much improved energy and momentum resolution, ARPES is ideally suited for this investigation due to its unique capability to measure key microscopic parameters that often reveal deep insights.  The project will also have broader scientific and technological impact by training students and by developing high precision scientific tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Materials in which the electrons interact strongly with each other exhibit a number of novel and interesting phenomena, including superconductivity at higher temperatures and a very large change in the electrical conductivity when exposed to a magnetic field. It is possible that some of these materials will prove to be of use to technology.  This individual investigator project will explore the universality and the diversity of phenomena seen in materials with strongly interacting electrons. Understanding these materials, and the phenomena they exhibit, has been a formidable challenge. Using an advanced spectroscopic technique called angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy, this project seeks to increase our understanding of the materials.  This tool makes it is possible to gain insight into microscopic processes occurring in these interesting materials. The technique has proven useful in increasing our understanding of high temperature superconductors. The project will also have broader impact by training students and by developing high precision scientific tools.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
