<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project will address problems health care professionals face when attempting to rapidly answer clinical questions with current evidence. Most rapid clinical references are neither updated frequently nor derived from the most valid research evidence, while systems for identifying new research leave clinicians struggling with multiple search result lists and no knowledge synthesis. The proposed product uses an innovative design for rapid browsing and updates knowledge syntheses daily from research surveillance. The technical objectives are to determine (1) how clinicians seek information, (2) if the product provides answers to clinical questions more efficiently than current sources, and (3) if the product provides the most valid answers. Results of interviews and direct observations will be used to improve organization of information for optimal browsing by clinicians. Primary care physicians attempting to answer clinical questions during practice will be randomized to use the proposed product or their usual sources, report whether answers were found, and their speed will be recorded. Physicians trained in research methodology will compare validity of answers from this and other sources&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The societal benefits will be improved health and health care utilization, as decision-makers gain ready access to coherent medical knowledge. The product will be especially useful in information-deprived areas (e.g. rural practices);  will advance understanding of how clinicians seek information in practice; and how to facilitate the process. The lessons learned can be applied to any field of knowledge requiring both the functions of quickly finding comprehensive information (synthesis of new and old data) and continuously evaluating the results of knowledge discovery. Failure to integrate these activities contributes to a societal disconnect between what we know and what we do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
