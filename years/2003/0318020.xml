<AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposed work is to establish a regionally-organized, self-sustaining leadership training program for junior women faculty in engineering disciplines.   By simultaneously training women engineering faculty in leadership and constructing a regional peer-mentoring network, the investigators hope to increase job performance and satisfaction for academic women in engineering, thus increasing both retention and advancement.  The proposed activity is based on a pilot program conducted in the Northeast and will fund a three-year series of &lt;br/&gt;regional meetings in the mid-Atlantic that will provide leadership training, facilitate networking, and will be used as a model for other regions of the country. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of this proposed program are to: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Train junior women engineering faculty in leadership, communication and conflict management through an experiential learning program;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Educate women about the academy through an "insider's perspective" from a senior woman academic engineer;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  Enable and foster peer-mentoring and regional networking among junior women faculty in engineering; and &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.  Promote the expansion of the program throughout the United States. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
