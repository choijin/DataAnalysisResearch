<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr. Scott Lanyon and Dr. Keith Barker at the University of Minnesota, Dr. Kevin Burns at San Diego State University, Dr. John Klicka at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, and Dr. Irby Lovette at Cornell University to examine DNA sequences from over 800 bird species.  These species (including blackbirds, tanagers, warblers, and sparrows) are among the best studied birds in the world and yet evolutionary relationships within this group remain controversial or in some cases completely unknown.  The investigators will examine DNA sequence data from nearly all of the 824 species in this diverse group which represents nearly one-tenth of modern bird species.  The resulting piece of the tree-of-life will provide information that will be essential to future studies of the morphologies, behaviors, and distributions of western hemisphere songbirds.  This increase in our knowledge of the origins of bird diversity will also be of importance to general studies of the biodiversity of the western hemisphere.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Species in this group of birds are ecologically and economically important, and understanding the group's history will stimulate and inform future research and management.  This group includes everything from important crop pests to critically endangered species.  Furthermore, these birds represent a huge percentage of the diversity enjoyed by everyone from backyard feeder enthusiasts to serious birders.  Birding is one of the fastest growing leisure-time activities in the United States with 70.4 million participants and in excess of $14 billion dollars in related expenditures annually.  This project, focused as it is on many of the most common and easily observed bird species in the US, represents an ideal opportunity to engage the public in a discussion about the Tree of Life.  The participating institutions will generate such discussions through their existing education programs that communicate the importance and relevance of current research to the community at large. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
