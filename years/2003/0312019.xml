<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;Despite the widespread use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in industry, &lt;br/&gt;there is still a lack of fully validated predictive CFD models of many relevant transport phenomena in Chemical Reaction Engineering (CRE),  especially in the field of multiphase flows and complex reacting flows.  The CFD in CRE conferences provide a unique forum for cross-fertilization between CFD model developers and industrial practitioners in order to advance the state of the art and prioritize research needs.    CFD in  CRE  conferences  are  the  only  scientific  meeting  that  focuses  on  CFD  research  in chemical engineering, in general, and chemical reaction engineering, in particular.  Thus, it provides a unique and valuable forum for U.S. academic, governmental and industrial &lt;br/&gt;researchers  to  discuss  limitations  of  current  CFD  models  and  to  explore  new  research avenues and application areas with colleagues from around the globe.  Promoting the exchange of ideas among leading researcher groups in this field will not only favorably impact the future growth of CFD in the U.S. chemical and pharmaceutical industries, but should ultimately result in more efficient and cleaner technologies and an improved way of life for the society as a whole. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;NSF.s travel support for CFD in CRE III to be held in Davos, Switzerland, May 25-&lt;br/&gt;30, 2003, will make it  possible for up to twenty  young researchers from the USA to attend the meeting by  covering travel  costs.   NSF funding  will allow these  young researchers to profit by listening to state-of-the-art review talks and research papers and from the opportunity to interact with their fellow researchers in the area.  The public at large  will  significantly  benefit  by  the  advancement  of  CFD  tools  for  the  chemical reaction engineering  field as a whole  and the use of the new ideas  generated  for the development of more efficient and environmentally friendlier technologies for the &lt;br/&gt;production of fuels, materials and chemicals.    &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
