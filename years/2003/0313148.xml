<AbstractNarration>This proposal aims to provide this deep understanding of server behavior during overload, in the&lt;br/&gt;case of both static and dynamic content. The approach is interdisciplinary: There is a theoretical&lt;br/&gt;component which aims to prove new theorems on M/G/1 queues with time-dependent load; an implementation&lt;br/&gt;component which performs a rigorous systematic study of web server and database server&lt;br/&gt;performance under overload as a function of various networking parameters; and a workload and client&lt;br/&gt;characterization component which aims to understand statistical properties of the request stream during&lt;br/&gt;transient overload and incorporate these into the design of a web workload generator for overload.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal also introduces a very simple idea for improving the performance of web servers&lt;br/&gt;under overload: a kernel-based implementation of SRPT connection scheduling. The idea is simple&lt;br/&gt;and intuitive. Connection scheduling does not require purchasing more hardware, or any other costly&lt;br/&gt;system upgrades. It appears to allow the server to survive much longer periods of overload, and to allow&lt;br/&gt;clients to experience better performance during these periods of overload. Furthermore, it appears&lt;br/&gt;to enable the server to recuperate from overload much faster. The proposal will provide a detailed&lt;br/&gt;evaluation of the benefits of SRPT connection scheduling and will aim to introduce similar scheduling&lt;br/&gt;policies for databases. The above concludes the intellectual merit portion of the proposal.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity include online availability of all source&lt;br/&gt;code generated during the project including modifications to the Apache code and to Linux, as well&lt;br/&gt;as online availability of all trace logs collected during this project, and a web workload generator for&lt;br/&gt;overload. The project initiates collaborations across various academic disciplines including: mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;computer systems, and operations management, as well as between universities and industry.&lt;br/&gt;The project will also provide a research opportunity for a minority undergraduate student.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal involves 1 faculty member (1 summer month only), 1.5 graduate students, and 1&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate, over the course of 3 years.</AbstractNarration>
