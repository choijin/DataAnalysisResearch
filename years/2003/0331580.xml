<AbstractNarration>Increasing use of computers and networks in business, government,&lt;br/&gt;recreation, and almost all aspects  of daily life has led to a&lt;br/&gt;proliferation of sensitive data (i.e., data that, if used improperly,&lt;br/&gt;can  harm data subjects or other relevant parties), and concern about&lt;br/&gt;the ownership, control, privacy, and accuracy of these data has become&lt;br/&gt;a top priority.  Despite significant technical accomplishments &lt;br/&gt;in relevant research fields (e.g., cryptology and security, database&lt;br/&gt;systems, and data mining),  there is no comprehensive, end-to-end&lt;br/&gt;technological infrastructure for handling sensitive data over &lt;br/&gt;the entire course of their lifetime, nor is there even widespread social&lt;br/&gt;agreement about the rights  and responsibilities of major stakeholders&lt;br/&gt;in our data-intensive, networked world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary, multi-modal&lt;br/&gt;project that looks comprehensively at sensitive data in a networked&lt;br/&gt;world.  There are two main academic centers of activity (Yale and&lt;br/&gt;Stanford), three smaller-scale academic participants (Stevens&lt;br/&gt;Institute of Technology, NYU, and the University of New Mexico), and&lt;br/&gt;substantial participation by non-academic partners, including&lt;br/&gt;technology companies, (IBM, HP, and Microsoft), representatives of&lt;br/&gt;user communities (Citigroup, NIH, Yale Center for Medical Informatics,&lt;br/&gt;the Census Bureau, and the Secret Service), and DC-based policy&lt;br/&gt;organizations (The Center for Democracy and Technology and The&lt;br/&gt;Electronic Privacy Information Center).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major technical theme of the project is privacy-preserving data&lt;br/&gt;mining, and, more generally, techniques for meeting the potentially&lt;br/&gt;conflicting goals of respecting individual rights and allowing law&lt;br/&gt;enforcement and other legitimate organizations to collect and mine&lt;br/&gt;massive data sets.  Other technical agenda items include (1)&lt;br/&gt;accessibility and reliability of distributed data (2) operating on&lt;br/&gt;encrypted databases, (3) remote control of data, (4) repelling hostile&lt;br/&gt;data, and (5) auditability of data-management systems.  Because these&lt;br/&gt;technical goals are affected by lack of agreement about the meanings&lt;br/&gt;of basic terms, most notably "privacy," a major goal of the project is&lt;br/&gt;the development of a conceptual framework for the study of rights,&lt;br/&gt;responsibilities, and public policies focused on sensitive-data&lt;br/&gt;handling.  This part of the project incorporates the notion of&lt;br/&gt;"contextual integrity," which considers both the context and the&lt;br/&gt;content of data sets in assessing sensitivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Projected outcomes of the project include a next generation of&lt;br/&gt;technology for handling sensitive information that is qualitatively&lt;br/&gt;better than the current generation's and an effective conceptual&lt;br/&gt;framework for policy making and philosophical inquiry into the rights&lt;br/&gt;and responsibilities of data subjects, data owners, and data users.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
