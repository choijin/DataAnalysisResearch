<AbstractNarration>PI: Adita Chattopadhyay, Arizona State University &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An  investigation  on  embedded  sensor  architecture  is  proposed  for  improved  signal  processing, &lt;br/&gt;which  is  directly  related  to  damage  detection.    A  high-fidelity  structural  analysis  procedure  will  be &lt;br/&gt;developed to  integrate the embedded  sensing  architecture  with a composite  host  structure.   The  results &lt;br/&gt;from the analysis will be verified experimentally using a Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer (SLDV). A &lt;br/&gt;comprehensive  investigation  into  characterization  and  detection  of  multi-scale  seeded  damage  is &lt;br/&gt;proposed.  To address feasibility, signal processing and instrumentation will be studied.  It is expected &lt;br/&gt;that the proposed sensing architecture will reduce the required number of channels for data acquisition &lt;br/&gt;considerably,  and  in  addition,  will  increase  the  spatial  advantage  to  cover  a  large  structural  area  for monitoring. &lt;br/&gt;Statement of Objectives  &lt;br/&gt;1. Development of efficient sensing architecture, capable of detecting damage.  &lt;br/&gt;2. Analysis of the integrated sensor architecture and composite host structure. &lt;br/&gt;3. Parametric studies to establish detection and quantification of seeded damage in composite structures &lt;br/&gt;using the proposed sensing architecture.   &lt;br/&gt;4. Address  practical  implications  regarding  the  acquisition,  collection  and  processing  of  the  data  to &lt;br/&gt;establish  the  feasibility  of  using  the  proposed  sensing  architecture  in  the  development  of  a  robust &lt;br/&gt;damage detection technique.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Structural integrity is a key issue in both civil and mechanical systems and the proposed research will have significant impact on the advancement of knowledge in structural health monitoring. Currently used damage detection methods are visual or localized methods using acoustic, ultrasonic, magnetic field, X-ray  or  thermal  principles.    All these  techniques  require  a  priori  knowledge  on  the  vicinity  of  the damage.    The  development  of  a  robust,  quantitative,  global  damage  detection  method,  applicable  to complex structures will have a major impact on engineering systems.  The impact of the research will be multifaceted ranging from development of new theory, course development and training new students to collaborative efforts with other related research establishments. Developing a mutually beneficial working relationship with national research organizations will be an integral part of the proposed research effort.  Interaction  with  other  research  organizations  will  enhance  and  expand  the  infrastructure  for  related research  efforts  as  well  as  initiate  mutually  beneficial  collaborative  efforts  and  partnerships.  Dissemination  of  the  developed  technology  will  be made  via  peer  reviewed  journal  articles,  seminars, workshops, short courses and technical conferences.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the educational front, training graduate students in the research area will be an integral part of &lt;br/&gt;the research effort.  It is anticipated that a graduate level course, entitled .Structural Health Monitoring,. &lt;br/&gt;will result from this research effort.  In addition, interaction with similar facilities at other educational and &lt;br/&gt;research institutions will help develop a network of interrelated teaching and research facilities that will &lt;br/&gt;help  in  expanding  the  educational  impact  of  the  proposed  research.    Minority  and/or women  graduate students  will  be  encouraged  to  participate  in  the  research  effort.  ASU  has  an  Office  of  Minority Engineering Programs (OMEP) and Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) program.  They work with the faculty to increase the participation of under represented minority and women in undergraduate and  graduate  levels  in  the  College  of  Engineering  at  ASU.  The  PI  is  an  active  member  of  the  WISE program and has two minority students who will participate in the proposed research effort. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
