<AbstractNarration>To optimize its scientific and educational legacy, EarthScope needs to incubate regional integrated efforts among scientists that will go well beyond the scope of typical individual PI or small group research projects. This proposal is a joint effort of the University of New Mexico and New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology to establish a national organizational structure to focus and integrate EarthScope science and education activities in the Rocky Mountain region (northern Rockies to the southwestern U.S.). Under this umbrella, which includes Sandia and Los Alamos National laboratories, and the New Mexico Bureau of Geology, the project includes a series of multidisciplinary regional workshops that will serve as part of a coordinated effort to foster scientific exchange, help plan future EarthScope activities, integrate existing and yet-to-be collected geologic and geophysical datasets, and help serve as a web-based information center for the Rocky Mountain region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: A decadal scientific vision for EarthScope in the Rocky Mountain region is to utilize this unique tectonic and geodynamic setting to answer fundamental questions about lithospheric evolution and geodynamic processes. The Rocky Mountains form a complex transition between the tectonically inactive core of North America and the active plate margin domain along the west coast. This region thus offers unique potential for EarthScope to examine lithosphere-asthenosphere interactions at a variety of scales to answer questions about tectonic processes within continental interiors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: EarthScope should, where possible, emphasize ties to societal issues such as geologic hazards (volcanism and seismicity), water quantity and quality, and education.  A decadal educational vision for Rocky Mountain EarthScope includes improving connections and communications between diverse groups, while discussing joint strategies for raising the general appreciation of Earth science in society. Because of the region's relatively small population and unique association of interested institutions, Rocky Mountain EarthScope offers an historic opportunity and rallying point to improve Earth science education. The large Native American and Hispanic populations of the region provide nationally significant opportunities for diversifying such efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
