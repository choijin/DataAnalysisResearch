<AbstractNarration>Many of the main obstacles to the development of efficient and &lt;br/&gt;reliable computational tools for simulating waves are rooted in the &lt;br/&gt;multiple spatial scales which are universally present. The focus of &lt;br/&gt;this project is the detailed study of select questions which are &lt;br/&gt;relevant for overcoming these obstacles. A unifying feature of the &lt;br/&gt;questions addressed is that all involve the efficient approximate &lt;br/&gt;evaluation of integral operators in space and time. Although the &lt;br/&gt;work, if successful, has the potential to impact numerous &lt;br/&gt;scientific and engineering disciplines, the efforts will be directed &lt;br/&gt;towards problems in aeroacoustics and electromagnetics. &lt;br/&gt;Precisely, the following will be developed: (i) Accurate, efficient &lt;br/&gt;and reliable computational domain truncation methods, allowing &lt;br/&gt;the direct simulations to take place only in regions where the &lt;br/&gt;medium is complex or where nonlinear effects are important; (ii) &lt;br/&gt;Efficient time-stepping methods allowing the simple treatment of &lt;br/&gt;concentrated regions of high resolution or geometric detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wave propagation problems are of fundamental importance in &lt;br/&gt;many areas of applied science and technology. They encompass a &lt;br/&gt;wide range of physics (electromagnetics, fluid and solid &lt;br/&gt;mechanics), but share essential mathematical properties. The &lt;br/&gt;defining characteristic of a wave is its ability to travel long &lt;br/&gt;distances relative to its basic dimension, the wavelength, carrying &lt;br/&gt;detailed information about the medium through which it has &lt;br/&gt;traveled. For this reason, waves are the primary method by which &lt;br/&gt;we probe nature and communicate. A consequence of this &lt;br/&gt;fundamental characteristic is that wave propagation problems &lt;br/&gt;typically involve disparate spatial scales - from the geometrical &lt;br/&gt;details of scatterers through a range of wavelengths to the &lt;br/&gt;propagation distances. These multiple scales, in turn, lead to &lt;br/&gt;difficulties in computational analysis. In particular, their uniform &lt;br/&gt;resolution would lead to a prohibitive number of degrees of &lt;br/&gt;freedom. Thus methods must be developed which can concentrate &lt;br/&gt;computational resources only where they are needed, providing &lt;br/&gt;the primary motivation for the problems we consider. In addition &lt;br/&gt;to this analysis, the plan is to collaborate with researchers who are &lt;br/&gt;building software for simulating jet noise, electromagnetic &lt;br/&gt;scattering in complex structures, as well as general-purpose wave &lt;br/&gt;propagation problems. Thus any positive developments from the &lt;br/&gt;research can come into use as rapidly as possible.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
