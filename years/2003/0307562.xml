<AbstractNarration>AST 0307562&lt;br/&gt;McAlister&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Georgia  State  University's  Center  for  High  Angular  Resolution  Astronomy  (CHARA)  operates  an interferometric array on Mt.  Wilson,  California.  The  CHARA  Array  consists  of  six  1-m  aperture telescopes  arranged  in  a  Y  configuration  providing  15  baselines  from  33  to  331 meters  in  length. The Array operates in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions with limiting resolutions of 1.6 and 0.4 milli-arcseconds at the K and V bands. In terms of the number and aperture size of its telescopes and the length of its baselines, the CHARA Array is among the most powerful facilities of its type in the world.  Built  with  funds  provided  by  Georgia State University (GSU),  the  NSF,  the  W.M. Keck  Foundation,  and  the  David  and  Lucile Packard Foundation, the CHARA Array is poised to undertake extensive observational programs having a broad impact on stellar astrophysics. This award will support these programs primarily by maintaining  an  adequate  scientific, technical and operational staff at the Array  site. The core CHARA team has also developed a number of collaborations to more fully exploit the Array's scientific capability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of its very high angular resolution and its good sensitivity and UV-plane coverage, the CHARA Array  will  have  unprecedented  access  to  stellar  diameter measures  for  main  sequence  stars  of  all temperatures  as  well  as  for  evolved  stars.  Accurate  low-visibility measurements  will  characterize  atmospheric  limb  darkening  in  stars. The  sizes and  shapes  of  young  stellar  objects  will  be  mapped.  Pulsations  of  Cepheid  variables  and  their  limb darkening  will  be  measured  to  directly  calibrate  this  important  rung  in  the  cosmic  distance  ladder. Continuum and molecular band observations will characterize scale heights in the atmospheres of evolved stars.  Disks  surrounding  Be  stars  and massive  outflows  from luminous  blue  variable stars, Wolf-Rayet stars and interacting binaries will be detected and characterized. In  the  area  of  binary  star  studies,  the  Array  will  eliminate  the  classical  problem  of  non-overlapping selection  effects  among  the  various  techniques  for  discovering  binary  stars  and measuring  their  orbital motions. It will resolve the majority of the spectroscopic binaries accessible to it, providing measurements of  stellar  mass,  luminosity  and  radius  for  stars  broadly  distributed  throughout  the  HR  diagram.  The emphasis  will  be  on  accuracy  of  mass  determination,  not  just  more  masses  of  mediocre  quality,  to observationally  detect  the  influence  of  age  and  metallicity  on  stellar  evolution.  Low-mass,  unseen companions  will  be  sought  in  wider  binary  systems.  Known  extrasolar  planetary  systems  will  be inspected to ensure that face-on binaries are not contaminating the sample even at a low level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact beyond the scientific and intellectual goals exists in three areas. First, CHARA is actively training the next generation of scientific and technical experts in the field of interferometry. A significant fraction of GSU astronomy graduate students are pursuing their PhD research with the Array. CHARA staff  have  participated  in  all  of  the  NASA/JPL  Michelson  Summer  Schools.  Second,  CHARA  will enhance science awareness in the large and diverse undergraduate community at GSU by incorporating Array imagery (real-time in some cases) in undergraduate astronomy courses, which enroll approximately 700 students per semester. Several undergraduates will be recruited to participate in remote observations and data processing. Third, a CHARA Exhibit Hall on Mt. Wilson dramatically displays the historic 20-ft Michelson Stellar Interferometer, used at the 100-inch telescope in the 1920s. Thousands of visitors to the observatory  grounds  each  year  will  have  a  unique  opportunity  to  interactively  learn  how interferometry can probe stars to reveal their surfaces and fundamental properties. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
