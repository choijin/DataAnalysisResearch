<AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry makes this Career award to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) to investigate protein adsorption on surfaces with the aim of shedding light on molecular level interfacial interactions that influence biocompatibility.  With this award, Professor Mark Schoenfisch will use antibody-modified atomic force microscope (AFM) tips to obtain images and probe physical properties of proteins adsorbed to surfaces.  The principles of traditional immunoassay will be applied to build molecular recognition into measurements with the AFM and allow for the investigation of discrete, specific antibody-antigen interactions.  Strategies for AFM-tip modification and control of non-specific interactions between the antibody-modified tip and the substrate will be explored.  The PI will also implement programs at both the graduate and middle school levels designed to advance the participation of women in science.  One program will engage women graduate students with women in the chemical workforce through seminars and roundtable discussions.  Another program will provide middle school age girls with hands-on exposure to modern chemical analysis methods in a two week summer camp coordinated with the UNC-CH Morehead Planetarium and Science Center.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AFM methods will be developed for studying complex interactions between proteins and synthetic materials.  The effects of substrate surface characteristics on the coverage, orientation and related physical properties of proteins will be investigated.  Focus will be on blood plasma proteins, such as fibrinogen and fibronectin, which influence the blood biocompatibility of implant materials.  The education plan will provide learning and mentoring opportunities for young women with the aim of increasing the participation of women in science. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
