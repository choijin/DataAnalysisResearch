<AbstractNarration>Over the next 10-15 years, the core and access networks will evolve in different directions.&lt;br/&gt;The core will evolve toward an all-optical system, while the access network will continue to&lt;br/&gt;experience a proliferation of technologies and network types, tuned to the economics of specific&lt;br/&gt;deployments and the requirements of users and applications. In particular, wireless technologies&lt;br/&gt;will play an increasing role not only for mobile applications but as a cost-competitive substitute&lt;br/&gt;for fixed wire access networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers propose to develop a test bed focused on the access network, containing both wired and&lt;br/&gt;wireless components. It will act as a shared-facility test bed for research on connectivity, quality&lt;br/&gt;of service, security, reliability/availability, and network and traffic management for&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous access networks. The test bed will also serve as a proof-of-concept test bed for&lt;br/&gt;wireless networks that exploit advanced flexible software defined radio devices, steerable&lt;br/&gt;antennas and upper millimeter wave point-to-point links to improve network performance under&lt;br/&gt;resource constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be two main academic centers of activity (Stevens Institute of Technology, and&lt;br/&gt;University of Colorado), supported by activities at one other institution, (University of Utah).&lt;br/&gt;There will also be substantial participation from non-academic partners, including technology&lt;br/&gt;companies (Vanu, Inc., Lightpointe, and BBN). Use of the test bed by others will be solicited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The access network is vitally important for service to the end user, yet&lt;br/&gt;frequently neglected in studies that focus on the high-speed core or the wireless link in isolation.&lt;br/&gt;A test bed in this area will enable collaborative research on ways to exploit and manage multiple&lt;br/&gt;networks simultaneously for overall optimization, maintain connectivity as mobile devices roam,&lt;br/&gt;exploit one network to support another, and improve security. In the past networking research&lt;br/&gt;has focused on layers 3 and higher, while wireless research has primarily looked at layers 1 and&lt;br/&gt;2. A critical aspect of this test bed is that it will support cross-layer integrated experiments all the&lt;br/&gt;way from layer 1 to layer 5, leading to future networks that can exploit physical layer flexibility,&lt;br/&gt;application awareness, and advanced routing for overall better performance and service.&lt;br/&gt;The hardware and software deployed in the test bed will be designed for easy modification&lt;br/&gt;and repeatable experiments at all layers. The team building the facility brings deep experience in&lt;br/&gt;these modifiable systems: Dirk Grunwald (Colorado) with the Click modular router, John Chapin&lt;br/&gt;(Vanu, Inc.) with Vanu Software Radio, Jay Lepreau (Utah) with the Emulab software platform,&lt;br/&gt;Craig Partridge (BBN) with protocol software, and Igor Alexandrov (Stevens) with millimeter&lt;br/&gt;wave bands radio. The effort is led by Paul Kolodzy (Stevens), formerly of the FCC and&lt;br/&gt;DARPA, who brings a wide overview of access network issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed test bed will provide a major research facility, bringing&lt;br/&gt;together a community from all over the country to focus on the interrelated problems facing&lt;br/&gt;access networks. In addition, novel educational approaches will be pursued where students will&lt;br/&gt;have access to multiple advisors with key complementary expertise, and key industrial partners.&lt;br/&gt;A series of high profile workshops will facilitate research agenda setting and community&lt;br/&gt;formation. Tangible products will include widely disseminated research papers and a series of&lt;br/&gt;white papers aimed at non-specialists. Finally a series of demonstrations of the test bed will be&lt;br/&gt;conducted for the research and lay communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Progress on the research problems of access networks will reduce the cost and increase the&lt;br/&gt;service level provided to all users of the Internet, especially those in currently underserved&lt;br/&gt;communities. Additionally, devices and techniques that better handle heterogeneous wireless&lt;br/&gt;networks will improve the interoperability problems facing public safety and homeland security.</AbstractNarration>
