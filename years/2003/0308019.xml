<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is the development of a mathematical&lt;br/&gt;theory, models, and computational  tools which underpin the design and&lt;br/&gt;of macromolecular materials  and nano-composites.  These materials are&lt;br/&gt;comprised of anisotropic molecules (nematic polymers), which undergo a&lt;br/&gt;spontaneous disorder-order transition  above a critical concentration.&lt;br/&gt;Materials made from nematic  polymers achieve their properties through&lt;br/&gt;the  collective  molecular  alignment structure.   Specific  molecular&lt;br/&gt;elements  yield  diverse  property  enhancements, from  strength  (the&lt;br/&gt;Dupont  product Kevlar  and spider  silk), to  electrical conductivity&lt;br/&gt;(carbon  tubes  and   conducting  polymers),  to  barrier  penetration&lt;br/&gt;properties  (discotic   clay  platelets).   The   major  technological&lt;br/&gt;challenge is to extend results with fibers to other geometries such as&lt;br/&gt;films and  molds.  However, in  typical laminar processing  flows, the&lt;br/&gt;molecular response is highly sensitive  to flow type and strength, and&lt;br/&gt;to molecular properties such  as shape and concentration.  In addition&lt;br/&gt;to  complex  dynamics,  during  flow  processing there  is  a  spatial&lt;br/&gt;conflict  between  interior  flow  response  and  molecular  anchoring&lt;br/&gt;conditions  at solid  boundaries.  The  result  is that  instead of  a&lt;br/&gt;uniform molecular  orientational distribution, as  in fiber processing&lt;br/&gt;flows, film and mold flows always generate morphology on length scales&lt;br/&gt;between the  molecules and  the processing devices.   These ubiquitous&lt;br/&gt;structures are not understood, either theoretically or experimentally,&lt;br/&gt;yet they  dictate the effective  properties of the  end-use materials.&lt;br/&gt;The research supported by this award will help to understand the dynamics&lt;br/&gt;and  structures  that  occur  in  typical  laminar  flows  of  nematic&lt;br/&gt;polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern  high-performance materials  and nano-composites  are primarily&lt;br/&gt;designed with  simple elements,  from rod-like to  platelet molecules.&lt;br/&gt;Remarkable  property  enhancements  have  been achieved  thus  far  in&lt;br/&gt;laboratory-scale experiments, with  increased strength and durability,&lt;br/&gt;the ability to shield heat  or gases, and to tune electromagnetic wave&lt;br/&gt;transmission.    The  technological  challenge   is  to   scale  these&lt;br/&gt;experimental results  to industrially viable  processes and materials.&lt;br/&gt;The challenge to  mathematics and computational science is  to build a&lt;br/&gt;solid foundation of theory,  modeling, and simulation tools from which&lt;br/&gt;to  design and control  the processes  and final  material properties.&lt;br/&gt;The theory of flowing molecules  in confined spaces is still unable to&lt;br/&gt;predict  and  control  the  molecular structure  created  during  flow&lt;br/&gt;processing.   Yet micron-scale  molecular structures  always  occur in&lt;br/&gt;processed films  and molds of nano-composites.   Furthermore, the bulk&lt;br/&gt;material performance  properties as well  as their failure  and damage&lt;br/&gt;modes  are   dominated  by  the  molecular   structures  generated  in&lt;br/&gt;processing.   The award will support a  research program  combining&lt;br/&gt;theory, modeling, simulations, and comparisons with laboratory data in&lt;br/&gt;the dynamics and structure properties of nematic polymer materials and&lt;br/&gt;nano-composites in processing flows.   These results will be the basis &lt;br/&gt;for the next phase of the materials pipeline,  where  bulk  material&lt;br/&gt;properties are deduced from the molecule properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
