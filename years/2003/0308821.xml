<AbstractNarration>A richer understanding of how populations adapt to new environments is necessary to answer several important questions in the genetics of adaptation. Unfortunately, the data necessary to further this work are difficult to come by in natural populations; for example, there are only a handful of cases in which we can identify an adaptive substitution. In microbial experimental evolution systems, however, data on adaptive evolution are much more easily obtained. In the bacteriophage system we are using, for example, the identity, chronology, and fitness effects of adaptive substitutions are all known. In my dissertation work, I am adapting several lines of an RNA bacteriophage to a new environment and studying the nucleotide substitutions. Here, I propose to extend this work with two new projects. The first is directly related to my dissertation research: I would like to directly measure the fitness effects of each adaptive substitution by measuring the growth rate of each phage genotype. The second project asks a novel question about adaptation: is evolution constrained by sequential epistasis, i.e., is the identity of late substitutions dependent on the identity of early substitutions? Together, these projects will shed much needed light on the genetics of adaptation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
