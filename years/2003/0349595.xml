<AbstractNarration>With this renewal proposal the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support for the work of Professor Frantisek Turecek of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA.  The research will continue the PI's research on the chemistry of transient intermediates in reactions of biological interest.  These transients will be investigated in the gas phase in the absence of solvent and other complicating factors allowing intrinsic properties to be determined.  The experimental observations will be complemented by sophisticated calculation of the structure and energy of these species.  Since the intermediates to be studied will be derived from DNA nucleobases, amino acids, and peptides, this research will contribute fundamental data in the area of protein and nucleic acid chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies are expected to have broad impact upon the biological sciences.  In particular, they will contribute to our knowledge of factors responsible for DNA and protein damage. In addition these experiments will provide a significant base of knowledge in the areas of proteomics and genomics in which many of the recent advances have been achieved through mass spectrometry. The research will also provide valuable training for students in the area of biological mass spectrometry.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
