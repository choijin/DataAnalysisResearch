<AbstractNarration>The intellectual content of the project is concerned with the study of computational&lt;br/&gt;complexity, which aims at an understanding of which tasks can be effciently performed&lt;br/&gt;by computers, and which ultimately cannot. There is currently an enormous&lt;br/&gt;gap between the very restricted computations in which the ultimate limitations can&lt;br/&gt;be analysed using existing mathematics, and the rich variety of tasks, such as the&lt;br/&gt;search problems that are NP-complete, where the limitations are currently only conjectured.&lt;br/&gt;This project is concerned with a new approach to these problems based on implicitly&lt;br/&gt;exponential models. This approach is inspired by quantum mechanics, which&lt;br/&gt;describes the transitions in physical systems in terms of well understood mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;namely linear algebra, but in order to do so works in high dimensions. In this&lt;br/&gt;project the model of computation is also exponential dimensional, but it needs to be&lt;br/&gt;simulatable by classical computers effciently in polynomial time. In analogy with&lt;br/&gt;quantum mechanics, complex computations are to be expressed in terms of well understood&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, namely linear and polynomial algebra, but at the cost of high dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;The questions being investigated center on whether those high dimensional&lt;br/&gt;representations that can express NP-complete and #NP-complete search problems&lt;br/&gt;are within the class that can be simulated in polynomial time. The approach &lt;br/&gt;can be viewed as a new branch of algebraic complexity theory that is inspired &lt;br/&gt;by quantum mechanics and quantum computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With regard to broader impacts the societal impact of the research will depend on&lt;br/&gt;its outcome. Since the main thrust is a new view towards efficient algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for search problems in general, a positive outcome may redefine what is computed&lt;br/&gt;in practice across a wide range of applications. Whatever the outcome the research &lt;br/&gt;will be carried out in an educational environment that includes an expanding group &lt;br/&gt;of diverse students, faculty, postdoctoral fellows and visitors with interests in &lt;br/&gt;the broad  research area of computational complexity.</AbstractNarration>
