<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Crim will continue and extend his research on the role played by vibrational excitation on chemical reactions in both gases and liquids.  The goal is to study the same reactions of vibrationally excited molecules in gases, where they react in single, isolated encounters, and in liquids, where molecules interact almost continuously.  Previous work on mode- and bond-selected reactions in the gas phase will be expanded to include new vibrationally excited molecules and to new reaction partners.  The experiments in liquids start with a thermal reaction to which is added a vibrational excitation to accelerate the reaction and alter its course.  For gases the select vibrational excitation will be accomplished by laser pulses of nanosecond duration, while femtosecond pulse excitation will be employed for the liquid studies.  This research will contribute to a unified fundamental understanding of chemical reaction processes in gases and liquids.  Graduate and undergraduate students, as well as post-doctoral research associates will participate in these studies. They will acquire skills and experience that will prepare them for advanced studies or entry into the scientific/technological workforce. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
