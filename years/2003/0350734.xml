<AbstractNarration>The proposed two-day workshop ( November 19-20,2003) will provide a much-needed opportunity for researchers, practitioners, and educators to convene and discuss some of the many pressing issues regarding emergency management as it is evolving currently in the U.S., particularly in a national environment that is pre-occupied with homeland security.  The focus will be on documenting research and policy needs in the fields of emergency management and homeland security. The basic intellectual intent of this workshop is to initiate a process of knowledge coordination and transfer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team plans will ask some of the workshop invitees to help shape the agenda by providing their input about the issues and topics of highest need and interest. After the workshop, the final report will provide a list of recommendations from the 80 participants regarding future research and policy needs, with their priorities indicated.  The results will be shared with attendees, NSF, and with the interested public via a project website. The workshop and follow-on activities are intended to assist in the formulation of programs and projects that result from the unprecedented government initiative that established the Dept. of Homeland Security. In particular, education and training programs designed for current and future emergency managers and first responders will benefit from a process that helps to re-define emergency management within the context of  homeland security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
