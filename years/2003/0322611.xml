<AbstractNarration>This project has three main goals. The first is to investigate the neural basis of deception. This goal will be achieved by using established neuroimaging technologies (fMRI), thus going beyond the traditional approaches based on the measurement of peripheral variables such as skin conductance, which have not proven highly valid. The second goal is to validate a novel taxonomy of lies based on prior research conducted in the PI's laboratory. The idea of subdividing lies into different categories and studying these categories separately is a major conceptual advance in the study of deception because the traditional approach has treated deception as a unitary phenomenon: either one is lying or one is telling the truth. In the proposed taxonomy, lies are divided according to two dimensions: 1) whether they are spontaneous or memorized in advance, and 2) whether they are isolated (i.e., unrelated to each other) or fit into a coherent story. The different types of lies are conceptualized in terms of the cognitive processes they are likely to engage. One of the methodological strengths of the proposed approach is that the brain regions supporting the hypothesized cognitive processes engaged during the different types of lies will be independently identified for each participant (by using a set of "neurocognitive localizer" tasks). These additional data will provide important constraints for the interpretation of the results in the deception conditions. The third goal is to use the resulting knowledge to develop a new technology for detecting the neural processes associated with different types of lies. This technology is known as diffuse optical imaging (DOI), and relies on measuring the absorption of near-infrared light in the cerebral cortex to track cortical processes. Although in its infancy, DOI has the advantage of being relatively inexpensive and portable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A better understanding of the brain processes that underlie deception can potentially benefit society in several ways. First, it is likely to advance our knowledge (and consequently collective awareness) of the limitations and potential of lie detection methods. Second, the understanding gained in this work about the neural processes underlying deception may lead to more effective lie detection methods; this could be very important in forensic settings. Third, the development of an affordable technology (DOI) that can be used to study the neural correlates of deception could eventually revolutionize the field of lie detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will strengthen the collaboration between researchers whose main area of expertise is cognitive neuroscience and researchers whose expertise is in physics and engineering. Such collaborations weaken traditional barriers between disciplines and allow scientists in training (students, assistants, postdocs) to acquire a greater range of skills and experience. The PI's lab has a long history of training scientists who have gone on to make independent contributions, and that practice will be continued. This project offers educational opportunities for students and junior researchers. On the technical side, they will not only acquire training in fMRI, but also have the unique opportunity to learn the novel DOI technology and participate in its development at various levels; on the content side, these studies cut across several lines of research that are often not integrated. In doing so, they provide students and junior scientists with an unusual breadth as well as an opportunity to learn to integrate what appear to be parallel research domains. In order to disseminate the results of the research as broadly as possible, significant findings will be reported primarily as journal articles, and preliminary data will be discussed with other investigators at scientific meetings.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
