<AbstractNarration>This project provides expanded support of an engineering and technology scholarship program called Galveston Aggie Technology and Engineering Scholarships (GATES) to support a minimum of 15 additional scholarships in Marine Engineering Technology, Marine Engineering Technology with License Option and Maritime Systems Engineering over four years.  The program includes specialized advising, diagnostic testing, learning communities, tutoring, supplemental instruction, and early intervention programs. GATES scholars have additional support with a no-cost summer math workshop and specialized tutoring.  Faculty mentors are assigned to each student to track their academic progress. Career Planning and Placement takes an active role in student mentoring with industry affiliations.  Industry provides internship opportunities and professional mentors for GATES scholars.  Students participating in this program are required to create a career search plan, attend career-oriented workshops and job fairs. Student Life involves GATES scholars in activities to help integrate them into campus life, and to develop leadership skills. This program targets nine especially diverse high schools in the Houston-Galveston as well as five community college districts and supports and tracks these students through graduation.  Selection of participants is based on an application process reviewed by a selection committee based on standard criteria including financial need and merit.  Upon graduation, GATES scholars will be quickly absorbed into the local economy. Many alumni are employed in the Houston/Galveston region with international companies who have locations around the world.</AbstractNarration>
