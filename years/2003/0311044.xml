<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)  We intend to accelerate the spread of computational molecular modeling through sophomore/junior level organic chemistry courses by lowering the barriers which have so far kept it from fulfilling its educational potential.   We are adapting and implementing the newly-developed and very affordable computational chemistry program, WebMO, which is a WWW-based, professional-level graphical &lt;br/&gt;interface to three state-of-the-art computational chemistry programs: Mopac, Gamess, &lt;br/&gt;and Gaussian.  We are collaborating with the developers of WebMO to combine the power of its computations with the power of existing Chime based visualization tools, and to deliver the combination of these two in a low-cost and globally accessible manner. We are writing web-based tutorials and a series of linked exercises appropriate to the needs of students in the organic chemistry course.  Students are providing assistance in making, testing and implementing the exercises.  The aims of this curriculum are to improve students' skills in using software, their understanding of MO theory and appreciation of the scope and limitations of computational chemistry.  We are implementing the tutorials and exercises through the establishment of a consortium of local community colleges including Monterey Peninsula College, Gavilan College, Hartnell College, San Jose City College, DeAnza College, and Diablo Valley College. Students at those institutions have free access to WebMO on a Cabrillo College server.  We are providing support to participating college faculty through professional development workshops, a web site and personal communication.   The results of this project have the potential to be disseminated nationwide through adoption of the new curriculum materials and replication of the consortium model.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
