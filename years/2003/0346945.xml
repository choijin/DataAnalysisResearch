<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Capacity and Ubiquity in Multitier Wireless Networks&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;To meet diverse communication requirements of users, wireless systems must&lt;br/&gt;simultaneously support wide-area access (ubiquity) and local area performance&lt;br/&gt;(capacity). Multitiered wireless networks represent a natural design option that fulfills&lt;br/&gt;these joint goals. These networks contain radios designed with coverage areas that vary&lt;br/&gt;in their order of magnitude. Higher-tier radios, which have larger coverage, extend the&lt;br/&gt;network's reach while lower-tier radios target location-specific performance. This&lt;br/&gt;research studies the capacity and ubiquity supported by various multitier networks. As a&lt;br/&gt;demonstration of the benefits offered by such systems, topographic and demographic data&lt;br/&gt;for Susquehanna County, a rural and technology-poor county in Northern Pennsylvania,&lt;br/&gt;will be used to implement derived results and to devise a multitier network for that&lt;br/&gt;region. This design will take into consideration the extremely hilly propagation&lt;br/&gt;characteristics of the area; location of population centers; and communication&lt;br/&gt;requirements at these locations in order to better serve the needs of the county (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;provide satisfactory cellular coverage, deliver broadband access, promote distance&lt;br/&gt;learning initiatives, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;Overall, this research aims to develop a general and unified framework for spectrally&lt;br/&gt;efficient multitier systems. Specifically, it examines the case of full spectral reuse across&lt;br/&gt;tiers for various centralized and decentralized multitier configurations. In centralized&lt;br/&gt;networks, users communicate exclusively to access points, which control admission and&lt;br/&gt;route information. In non-centralized systems, such responsibilities are distributed over&lt;br/&gt;access points and users, and ad-hoc connections are possible. The key challenge lies in&lt;br/&gt;overcoming cross-tier interference produced by high spectral reuse. This research&lt;br/&gt;develops analytical methods that 1) model this interference; and 2) use signal processing,&lt;br/&gt;radio resource allocation, and access control techniques to jointly suppress it and deliver&lt;br/&gt;desired ubiquity and capacity.&lt;br/&gt;COVER SHEET FOR PROPOSAL TO THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION&lt;br/&gt;FOR NSF USE ONLY&lt;br/&gt;NSF PROPOSAL NUMBER&lt;br/&gt;DATE RECEIVED NUMBER OF COPIES DIVISION ASSIGNED FUND CODE DUNS# (Data Universal Numbering System) FILE LOCATION&lt;br/&gt;FOR CONSIDERATION BY NSF ORGANIZATION UNIT(S) (Indicate the most specific unit known, i.e. program, division, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;PROGRAM ANNOUNCEMENT/SOLICITATION NO./CLOSING DATE/if not in response to a program announcement/solicitation enter NSF 03-041&lt;br/&gt;EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (EIN) OR&lt;br/&gt;TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (TIN)&lt;br/&gt;SHOW PREVIOUS AWARD NO.
