<AbstractNarration>Geophysical turbulence may be modeled by a hierarchy of &lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations including both &lt;br/&gt;waves and turbulence.  In each model, the vortical, non-wave motions&lt;br/&gt;correspond to observed, long-lived structures such as the jet stream&lt;br/&gt;of the tropopause, the persistent horizontal layers of the stratosphere, &lt;br/&gt;and hurricanes.  Despite decoupling of vortical modes and waves at &lt;br/&gt;first order in weak turbulence expansions, numerical simulations &lt;br/&gt;have demonstrated the generation of the anisotropic, vortical modes &lt;br/&gt;from fast waves.  These simulations suggest major modifications to&lt;br/&gt;current models designed to capture only the large-scale dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;For example, they show the dominance of vertically&lt;br/&gt;sheared, horizontal flow modes in strongly stratified flows, &lt;br/&gt;presently not included in large-scale models.  Our work&lt;br/&gt;focuses on (1) stability analyses to understand the &lt;br/&gt;mechanisms responsible for the formation of slow, large-scale coherent &lt;br/&gt;motions from fast, small-scale turbulence, and (2) the&lt;br/&gt;development of improved ordinary and partial differential equations&lt;br/&gt;describing the slowly varying, large-scale dynamics, reflecting&lt;br/&gt;the physics observed in the numerical simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most current models of turbulence are based on isotropic theory, and&lt;br/&gt;assume that small-scale turbulence acts as a sink of energy for&lt;br/&gt;larger-scale flows.  Such turbulence models are used in&lt;br/&gt;numerical prediction, for example, of weather and climate change.&lt;br/&gt;However, turbulence in nature and in engineering flows is anisotropic&lt;br/&gt;more often than not, for example, due to the presence of&lt;br/&gt;boundaries.  In this study, we focus on anisotropy induced by&lt;br/&gt;strong rotation and stratification, both of which give&lt;br/&gt;rise to wave motions.  In anisotropic wave-turbulence systems, &lt;br/&gt;turbulence may act as a source of energy for larger-scale flows.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, coherent structures often&lt;br/&gt;emerge spontaneously from small-scale, random fluctuations.&lt;br/&gt;One example in nature is the generation of hurricanes&lt;br/&gt;from smaller-scale motions in the atmosphere.    This study&lt;br/&gt;aims to understand large-scale, coherent-structure generation&lt;br/&gt;from small-scale turbulence in the atmosphere and oceans.  In&lt;br/&gt;addition, new models will be developed to capture these physical&lt;br/&gt;phenomena, absent in current models.  The results should impact &lt;br/&gt;our ability to predict long-term variability in ocean-circulation,&lt;br/&gt;weather and climate.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
