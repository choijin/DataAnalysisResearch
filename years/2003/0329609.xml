<AbstractNarration>Stankovic - abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wireless sensor networks, composed of 1000s of inexpensive devices, have the&lt;br/&gt;potential to significantly improve emergency response systems for&lt;br/&gt;earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters, as well as for&lt;br/&gt;chemical and biological attacks. While each node must be very cheap and,&lt;br/&gt;therefore, is likely to have limited capacity, the aggregate behavior of &lt;br/&gt;the nodes should collectively determine the situation,&lt;br/&gt;detect possible survivors, send necessary information to the nearest &lt;br/&gt;rescue teams, identify a safe exit path for them, and monitor any &lt;br/&gt;subsequent events of interests in the area. Since such emergencies &lt;br/&gt;may last a long time and are highly dynamic;  the system needs to adapt to &lt;br/&gt;the changing  environment, be robust, utilize &lt;br/&gt;the limited resources efficiently, and meet any timing requirements. &lt;br/&gt;This research is developing robust and real-time middleware services&lt;br/&gt;for events and message delivery. In wireless sensor&lt;br/&gt;networks events are not binary, but are based on sensor fusion&lt;br/&gt;from many noisy sensors in complicated environments. Sensor data&lt;br/&gt;may be missing, wrong, or out of date. Consequently, the event service&lt;br/&gt;must support real-time, data fusion, confidence calculations, and&lt;br/&gt;conserve power. Events can occur in a very local region, be global or occur&lt;br/&gt;simultaneously in many parts of the system. The event service must be&lt;br/&gt;highly decentralized in order to work on the limited capacity&lt;br/&gt;devices. The service must also minimize false alarms. &lt;br/&gt;All of these features makes an event service for wireless&lt;br/&gt;sensor networks very challenging. The ultimate vision of&lt;br/&gt;this work is to provide a facility that allows the application to specify &lt;br/&gt;the desirable data and events, and deliver them in a timely manner. &lt;br/&gt;If this research is successful, emergency response can occur&lt;br/&gt;more quickly, and be more accurate; lives can be saved and damage&lt;br/&gt;reduced.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
