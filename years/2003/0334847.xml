    <AbstractNarration>The Fourth USUCGER National Workshop scheduled for October 2003 provides a unique opportunity to foster the academic development of women in the geotechnical engineering academic community. This award funds for a one day workshop to be held the day prior to the National Workshop to discuss academic career issues in geotechnical engineering, including diversity, research, teaching and service. Women who attend this workshop are expected to also attend the National Workshop thereby increasing the representation of women in USUCGER activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is designed to foster technical, intellectual and personal exchange among women in the geotechnical academic community. Participants will be women faculty currently holding geotechnical academic positions at U.S. Universities. These will include women from academic research institutions, as well as predominately undergraduate teaching institutions. Participants will represent all stages of an academic career, and a broad range of technical expertise and geographic location. The intent of the workshop is to instill in its participants a sense of belonging within the geotechnical community in which they must ultimately succeed as academics, and to which their contributions are essential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will consist of roundtable discussions, informal presentations and a guest speaker. It will be a somewhat intense event that will foster exchanges between the participants. It is an excellent opportunity to trade notes, identify common interests and issues, and develop collaborative efforts within the geotechnical community. The outcome will be the development of a list of action items and a set of recommended strategies for the action items. Follow-up surveys will be conducted to document the benefits of the workshop and a web page will be created to serve as a USUCGER resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this workshop include both short- and long-term benefits. The short-term benefits include development of an active network of mentors and peers for women within the geotechnical community, increased awareness of research and funding opportunities/ collaborations, and increased participation of women at the Fourth USUCGER National Workshop. The long-term benefits include increased retention of women as active researchers, educators and mentors within geotechnical engineering and increased diversity within geotechnical engineering.</AbstractNarration>
