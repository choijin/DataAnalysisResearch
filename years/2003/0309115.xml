<AbstractNarration>9733350  Otaigbe    This  Faculty  Early Career Development project will  investigate  one  of the most fundamental and general questions regarding  the  properties   of  amorphous  materials:  namely,   what   is   the  relationship between the structural characteristics of disordered  materials and the various physical processes used to produce  the  amorphous  material.  Specifically, the project will examine  the  changes   in  polymeric  phosphate  glass  structure  caused   by  variations  in  composition and evolved by melt  processing.   It  will   correlate  these  structural  changes  in  novel   durable  polymeric  phosphate  glasses with the  rheology,  durability  to  water, and resistance to crystallization. The research objectives  will  be  accomplished using an interdisciplinary  approach  that  integrates  aspects  of materials science, rheology,  solid-state  chemistry  and  physics, and process engineering to  explore  the  effects of controlled shear flow on both the short-range and  the  intermediate-range order structure of the glasses  produced.  The  macroscopic   glass   structure  will  be  studied   by   various  spectroscopy, microscopy, high performance liquid chromatography,  and  calorimetry  techniques; it  will  then  be  linked  to  its  microscopic  origin through X-ray diffraction  experiments.  This  work  will  correlate melt-processing conditions (such  as  shear  distortion,  temperature,  and  shear  rate)  with  the  ultimate  rheological behavior of the glass.  The results will be  compared  to  reported  structural  models  for  phosphate  glasses.   This  project   will  evolve  into  a  major  education  and   research  capability  at  Iowa  State University that will  be  facilitated  through  collaborations with international leaders  in  phosphate  glass  research.  In addition, students in the Materials  Science  and  Engineering  (MSE)  Department  will  be  provided  with   a  relevant,  and practice-oriented education that is attractive  to   industry.   This objective will be accomplished by (a)  providing  research  experiences for graduate and undergraduate students  in  MSE;  (b)  demonstrating to students the  synergistic  effect  of  interdisciplinary research in solving fundamental problems  using  innovative, computer-based instructional modules; (c)  developing  graduate  student  internship  opportunities  with  industry   by  leveraging  both  the human and the equipment  resources  of  the  industrial   collaborators;  (d)  developing   simple   practical  materials  science  demonstration kits for  high  school  science  students   and  other  distant  education  teaching   aids;   (e)  developing   cooperative  student  learning   groups,   and   (f)  incorporating research findings into the principal investigator's  courses.  %%%  Understanding   the  dependencies  of  chemical  durability   and  resistance  to crystallization tendencies on both the composition  and  the  melt-processing conditions of  phosphate  glasses  will  enhance  the  use  of phosphate glasses in applications  such  as  glass-to-metal seals for high expansion metal applications, flame  retardants,  biomaterials, storage materials for nuclear  wastes,  optics, phosphorescent/fluorescent materials, scintillators,  and  load-bearing organic/inorganic composites. In addition,  students  in the Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) Department at Iowa  State   University  will  be  provided  with  a   relevant,   and  practice-oriented education that is attractive to industry.  ***</AbstractNarration>
