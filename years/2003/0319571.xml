<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Grinnell College under the direction of Dr. Peter Jacobson to purchase a suite of three instruments with a common focus: to elucidate the influences of nutrient dynamics on ecological systems. This equipment - a Nitrogen/Carbon Analyzer, an Automated Ion Analyzer and a Combustion Analyzer -- will be used in collaborative student/faculty research projects spanning the breadth of ecology, from ecophysiological studies of plants to large-scale ecosystem impacts of hydrologic change. The instruments' ability to automate many time-consuming procedures will make these investigations more efficient and more effective learning tools for students, who will be able to spend more of their time exploring appropriate modes of analysis and understanding the applications of their data.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the equipment will enable investigations of: (1) the mechanisms by which fire and grazing affect prairie arthropod communities; (2) the nutrient-sensitivity of resource trade-offs in plant reproduction; (3) the environmental factors that shape arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal fungal communities; and (4) the influence of flood pulses on nutrient dynamics and production in riparian forests. In addition to these studies, the instrumentation will significantly increase the range of investigations available to students in the laboratory and field while providing them with invaluable experience using state-of-the-art analytical techniques in ecological studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities have a number of broader impacts. Grinnell College's dedication to integrating research and undergraduate education makes automated, user-friendly instruments essential. The proposed activities would allow students to understand both the principles and applications of nutrient analysis techniques, while involving them in authentic research with faculty. These activities will contribute in diverse ways to our understanding of nutrient dynamics in ecological systems, while significantly enhancing the College's infrastructure by providing sophisticated tools for ecological research and education. As with other instrumentation at Grinnell College, this new equipment will be integrated into the curriculum at all levels, enriching the research training and learning of a broad cross-section of students. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
