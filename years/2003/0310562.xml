<AbstractNarration>DMS-0310562&lt;br/&gt;Yuanan Diao, Claus Ernst, Uta Ziegler&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a CARGO incubation award made under solicitation &lt;br/&gt;http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2002/nsf02155/nsf02155.htm.&lt;br/&gt;New applications of knot theory in biophysics and biochemistry have focused interest on &lt;br/&gt;knotted molecules, that is, on physical knots of volume-occupying nature and particular &lt;br/&gt;geometric shapes. A physical knot is modeled as a smooth closed curve with certain thickness. &lt;br/&gt;The thickness of a smooth knot can be thought of, intuitively, as the radius of the rope &lt;br/&gt;with which the knot is tied as tight as possible. In mathematical terms it is the largest &lt;br/&gt;embedded normal tube around a smooth knot that does not intersect itself. The ropelength &lt;br/&gt;of a (thick) knot is the quotient of its arc length over its thickness. The focus of this &lt;br/&gt;proposed work is the challenging problem of finding good estimates of the minimum &lt;br/&gt;ropelengths of various knots. For knots with small crossing numbers, computational &lt;br/&gt;methods exist which estimate their ropelengths. The techniques used to obtain these &lt;br/&gt;estimates cannot be extended to very large knots. Thus very few computational results &lt;br/&gt;are available for knots with large crossing numbers. It is known that for any &lt;br/&gt;nontrivial knot, its minimum ropelength is bounded above by a constant times its &lt;br/&gt;crossing number squared. The PIs have recently improved this bound to a constant times &lt;br/&gt;the crossing number (of the knot) raised to the three half power. However, &lt;br/&gt;the PIs suspect that for most knots, their ropelengths are bounded by their &lt;br/&gt;crossing numbers (times a constant) or less. So there seems to be a gap between &lt;br/&gt;the proven bound and the actual minimal ropelengths of various knots. In this work, &lt;br/&gt;the PIs will develop a computer program that is capable of computing a close estimate &lt;br/&gt;of the minimum ropelengths of knots with large crossing numbers. This computer program &lt;br/&gt;will make use of the algorithm used in establishing the upper bound of the three &lt;br/&gt;half power mentioned above. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some research in biophysics, chemistry and physics deals with long strings of molecules &lt;br/&gt;that are knotted, for example, circular DNA or polymer chains. The type of knotting &lt;br/&gt;often influences the properties and behavior of the molecules. To better understand the &lt;br/&gt;properties of such molecules, this project proposes to examine the relationship between &lt;br/&gt;the complexity of a knot and its physical length. This relationship can be formulated &lt;br/&gt;into the following question: If one is given a rope of certain radius and wants to tie &lt;br/&gt;a certain knot, how long does the rope have to be? For small knots, one can get a rough &lt;br/&gt;idea by simply tying the knot and measuring how much rope it took. However for very &lt;br/&gt;large knots that is not practical since it is not clear how to tie a knot with rope &lt;br/&gt;in an optimal way. The proposed project involves the creation of a computer program &lt;br/&gt;that - for many knots -checks lots of different ways how the same knot can be tied, &lt;br/&gt;in order to find a close estimate to the minimum length of rope. The results of the &lt;br/&gt;computer program will be used to hypothesize a general relationship between the &lt;br/&gt;complexities and the lengths of knots. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
