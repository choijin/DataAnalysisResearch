    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of using a sex-pheromone based mass trapping and mating disruption system for soybean aphids. The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, is a newly invasive aphid pest, and the only aphid pest on soybeans. This species causes major economic losses either as direct pests or as vectors of plant viruses. This Phase I project will identify and optimize the sex pheromone blend of Aphis glycines, and develop effective controlled release dispensers to be used for disrupting the mating of females, either by classical pheromone mating disruption or by mass trapping. Novel ways of inexpensively procuring large amounts of the pheromone components will also be initiated. The research builds on preliminary studies showing that the soybean aphids can be cultured in the laboratory under controlled conditions to produce sexually active adults. Preliminary experiments have also indicated the production in A. glycines of two compounds known to serve as pheromone components in other aphid species. These compounds evoke upwind flight by males in the wind tunnel, and are attractive to both males and gynoparous female soybean aphids in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project is in the area of pest management for soybean crops. It is expected that the technology developed against the aphid species in soybean may also be applicable against other aphid pests in other economically important crops.</AbstractNarration>
