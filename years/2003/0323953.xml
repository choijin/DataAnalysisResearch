<AbstractNarration>NSF Grant No. 0323953&lt;br/&gt;QUASI-LINEAR CONTROL&lt;br/&gt;PI: P. T. Kabamba, Co-PI: S. M. Meerkov&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides funding for the development of theory and techniques for design of controllers in&lt;br/&gt;feedback systems with linear plants and nonlinear sensors and actuators. This type of systems, referred&lt;br/&gt;to as linear plant, nonlinear instrumentation (LPNI) systems, often appear in aerospace, automotive&lt;br/&gt;and other applications, where plants can be linearized but the instrumentation is fundamentally&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear due to cost, power, weight and other physical constraints. Within this project, all main&lt;br/&gt;problems of control, i.e., disturbance rejection, reference tacking, conservation laws, etc., will be&lt;br/&gt;addressed. The approach is based on the method of stochastic linearization, whereby the nonlinearities&lt;br/&gt;of the instrumentation are replaced by static gains, calculated as functions of the variance of the&lt;br/&gt;signals at their inputs. Unlike local (i.e., Jacobian) linearization, this method is semi-global in the&lt;br/&gt;sense that it approximates the original system in arbitrarily large domains, defined by the signals&lt;br/&gt;at the inputs of the nonlinearities. The set of techniques, to be derived using this approach, is&lt;br/&gt;envisioned as extensions of corresponding linear control tools, augmented by nonlinear relationships&lt;br/&gt;that account for instrumentation nonlinearities. This set of tools is referred to as quasi-linear control&lt;br/&gt;theory (QLCT).&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this work will lead to improvements in design of controllers for a wide&lt;br/&gt;range of practical LPNI. Today, such controllers are often designed using linear theory and then&lt;br/&gt;time-consuming and expensive validations and incremental improvements, based on simulations, are&lt;br/&gt;carried out. QLCT will, to a large extent, eliminate the necessity of extensive simulations, since&lt;br/&gt;the optimal controllers will be designed directly taking into account instrumentation nonlinearities.&lt;br/&gt;Initial application of these techniques for design of air-to-fuel ratio controllers at Ford Motor Co. is&lt;br/&gt;planned.</AbstractNarration>
