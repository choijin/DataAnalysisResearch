<AbstractNarration>This grant provides support for the acquisition of a Fourier Transform Infrared Raman (FTIR) spectrometer system to probe intermediate phases in disordered systems at the University of Cincinnati. Network glasses have served as a paradigm of disordered systems. Raman scattering and modulated-differential-scanning-calorimetry experiments have shown that the onset of stressed rigidity in glasses involves two elastic phase transitions as a function of increasing cross-linking: transition-1 from an easily deformable network (floppy phase) to an isostatically rigid network (intermediate phase), and transition-2 from an intermediate phase to a stressed rigid phase. The term isostatic connotes absence of redundant bonds that would create stress. Intermediate phases represent self-organized phases of disordered systems in which stress (energy) is globally minimized. These ideas on self-organization of disordered molecular networks may extend to biological ones (protein folding) and electronic ones (high-T superconductors). The FTIR spectrometer acquisition will make possible, for the first time, the probing of IR-active modes. Furthermore, the FT-Raman module will permit probing glasses with optical gaps to include some of the technologically more important materials systems. From an educational point of view, the instrument acquisition will permit materials research of superhard thin-films, zeolites, nanoscale polarized light-emitting diodes, clays, ferroelectrics and silicon based structures in addition to glasses. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The instrument will impact directly the graduate thesis of more than 30 graduate students working on these materials across several departments in the Colleges of Engineering, and Arts and Sciences at the University of Cincinnati. In addition, the instrument will provide hands on experience to students in graduate courses. Undergraduate students at UC and at Northern Kentucky University will benefit from use of the facility in seniors and undergraduate research projects. Furthermore, the faculty will work with select groups of minority undergraduates, as part of a program established to interest these students into available research opportunities. Minority high school students will be recruited to participate in laboratory work during summer recess. The faculty will also give presentations to 4th through 7th graders and their parents, as part of the Family Science Academy outreach effort to interest children in the role of Science and Engineering in our lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
