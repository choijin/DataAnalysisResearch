<AbstractNarration>Wireless networks of sensors will be widely deployed in the future because they&lt;br/&gt;greatly extend our ability to monitor and control the physical environment from&lt;br/&gt;remote locations. One of the most important communication primitives that has&lt;br/&gt;to be provided by sensor networks is information gathering: information from&lt;br/&gt;the sensors has to be forwarded to a single point for evaluation. Since sensors&lt;br/&gt;will exist with the ratio of thousands of nodes per user, it is impossible to&lt;br/&gt;pay attention to any individual node. Hence, it is important to use&lt;br/&gt;communication methods in sensor networks that are extremely simple - to allow a&lt;br/&gt;verification of their correct implementation - and self-reconfiguring - to&lt;br/&gt;allow automatic adjustments to changes in the sensor network or sensing tasks.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, since sensors are simple devices with limited processing power,&lt;br/&gt;storage capacity, and energy, it is important to develop routing strategies&lt;br/&gt;that can support information gathering as efficiently as possible. Whereas many&lt;br/&gt;heuristics have already been suggested for resource-efficient information&lt;br/&gt;gathering in sensor networks, almost no rigorous theoretical work has been&lt;br/&gt;performed in this area yet. Therefore, the goal of this project is to explore&lt;br/&gt;fundamental concepts for self-reconfigurable and resource-efficient information&lt;br/&gt;gathering in wireless sensor networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concentrates on networks of static sensors (i.e. sensors do not&lt;br/&gt;move around, which is commonly the case). However, the observer may move&lt;br/&gt;around. Also, connections between sensors may be available or unavailable&lt;br/&gt;depending on the underlying medium access control protocol or temporary&lt;br/&gt;problems such as obstacles. In addition, sensors may fail permanently due to&lt;br/&gt;energy problems. To ensure that the network protocols developed in the project&lt;br/&gt;will work under any circumstances, models are used in which the injections of&lt;br/&gt;packets, the status of the edges, and the movements of the observer are assumed&lt;br/&gt;to be under adversarial control. The challenge is to find distributed online&lt;br/&gt;protocols for this case - i.e. protocols performing online decisions that can&lt;br/&gt;be executed locally at every sensor  - that have a near-optimal throughput&lt;br/&gt;using a near-minimum amount of energy and storage. Simple protocols with these&lt;br/&gt;properties have recently been developed and analyzed by the PI for specific&lt;br/&gt;cases (such as specific topologies of sensors and a static observer), and the&lt;br/&gt;research goal of the project is to establish analytical and experimental&lt;br/&gt;results for much more general cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A broad impact of the project is ensured by disseminating the research results&lt;br/&gt;via lecture notes, conference and journal publications, presentations, and&lt;br/&gt;publications on the Web. Furthermore, sensor networks is a highly&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary field. It involves people from many different areas:&lt;br/&gt;integrated circuits, signal processing, operating systems, and theoretical&lt;br/&gt;computer science. The project will stimulate interactions of the PI with people&lt;br/&gt;from these fields, which may lead to exciting interdisciplinary projects in the&lt;br/&gt;future. Finally, since no standards have been set yet for communication in&lt;br/&gt;sensor networks, a potential consequence of the project with high social&lt;br/&gt;benefit will be to provide valuable contributions to future standards.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
