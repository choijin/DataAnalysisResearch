<AbstractNarration>DMS-0305012&lt;br/&gt;James Conant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator, a low dimensional topologist, is utilizing a&lt;br/&gt;tool he developed with Peter Teichner (called ``grope cobordism") to find&lt;br/&gt;topological applications and interpretations for an important class of&lt;br/&gt;invariants called Vassiliev invariants. In particular he and Teichner are&lt;br/&gt;pursuing the question of whether Vassiliev invariants detect knottedness.&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator is also looking for more powerful versions of&lt;br/&gt;the theory of Vassiliev invariants, hopefully giving rise to four&lt;br/&gt;dimensional (concordance) information. Some of this is joint with Jacob&lt;br/&gt;Mostovoy and Ted Stanford. Working jointly with Matt Horak and Karen&lt;br/&gt;Vogtmann, the principal investigator is studying the mapping class group&lt;br/&gt;of surfaces via a tool developed by Harer, Penner, and elucidated by&lt;br/&gt;Kontsevich (graph homology). Graph homology is very similar to the algebra&lt;br/&gt;that appears in the context of Vassiliev invariants. The principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator is also studying the group of outer automorphisms of a free&lt;br/&gt;group via graph homology. Finally, the principal investigator, working&lt;br/&gt;jointly with Ryan Budney, Kevin Scannell, and Dev Sinha, is pursuing a&lt;br/&gt;program for grounding Vassiliev invariants in classical homotopy theory&lt;br/&gt;and differential topology. This program has already borne fruit in terms&lt;br/&gt;of geometric interpretations of the simplest Vassiliev invariant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The yoga behind the theory of topological invariants is that they provide&lt;br/&gt;useful, computable topological information. When the number of dimensions&lt;br/&gt;is large, complete answers to topological questions can often be found&lt;br/&gt;using algebraic invariants. In low dimensions, such as 3 and 4, the&lt;br/&gt;situation is more complicated. The invariants still exist, but they are&lt;br/&gt;much weaker, and usually do not give complete answers.  On the other hand,&lt;br/&gt;there are lots of invariants in low dimensions which don't have high&lt;br/&gt;dimensional analogues, and which are poorly understood topologically. For&lt;br/&gt;example, there is a polynomial you can associate to any knotted loop (such&lt;br/&gt;as a piece of DNA or a singularity in spacetime) which will not change&lt;br/&gt;even if the loop is pushed and pulled into a new shape. This polynomial,&lt;br/&gt;called the Jones polynomial, has a definition which eludes any topological&lt;br/&gt;interpretation and whose topological applications have been modest. The&lt;br/&gt;principal investigator is working to understand precisely the connection&lt;br/&gt;of this polynomial (and other similar objects) with topology, and this&lt;br/&gt;will lead to more effective methods for answering questions in low&lt;br/&gt;dimensional topology and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
