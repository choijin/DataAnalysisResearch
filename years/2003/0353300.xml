<AbstractNarration>Travel Grant to 5th International PhD Symposium in Civil Engineering &lt;br/&gt;TU Delft, The Netherlands ,CMS project 0353300&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Reginald Des Roches,  GA Tech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to provide travel fellowships for approximately 8-10 graduate students to attend &lt;br/&gt;the 5th International PhD Symposium in Civil Engineering, in Delft, The Netherlands, in June, &lt;br/&gt;2004.  The symposium is the 5th, in a sequence of successful symposiums that began in 1996 in &lt;br/&gt;Budapest.   The symposium is a great opportunity to have students highlight the results of their &lt;br/&gt;research and interact with students from all over the world.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the Symposium are to:&lt;br/&gt; Provide a forum to exchange ideas and research results for PHD Students &lt;br/&gt; Discuss the results of ongoing research &lt;br/&gt; Provide opportunities for PhD students to establish scientific relationships  &lt;br/&gt; Compare PhD programs in various countries &lt;br/&gt; Excite students about academia in this critical stage of their careers &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will be recruited from Universities all over the United States.  Attempts will be made to &lt;br/&gt;have a diverse group of students selected for the fellowships (in terms of research topics, &lt;br/&gt;regional representation, and cultural diversity).   Special efforts will be made to attract talented &lt;br/&gt;students from smaller and non-traditional universities, as well as students from &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed travel grant are that it will provide graduate students an &lt;br/&gt;opportunity to exchange ideas and research results with PhD students from all over the world.  &lt;br/&gt;This experience will help excite students about civil engineering and academia at this very &lt;br/&gt;critical stage in their careers. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
