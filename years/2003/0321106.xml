<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;0321106&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hysitron TriboScope Nanomechanical test instrument is a quantitative&lt;br/&gt;depth-sensing nanoindentation and nanoscratch system which is interfaced with a scanning&lt;br/&gt;probe microscope (SPM) to provide in-situ imaging. The acquisition of the TriboScope Nanomechanical Test System will enable us to&lt;br/&gt;address some of the open issues in the field of nanoscale structural components. Two of&lt;br/&gt;the open problems include (a) the inconsistent production and fabrication techniques which&lt;br/&gt;lead to varied results for the same nanosystem, (b) the procurement of reliable and&lt;br/&gt;fundamental data banks of durability and material properties, and c) the computational&lt;br/&gt;modeling of nanostructured materials which utilize realistic material properties. The&lt;br/&gt;types of experiments that will be performed on this test system will allow for us to&lt;br/&gt;directly address issues (b) and (c). The tests that will be performed include Modulus,&lt;br/&gt;hardness, fracture toughness measurements, and the generation of force vs. displacement&lt;br/&gt;curves. Nanostructures represent a new field of science that can extend the size, efficiency and&lt;br/&gt;design of well-known materials. As this field has progressed, more elaborate structures&lt;br/&gt;have been generated that require a better understanding and more consistent methodology&lt;br/&gt;for obtaining reliable material properties.&lt;br/&gt;With the nation's most successful Dual-Degree Engineering program for African-American&lt;br/&gt;males, Morehouse College is well positioned to have a significant impact on the production&lt;br/&gt;of engineers of African American lineage by increasing the number and the retention of&lt;br/&gt;students in the engineering and applied physics programs. This equipment will not only serve&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates at Morehouse College, but will also serve neighboring undergraduate liberal&lt;br/&gt;arts colleges in the AUC. Colleges in the consortium directly impacted by the procurement&lt;br/&gt;of this equipment include Clark Atlanta University, Morris Brown College, and Spelman&lt;br/&gt;College, a private liberal arts Historically Black College for African-American females.&lt;br/&gt;Students from these colleges are not only allowed to cross-register and take classes at&lt;br/&gt;the neighboring schools, but may also complete research projects. Therefore, the research&lt;br/&gt;opportunities at Morehouse will also have a direct impact on the students at Clark&lt;br/&gt;Atlanta, Morris Brown and Spelman College.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
