<AbstractNarration>The objective of the proposed research is the development of algorithmic &lt;br/&gt;methods for design verification. Today's rapid development of complex and &lt;br/&gt;safety-critical systems requires reliable verification methods.  Formal &lt;br/&gt;verification is the study of algorithms and structures applicable to the &lt;br/&gt;verification of hardware and software designs.  It combines theoretical &lt;br/&gt;and experimental aspects.  In the last few years, this area has seen a &lt;br/&gt;dramatic expansion of activities.  Verification tools are incorporated &lt;br/&gt;into industrial development of new designs, forming an active and exciting &lt;br/&gt;area of research where theory and practice stimulate each other. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this poject is the application of the&lt;br/&gt;automata-theoretic approach to design verification, which uses the theory&lt;br/&gt;of automata as a unifying paradigm for design specification,&lt;br/&gt;verification, and synthesis.  The automata-theoretic&lt;br/&gt;perspective considers the relationships between designs and their&lt;br/&gt;specifications as relationships between languages. By translating&lt;br/&gt;design and logical specifications to automata, questions about&lt;br/&gt;programs and their specifications can be reduced to questions about&lt;br/&gt;automata. More specifically, questions such as satisfiability of&lt;br/&gt;specifications and correctness of designs with respect to their&lt;br/&gt;specifications can be reduced to questions such as non-emptiness and&lt;br/&gt;containment of automata.  The automata-theoretic approach separates &lt;br/&gt;the logical and the combinatorial aspects of reasoning about systems. &lt;br/&gt;The translation of specifications to automata handles the logic and shifts &lt;br/&gt;all the combinatorial difficulties to automata-theoretic problems, &lt;br/&gt;yielding clean and asymptotically optimal algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, automata are very helpful for implementing&lt;br/&gt;temporal-logic based verification methods, and are the key to &lt;br/&gt;techniques such as on-the-fly verification&lt;br/&gt;that help coping with the ``state-explosion'' problem.&lt;br/&gt;Automata-theoretic methods have been implemented in both &lt;br/&gt;academic and industrial automated-verification tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many questions in the theory of automata on infinite objects are still&lt;br/&gt;open, and more fruitful applications of automata theory in design&lt;br/&gt;verification are possible. This projects aims at solving several&lt;br/&gt;automata-theoretic problems with clear application to design&lt;br/&gt;verification, and at develoing automata-based verification methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;The broad impact of this project is the contribution to the&lt;br/&gt;efforts of developing and improving formal verification methods,&lt;br/&gt;constituting an additional step toward formal verification of&lt;br/&gt;industrial real-life designs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
