<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Allan Simmons will conduct two seasons of archaeological  investigation into the initial colonization of the Mediterranean island of &lt;br/&gt;Cyprus,.  For many years, scholars considered the Mediterranean islands as &lt;br/&gt;late recipients of human occupation. Cyprus, however, had the earliest &lt;br/&gt;evidence, with most data pointing to the founding of the first villages during &lt;br/&gt;the later Neolithic period, around 6,000 B.C. The Neolithic, the transition &lt;br/&gt;from hunting and gathering economies to those based on food production, first &lt;br/&gt;occurred on the Near Eastern mainland about 9,000 B.C. and thus the colonization &lt;br/&gt;of the Mediterranean islands was seen as relatively late.  Furthermore, the &lt;br/&gt;island Neolithic was characterized as a nondescript counterpart of its &lt;br/&gt;mainland ancestors, often regarded as little more than a footnote in the wider &lt;br/&gt;Neolithic world.  Research at Ais Yiorkis challenges this perception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent discoveries on Cyprus demonstrated an initial occupation around &lt;br/&gt;10,000 B.C., which likely resulted in the extinction of native Pleistocene &lt;br/&gt;fauna such as the pygmy hippopotamus.  Other research has extended the &lt;br/&gt;chronology and scope of the actual Neolithic colonization of the island by &lt;br/&gt;about 1,000 years.  This newly defined phase, the Cypro-PPNB, presently &lt;br/&gt;consists of a handful of sites, of which Ais Yiorkis is one.  Research at the &lt;br/&gt;settlement is oriented towards understanding why it is atypical from other &lt;br/&gt;Neolithic sites.  First, it is located in the uplands rather the coastal area, &lt;br/&gt;where nearly all other sites are situated.  Second, it contains a &lt;br/&gt;technologically and typologically sophisticated artifact assemblage, including &lt;br/&gt;imported obsidian artifacts.  Third, although it does not appear to be a &lt;br/&gt;village, it contains a large circular stone structure unlike anything &lt;br/&gt;previously found in the Cypriot Neolithic.  Finally, economic data suggest a &lt;br/&gt;far more wide ranging subsistence base that previously suspected.  This &lt;br/&gt;included the limited presence of cattle, which had not been documented until &lt;br/&gt;the much later Bronze Age.  Cattle also have recently been reported from &lt;br/&gt;another Cypro-PPNB site, thus these animals appear to have been part of &lt;br/&gt;the "Neolithic Package" that accompanied the island's first colonists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will establish base-line data for the newly defined Cypro-PPNB period.  The project will test models related to variability in the early permanent occupation of Cyprus &lt;br/&gt;which is now known to be far more complex than initially believed.  In &lt;br/&gt;particular, the research examines both the nature of an upland occupation and &lt;br/&gt;the economic, and possible ritual, impact of cattle in the early Neolithic of &lt;br/&gt;the island. The work contributes to a better understanding of the trajectory of how early food producing societies spread throughout the Mediterranean area during the tumultuous "Neolithic &lt;br/&gt;Revolution."  It is now clear that Cyprus was an active  participant in this event much earlier than believed.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Neolithic resulted in both the establishment of the Mediterranean agro-pastoral economic pattern and the ecological degradation associated with food production and high population &lt;br/&gt;densities that is still being felt in the region today.  It is, therefore, a &lt;br/&gt;relevant research issue with contemporary significance.  Both Cypriot and U.S. &lt;br/&gt;students will join the project, thereby gaining valuable research &lt;br/&gt;experience.   Archaeology students from the fledging University of Cyprus will &lt;br/&gt;be encouraged to participate, enhancing joint participation between the U.S. &lt;br/&gt;and Cyprus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
