<AbstractNarration>Professor Royce W. Murray of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program to investigate metal nanoparticles with emphasis on particles in the range from 3 nm to just below 1 nm in diameter.  Focus is on advancing techniques for the preparation and characterization of monolayer-protected metal clusters (MPCs), compounds that have metal, or metal-like, cores stabilized by protecting monolayers of thiolate ligands.  Metal nanoparticles in the size range targeted for study lie in the transition region between bulk metals and discrete molecules and exhibit properties that are dependent on both core size and the chemical nature of the protecting monolayer.  The research team is exploring synthetic strategies for the preparation of MPCs that are increasingly smaller and more highly mono-disperse and enable variations in metal core composition and ligand functional groups (fluorophores, redox groups, and analytically useful binding sites).  Analytical methods are being developed with special focus on high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) separations and tactics of optical and electrochemical detection that elucidate MPC size dispersity.  The energetics and dynamics of electron transfer chemistry of differently sized MPCs are being explored through comparisons between responses of the largest MPCs that display a continuum of electronic charging, smaller MPCs that display quantized double layer charging and the smallest core MPCs that exhibit molecule-like homo/lumo band gaps.  Ligand exchange reactions and the excited state behavior of fluorophores attached to the ligand monolayer of the metal core are also being investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is developing tools necessary to study the metal-to-molecule transition region of metal clusters in solution.  The work has impact in application areas that include chemical sensing and the development of nanometer-scale conduits for electronic charge transport.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
