<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shin abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small low-cost sensor devices, each equipped with limited resources,&lt;br/&gt;are networked and used for various critical applications.&lt;br/&gt;The nature of these applications may require the underlying sensor&lt;br/&gt;network to be secure even though it is usually deployed in&lt;br/&gt;a harsh, sometimes hostile, and unsupervised environment,&lt;br/&gt;and hence, is subject to capture, reverse-engineering&lt;br/&gt;and manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;Existing tamper resistance techniques are either hardware-based or intended for&lt;br/&gt;environments with sufficient computation and communication&lt;br/&gt;resources, but they cannot be used for low-cost (thus resource-limited)&lt;br/&gt;sensor devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the development and evaluation of&lt;br/&gt;a Program-Integrity Verification (PIV) protocol that intermittently &lt;br/&gt;verifies integrity of the program code of a sensor device, e.g., whenever&lt;br/&gt;it joins a network or has experienced a long service blockage.&lt;br/&gt;The PIV protocol augments sensor devices to make them&lt;br/&gt;usable for applications that require high-level security.&lt;br/&gt;PIV uses a randomized hash function,&lt;br/&gt;by which the algorithm for hash computation on the program code&lt;br/&gt;can be randomly generated whenever the code needs to be verified.&lt;br/&gt;By applying this algorithm, the PIV protocol will offer protection&lt;br/&gt;against manipulation/reverse-engineering/reprogramming of sensors;&lt;br/&gt;provide software-based protection without requiring tamper-resistant hardware;&lt;br/&gt;exploit infrequent triggering of verification, thereby not&lt;br/&gt;stressing or interfering with normal sensor functions; &lt;br/&gt;and assure cryptographic security.  The project consists of the following four&lt;br/&gt;closely-related tasks, Program-Integrity Verification, Key Management, &lt;br/&gt;Adaptive Intrusion Detection, and Experimentation and Validation.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;advancement of software-based tamper-resistance techniques.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact is epxected in emerging&lt;br/&gt;sensor networks that will play key roles in safety-critical&lt;br/&gt;and homeland security applications such as surveillance&lt;br/&gt;of the physical infrastructure, including buildings and bridges,&lt;br/&gt;transportation systems, water supply systems, and power generation&lt;br/&gt;and distribution systems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
