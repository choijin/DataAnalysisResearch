<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL DMS-0305829&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Joseph M. Landsberg&lt;br/&gt;Title: Geometric applications of exterior differential systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Landsberg will work on two projects: the dual defect conjecture&lt;br/&gt;and the classification of Legendrian varieties and contact Fano manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;The second project originates with a question in differential geometry,&lt;br/&gt;the classification of compact quaternionic-Kahler manifolds, which, thanks &lt;br/&gt;to work of LeBrun and Salamon, is essentially equivalent to the &lt;br/&gt;classification of contact Fano manifolds. Inside the tangent space of a &lt;br/&gt;general point of  a contact Fano manifold is an immersed Legendrian &lt;br/&gt;variety and knowledge about such varieties is important for the contact &lt;br/&gt;Fano problem. The Salamon conjecture is that all contact Fano manifolds&lt;br/&gt;are homogeneous.  &lt;br/&gt;The first project is to show that the dual variety of a &lt;br/&gt;smooth variety of codimension less than half its dimension is a &lt;br/&gt;hypersurface. This question is of importance in algebgraic geometry as &lt;br/&gt;part of the investigations motivated by Hartshornes's conjecture on complete &lt;br/&gt;intersections. The techniques that will be developed to solve this &lt;br/&gt;problem are  as important as the problem iself- a combination of exterior &lt;br/&gt;differential systems and representation theory  that will be useful for &lt;br/&gt;other problems in geometry and other areas of science such as &lt;br/&gt;computational complexity and algebraic statistics (Baysean networks).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Landsberg will use techniques from partial differential equations&lt;br/&gt;(more precisely, exterior differential systems) and representation&lt;br/&gt;theory (of simple Lie algebras) to study two problems in geometry&lt;br/&gt;related respectively  to dual varieties and contact Fano manifolds. In &lt;br/&gt;addition to the importance of these questions to the mathematical &lt;br/&gt;community, the techniques that will be developed will be applicable to &lt;br/&gt;problems in other fields such as computational complexity and algebraic &lt;br/&gt;statistics (Baysean networks).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
