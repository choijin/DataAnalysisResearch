<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;1. Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;We have recently demonstrated experimentally that hybrid thin film structures possessing&lt;br/&gt;an appropriately selected geometric interface between a semiconductor and a metal display a&lt;br/&gt;new phenomenon that has been labeled extraordinary magnetoresistance (EMR) and that InSb&lt;br/&gt;devices with either internal or external Au shunts exhibit room-temperature EMR as high as&lt;br/&gt;100% to 750,000% at magnetic fields, ranging from 0.05T to 4 Tesla, respectively. These&lt;br/&gt;nonmagnetic structures are readily fabricated for practical sensor applications such as read-heads&lt;br/&gt;for ultra-high density magnetic recording and rival the performance of conventional sensors&lt;br/&gt;based on the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect. We have also demonstrated that EMR&lt;br/&gt;devices are scalable from macroscopic to nanoscopic dimensions in the range of millimeters to&lt;br/&gt;20 nanometers. It has recently been realized that EMR is but one example of a broad class of&lt;br/&gt;geometry-driven interfacial effects in hybrid semiconductor-metal structures. Now a second&lt;br/&gt;example of such interfacial phenomena, extraordinary piezoconductivity (EPC), has also been&lt;br/&gt;demonstrated by Solin et. al. Here we propose to establish proof of principle, elucidate the&lt;br/&gt;underlying physics and develop prototypes of a new class of ifEXXly sensors in which the&lt;br/&gt;sensitivity of the metal-semiconductor interface to external perturbations gives rise to similar&lt;br/&gt;extraordinary responses. In the case of EMR we propose new prototype array structures for&lt;br/&gt;ultra-high resolution magnetic sensing and magnetic imaging. For EPC we propose to clarify the&lt;br/&gt;physical principles and to develop prototypes of ultra sensitive and robust strain and pressure&lt;br/&gt;sensors. For extraordinary electroconductance (EEC), extraordinary thermoconductance (ETC)&lt;br/&gt;and extraordinary optoconductance (EOC) devices we will first establish proof of principal and&lt;br/&gt;thereafter move to the prototype stage.&lt;br/&gt;All EXX effects are critically dependent on the geometry and physical properties the&lt;br/&gt;metal-semiconductor interface. We have already shown that the finite element method (FEM)&lt;br/&gt;for modeling EMR provides excellent ixno adjustable parameterl" agreement with experiments&lt;br/&gt;while revealing the current and potential distribution in the device in exquisite detail. Therefore,&lt;br/&gt;we propose collateral investigation of these novel EXX effects using FEM modeling since it&lt;br/&gt;incorporates geometrical issues, while accounting for the attendant complex boundary&lt;br/&gt;conditions. FEM is also ideally suited for the design optimization of the structures in order to&lt;br/&gt;enhance sensitivity.&lt;br/&gt;2. Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that the proposed research will have broad beneficial impact on&lt;br/&gt;education, technology, and society. It will expose graduate and undergraduate students from a&lt;br/&gt;number of disciplines/departments to new experimental techniques, basic physical principles,&lt;br/&gt;and novel fabrication methods related to EXX sensor development thus providing&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary skills that will be mandatory for the next generation of the nation's scientists&lt;br/&gt;and engineers. Research results will also be integrated into the undergraduate course work at&lt;br/&gt;both institutions and into a special topics course for ioMagnetlo high school students. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research will enhance the opportunity for adding women and under-represented&lt;br/&gt;minorities to the Washington University faculty through hiring programs currently chaired by the&lt;br/&gt;PI. It will also significantly augment the development of a new campus-wide Materials&lt;br/&gt;Initiative/Center that is lead by the PI. EXX sensors could impact a variety of diverse&lt;br/&gt;technologies including sensors for medical applications, manufacturing quality control,&lt;br/&gt;automobile safety, pollution-control and fuel-efficiency, thermal imaging devices and consumer&lt;br/&gt;electronics with obvious social, medical and economic benefits.</AbstractNarration>
