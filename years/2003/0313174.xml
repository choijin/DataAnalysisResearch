<AbstractNarration>This study is an investigation of the issues associated with information technology in the manufacturing of complex engineering products using mass customization in the north/south maquila manufacturing systems.  Mass customization is a concept based on the processes associated with the production and delivery of products with diverse configurations, as prescribed by the customer, with a very short lead time.  It is believed that mass customization can provide a competitive advantage for the Mexico based maquila manufacturers and reduce the loss of jobs and businesses to overseas operations.  This research will focus on the development of the IT backbone which is critical for successful implementation of mass customization methodology for assembly of complex, customized products.  There are three key elements of this research: the identification of an appropriate design methodology for mass customization of complex, customer-defined products for the North/South maquila manufacturing environment; the identification of manufacturing methodology to support mass customization; and the identification of critical Information Technology issues for integration of product design-component manufacturing-product assembly to optimize the effectiveness in terms of cost and speed of the mass customization process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will provide a general framework with which to understand the information technology issues associated with mass customization.  The long term goals to be addressed in this study are: a methodology for the identification and modeling of product variants and their impact on mass customization; a methodology for the identification and modeling of manufacturing processes and their impact upon mass customization; a suitability metric for mass customization; a conceptual framework for information technology issues in mass customization; and an evaluation of the conceptual framework.  This research will be jointly conducted at Michigan State University and the University of Texas - Pan American, that is located in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas.  The location of the two institutions mirrors the geographic configuration of many maquila operations - engineering function in the north and manufacture in the south.  Participation in this research by industrial partners that have home offices in Michigan and maquila operations in Texas, and application of the mass customization framework developed should provide benefits for the manufacturing operations that operate under the north/south scheme; particularly the historically economically disadvantaged areas in South Texas. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
