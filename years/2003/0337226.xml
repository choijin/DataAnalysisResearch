    <AbstractNarration>Geometrical and material heterogeneities in faults have long been viewed as &lt;br/&gt;a crucial feature affecting earthquake behavior. More recently, the role of&lt;br/&gt;stress heterogeneities has begun to be recognized as a potentially &lt;br/&gt;central feature,&lt;br/&gt;particularly with the demonstration that stress heterogeneities alone &lt;br/&gt;already can produce a remarkably rich and complex set of earthquake-like&lt;br/&gt;behaviors on uniform planar faults. What is missing is an understanding of how&lt;br/&gt;the two types of heterogeneities, the static geometrical and material&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneities, and the dynamic stress heterogeneities, might combine&lt;br/&gt;and interact to produce even more realistic behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to further develop a line of modeling which &lt;br/&gt;extends elastodynamic simulations to nonplanar geometries. &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the aim is to develop simulations of rough fault geometries.&lt;br/&gt;By studying long sequences of events on the faults, the dynamical attractor&lt;br/&gt;develops, and thus the interaction of stress heterogeneities with any&lt;br/&gt;geometrical heterogeneities can be examined. &lt;br/&gt;As well as developing the technology, we are applying the model&lt;br/&gt;to a set of observations, including normal stress effects, rupture&lt;br/&gt;initiation and termination, and aftershocks. These applications&lt;br/&gt;have relevance to understanding friction better, improving long term &lt;br/&gt;hazard estimation based on segmentation, and short term hazard estimation&lt;br/&gt;based on aftershocks.</AbstractNarration>
