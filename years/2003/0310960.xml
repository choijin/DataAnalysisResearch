<AbstractNarration>This proposal is about pseudorandomness and its relationship with coding &lt;br/&gt;theory and cryptography.  A fundamental object in the study of &lt;br/&gt;pseudorandomness is the extractor, introduced by Nisan and the PI.  An &lt;br/&gt;extractor is an algorithm which extracts high-quality randomness from a &lt;br/&gt;low-quality random source, using a few auxiliary high-quality random &lt;br/&gt;bits.  Recently, the PI and co-authors have discovered interesting &lt;br/&gt;connections between extractors and coding theory.  Specifically, they &lt;br/&gt;showed how to use Reed-Muller codes to build good extractors, and how &lt;br/&gt;extractors yield good list decodable codes.  While there have been &lt;br/&gt;improvements in these methods, optimal extractors have not been &lt;br/&gt;achieved, and the PI proposes to work towards that goal.  The PI also &lt;br/&gt;plans to work on related issues in coding theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the PI plans to work on using low-quality randomness in &lt;br/&gt;cryptography, where less work has been done.  Cryptography also &lt;br/&gt;motivates the notion of deterministic extractors, which extract &lt;br/&gt;randomness from low-quality sources without any auxiliary random bits.  &lt;br/&gt;While this is impossible for general low-quality sources, it is possible &lt;br/&gt;with more specialized ones.  For example, the PI and a student &lt;br/&gt;constructed deterministic extractors for so-called oblivious bit-fixing &lt;br/&gt;sources. This has applications to exposure-resilient cryptography, where &lt;br/&gt;cryptographic primitives are made to work even if large portions of keys &lt;br/&gt;are exposed.  The PI proposes to improve previous results and work on &lt;br/&gt;related issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many scientists use pseudorandom generators in Monte Carlo &lt;br/&gt;simulations,and may get wrong answers without knowing it.  Advances in &lt;br/&gt;pseudorandom generators can therefore mean advances in other areas of &lt;br/&gt;science.  Advances in cryptography are also important to society, as &lt;br/&gt;computer security becomes more relevant for national security.  The &lt;br/&gt;project also has educational benefits:  the PI's research is integrated &lt;br/&gt;with his teaching, especially in his mentoring of graduate students and &lt;br/&gt;postdocs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
