<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this research is to develop several unexplored areas in&lt;br/&gt;data compression, as well as to utilize universal data compression&lt;br/&gt;techniques in other applications including biological modelling and a&lt;br/&gt;novel direction of joint source-channel coding. The research focuses on&lt;br/&gt;four topics: (a) design of joint source-channel universal source code&lt;br/&gt;based codes, (b) study of universal compression for large and unknown&lt;br/&gt;source alphabets, (c) design of advanced universal coding techniques for&lt;br/&gt;non-traditional, yet more realistic, data models with practical&lt;br/&gt;implementations, and (d) the study of random access lossless compression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Common techniques in joint source-channel coding suffer from&lt;br/&gt;severe synchronization problems in bad channel conditions and do&lt;br/&gt;not address universality issues when the source statistics are&lt;br/&gt;unknown.  This research develops techniques to combat these&lt;br/&gt;problems, and even attain "free" gain in channel decoding&lt;br/&gt;performance for redundant channel information streams. Common&lt;br/&gt;compression schemes assume that the data is from a known alphabet,&lt;br/&gt;it has a "standard" stationary or constantly changing&lt;br/&gt;statistical model, and it consists of a long sequence. However,&lt;br/&gt;(a) there exist compression applications with large unknown&lt;br/&gt;alphabets, such as text compression where the words constitute the&lt;br/&gt;alphabet, (b) most real data sequences are usually neither stationary&lt;br/&gt;nor of constantly varying statistics, and (c) random access is&lt;br/&gt;necessary in large compressed data bases. The investigator studies&lt;br/&gt;these three non-traditional problems. The research work combines&lt;br/&gt;the development of rigorous theoretical results including&lt;br/&gt;redundancy and description length bounds, with empirical testing,&lt;br/&gt;algorithm design with focus on practical low-complexity&lt;br/&gt;techniques, and implementation of proposed techniques. Finally,&lt;br/&gt;the research also investigates the use of universal compression&lt;br/&gt;techniques to segmentation and modelling of biological sequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
