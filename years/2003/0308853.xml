<AbstractNarration>Polyploidization is an increase in genome content by duplication of existing DNA or fusion of two species' genomes.   Polyploidization events provide new material for natural selection to act upon.  For example, genes with new functions may evolve or large portions of the duplicated genome may be deleted.   The proposed research will focus on studying this phenomenon in gray treefrogs.  Some gray treefrogs are diploid and have two sets of chromosomes, while the others are tetraploid and have four complete sets.  Tetraploid frogs originated from diploid populations.  Molecular data from different genes will be collected to determine (1) which diploid populations contributed to the formation of the tetraploids and (2) whether doubling of the genome content has changed the rate of evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will have broad impacts by advancing the understanding of basic biological research and educating undergraduate and graduate students.  Women are represented at both undergraduate and graduate levels.  This cross-disciplinary genomics project incorporates phylogenetics, molecular evolution, and computer science with state-of-the-art techniques and equipment.  Results will be published in scientific journals and presented at society meetings and in public forums.  DNA sequence data will be made publicly available through submission to the GenBank database.  Finally, this work addresses questions of relevance to agricultural crops, many of which have polyploid origins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
