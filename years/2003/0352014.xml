<AbstractNarration>Large-scale power outages occurred on August 14, 2003 covering a 10,000 square-mile&lt;br/&gt;area involving 50 million people in more than 10 states in Midwest and northeastern part of this&lt;br/&gt;nation and southern Canada. A number of major centers of population such as Metropolitan&lt;br/&gt;New York were impacted severely causing human inconvenience and miseries of all kind while&lt;br/&gt;power recovery effort gradually took effect. The disaster may have been caused by, as many&lt;br/&gt;suspected, malfunction of a critical power component under excessive power demand in the&lt;br/&gt;summer heat. It might take some time, however, to identify the exact cause of this worst power&lt;br/&gt;blackout in the history of USA.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this exploratory research is to acquire and archive potentially perishable&lt;br/&gt;data related to the outages. We are particularly interested in the way in which the outage initiated&lt;br/&gt;and cascaded throughout the power grids. The data to be collected will span a spectrum of&lt;br/&gt;mechanical, electrical and socio-economic impact with significant emphasis on the data that are&lt;br/&gt;needed for grid reliability evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;PI of this proposed research studied extensively on reliability of utility networks and&lt;br/&gt;power grids to resist seismic conditions under which similar outages could happen. In these&lt;br/&gt;studies, transmission networks and grids, involving Los Angels Department of Water and&lt;br/&gt;Power.s (LADWP.s) and Memphis Light, Gas, and Water.s (MLGWP.s) systems were used as&lt;br/&gt;living laboratories. These studies were based upon the analytical simulation of power flow, using&lt;br/&gt;Electric Power Research Institute.s Interactive Power Flow (IPFlow) code, which is the industry&lt;br/&gt;standard, for realistic performance evaluation of Western Electric Coordinating Council.s&lt;br/&gt;(WECC.s) power grid and of Memphis transmission network.&lt;br/&gt;Initially, the study was motivated by an accident in August 1996 in Oregon, in which a&lt;br/&gt;tree came into contact with a segment of a high-voltage aerial power line, disabling its&lt;br/&gt;transmission capability. The result was a wide-spread blackout in several states and cities,&lt;br/&gt;including part of Los Angeles. In fact, the research demonstrated that a local disturbance and&lt;br/&gt;instability can propagate almost instantly far away to remote locations. The research became&lt;br/&gt;more seriously significant after the tragic September 11 event from homeland security point of&lt;br/&gt;view and has just added another layer of relevance since the August 14, 2003 power outage.&lt;br/&gt;This is because disablement can be man-made, accidental or malicious, and cause a devastatingly&lt;br/&gt;negative impact on socio-economic welfare of the directly affected regions immediately and of&lt;br/&gt;the nation in the long run.&lt;br/&gt;PI.s experience and expertise plays a crucial role in identifying the data that are&lt;br/&gt;indispensable and therefore should be collected for the ensuing reliability analysis of the physical&lt;br/&gt;components, utility networks and power grids. Since the preparedness for the emergency of the&lt;br/&gt;utility organizations, individually and in collaboration, is critical in minimizing the consequence&lt;br/&gt;of outages, the data will include the record of implemented organizational response processes.&lt;br/&gt;Beyond these, data are needed to record how transportation, water and other lifeline systems and&lt;br/&gt;business/industrial sectors behaved under the interruption of power supply. The estimated&lt;br/&gt;economic losses will be updated as more information emerges, although the estimation will be&lt;br/&gt;somewhat speculative within the first year after the event.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact of this research is that it will contribute to significant scientific advances&lt;br/&gt;in predictive systems analysis methods and protective countermeasures, and it will benefit tens of&lt;br/&gt;millions of customers of the utility systems, and local, regional and national economy.&lt;br/&gt;Pedagogically the research project is truly beneficial in training and encouraging junior&lt;br/&gt;researchers to become more interested in the electric power related research where lack of&lt;br/&gt;research talents has been conspicuous.</AbstractNarration>
