<AbstractNarration>Investigations of Computational Optimization in Brachytherapy Cancer&lt;br/&gt;Treatment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings together researchers in computational optimization &lt;br/&gt;and medicine to address the fundamental problem of treatment planning for &lt;br/&gt;brachytherapy treatment of cancer. The project involves four avenues of &lt;br/&gt;investigation: 1) Design of realistic and practical mathematical models &lt;br/&gt;based on mixed integer programming (MIP) technology to describe the &lt;br/&gt;physical planning of brachytherapy, which involves the determination of an&lt;br/&gt;``optimal'' configuration of radioactive sources to be implanted in/near &lt;br/&gt;the tumor. 2) Theoretical investigation of the underlying polyhedral &lt;br/&gt;structure of the MIP models via the construction of conflict hypergraphs. &lt;br/&gt;Associated polyhedral implications will be exploited to develop and &lt;br/&gt;implement separation algorithms to assist in the solution process.   &lt;br/&gt;3)  Develop new computational tools aimed at solving the difficult &lt;br/&gt;dense MIP instances from this class of problems, as well as from other &lt;br/&gt;applications. Computational approaches include matrix reduction&lt;br/&gt;techniques, penalty branching strategies, aggregate branching which &lt;br/&gt;focuses on reduced-cost and multiple branches with sets of variables instead &lt;br/&gt;of variable dichotomy, and generation of strong cutting planes from &lt;br/&gt;hypergraphic structures. 4) Integration of the mathematical models and &lt;br/&gt;computational engine into an expert planning system for use in the &lt;br/&gt;operating room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of the research will lead to important theoretical results &lt;br/&gt;related to integer programming through the hypergrahic constructs; &lt;br/&gt;it will lead to computational advances for solving dense MIP instances, &lt;br/&gt;a characteristic rather different from most industrial applications, &lt;br/&gt;but arising commonly in medical diagnosis and treatment planning problems; &lt;br/&gt;and it will improve the ability to treat patients in the best possible&lt;br/&gt;way. Furthermore, the resulting treatment planning system will serve as a &lt;br/&gt;research tool to push the frontier of understanding for brachytherapy &lt;br/&gt;treatment, opening up the possibility of conducting clinical&lt;br/&gt;investigations which require unbiased plans to be produced within a &lt;br/&gt;short time frame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational outreach involves developing teaching materials related&lt;br/&gt;to the project for undergraduate and graduate students in engineering and &lt;br/&gt;in the medical domain. It also involves training of 2 Ph.D. students in&lt;br/&gt;this multidisciplinary research involving optimization, algorithmic design &lt;br/&gt;and cancer treatment.  The Ph.D. research will focus on theoretical and &lt;br/&gt;computational optimization, and in particular, on issues related to the &lt;br/&gt;project herein. Undergraduates and minorities will be involved in the &lt;br/&gt;research experience through undergraduate courses and regular premed and &lt;br/&gt;minority student mentoring. Part of the research project will also be &lt;br/&gt;disseminated in the lectures on information and biotechnology in the &lt;br/&gt;course ``Cancer Biology and Biotechnology'', developed recently by a group &lt;br/&gt;of interdisciplinary faculty researchers at Georgia Tech with a focus on &lt;br/&gt;multi-faceted approaches for advancing cancer technology. Mention of this &lt;br/&gt;new educational effort highlighting applications of engineering technology &lt;br/&gt;in medical/oncological research will be included in possible panel&lt;br/&gt;discussions and in the recruitment of high school students.</AbstractNarration>
