<AbstractNarration>The University of Texas at El Paso will be hosting a ten-week summer Research Experience for Undergraduates Program during the summers of 2004 - 2009.  The main goal of the program is to provide ten participating students with a nurturing and exciting environment in which to obtain the tools, information, and research experience that encourages the pursuit of graduate careers.  Students are required to engage in a research project under the supervision of a faculty mentor.  Students will be trained to address questions in various areas of basic biology utilizing molecular and cellular biology techniques.  Students also attend two weekly meetings, a "Career Development Workshop" and "Careers in Science Seminar Series".  The first workshop strives to provide the students with the tools to enhance both their oral and written communication skills and the second seminar series introduces students to careers in science.  Throughout the summer, several social activities are also organized to help students get acquainted with each other, with the University, and with the surrounding area.  At the conclusion of the program the students will present their research accomplishments in both written and oral reports.  In recognition of student efforts, participants will be funded to present their research at one regional or national conference during the regular academic year.  Although not strictly limited to this geographical area, we will focus our recruiting efforts on students who are from the southwest U.S.- Mexico border region.  Students in underrepresented minority groups are particularly encouraged to apply.  For more information, visit http://www.reu.utep.edu or contact Dr. Garza at kgarza@utep.edu.</AbstractNarration>
