<AbstractNarration>The unprecedented explosion in the volume of readily accessible data in &lt;br/&gt;recent years, although highly desirable, comes at a heavy price - it is now &lt;br/&gt;considerably more difficult to locate the answer to a specific question, or to &lt;br/&gt;find patterns and correlations that are central to a phenomenon. The PI's &lt;br/&gt;propose to study general-purpose clustering as a solution to the problem of &lt;br/&gt;locating relevant information and organizing it in an intelligible way. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal falls into two tracks. The first track is to develop measures &lt;br/&gt;and criteria that accurately re the quality of a clustering. The PI's have &lt;br/&gt;initiated work in this direction, and plan to build a theory of clustering criteria firmly grounded in the intuition of practitioners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second track is the design of efficient algorithms to find near-optimal &lt;br/&gt;clustering under the right measures. The PI's propose to develop algorithms &lt;br/&gt;based on the so-called "spectral methods" and other techniques. They plan &lt;br/&gt;to make them efficient by the use of random (non-uniform) sampling. The &lt;br/&gt;PI's also plan to implement some of the algorithms and empirically evaluate &lt;br/&gt;them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's propose to ensure that any positive impact from their research &lt;br/&gt;is maximized by (a) widely disseminating the results via conferences and &lt;br/&gt;also by inviting other researchers to discuss the ideas, (b) by making the &lt;br/&gt;preliminary implementations of clustering algorithms available.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
