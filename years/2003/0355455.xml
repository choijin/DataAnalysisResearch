<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0355455&lt;br/&gt;Title: Far fields and Remote sensing&lt;br/&gt;PI: John Sylvester (University of Washington)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We study inverse scattering and inverse source problems for the&lt;br/&gt;Helmholtz equation, Maxwell's equations, and other PDE's. Our efforts&lt;br/&gt;focus on identifying those characteristics of size and location that&lt;br/&gt;can be computed from data sets that are much too small to uniquely&lt;br/&gt;determine the source or scatterer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Born approximation to time harmonic scattering is the Fourier&lt;br/&gt;Transform. In this approximation, one such data set would be the&lt;br/&gt;restriction of the Fourier transform of a function to a sphere . In&lt;br/&gt;this case, it is impossible to find the support of the function from&lt;br/&gt;this data, but we can find a smallest convex set, a set which must&lt;br/&gt;belong to the convex hull of the support of any function with this&lt;br/&gt;restricted Fourier transform. This set can be stably calculated, even&lt;br/&gt;from noisy data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For other data sets, there are other "minimal supports", where the&lt;br/&gt;definition of "support" depends on the data set. We seek to discover&lt;br/&gt;the correct notion of support for different data sets and different&lt;br/&gt;models. In the presence of a priori information (e.g. polygonal shape&lt;br/&gt;or positivity), these minimal sets may even describe true supports. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this project is to develop and improve algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;acoustical and electro-magnetic remote sensing (e.g. radar, sonar,&lt;br/&gt;ultrasound).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical theory of inverse scattering includes powerful&lt;br/&gt;methods for deducing the material properties of an object from data&lt;br/&gt;measured in a remote sensing experiment. However, there are many&lt;br/&gt;practical applications where it is impossible to make observations at&lt;br/&gt;sufficiently many frequencies and angles to apply these methods. In&lt;br/&gt;this project, we focus on understanding those aspects of size and&lt;br/&gt;location that can be unequivocally identified from limited data sets,&lt;br/&gt;and developing algorithms to stably compute these sizes and locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
