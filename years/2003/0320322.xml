    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed to the development of a single-wafer spin processing module for high-speed ozone-water-based resist and residue removal in semiconductor device manufacturing. A new ozone-water process which is unique in promising practical throughputs in single-wafer processing configurations has been developed. Experimental and analytical work has shown there is an opportunity to significantly increase the etch rate and etch uniformity of this process with improvements in the design of the spin processing module. Four goals are established for this Phase I: (1) Measure the radial dependence of the etch rate as a function of key process parameters using a standard commercial spin processing module; (2) Develop a computational fluid dynamic model of the module; (3) Validate the model by comparing the measured etch rate to that predicted by the model; and, (4) Use the model to make a preliminary evaluation of promising new spin processor designs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single-substrate wet processing has applications in wafer processing, magnetic disc manufacturing, optical disc manufacturing, and flat panel display manufacturing. The market for wafer wet processing equipment alone is projected to reach 3.1 billion dollars by 2005. The single-wafer wet processing segment is growing and is expected to be between 300 million to 450 million dollars by 2005.</AbstractNarration>
