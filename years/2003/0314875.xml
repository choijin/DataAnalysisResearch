    <AbstractNarration>The proposed project presents a new, creative approach to address student understanding of related material in different courses through the use of a multi-semester interwoven project to reinforce basic STEM material critical to solving engineering problems. A strong laboratory component with multimedia and hands-on application of STEM material will reinforce theoretical concepts. &lt;br/&gt;Through the use of a common problem for dynamic systems that spans across several courses (basic math skills, laboratory measurement and model development to predict dynamic system response), students are better equipped to solve a real dynamic system problem which requires the use of many STEM tools. A strong laboratory component measuring a real system using a web-based data acquisition system requires the students to "think outside the box" and apply theoretical concepts through practical hands-on learning. An open ended project forces the students to take ownership of learning material which integrates several themes and underlying STEM material promoting a life-long, self-learning process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interwoven project contains basic core STEM material that is easily transferable to all engineering disciplines as well as other institutions. Since the project will &lt;br/&gt;result in educational material online, geographic, ethnic and gender barriers will be overcome and will allow for universal access to the material. This multi-semester, interwoven project concept with an online experiment is the salient feature of this program; integration of STEM material is accomplished in a relevant, meaningful way for student comprehension and retention.</AbstractNarration>
