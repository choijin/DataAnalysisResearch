<AbstractNarration>This project addresses mechanisms that enhance thin film growth kinetics resulting from exposure to high intensity, ultrafast laser pulses (120 fs) during growth. Several methods will be utilized to assess atomistic processes and mechanisms. These include the use of marker layers to directly measure structural details and their spatial variations (via transmission electron microscopy-TEM), in-situ surface methods (LEED/RHEED/AES), as well as a variety of other chemical and structural probes (x-ray diffraction, XEDS, EELS, AFM). An additional technique, a NanoThermometer, will be explored to characterize thermal effects as a function of distance from the surface of the material being irradiated. The NanoThermometer concept is a grown-in layer of a different material that diffuses in a well-characterized manner. By measuring the diffusion length of such a layer, it is anticipated that an "effective temperature" for mass transport can be inferred. &lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;This project addresses basic materials research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance, and places emphasis on the integration of research and education. The research program provides excellent opportunities for hands-on experience in the use of sophisticated scientific equipment. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the synthesis, processing, and characterization of electronic materials. This project also provides a synergistic vehicle for interaction with minority students during the summer through the complementary NASA/Sharp program at Michigan.&lt;br/&gt;***        &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
