<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to define methodology to facilitate the growth of engineered cartilage tissue for use in a multi-well culture system for drug discovery.  Culture systems, which are currently available to study the affect of potential therapeutic factors in degenerative joint disease, are less than ideal for shedding light upon the anabolic and catabolic processes which are taking place.  The purpose of this proposal is 1) to define culture conditions for the de novo formation of engineered cartilage tissue, 2) to adapt the methodology for the preparation in vitro of cartilage tissue with defined properties for use in a multi-well culture system, and 3) to develop a system of standard operating procedures and quality control measures for tissue production.  Engineered cartilage tissue will offer an alternative to expensive animal studies and provide the option of utilizing human tissue.  The studies outlined here will test the influence of factors on the anabolic and catabolic aspects of cartilage matrix turnover and cartilage matrix maturation.  This work will ideally lead to an inexpensive commercially available semi-automated cartilage culture system promoting efficient drug discovery and efficacy and toxicology testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project will be for use by researchers in the field of joint and bone therapies.  Major pharmaceutical companies and research institutes (e.g. NIH) could use the cartilage culture system to identify and test new drugs for cartilage repair and growth. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
