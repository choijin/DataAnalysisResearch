<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this gathering is to make a cost-benefit analysis of sequencing the tomato genome as a reference for the family Solanaceae and other closely related plant families. An international contingency of scientists will be invited who can address: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The current status of tomato-potato research including aspects of plant biology for which Solanaceous species are a preferred model;&lt;br/&gt;2.  The potential impact of sequencing the tomato genome on research in the Solanaceae specifically and plant biology in general; &lt;br/&gt;3.  What sequencing strategy might be best in terms of cost and utility; &lt;br/&gt;4.  To what extent and through what mechanisms might such a sequencing project be conducted as part of a multinational consortium; &lt;br/&gt;5. How might information derived from such a project be managed, curated, and made available to the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will be held in November of 2003 in Washington DC and will include representatives from academia, government and the private sector coming from (but not necessarily limited to) China, France, Germany, Holland, Israel, Italy, Spain, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Currently, all of these countries have active genomics research activities in one or more Solanaceous species or have expressed interest in participating in a sequencing project of the tomato genome. In addition to individuals actively working on solanaceous species, we will also invite representatives from other plant genome sequencing projects (e.g. Arabidopsis, rice, Medicago) so that they might provide insights/advice into the organization/execution of such a project. The meeting will last one day and will result in a summary document that will be distributed to all participants as well as any other interested parties.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
