<AbstractNarration>Proper characterization of elastic anisotropy can help understand the &lt;br/&gt;causes, mechanisms, and consequences of tectonic deformation in the &lt;br/&gt;upper mantle and in other regions of the Earth's deep interior and &lt;br/&gt;beneath regions of active tectonics.  Unfortunately, our &lt;br/&gt;understanding of seismic anisotropy is still unsatisfactory and &lt;br/&gt;interpretation of seismological diagnostics of anisotropy (such as &lt;br/&gt;shear wave birefringence) is often ambiguous.   Gaining full &lt;br/&gt;understanding of seismic anisotropy and flow beneath complex tectonic &lt;br/&gt;regions has, therefore, remained an outstanding challenge of modern &lt;br/&gt;seismology and geodynamics.  In collaboration with colleagues in &lt;br/&gt;France, scientists from MIT and Colorado School of Mines propose to &lt;br/&gt;meet this challenge through the explicit integration of powerful data &lt;br/&gt;sets and forward and inverse modeling tools.  In particular, they aim &lt;br/&gt;to improve the understanding of 3-D seismic anisotropy and tectonic &lt;br/&gt;deformation in the upper mantle near subduction zones, which are &lt;br/&gt;tectonic regions that are of particular societal interest because of &lt;br/&gt;their association with significant volcanic and seismic hazard.  They &lt;br/&gt;will focus on Japan, where geophysical instrumentation is dense &lt;br/&gt;because of the need for the continuous monitoring of seismic and &lt;br/&gt;volcanic activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data from these dense networks can be obtained through the internet, &lt;br/&gt;thanks to scientists in Japan, and the MIT-CSM team has already &lt;br/&gt;assembled a large data set from 64 broadband seismic stations. &lt;br/&gt;Through examination of ~12,000 individual seismograms, they compiled &lt;br/&gt;a database of ~1330 high-quality shear wave splitting measurements &lt;br/&gt;for S, SKS/SKKS, and ScS, and more will be added later.  They propose &lt;br/&gt;to improve the quantitative interpretation of the splitting maps by &lt;br/&gt;combining two complementary approaches.  First, they wish to extend &lt;br/&gt;their numerical modeling of upper mantle flow from 2.5 to 3-D, &lt;br/&gt;incorporating (evolving) velocity boundary conditions and realistic &lt;br/&gt;geometries and rheologies. Second, they plan to develop a novel &lt;br/&gt;technique for tomographic inversion of the observed shear wave &lt;br/&gt;polarizations and split times.  The flow models will be used to &lt;br/&gt;design the parameterization and regularization of the inversion, and, &lt;br/&gt;in turn, the seismic imaging results will be used to update the flow &lt;br/&gt;models.  Such an explicitly cross-disciplinary approach will not only &lt;br/&gt;yield new insight into the 3-D anisotropy and flow field beneath &lt;br/&gt;Japan.  Indeed, the powerful new tools and concepts for data &lt;br/&gt;analysis, modeling, and interpretation can also be applied to data &lt;br/&gt;from such new initiatives as USArray/Earthscope.</AbstractNarration>
