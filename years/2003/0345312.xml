<AbstractNarration>Determination of paleoslopes in ancient fluvial systems has potentially broad, but&lt;br/&gt;largely untapped, application to quantitatively constraining the history of tectonics and&lt;br/&gt;paleoclimate in continental sequences. The objective of this project is to, first, flesh out a&lt;br/&gt;new approach to calculating paleoslope and associated information, such as water and&lt;br/&gt;sediment flux, from sandy braided stream deposits. The second objective is to apply the&lt;br/&gt;method to the Kayenta Formation (Jurassic) on the Colorado Plateau to demonstrate the&lt;br/&gt;utility of the method in reconstructing aspects of long-term climate change from the&lt;br/&gt;ancient record of fluvial deposits found on a regional scale. The key to reconstructing&lt;br/&gt;paleoclimate as proposed here is to estimate paleowater flux from estimates of paleoflow&lt;br/&gt;depth (as determined from bar forms) and calculations of paleoslope. Paleoslope&lt;br/&gt;calculation follows a novel approach utilizing the Rouse Number, an indicator of grainsize&lt;br/&gt;fractionation between bed load and suspended load in water flows. The key tool to&lt;br/&gt;applying the method is the use of high-precision, rapid, grain-size determinations&lt;br/&gt;available using equipment housed at M.I.T. Preliminary results show the approach works&lt;br/&gt;well in the modern and yields remarkably consistent comparisons with the Kayenta&lt;br/&gt;Formation. Theoretical modeling of climate impact on fluvial systems suggests that longterm&lt;br/&gt;climate change may produce a very different stratigraphic record than short-term&lt;br/&gt;(Milankovich scale) changes. Hence application of the method to the ancient not only&lt;br/&gt;provides an example of what the method can do, but will help answer specific questions&lt;br/&gt;regarding how the long-term change from dry to wet to dry conditions represented by the&lt;br/&gt;Wingate-Kayenta-Navajo formations of the Glen Canyon Group, respectively, affect&lt;br/&gt;river systems. By systematically applying the methodology to the Kayenta Formation, we&lt;br/&gt;will obtain statistically significant probability distributions of aspects of paleoflow (slope&lt;br/&gt;and water flux) that can be compared between sites within the unit to show how river&lt;br/&gt;systems changed down basin and over time. Such an application will demonstrate the&lt;br/&gt;utility of the paleohydraulic reconstruction approach to paleoclimate reconstruction that&lt;br/&gt;can be applied to other sandy fluvial deposits in the ancient record.&lt;br/&gt;The broader aspects of the study include training a female Ph.D. student at the&lt;br/&gt;University of Wyoming in quantitative methodologies of sedimentation. An&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate at M.I.T. will also be trained in field and laboratory techniques as part of&lt;br/&gt;this project. In addition, the research includes a tie to an NCED (National Center for&lt;br/&gt;Earth-Surface Dynamics) facility, allowing for outreach of this NSF-funded Science and&lt;br/&gt;Technology Center.</AbstractNarration>
