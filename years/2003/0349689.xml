    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II will develop and commercialize electrochemically operated devices that will revolutionize the oral hygiene industry by providing an on-demand generation of mouthwash in a portable device and in an irrigator. The mouthwash generated in these devices will be effective in controlling halitosis and dental plaque and will also provide tooth whitening. In the Phase I study, all of the proposed objectives and specified criteria of success were accomplished to amply establish the proof of concept and feasibility of the project. In Phase II, further optimization of the parameters will be followed by the design and fabrication of prototypes in conjunction with a prominent company dealing with turnkey manufacturing, and the testing of 100 portable units in a clinical setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial impact of this project will be in the area of oral hygiene products. It is broadly estimated that up to 85 million Americans have halitosis, and over 35 million suffer from periodontal disease. Thus, the cost effective devices to be developed in this project are expected to have a large market potential in the $ 4.7 billion oral care industry.</AbstractNarration>
