<AbstractNarration>This is a planning grant for department level reform in the Industrial Engineering Department of the University of Pittsburgh.  This project addresses an important and pressing issue in engineering education - how to develop a comprehensive, integrated curriculum that is (1) pedagogically sound, (2) thoroughly prepares graduating engineering students for industrial practice and graduate school, and (3) trains them to readily recognize and apply their engineering background to solve unstructured problems, both locally and beyond US borders. In particular, the focus is on the Industrial Engineering (IE) curriculum but our results could be extended and adapted to other engineering disciplines.  The approach to curriculum reform that contains four overarching objectives, namely (1) the integration of concepts across the curriculum; (2) teaching students to synthesize different concepts to solve unstructured problems; (3) providing problem solving methods and strategies within a societal framework that allows for their application within a local as well as a global context; and (4) creating a portable development methodology that can be readily adapted to other engineering disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is based on a sound understanding of prior work on IE curriculum reform, and is conceived and organized with input from a variety of sources, including faculty, students and practicing engineers. The proposal defines the core knowledge areas that constitute "Industrial Engineering science" and addresses the vital need for students to see how to integrate different concepts in solving complex real world problems. The proposal also outlines a plan to emphasize the synthesis of IE concepts/methods with broader engineering proficiencies in order to solve open-ended, unstructured problems. The model we propose for integrating and synthesizing technical skills and life-long proficiencies into the curriculum is based on two unique aspects: reinforcement and "just-in-time" concept integration. The proposal outlines a plan to ensure that students receive greater exposure to and a better understanding of today's global business environment. The plan also ensures that our graduates will have the life-long engineering capabilities such as business practice skills; skills to analyze data and deal with uncertainty; proficiency with information systems and programming; design, innovation and problem solving skills; and communication and teamwork skills, in order to successfully apply what they learn. Additionally, a plan is provided for evaluating both the quality of the approach and how feedback will be used to improve student learning. Results of this planning grant are portable to other curriculum planning contexts - within other IE programs of a similar size; scaled up to larger or down to smaller IE programs; and to other engineering programs. Plans are also provided for broad dissemination of our work.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
