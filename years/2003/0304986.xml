<AbstractNarration>The conference is concerned with the theory of computability and&lt;br/&gt;complexity in analysis, physical sciences, and engineering over the real&lt;br/&gt;numbers, which is built on the Turing machine model. This research is an &lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary area between applied analysis and computability and &lt;br/&gt;complexity theory, and sometimes also involves works in numerical &lt;br/&gt;analysis. The goal of the research is to understand the laws of real number &lt;br/&gt;computation, the computability content of existence results in analysis, and &lt;br/&gt;the computational complexity of computable operators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computability brings to mind computers, which are playing an ever larger&lt;br/&gt;role in our society. Computers operate on finite strings of digits.&lt;br/&gt;However most mathematical models describe continuous problems ranging&lt;br/&gt;from physical phenomena such as electromagnetism and sound waves, to&lt;br/&gt;engineering applications such as bridge designs and air flows around&lt;br/&gt;airplanes, to financial predictions such as expected investment returns.&lt;br/&gt;Continuous models are based fundamentally on the concept of real&lt;br/&gt;numbers. Although a large portion of computer resources is devoted to&lt;br/&gt;compute the solutions of such continuous problems, real number&lt;br/&gt;computation is not as well understood as it should be. There still &lt;br/&gt;exists a big gap between the continuous nature of problem from the &lt;br/&gt;physical world and the computability and complexity theory of discrete &lt;br/&gt;structures. The explosion of Ariane 5 rocket on June 4, 1996, is a drastic &lt;br/&gt;example. The problem at the center is that computers operate on finite &lt;br/&gt;strings of digits  while the real numbers are infinite mathematical objects.&lt;br/&gt;The increasing demand for reliable as well as fast software requires a&lt;br/&gt;better understanding of real number computation. Computable analysis is&lt;br/&gt;a theory which studies the laws of real number computation. Its goal is&lt;br/&gt;to bridge the gap between analysis, the mathematical theory of real&lt;br/&gt;numbers, on the one end, and computability on the other. It studies&lt;br/&gt;which computations in analysis, physical sciences, and engineering are&lt;br/&gt;possible and which are not. The research lets us understand why a&lt;br/&gt;problem cannot be solved on computers, or provides us with a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the computability content of a continuous problem and&lt;br/&gt;thus better tools for constructing more efficient algorithms. The&lt;br/&gt;research outputs of the conference series are substantial. The series&lt;br/&gt;has produced five volumes of proceedings containing more than 100&lt;br/&gt;(refereed) papers ranging from theoretical investigations of&lt;br/&gt;computability and complexity in analysis to new implementations of exact&lt;br/&gt;real arithmetics as well as further developments of existing&lt;br/&gt;software packages.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
