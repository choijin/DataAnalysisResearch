<AbstractNarration>Geology (42) The Department of Geosciences at Fort Lewis College has one of the best natural laboratories in the world, but the program lacks an analytical instrument for chemical analyses of rock, soil, or water samples. The capability of the ICP-OES to routinely measure a spectrum of elements in various media makes it the ideal instrument for use in geochemical and environmental curriculum and research. We are adapting exercises developed by Professor Kurt Hollocher at Union College (http://www.union.edu/PUBLIC/GEODEPT/hollocher/pedagogy/mineral_dissolution.htm and http://www.union.edu/PUBLIC/GEODEPT/hollocher/pedagogy/partition_coefficients.htm).  Acquisition of an ICP-OES is enriching our program by: 1) allowing the development of field- and laboratory-based analytical projects in introductory and advanced-level undergraduate courses in geology and environmental studies; 2) expanding the opportunities for independent undergraduate-student research in these fields; 3) allowing future K-12 educators to collect and analyze geochemical data in courses required for Education majors and use this information to develop science curriculum; 4) giving students opportunities to incorporate geochemical data into local research projects, both in classes and senior thesis research; and 5) providing increased opportunity for faculty development at a small public baccalaureate-granting institution. The broader impacts of this study include the: 1) increased opportunities for a significant Native American and Hispanic population to participate in undergraduate research throughout the curriculum, from class projects to independent research; 2) use of the instrument by future K- 12 educators in required courses for secondary education degrees, and 3) involvement of undergraduate students in a greater variety of scientific studies to further develop the philosophy and process of scientific discovery. Finally, because this is the only analytical instrument of this type in the Four Corners region, it is serving the larger community, including community colleges such as Dine College and San Juan Community College, local K-12 educators, environmental consulting firms, and the oil and gas industry.</AbstractNarration>
