<AbstractNarration>The goals of this project are to enroll and graduate more academically talented and financially disadvantaged students who are majoring in computer science, engineering, mathematics, and computer technology. An emphasis is placed on recruiting and retaining underserved groups. The goal is being accomplished with objectives focused on recruitment and retention, academic support and enhanced educational opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;1.  Objective 1 increases the number of computer science, engineering, and mathematics (CSEM) majors with the award of 166 scholarships over a four-year period. Recruiting strategies build on a successful NSF funded recruitment model, The IT Pathway, developed to target females and other underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;2.  Objective 2 focuses on retention of scholars and includes a campus support team of CSEM faculty, financial aid directors, academic and career counselors, and learning lab instructors. Campus faculty advisors monitor student performance and progress and develop individualized early intervention strategies, as needed. &lt;br/&gt;3.  Opportunities for students to expand the scope of their educational experience are offered with objective 3. Students participate in planned business/industry visits, CSEM forums with business/industry/university professionals, engage in career exploration and attend professional meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the program is the design to increase the number of scholars pursuing CSEM fields of study and persisting to program completion or bachelor degree completion. By networking cohort CSEM students with business/industry/university professionals, connections extend beyond the classroom. These interactions and participation in professional meetings advance CSEM knowledge regionally and nationally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project are being realized from the various methods of academic support planned to ensure students meet their educational goals. The academic support system for scholars is built around differing modes of teaching and  learning, teamwork, networking, on-site observation, field research and technology. Students and faculty explore options to traditional methods of learning to assist students achieve. In an effort to increase the participation of females and other underserved groups, recruitment for scholars and the selection process has been designed to identify and attract underrepresented groups to a CSEM field of study.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
