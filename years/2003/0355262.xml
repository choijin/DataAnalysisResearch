    <AbstractNarration>The study of helium-3 through electron scattering attempts to expose&lt;br/&gt;nuclear physics and its underlying forces by breaking apart one of the&lt;br/&gt;simplest nuclei, a bound state of one neutron and two protons, also&lt;br/&gt;known as helium-3. The lowest bound nuclei are hydrogen, deuterium (&lt;br/&gt;a bound neutron and proton), tritium (one proton and two neutrons) and&lt;br/&gt;then helium-3. Because deuterium has only two nucleons, it is an odd&lt;br/&gt;nucleus and does not represent standard nuclear material well. Tritium&lt;br/&gt;is a difficult to work with, leaving helium-3 as the simplest nucleus&lt;br/&gt;that has sufficiently interesting dynamics that are believed to exist in&lt;br/&gt;larger nuclei. By breaking apart these nuclei using an electron beam,&lt;br/&gt;the nucleus can be reconstructed from data taken and then tested against&lt;br/&gt;leading theories in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By working in two locations, the United States Naval Academy (USNA)&lt;br/&gt;and MIT, students can be trained in the handling of the helium-3 nuclei&lt;br/&gt;at USNA, and then later complete their education by working at the&lt;br/&gt;MIT-Bates laboratory during the Summer months. The BLAST&lt;br/&gt;(Bates Large Acceptance Spectrometer Toroid) experiment provides these&lt;br/&gt;students the chance to participate on a world-class experiment while&lt;br/&gt;exposing them to new concepts and instrumentation. The facilities to&lt;br/&gt;perform experiements of this caliber are unique and only a handful are&lt;br/&gt;in operation around the world. The specialized features of the&lt;br/&gt;experiment BLAST are that the electron beam and helium-3 targets are&lt;br/&gt;both polarized in a magnetic field such that new information about the&lt;br/&gt;nucleus is revealed. One particular quantity sought after is the&lt;br/&gt;electric moment of the neutron, dubbed G_E_n, which describes how the&lt;br/&gt;neutron begins to appear as an electric moment as higher and higher&lt;br/&gt;energies come to bear on the neutron. For this purpose, the BLAST&lt;br/&gt;experiment will use both deuterium as well as helium-3 as &lt;br/&gt;targets for the electrons to strike the neutrons held within &lt;br/&gt;the nuclei.</AbstractNarration>
