<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is designed to look at the topographic evolution of a portion of the central Basin and Range in the western United States during a period of late Cenozoic extensional tectonism. A variety of paleoaltimeters, geologic studies, and geophysical models have alternately predicted that the western United States has experienced either significant late Cenozoic uplift or substantial late Cenozoic lowering due to, or at least synchronous with, large magnitude intracontinental tectonism. In part these disparate results may be due to the geologic complexity of the western United States, and the fact that many of the study areas may have undergone differing tectonic histories in late Cenozoic time. The central Basin and Range province, between Las Vegas and the Sierra Nevada is an ideal locality to study the paleotopographic evolution of the western United States because of 1) the wide spread and detailed geologic mapping that has been completed, resulting in a fairly complete palinspastic reconstruction of Tertiary extension; 2) recent passive and active seismic and other geophysical experiments in the region which delineate the crustal structure and 3) studies that have examined the evolution of the sub-Basin and Range lithosphere through this same time period using xenoliths and the geochemistry of volcanic rocks. A newly developed paleoaltimeter based on basalt flow vesicles is well suited for approaching this problem due to the extensive coverage of basalts in this study area, the broad age range of the flows, and the desert environment which keeps them relatively fresh. The PI proposes to sample approximately 40 sites for paleoaltimetry across a 300 km transect from the Sierra Nevada to the Spring Mountains, Nevada and determine the paleoelevations of these sites from late Miocene to Pliocene or Recent time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study has broad impacts for several reasons; first it bears strongly on the hypothesis that late Cenozoic epierogeny has affected climate, both in the United States and globally. The work also ties together years of work in developing map view palinspastic reconstructions of Basin and Range extension by adding a third dimension to the deformation, and finally, this study will be the first broad tectonic study using the newly developed altimeter. Collaborations with both the developers of the altimeter and the analytical facilities which process the samples should result in a streamlined process for future use of this altimeter, as well as testing and demonstrating its use in tectonic studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
