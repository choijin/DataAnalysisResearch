<AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims at developing a model of cortical oscillation in the brain as they are&lt;br/&gt;believed to encode in a precise way all the different brain-state dynamics. Nowadays, we are able&lt;br/&gt;to obtain measurements of neural activities at multiple scales starting at the molecular level with&lt;br/&gt;detailed chemical interactions, to cellular levels with localized recordings of synaptic currents and&lt;br/&gt;firing dynamic, to networks with recordings from neuronal assemblies, to systems with recordings&lt;br/&gt;of brain activation from multiple cortical areas.&lt;br/&gt;The model will have the following attributes: 1) it is consistent with physiological hypotheses&lt;br/&gt;and experimental recordings under specific brain states, 2) it is hierarchical, describing the brain&lt;br/&gt;activity at multiple resolutions as well as describing brain state transitions as information-state&lt;br/&gt;refinements and 3) it is amenable to efficient simulations.&lt;br/&gt;This model will further our understanding of several phenomena evident in the cortical dy-&lt;br/&gt;namics of the brain: 1) it will explain the recruitment process the brain undergoes in terms of&lt;br/&gt;synchronization, 2) it will explain the robustness of the synchronization process, 3) it will explain&lt;br/&gt;the smoothness in the dynamics of brain-state transitions, 4) it will explain the relationship be-&lt;br/&gt;tween the number of synchronized cells and the frequency of synchronization, 5) it will explain&lt;br/&gt;the dynamics and integration of the top-down dynamic evolution based on internal stimuli and&lt;br/&gt;the bottom-up processing of sensory information, and 5) it will explain the timing properties and&lt;br/&gt;efficiency in execution.&lt;br/&gt;The derived detailed cortical model will then be integrated with our existing system-level&lt;br/&gt;model of the motor control system. In particular, we aim to study the role of oscillations in&lt;br/&gt;information transfer across constituent cortical subsystems, and to subsequently identify unique&lt;br/&gt;signatures of motion planning in scalp EEG recordings.&lt;br/&gt;Models of cortical oscillations will have utility in various ways. On one hand, if used as&lt;br/&gt;predictors, they can point to important experimental activities designed to invalidate the models,&lt;br/&gt;which will result in a substantial progress of our understanding of the brain processes. On the&lt;br/&gt;other hand, these models are critical as a diagnostic tool, for example, such models can be used&lt;br/&gt;to detect seizures and brain tumors, to calibrate drug action during anesthesia, to study cognitive&lt;br/&gt;task signatures, and to study mental retardation. Finally, they can provide the appropriate&lt;br/&gt;dynamic description for a proper design of neural prosthesis.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed research provides a bridge between neurophysiology, neu-&lt;br/&gt;roanatomy, and engineering through the development of a consistent computational model of&lt;br/&gt;cortical activities. The research is conducted by a multi-disciplinary group with expertise in&lt;br/&gt;both modeling, analysis and design of systems in general, as well as modeling and analysis of&lt;br/&gt;the nervous system in particular, with a track record of collaboration through NSF support. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research will be augmented with an experimental component through our ongoing motor&lt;br/&gt;system control collaboration with workers in Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact: Beyond the utility mentioned above, this research is systematically closing the&lt;br/&gt;gap between the fragmented research on understanding the nervous system conducted by biolo-&lt;br/&gt;gists, statisticians, computer scientists and system theorists. With this unification, computational&lt;br/&gt;biology developments will aid in understanding and potentially curing much of the neural diseases&lt;br/&gt;known.&lt;br/&gt;Progress in this research removes the boundaries between the strongly segregated fields such as&lt;br/&gt;sciences and engineering. Such multi-disciplinary research requires complete interactions between&lt;br/&gt;different groups with different domains of expertise. This research will result in PhD theses cov-&lt;br/&gt;ering both such fields as demonstrated by our KDI project. In addition, courses across disciplines&lt;br/&gt;can be structured to provide better multi-disciplinary training at the undergraduate level.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
