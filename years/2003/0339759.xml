    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project addresses low cost fabrication of probe cards for use in testing advanced circuit technologies. Currently, high-density probe card assemblies employ more than 1500 test points to provide the increased test coverage necessary for System-on-a-Chip and high pin count devices. At $50/test point, such assemblies often sell for over $75,000 and they wear out in only 1 million wafer touchdowns. These assemblies often require integration of multiple components-sometimes thousands-and require many hours of labor to assemble. This project would promote nanoparticle-based meso-film; laser patterned optical-quality glass ceramics; and inkjet printing processes that will reduce the probe card manufacturing cost, increase test point density, increase contact life, and reduce assembly labor. The Phase I project will be a collaboration of several companies bringing together expertise in 3D laser patterning; material and process development; and nanoparticle manufacturing in a unique and powerful way to tackle an important industry challenge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project is in testing of advanced electronic circuits in such uses as processes for the manufacture, deposition and functionalization of nanoparticle-based coatings with low sintering temperatures; feature resolution of laser patterned substrates for 3D micromachining applications including MEMS, MOEMS, microreplication, and grating manufacture; test integration-optical, mechanical, and electrical wafer testing being combined in a monolithic substrate; faster product development cycle times and production ramps for advanced processor and microsystem designs; and design of test fixtures for the new wave of electronic products built using direct-write deposition of passive and active electronic structures onto non-silicon substrates.</AbstractNarration>
