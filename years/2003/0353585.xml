    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT for EAR0353585&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Keck Geology Consortium focuses on enriching undergraduate education through development of high-quality research experiences. The Consortium has been a fundamental component of the undergraduate-research landscape over the last seventeen years, supporting 909 undergraduate students from eighty-three schools across the nation. In addition to research projects, the Consortium program includes the annual Keck Research Symposium in Geology. &lt;br/&gt;The symposium is a gathering place for some of the most talented and motivated undergraduate students in the nation. For the students, the symposium is a place to present research results in an environment that emphasizes the importance of communication and builds self-confidence. For the faculty, the symposium is an opportunity to interact and share information with each &lt;br/&gt;other, stimulating development of new collaborations and innovative programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This award will is to continue the Keck Geology Consortium in order to capitalize and build on the seventeen-year experience of the Keck Geology Consortium in collaboration, design, and administration of undergraduate research projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU site will serve as the platform for a systematic assessment study to produce a web-based assessment library that can be adapted by the geoscience community to inform the development and practice of teaching undergraduate research.</AbstractNarration>
