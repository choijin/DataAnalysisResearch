<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an emerging technology, the use of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) materials in the civil infrastructure has seen a rapid growth. Despite the abundance of research activity and the growing number of demonstration and commercial applications, many issues involved in the use of FRP materials in infrastructure remain to be addressed. In some cases, the dearth of understanding and/or design guidance represents a significant limitation to the broader implementation of FRP materials in infrastructure applications.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposed Workshop is to bring together industry, practitioner and academic experts to help to identify and prioritize research areas and issues requiring further attention in order to improve our understanding of the behavior of FRP materials and FRP structural and repair systems.&lt;br/&gt;The primary deliverable of this proposed Workshop will be the identification of critical research needs affecting the implementation of FRP composites in concrete construction applications and the development of a consensus on the priority of these needs. Having developed such a consensus, a unified research approach addressing this research needs and matching research needs with appropriate funding agencies/opportunities can be established.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from this effort is not only the identification of critical needs, but also the development of consensus-based unified approach to future research needs. This broader impact is anticipated to aid the funding agencies to identify priorities of research in the area of FRP.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
