<AbstractNarration>The University of Central Oklahoma (UCO) and its four partners in the SURE-STEP Consortium, Cameron University, East Central University, Langston University (a Historically Black College or University), and Southwestern Oklahoma State University, plan to increase the number of students who graduate in STEM majors by 10%. As participants in the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics program for the past seven years, all five of  the consortium universities have helped students realize their dreams of earning baccalaureate degrees.  Through this project, the Consortium is piloting methods not previously related in these institutions in order to interest, retain, and graduate many more students in the STEM disciplines, working with students from high school graduation through their critical first years of college experience. Under earlier efforts supported by a variety of agencies, the partners have made progress in attracting more STEM majors. Retaining STEM majors to graduation has not proved as successful.  Among the five SURE-STEP universities, 4,700 students declared STEM majors in the Fall, 2001 semester. However, for the entire 2001-2002 school year, only 588 students graduated in these majors (OSRHE 2002 report). The SURE-STEP grant program is creating the vital bridge to academic excellence and student engagement that promises to increase the number of STEM graduates at all five institutions.  First, underrepresented, low-income and first-generation students who have been admitted for the Fall semester are being recruited from area high schools for the four-week summer bridge component. Spaces available after recruitment are filled first-come, first-served by other interested students. Participants engage in discipline-specific research and academic skill-building workshops, explore the campus with faculty and peer mentors, and begin to get acquainted with their student cohort. SURE-STEP participants also have on-line access to mentors and supplemental instruction (SI) leaders. In the Fall, each university offers supplemental instruction for the historically difficult first-year STEM courses (biology, physics, mathematics, chemistry, and computer science). In year two, SURE-STEP participants become Research Ambassadors, recruiting students by speaking at high schools, local math and science days and seminars. Others in the program mentor new students. Participants continue to mentor, as well as work in internships in business, industry, and research labs. Because of the strength of the research component at the consortium universities, Oklahoma EPSCoR has committed to help support SURE-STEP participants in summer research experiences.  In order to disseminate the results of the program, all SURE-STEP participants produce abstracts and research posters for Research Day at Regional Universities. Formative assessment of the SURE-STEP program is based on faculty, peer mentor, SI leader and participant surveys and interviews.  Summative assessment will include retention data for the participants as well as a control group and GPAs. Data will be available on the website. Results of the project will be presented/published at local, state, regional and national seminars and symposiums.</AbstractNarration>
