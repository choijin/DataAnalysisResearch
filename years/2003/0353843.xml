<AbstractNarration>AST 0353843 Smith&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CTIO) will provide an opportunity for U. S. undergraduate students to participate in current astronomical research in an international environment. The students will be chosen from a mixture of backgrounds, with an emphasis on those who would not otherwise have access to large telescopes. While in Chile, they will themselves operate one or more of the telescopes at CTIO; complete individual research projects under the mentorship of CTIO and associated staff astronomers; gain an understanding of the breadth of work being done at CTIO by attending seminars given by staff; and perform all this alongside astronomers and students from several other countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the program are: To provide undergraduates with a concrete research experience with scientists who are working at the forefront of contemporary astrophysics; To introduce undergraduates who are exploring a career in science to the range of opportunities in astronomy today and; To expose undergraduates to the diversity of scientists and support staff involved in astronomical research.  The major themes of the CTIO REU Program are the conduct of publishable research, within a framework of rigorous intellectual merit and; exposure to the international nature of astronomy, both in people and places. The program is conducted over ten weeks during the southern summer, January through March, both to allow interaction with Chilean students and as an alternative to traditional northern-summer student programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
