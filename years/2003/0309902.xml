<AbstractNarration>Biological and biomedical sciences are undergoing a major revolution&lt;br/&gt;as new experimental approaches, such as high-throughput DNA&lt;br/&gt;sequencing, DNA microarray, whole genome location, and&lt;br/&gt;single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) techniques, are yielding&lt;br/&gt;unprecedented amounts of genetic data. The exploration of this&lt;br/&gt;information is critically dependent upon the development of&lt;br/&gt;advanced computational methods for data analysis. Since the recent&lt;br/&gt;completion of the Human Genome Project, the focus of Computational&lt;br/&gt;Biology (or Bioinformatics) has shifted to topics that are more&lt;br/&gt;directly related to biological functions, i.e. computational problems&lt;br/&gt;that arise in functional genomics and proteomics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PI will study some new algorithmic problems&lt;br/&gt;that aim at addressing three important questions in&lt;br/&gt;computational biology: (i) how to infer haplotype configurations from&lt;br/&gt;genotype data based on the Mendelian law of inheritance for a given&lt;br/&gt;pedigree, (ii) how to resolve missing values in cluster&lt;br/&gt;analysis for oligonucleotide fingerprinting, and (iii) how to&lt;br/&gt;assign NMR peaks to individual amino acids. The first question is&lt;br/&gt;fundamental to the fine-mapping of genetic diseases&lt;br/&gt;using markers such as microsatellites and SNPs.&lt;br/&gt;Question (ii) arises in the analysis of discretized oligonucleotide&lt;br/&gt;fingerprints from DNA array experiments and has important applications&lt;br/&gt;in the classification of microbial communities. Question (iii)&lt;br/&gt;represents a crucial step in NMR-based protein structure determination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the above algorithmic problems are relatively new in the&lt;br/&gt;literature (in fact, some of them were recently introduced by the PI &lt;br/&gt;in collaboration with experimentalists), they have strong ties to&lt;br/&gt;well-known combinatorial optimization problems such as bipartite matching,&lt;br/&gt;interval scheduling, graph clique partition (or coloring), and set cover.&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, their solutions could also be of interest to the general&lt;br/&gt;algorithms and combinatorial optimization communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
