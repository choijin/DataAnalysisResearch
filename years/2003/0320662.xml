<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Macalester College under the direction of Dr. Paul J. Overvoorde for the acquisition of three fluorescence-based instruments: a DNA Sequencing System; an Infrared Imaging System and a Real-time Quantitative PCR System. The DNA Sequencing System can be used both for DNA sequencing and for genetic "fingerprinting". The Infrared Imaging System allows the simultaneous detection and quantification of two different infrared fluorophores. These fluorophores can be attached to nucleic acids or proteins (e.g. antibodies) allowing the non-radioactive adaptation of numerous techniques (e.g. Southern blotting, RNA gel blot analysis, immunoblotting, gel shift assays, and others) that have traditionally required the use of radioactivity for sensitivity. The Real-time Quantitative PCR System allows measurement of the amounts of up to four independent DNA targets within a single reaction. Because of several factors including being able to start with small quantities of material, rapid thermocycling, and instantaneous detection of multiple fluorophores, real-time PCR has emerged as a powerful tool for assessing the level of gene expression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These instruments can be used as powerful investigative tools in a wide variety of disciplines, and their acquisition by Macalester College will support research by faculty whose research interests include such wide-ranging fields as molecular biology, developmental biology, neuroscience, plant ecology, and fresh-water mussel conservation and taxonomy. Beyond advancing multiple research agendas, the requested instrumentation will significantly strengthen the training of our students by providing them with access to state-of-the-art equipment. The availability of this equipment will deepen the rigor of scientific inquiry at this exclusively undergraduate institution by allowing on-going research to be addressed more fully at the molecular level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of the requested equipment will be coupled with support from industry to develop investigative modules that expose students to the methods afforded by the advances in technology. When students use state-of-the-art instruments, they gain a more accurate view of modern scientific inquiry and can make more informed decisions about career paths. In addition, exposure to this type of instrumentation allows students to hone the types of critical thinking skills that are required for designing and interpreting experiments at the molecular level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will enhance the research productivity of faculty and the scientific rigor of the undergraduate program at Macalester College.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
