<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0318248&lt;br/&gt;O'BANNON&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity is to create an annual leadership institute for senior tenured women faculty in NSF-supported disciplines with the purpose of increasing the representation of women in higher education leadership positions (chair, dean, etc.), and supporting the ADVANCE goal of facilitating women's advancement to the highest ranks of academic leadership. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The leadership institute will increase the accessibility for such training for faculty in the midwest by providing low cost workshops within that geographic area. The leadership training will focus on the business and leadership skills needed for women to make a successful entry into department chair and dean positions. This proposal addresses the need for women to have opportunities to cultivate leadership skills and goals in a structured setting in order to capture the benefits of such training that is often made available to male faculty in informal, less structured and more 'on the job' settings. The goal of the ADVANCE program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers. With this award, NSF seeks to support new approaches to improving the climate for women in U.S. academic institutions and to facilitate women's advancement to the highest ranks of academic leadership&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
