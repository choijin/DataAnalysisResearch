    <AbstractNarration>The aims of this project are to stabilize enzymes in inorganic layered materials, and to develop a detailed understanding of enzyme-solid interactions. This research is crucial for the rational design of new materials to maximize enzyme function for application in biocatalysis, implants, artificial organs, and biosensors (homeland security). Industrial/laboratory use of enzymes is severely limited, due partly to enzyme instability towards pH, temperature, and organic solvents. Enzymes embedded in solids can overcome some of these limitations, but embedding of enzymes results in significant loss of activity. The goal of this research is to provide a systematic investigation of enzyme-solid materials needed to fill this knowledge gap. We will use a novel, reversible, and robust methodology (tethered-heme approach) to embed enzymes in solids, and evaluate them using state-of-the-art micro-calorimetric and spectroscopic methods. Graduate, undergraduate, high school students, and visiting foreign scholars will be trained in material synthesis, protein structure, enzyme kinetics, micro-calorimetry, and attenuated total reflectance - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). We will participate in the outreach programs, "Kids are Scientists Too" for young children; the "Mentor Connection" for gifted high school students; and the NSF REU program in Chemistry. We will post educational materials on the web http://jasmin.chem.uconn.edu) for graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Enzymes are responsible, directly or indirectly, for most of the key biochemical processes in the body. The exciting possibility of using enzymes for industrial/laboratory applications is severely limited due to the fact that enzymes are available in extremely low quantities, are expensive, and they are deactivated very readily. The resulting new knowledge from this project will be essential for the design of novel materials to maximize enzyme function. Some applications of embedded enzymes would include, but not be limited to, biocatalysis, implants, artificial organs, and biosensors (for homeland security).&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
