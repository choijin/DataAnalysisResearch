    <AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Bruce H. Dahlin will conduct three summer field seasons of archaeological research in the Chunchucmil region of NW Yucatan, Mexico to complete Phase II of The Pakbeh Regional Economy Program (PREP). Since 1993, PREP has been investigating the Early Classic lowland Maya site of Chunchucmil and its surrounding region in NW Yucatan, Mexico. While the urban status of other Classic Maya cities is arguable, Chunchucmil is a true city with a conservatively estimated population within its central 14km2 of between 29,700 and 46,650, and it has the highest population densities of any Maya site. Chunchucmil nevertheless occupies one of the most depauperate agricultural landscapes in the entire Maya lowlands, suggesting that it exceeded agricultural carrying capacity, thus necessitating the importation of food and other basic goods. In fact, the city is unique in having features like streets and avenues that would have facilitated trade. It also lacks the usual trappings of a 'regal/ritual center' that characterize other Maya sites, i.e., monumental civic/ceremonial architecture, congregational spaces, and sculpture and hieroglyphics in demonstrably public spaces. The hypothesis that makes the most sense of these and other departures from the typical Classic Maya urban pattern is that Chunchucmil was founded on trade. It had access to a vigorous maritime trade route, control of the second largest salt works in Mesoamerica, a port facility, and a rich diversity of environmental resource zones. We are testing an empirically derived composite model of the region's economic organization using a variety of data gathering techniques at all scales, from regional and urban mapping to excavation of households. Traditional artifactual analyses (stylistic, compositional and modal) will help construction of a detailed ceramic sequence and ceramic and lithic exchange networks. However, since the vast majority of materials used in subtropical areas are highly perishable and unlikely to leave archaeological remains, we are using Chunchucmil as an experimental laboratory for developing new prospecting, data gathering and analytical techniques. The most successful so far is identification using chemical biomarkers in soils of the first positively known ancient Maya marketplace. This technique may distinguish production from ordinary domestic activities and differential consumption activities within households. Functions of ceramic and stone artifacts will be reconstructed based in part on microscopic and chemical residues. Spatial distributions of artifacts and natural and man-made landscape features are being analyzed using a GIS database. This research will contribute to the substantive interpretation of Maya economic and political systems and how those systems acted as a filter or broker for cultural ideas coming from, and contributing to, the larger pan-Mesoamerican world. The research will also contribute methodologically by applying new geochemical techniques to archaeological prospecting, data gathering and interpretive practices. Finally, the project will continue to train students from throughout North America (Mexico, U.S.) and Europe (France, Germany, Spain) and it will continue to provide employment and training opportunities to local villagers in this economically depressed region of Mexico.</AbstractNarration>
