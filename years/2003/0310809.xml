<AbstractNarration>The PI is investigating methods for jointly adapting transmitters &lt;br/&gt;and receivers in a wireless network. The objective is to optimize&lt;br/&gt;performance by measuring and exploiting properties of the channel &lt;br/&gt;and interference. Parameters adapted at the transmitter include &lt;br/&gt;data rate and power, along with transmitted signatures, which can &lt;br/&gt;span dimensions across space, time, and frequency. An important&lt;br/&gt;part of this effort is to account explicitly for limited feedback&lt;br/&gt;from the receiver to the transmitter. Both cellular and non-cellular &lt;br/&gt;(e.g., peer-to-peer) wireless networks are being considered. &lt;br/&gt;In the latter case, the PI is investigating methods for allocating &lt;br/&gt;rate and power across degrees of freedom associated with &lt;br/&gt;multiple antennas and links in a multi-hop network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joint power and signature optimization problems are being studied&lt;br/&gt;both with perfect channel knowledge at the transmitter, and with &lt;br/&gt;limited feedback. Signature optimization serves to avoid interference while &lt;br/&gt;simultaneously exploiting channel conditions.&lt;br/&gt;Solutions to problems with perfect channel knowledge&lt;br/&gt;provide benchmarks for comparisons with suboptimal transmission schemes, &lt;br/&gt;e.g., when channels are unknown. Channel models of interest include &lt;br/&gt;multiple access (reverse-link) and forward-link channels, and &lt;br/&gt;the uncoordinated multi-input/multi-output channel, which models &lt;br/&gt;a peer-to-peer network. Transmitter optimization is being studied&lt;br/&gt;in the context of both direct-sequence spread spectrum and&lt;br/&gt;multi-carrier signaling. Implications for joint transmitter-receiver &lt;br/&gt;adaptation over time-varying channels are being considered.&lt;br/&gt;Transmitter designs, which can exploit link diversity in a &lt;br/&gt;simple multi-hop channel model, are also being explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
