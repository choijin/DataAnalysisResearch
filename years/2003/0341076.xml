<AbstractNarration>Previous results of the investigator and collaborators establish&lt;br/&gt;a relation between coherent sheaves on a Steinberg variety of a complex&lt;br/&gt;simple algebraic group, and perverse sheaves on the affine flag variety of&lt;br/&gt;the Langlands dual group. Since the latter are known, by the work of Kazhdan&lt;br/&gt;and Lusztig, to be related to representations of quantum groups at a root&lt;br/&gt;of unity, and hence also to representations of algebraic groups in prime&lt;br/&gt;characteristic, our results have implications for that theories. &lt;br/&gt;They also indicate that there should be a relation between the geometry&lt;br/&gt;of perverse sheaves on affine flag varieties, and non-restricted &lt;br/&gt;representations of quantum groups or Lie algebras in prime characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;The principal goal of the present project is to develop this kind of &lt;br/&gt;relationship, thus providing a new tool for the theory of non-restricted &lt;br/&gt;representations. It is expected, in particular, to yield a proof and a&lt;br/&gt;conceptual explanation for recent numerical conjectures by Lusztig. &lt;br/&gt;The methods and ideology of the present work are partly based on the geometric&lt;br/&gt;approach to the Langlands program, due to Drinfeld. Another goal of the project&lt;br/&gt;is to investigate consequences of the above mentioned results to that theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A key to new developments, and a source of inspiration in mathematics often &lt;br/&gt;lie in discovery of parallelism (equivalence) between&lt;br/&gt;seemingly unrelated objects or theories. Representation theory is a rich&lt;br/&gt;source of examples of that kind: though formally being a branch of algebra,&lt;br/&gt;the modern theory relies heavily on geometric disciplines, such as&lt;br/&gt; topology and algebraic geometry. The principle goal of the present project&lt;br/&gt;is to develop geometric language for a branch of representation theory&lt;br/&gt;where it has been lacking so far, namely the so called theory of non-restricted&lt;br/&gt;modular representations. In the corresponding algebraic constructions &lt;br/&gt;divisibility&lt;br/&gt;properties of integral numbers by a particular prime number are relevant.&lt;br/&gt;The geometry apparently related to this deals with particular infinite&lt;br/&gt;dimensional objects, encountered also in mathematical physics&lt;br/&gt;(conformal field theory), and in number theory (Langlands duality theory).&lt;br/&gt;This construction is expected to provide new tools for the above mentioned&lt;br/&gt;branch of representation theory; in particular, it is expected to yield a&lt;br/&gt;proof of certain conjectures  by  leading experts in the field.</AbstractNarration>
