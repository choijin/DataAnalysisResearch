<AbstractNarration>DMS-0302043&lt;br/&gt;Lorenzini, Dino J.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Abelian varieties and Neron models&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main problems in arithmetic geometry is the determination&lt;br/&gt;of the set of rational solutions of a system of polynomial &lt;br/&gt;equations with rational coefficients. &lt;br/&gt;One of the most successful techniques&lt;br/&gt;in the study of such a set of solutions is to reduce the equations modulo&lt;br/&gt;a prime p and to study   the set of solutions of &lt;br/&gt;the latter system of equations.  It turns out that,&lt;br/&gt;in many situations, it is possible to describe a canonical way&lt;br/&gt;of reducing the equations modulo p. When A/K&lt;br/&gt;is an abelian variety, this canonical reduction is called the N\'eron model&lt;br/&gt;of A/K. This reduction is the object of study in &lt;br/&gt;Lorenzini's first three research projects in this proposal. &lt;br/&gt;For instance, attached to any Neron model&lt;br/&gt;is a finite group called the group of components. When the reduction is purely&lt;br/&gt;additive, it is conjectured that  there are only &lt;br/&gt;finitely many possibilities for this group once the dimension g is fixed.&lt;br/&gt;Lorenzini's proposed research will&lt;br/&gt;shed  more light on this conjecture and on other special&lt;br/&gt;phenomena that arise when the reduction modulo a small prime p&lt;br/&gt;is not `good.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For centuries, human beings have been fascinated with &lt;br/&gt;solving Diophantine equations, named after the Greek &lt;br/&gt;mathematician Diophantus who lived&lt;br/&gt;in the third century AD. The field of Diophantine equations&lt;br/&gt;has taken added significance in the modern world as &lt;br/&gt;it finds applications in a variety of areas, including &lt;br/&gt;encryption. Since the time of the Greeks, mathematicians have developed&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated tools to aid in solving equations. This investigator &lt;br/&gt;has developed some such tools, and is currently working on &lt;br/&gt;further contributions to this field.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
