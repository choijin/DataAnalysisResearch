<AbstractNarration>Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Interdisciplinary Informatics are sponsored jointly by the Directorates for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and Biological Sciences (BIO) to encourage research and training that cross the traditional disciplinary boundaries between them. These fellowships provide opportunities for interdisciplinary research and educational activities in biology and informatics to a wide range of recent doctoral recipients (biologists, chemists, physicists, mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, and others).  It is expected that the Fellows trained through these fellowships will play an important role in training the future workforce. Postdoctoral research and training in informatics will permit junior scientists trained in biology, mathematical, chemical, and physical sciences to play key roles in developing new quantitative tools and methods that will advance informatics in biology and other fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Mutations, evolution, and functional sequences: a comprehensive comparison of the mouse and human genomes".  By studying orthologous genes and noncoding regions, this research is elucidating the process of molecular evolution, the variations of mutation patterns across the genome, and the detection of functional sites in the noncoding regions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
