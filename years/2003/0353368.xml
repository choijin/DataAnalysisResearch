    <AbstractNarration>This five-year project would develop nine multi-media professional development resources that will enhance PreK-8 teachers' understanding of how to employ instructional strategies from the field of literacy in developing students' scientific understanding. Four of the modules will be resources on specific uses of literacy in the science classroom; four will be case studies offering examples of best practices, including video components from the classrooms of master teachers. The 9th module will provide an introduction to the theoretical underpinnings and research studies that support linking science and literacy. The PI, an expert in K-6 science instructional resource development, and her colleagues from EDC lead a development team that includes experts in child development, second language learning, literacy acquisition and science content.</AbstractNarration>
