<AbstractNarration>Within every living cell, proteins called enzymes catalyze the thousands of individual chemical reactions that make life possible.  These enzyme-catalyzed reactions break down nutrients to generate energy; assemble proteins and DNA from smaller molecules such as amino acids and nucleic acids; defend the cell against pathogens, etc.  Cells must carefully coordinate these individual processes so that they combine together, like the steps in an assembly line, to efficiently produce what is needed when it is needed.  These processes must be adjusted, or regulated, to respond to changes in the cell's surrounding environment.  One of the most versatile mechanisms for regulating the activity of enzymes is protein phosphorylation.  When a protein kinase attaches a phosphate group to a target protein, the phosphate acts as a switch that turns "on" or "off" that protein's function.  Protein phosphatases remove the phosphate group (dephosphorylation) when needed to turn the phosphate switch back to its original position.  Cells possess a number of proteins containing phosphate switches that enable them to exert very comprehensive control.  The objective of this project is to determine the origins and development of this switching mechanism in order to understand the fundamental principles upon which it operates.  A simple model organism from the Archaea, Sulfolobus solfataricus, will be used in this study because the Archaea represent living fossils that preserve many of the properties of the earliest living organisms.  They also carry out potentially useful chemical processes such as the generation of methane.  In the future, the knowledge generated concerning phosphate switches can be exploited to engineer these organisms to perform functions of benefit to humanity. Using mass spectroscopy and molecular biology, the proteins that are phosphorylated in Sulfolobus solfataricus and the enzymes that phosphorylate and dephosphorylate them, will be identified and the functional relationships between them mapped. Students will be trained and a much needed website on the subject will be provided</AbstractNarration>
