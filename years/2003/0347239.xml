<AbstractNarration>Model reduction for control of fluids&lt;br/&gt;C. W. Rowley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many powerful techniques are available for analyzing and controlling &lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems, if one has a tractable mathematical model, for &lt;br/&gt;instance in the form of a differential equation.  For fluids, and many &lt;br/&gt;other systems of interest, models are well known, but are too complex &lt;br/&gt;for traditional techniques from dynamical systems and control theory to &lt;br/&gt;be practical.  This program develops techniques for obtaining simpler &lt;br/&gt;models of complex systems, in order to provide a bridge between &lt;br/&gt;interesting multiscale applications, and the mathematical tools useful &lt;br/&gt;for their analysis and control.  The techniques will then be used to &lt;br/&gt;address problems in fluid mechanics, focusing on controlling transition &lt;br/&gt;to turbulence in a plane channel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific model reduction techniques addressed will include balanced &lt;br/&gt;truncation and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and symmetry &lt;br/&gt;reduction methods from geometric mechanics.  Each of these techniques &lt;br/&gt;has severe limitations when applied to fluids problems.  POD often &lt;br/&gt;produces highly unreliable models, and often the accuracy of the models &lt;br/&gt;does not improve as the number of modes increases.  Balanced truncation &lt;br/&gt;applies to stable linear systems, and has good error bounds that &lt;br/&gt;improve as the number of modes increases, but the method is not &lt;br/&gt;tractable for very large systems such as fluids.  A central component &lt;br/&gt;of the research involves a new method for performing "balanced POD," &lt;br/&gt;which may be viewed as form of weighted POD that more heavily weights &lt;br/&gt;states of large dynamical importance.  In addition, ideas from symmetry &lt;br/&gt;reduction, and heirarchical finite-element modeling combine to guide &lt;br/&gt;the development of local versions of POD and balanced truncation, which &lt;br/&gt;will capture traveling structures better than the global basis &lt;br/&gt;functions produced by standard POD and balanced truncation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational components of the program include developing an &lt;br/&gt;exchange program with Brazil, in order to promote engineering education &lt;br/&gt;in an international setting.  In addition, a new outreach program will &lt;br/&gt;help local elementary school teachers introduce engineering into K-6 &lt;br/&gt;classrooms, by organizing undergraduates to volunteer their time to &lt;br/&gt;assist with the technical aspects of engineering projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
