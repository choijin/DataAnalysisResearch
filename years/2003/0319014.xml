    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will test feasibility of using inexpensive wireless chipsets as a means of directly measuring mechanical vibration. Microwaves are a reliable means of sensing in the harshest of industrial and laboratory environments. The radar signals can be transmitted to the object of interest from a remote location via waveguide or through microwave transparent materials. However, the current state of the technology uses high-end radar devices with extremely high component costs that prohibit its use in most applications. The proposed research will develop a prototype non-contact sensor based on the latest electronic components used for wireless applications. Through specialized assembly of chipsets developed for Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11 wireless applications, it may be possible to assemble ultra low-cost radars for measuring vibration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vibration and position sensing are critical measurements in many industrial and laboratory processes. Applications for the sensor are many of those within the $800 million accelerometer market and include factory automation (especially in the chemical and biological industries), electric motor (of all sizes) monitoring for condition-based-maintenance, semiconductor/thin film manufacturing and quality control, and automotive applications, particularly engine monitoring and terrain sensing.</AbstractNarration>
