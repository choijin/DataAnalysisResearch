<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit. Funding is requested to continue community structure and&lt;br/&gt;biogeographic analysis of organisms associated with hydrothermal vents. Work&lt;br/&gt;completed to date has led to the acquisition of a unique, quantitative assessment of&lt;br/&gt;diversity and faunal similarities and differences among vent and seep mussel beds from&lt;br/&gt;vent sites along the East Pacific Rise and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and seep sites in the&lt;br/&gt;Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. These samples provide a rich context within which to&lt;br/&gt;interpret the faunal composition and structure in mussel beds in an area south of the&lt;br/&gt;Easter Microplate (38S) and in the Lau and Fiji back-arc basins. Specimens will be&lt;br/&gt;collected using our standard gear from two discrete mussel beds at each of the 3 primary&lt;br/&gt;sites. Once collected, samples will be processed using the standard protocol established&lt;br/&gt;in our lab, and identified with the help of the extensive voucher collection maintained at&lt;br/&gt;The College of William &amp; Mary, and with the aid of taxonomic specialists as necessary.&lt;br/&gt;A subset of appropriately preserved sorted samples will be made available for molecular&lt;br/&gt;analyses, which will be undertaken in collaboration with R. Vrijenhoek. Molecular&lt;br/&gt;analyses will focus on taxa where there is a need to test for cryptic species or phenotypic&lt;br/&gt;plasticity and selected other taxa of interest to Vrijenhoek and Van Dover, in addition to&lt;br/&gt;the suite of taxa that Vrijenhoek is separately funded to analyze (primarily tubeworms,&lt;br/&gt;mussels, crabs, clams). The proposed community structure and faunistic analyses will&lt;br/&gt;contribute to our understanding of the degree of evolutionary alliance of vent faunas&lt;br/&gt;within the Pacific Ocean basin and to potential barriers or conduits to dispersal. The&lt;br/&gt;work is of particular interest because the study sites have been strategically chosen to&lt;br/&gt;address biogeographic issues relating to the degree of isolation of adjacent back-arc basin&lt;br/&gt;systems, the relationship of these back-arc faunas to the most-southern-known vent&lt;br/&gt;faunas on the mid-ocean ridge (at 38S), and the relationships among these faunas and&lt;br/&gt;sites already studied north of the Easter Microplate on the East Pacific Rise.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. Numerous undergraduates and graduate students will benefit from&lt;br/&gt;participation in field programs and analysis of samples. Aspects of the research are&lt;br/&gt;incorporated into the PIs undergraduate and graduate teaching. Results will be published&lt;br/&gt;in the professional literature and will be made available to the public through web-based&lt;br/&gt;resources and through public lectures by the PI and her students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
