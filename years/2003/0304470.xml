<AbstractNarration>Space-Time Coding for Wireless Communications&lt;br/&gt;Michael P. Fitz and Urbashi Mitra&lt;br/&gt;Proposal 9980616,&lt;br/&gt;The Ohio State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This research will extend the state of the art in channel coding for&lt;br/&gt;multi-antenna communication systems.  It has recently been shown that&lt;br/&gt;the capacity of a wireless communications system can be greatly&lt;br/&gt;increased if multiple antennae are used both at the transmitter and the&lt;br/&gt;receiver.  Furthermore, a method for achieving such gains is to&lt;br/&gt;introduce controlled redundancy (coding) in the transmitted data&lt;br/&gt;sequence spatially as well as temporally,  which is the conventional&lt;br/&gt;scheme.  This area of research is still quite new and several key&lt;br/&gt;problem areas need to be addressed.  For example, computationally&lt;br/&gt;efficient methods for finding space-time codes are necessary. &lt;br/&gt;Typically, the wireless channel is time-varying and it is not always&lt;br/&gt;possible to achieve good estimates of the channel conditions; thus&lt;br/&gt;evaluating the robustness of space-time codes is of value.  A related&lt;br/&gt;project is to consider the interplay of space-time coding and decoding&lt;br/&gt;methods with algorithms designed to estimate the channel and other key&lt;br/&gt;communication parameters.  Turbo codes have recently emerged as&lt;br/&gt;powerful codes for achieving near Shannon capacity, thus space-time&lt;br/&gt;generalizations of such codes will be studied.  Finally, much of the&lt;br/&gt;current work on space-time coding is for narrowband time division&lt;br/&gt;multiple access systems, thus we shall consider space-time code design&lt;br/&gt;and decoder design for wideband code-division multiple-access systems&lt;br/&gt;as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The first research thrust will focus on the development and analysis&lt;br/&gt;of improved search techniques for space-time trellis codes.  Current &lt;br/&gt;methods for searching the distance spectrum of space-time trellis codes &lt;br/&gt;can be computationally expensive.  Methods for reducing the size of the &lt;br/&gt;error state trellis coupled with reduced complexity trellis search schemes&lt;br/&gt;will be explored. The next focus is on evaluating the robustness of space-time&lt;br/&gt;codes under realistic channel conditions.  In addition, space-time coding &lt;br/&gt;for parametric channels will be considered.  Thus, constrained channel &lt;br/&gt;uncertainty will exist and code designs for such scenarios will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;The third research focus will be on space-time turbo codes as one method to &lt;br/&gt;achieve robustness to a variety of channel conditions.  The random--like &lt;br/&gt;structure of turbo coded schemes hold some promise of mitigating the possible &lt;br/&gt;interactions between the code structure and the channel characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;Space-time code designs for CDMA channels will be investigated in the &lt;br/&gt;fourth research thrust.  CDMA signals have a larger dimensionality and&lt;br/&gt;thus the space-time code design is different from that for single-user &lt;br/&gt;systems.  In addition, CDMA signals in a multipath channel will result &lt;br/&gt;in different optimal code designs. The final research topic will consider &lt;br/&gt;receiver designs in the context of space-time coding.  That is, channel &lt;br/&gt;estimation and synchronization for space-time coding and modulation will&lt;br/&gt;be investigated.  Algorithms which exploit the properties of space-time&lt;br/&gt;codes will be designed.  In addition, the performance dependence on accurate&lt;br/&gt;channel estimates and synchronization will be analyzed.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
