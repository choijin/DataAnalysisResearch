    <AbstractNarration>With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic and Macromolecular Program supports the research of Professor Craig A. Ogle and Dr. Michael D. Murphy of the Department of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, NC. The project will apply NMR spectroscopy and the rapid injection NMR technique to the study of two very important chemical reactions, anionic polymerization and the addition reactions of organocuprates. Although both of these reactions are scientifically significant and highly important economically, there are many consequential unanswered questions concerning their mechanism. The use of the rapid NRM technique will allow the determination of the structure and nature of the reactive intermediates in these important reactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, this project will train undergraduate and masters students in the use of sophisticated analytical instrumentation and modern experimental design. The potential economic impact of this research could be significant, leading to new products and methodologies in both the polymer and the pharmaceutical industry.</AbstractNarration>
