<AbstractNarration>FRG collaborative Award with lead DMS-0354353  of Ono, Zhang and Kudla with Co-PI Yang. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves arithmetic geometry and number theory and&lt;br/&gt;focuses on a systematic study of cycles on Shimura &lt;br/&gt;varieties and applications. The fascination of diophantine problems -- the study of whole number&lt;br/&gt;solutions of polynomial equations-- goes back to ancient times.&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical techniques developed in the last 50 year to&lt;br/&gt;attack such questions have lead to significant advances in our knowledge&lt;br/&gt;of this subject, for example the proof of Fermat's last theorem.&lt;br/&gt;These same tools have, meanwhile, proved to be of great importance&lt;br/&gt;in cryptography, the construction of new algorithms for computer science&lt;br/&gt;and new error correcting codes for electronics.&lt;br/&gt;Shimura varieties are the geometric objects&lt;br/&gt;associated to systems of diophantine equations &lt;br/&gt;with a great degree of symmetry. Their diophantine &lt;br/&gt;properties have deep connection with many important parts of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An extensive study will be made of the arithmetic geometry of&lt;br/&gt;cycles on Shimura varieties, with an emphasis on the interaction&lt;br/&gt;of their heights, arithmetic intersections and density properties&lt;br/&gt;with modular forms and special values of L-functions and their&lt;br/&gt;derivatives. Applications will be made to Gauss's class number&lt;br/&gt;problem, equidistribution problems for cycles on Shimura&lt;br/&gt;varieties, and the Andre-Oort conjecture, and the Tate and Bloch-Beilinson&lt;br/&gt;conjectures.  This collaborative project will take&lt;br/&gt;advantage of recent developments including nonvanishing properties&lt;br/&gt;of Fourier coefficients of modular forms,&lt;br/&gt;the theory of Borcherds forms and their connections with theta &lt;br/&gt;functions, and integral representations of Langlands L-functions. &lt;br/&gt;A long range goal of the project is to establish relations&lt;br/&gt;between the height pairings, periods, and algebraic cycles and the&lt;br/&gt;derivatives of L-functions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
