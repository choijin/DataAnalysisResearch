<AbstractNarration>DMS-0310645&lt;br/&gt;Fuhua (Frank) Cheng&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a CARGO incubation award made under solicitation &lt;br/&gt;http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2002/nsf02155/nsf02155.htm.&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides funding for the development of necessary&lt;br/&gt;mathematical theories and geometric algorithms to support&lt;br/&gt;subdivision surface based one-piece representation, i.e.,&lt;br/&gt;representing the final object in a design process with only&lt;br/&gt;one subdivision surface, no matter how complicated the object's&lt;br/&gt;topology or shape. Hence, the number of parts in the final&lt;br/&gt;representation is always the minimum: one.  The research requires&lt;br/&gt;studies in three areas: representation refinement, representation&lt;br/&gt;conversion and representation joining. The aim for representation&lt;br/&gt;refinement is to develop new vertex generation schemes and&lt;br/&gt;topological structures that allow local refinement of a subdivision&lt;br/&gt;surface's control mesh while preserving the crack-free property of&lt;br/&gt;the refining process.  The aim for representation conversion is to&lt;br/&gt;develop conversion algorithms for subdivision surfaces of different&lt;br/&gt;type or subdivision surfaces of the same type but whose control&lt;br/&gt;meshes are of different topology.  The aim for representation&lt;br/&gt;joining is to develop direct and indirect joining techniques that&lt;br/&gt;can be iteratively applied to join different component surfaces of&lt;br/&gt;an object into a single surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will significantly&lt;br/&gt;shorten the construction process of a free-from surface because&lt;br/&gt;one-piece representation makes Boolean operations more efficient&lt;br/&gt;and, consequently, increase the productivity of a design engineer.&lt;br/&gt;Actually, in addition to their roles in one-piece representation,&lt;br/&gt;the results in the first area will also significantly improve the&lt;br/&gt;current art of subdivision surface theory.  They would not only&lt;br/&gt;include current refinement techniques as special cases, but also&lt;br/&gt;provide more powerful mesh refining rules which allow both local&lt;br/&gt;and adaptive refinement of subdivision surfaces.  The results in&lt;br/&gt;the second area will also make it possible for a CAD/CAM system to&lt;br/&gt;include subdivision surfaces as a new and yet more general free-form&lt;br/&gt;surface modeling tool because B-splines and NURBS are special cases&lt;br/&gt;of subdivision surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
