<AbstractNarration>Mangel&lt;br/&gt;     The study of disease using mathematical models has a long&lt;br/&gt;and rich history.  Much interesting and new mathematics has been&lt;br/&gt;motivated by disease, because the problems are inherently&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear and multidimensional.  On the other hand, the emergence&lt;br/&gt;of new diseases, the re-emergence of older diseases, and the&lt;br/&gt;potential of bioterrorism require that the mathematics be not&lt;br/&gt;only interesting and new, but applied and applicable.  In most&lt;br/&gt;cases of disease outbreak or emergence, learning about the&lt;br/&gt;parameters of the disease will occur as it progresses.  Thus, the&lt;br/&gt;questions sit at the intersection of the biology of disease,&lt;br/&gt;modeling, and analysis of data.  In this project, the PI&lt;br/&gt;nvestigator seeks to apply the process of ecological detection,&lt;br/&gt;in which different models compete as explanations of process and&lt;br/&gt;the data arbitrate the outcome of this competittion, to emerging&lt;br/&gt;or re-emerging disease.  The mathematical theory of disease leads&lt;br/&gt;to fundamental characterizations such as the basic reproductive&lt;br/&gt;rate of the disease, the critical number of susceptibles for&lt;br/&gt;infectives to initially spread, and the number of infectives in&lt;br/&gt;the population at the time that the first infection/death is&lt;br/&gt;discovered.  These in turn depend on fundamental population&lt;br/&gt;parameters, and those are the focus of the proposed work.  Methods&lt;br/&gt;are developed so that, as a disease progresses, one can learn&lt;br/&gt;about the transmission coefficient of the disease, the&lt;br/&gt;distribution of susceptibles, the level of aggregation in&lt;br/&gt;encounters between susceptibles and infecteds, and the level of&lt;br/&gt;detail needed in the models, for purposes of both understanding&lt;br/&gt;and prediction.  These methods are based on analysis of&lt;br/&gt;appropriate differential equations, computer simulation,&lt;br/&gt;stochastic dynamic programming and Bayesian statistical updating.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, real populations exist in networks, rather than as&lt;br/&gt;randomly mixing individuals, about which two kinds of questions&lt;br/&gt;can be asked.  First, given a specific model for the transmission&lt;br/&gt;of disease, what kind of network is created and what are the&lt;br/&gt;properties of that network?  Second, given a network of social&lt;br/&gt;interactions, what can be said about the dynamics of the disease&lt;br/&gt;on this network?  Both sets of questions are investigated.&lt;br/&gt;     The proposed work provides new conceptual and operational&lt;br/&gt;tools in dealing with emerging and re-emerging diseases such as&lt;br/&gt;HIV/AIDS, epidemic behavior of hepatitis C, the outbreak of&lt;br/&gt;foot-and-mouth disease and BSE in the UK, the potential of&lt;br/&gt;smallpox as a bioterrorist agent, and malaria.  The project also&lt;br/&gt;provides training to the next generation of applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians and mathematical biologists, who -- more than any&lt;br/&gt;generation before them -- are keen to solve practical problems in&lt;br/&gt;the real world.  It thus represents science in the national&lt;br/&gt;interest at two different levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
