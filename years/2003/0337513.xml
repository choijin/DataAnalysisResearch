    <AbstractNarration>The APEC Cooperation for Earthquake Simulation (ACES), an international collaboration of scientists that has been meeting and working together since February 1999, represents a highly &lt;br/&gt;promising, new, Computational Science and Information Technology (CSIT) approach to the &lt;br/&gt;problem of understanding earthquake physics and dynamics. The purpose of this May 2004 workshop, with joint agency sponsorship by NASA is to review recent progress in several key areas of science and technology related to earthquake simulations, and to formulate joint plans for future progress. Work through ACES promotes understanding of earthquake processes. &lt;br/&gt;Scales ranging from microscopic to global, and timescales ranging from milliseconds to &lt;br/&gt;millennia are considered. One goal of ACES is to integrate these scales into comprehensive &lt;br/&gt;models that will improve understanding of how earthquakes occur and how faults are &lt;br/&gt;interconnected. The work is carried out through the application of computational technologies to &lt;br/&gt;improve modeling and interpretation capabilities. ACES activities and meetings involve students and academia from all of the participating countries. The work involves research and mentoring of students, as well as their participation in the working groups, workshops, and meetings. Many of the results are also communicated to the broader public through press releases and news stories.</AbstractNarration>
