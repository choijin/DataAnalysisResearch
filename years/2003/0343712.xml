<AbstractNarration>Proposal No. 0343712 is a continuation of an existing evaluation study designed to review the impact of the Rural Systemic Initiative (RSI) Program.  Since October 1, 2001, Systemic Research, Inc. has been working on this two-year NSF grant titled "Mathematics and Science Education in Rural America: An Evaluative Study of NSF's Rural Systemic Initiative."  Hence, the proposal requests support to continue collecting data through the 2002-03 school year.  The collection and analysis of the 2002-2003 data will complete a decade of ongoing research and evaluation of the RSI. The current activities of the grant to be expanded as a result of a one-year extension are:&lt;br/&gt;Development, collection, and compilation of RKID-2004&lt;br/&gt;Rural Math and Science Indicator Report:2004&lt;br/&gt;Publication of updated RSI Case Stories with additional indicator data&lt;br/&gt;RSI/RKID web site upgrade for enhanced communication, RKID management, and dissemination&lt;br/&gt;RSI/RKID Annual Workshop&lt;br/&gt;RSI Advisory Panel Meeting&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination of study results through printed copy, CD-ROM, and web.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
