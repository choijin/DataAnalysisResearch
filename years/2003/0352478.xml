<AbstractNarration>This thirty-three month project will develop and evaluate "My World," a learner-appropriate geographic information system (GIS), data library and learning activities.  The software and accompanying data and materials will support inquiry-based learning in middle and high school Earth science, environmental science and geography classes.  The project will complete development of the software, develop a community of users, create and disseminate a data library with appropriate activities and conduct an extensive evaluation.  The software development focuses on usability and scaffolding, functionality to support standards-based instruction and compatibility with school needs.  The community development effort builds a community of GIS experts in schools who will provide input to the design, develop associated materials and provide professional development.  The project will include a core data library for the geosciences with learning activities ready for distribution.  The evaluation effort will conduct formative and summative evaluations.  Part of this plan includes a comparison to traditional and to established methods.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Close cooperation with developers and publishers is included in the work plan and the PI anticipates these materials will be included in future secondary earth science courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
