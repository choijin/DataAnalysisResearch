<AbstractNarration>This exploratory proposal will present a new method which uses a Nickel-functionalized amphiphilic block copolymer pattern to separate and collect viruses.  Block copolymers can provide flexible transparent functional nanoscale devices with non-lithographic nanoscale patterns which could be made compatible with biologically active molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work is divided into two specific objectives:  The first deals with synthesizing and processing functionalized block copolymers, the second will apply these materials to biomimetic virus sensing.&lt;br/&gt;1. Nickel functionalized block copolymers will be synthesized and processed into thin films.&lt;br/&gt;2. Virus binding of different sizes and shapes (BV-GFP, TMV, TNV, PVX, CGMMV) will be carried out, and &lt;br/&gt;their specificity on the block copolymer pattern will be evaluated in aqueous and physiological media.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed exploratory methodologies for the synthesis and characterization of thin-film virus binding       nanoscale polymer patterns thus offer exciting avenues for the development of novel biosensing materials       and techniques.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed exploratory research relate to a block copolymer nanoscale device system which would apply in the identification, classification, and removal of viruses.  This is currently a very difficult task, but the need is widespread in diverse sectors, including national security (e.g. bioterrorism), human and animal health, crop protection, and biologics production.  The education activities to be undertaken in this work include undergraduate and graduate teaching, middle school teacher training, graduate student advising, and various opportunities in undergraduate research involvement and mentoring, as well as the development of a K-12 tailored interactive web page.&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported jointly by the NSF and the Intelligence Community.  The Approaches to Combat Terrorism Program in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences supports new concepts in basic research and workforce development with the potential to contribute to national security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
