    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop novel, highly integrated, high performance series of high frequency (Ka to W-band) GaAs Monolithic Voltage Controlled Oscillators (VCO) by efficient integration of hyperabrupt varactor diode with the Pseudomorphic High Electron Mobility Transistor (PHEMT) oscillator. This Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) will integrate the two exclusive doping profiles needed for the hyperabrupt varactor diode and the PHEMT process. This level of integration will simplify and improve the overall system performance and meet the cost compatibility for reliable commercial production. To date, there is no product in the world market, which is a fully integrated high frequency VCO. Moreover, the MMIC VCOs available so far have very low tuning range (120 MHz) and mediocre phase noise, which does not meet the demands of present day communication systems (tuning range of &gt;500 GHz). This technology will integrate a patented varactor diode with a millimeter wave VCO MMIC design to develop and deliver a family of single chip VCOs with over 1GHz bandwidth, low phase noise of -90dBc/Hz at 100 KHz with &gt; 16dBm output power for frequencies from 20 to 94 GHz.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A stable, wide tuning range, low phase noise, high power, light weight, low cost VCO MMIC is an essential component of any commercial and military wireless communication system. This project plan is to develop MMIC VCO at millimeter wave frequencies to enable low cost, small size commercial communication systems with high performance. The project will address the needs of high frequency commercial wireless communication systems world wide, ranging from Local Multi Point Distribution Systems (LMDS) at Ka-band to Automotive collusion avoidance communication systems at W-band. In addition, resulting product will contribute to Homeland security systems.</AbstractNarration>
