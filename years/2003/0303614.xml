<AbstractNarration>DMS-0303614&lt;br/&gt;Ionut Ciocan-Fontanine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to pursue a program based on the&lt;br/&gt;theory of derived moduli spaces towards calculating higher genus&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten invariants of certain Calabi-Yau threefolds, such as the&lt;br/&gt;quintic in projective 4-space. While computations of the genus zero&lt;br/&gt;invariants have been quite successful, leading to proofs of physicists'&lt;br/&gt;Mirror Symmetry - based predictions in that case, there has been no&lt;br/&gt;progress so far in higher genus. The main obstacle has been a lack of&lt;br/&gt;concrete understanding of the virtual fundamental classes of the moduli&lt;br/&gt;spaces of higher genus stable maps. In recent work, the PI and Kapranov&lt;br/&gt;have developed an approach to virtual classes via differential-graded (dg)&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. Dg-manifolds appear as derived versions of algebro-geometric&lt;br/&gt;moduli spaces. The PI and Kapranov constructed such a structure on the&lt;br/&gt;moduli spaces of stable maps. The greater flexibility of the dg-point&lt;br/&gt;of view restores some of the features that facilitated the genus zero&lt;br/&gt;computations. The ultimate goal is to prove the higher genus ``mirror&lt;br/&gt;theorem'', as predicted by the physicists Bershadsky, Cecotti, Ooguri,&lt;br/&gt;and Vafa. A crucial part of the program involves a novel construction of&lt;br/&gt;a virtual class in situations outside the reach of earlier approaches.&lt;br/&gt;This is of great independent interest in algebraic geometry, as it allows&lt;br/&gt;to extend the theory of virtual classes to all moduli spaces, as opposed&lt;br/&gt;to just the (rather small) subset to which it currently applies.&lt;br/&gt;Ciocan-Fontanine also proposes to establish a relationship between the&lt;br/&gt;genus zero Gromov-Witten theory of a GIT quotient X//G by a reductive&lt;br/&gt;algebraic group G, and that of the associated abelian quotient X//T,&lt;br/&gt;where T is a maximal torus in G. Precise conjectures are made on what the&lt;br/&gt;relationship is, inspired by results obtained recently by the PI and his&lt;br/&gt;collaborators in the case when X is a complex vector space and G is the&lt;br/&gt;general linear group. They are  consistent with expectations on how the&lt;br/&gt;physical theories associated to X//G and X//T are related and will be of&lt;br/&gt;interest to physicists, as well as to algebraic geometers.&lt;br/&gt;The third problem proposed by the PI is to give a proof of a combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;formula for the three-point, genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants of complex&lt;br/&gt;Grassmannians. This is the only outstanding unsolved problem remaining in&lt;br/&gt;``Quantum Schubert Calculus.''&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, which is one of the&lt;br/&gt;oldest branches of modern mathematics. In recent years, the methods and&lt;br/&gt;ideas of algebraic geometry, especially the study of moduli spaces, have&lt;br/&gt;been employed in string theory, a very active part of theoretical physics.&lt;br/&gt;Developments in string theory have  sparked a fruitful interaction between&lt;br/&gt;the two communities of researchers and have led to the discovery and study&lt;br/&gt;of many unexpected new phenomena. The theory of Gromov-Witten invariants&lt;br/&gt;and Mirror Symmetry are particularly striking examples.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
