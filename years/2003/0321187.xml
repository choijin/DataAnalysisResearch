<AbstractNarration>This grant provides support for the acquisition of a pulsed laser deposition system for research and educational training in materials science at Southwest Missouri &lt;br/&gt;State University (SMSU).  In recent years, a Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) system has emerged as a vital experimental tool for both research and education, particularly in materials science. This is due to its unique performance, versatility and success in synthesis of advanced materials and the development of cutting-edge technology. This technique has been extensively used to prepare high quality thin films of oxides, ferroelectrics, dielectrics, semiconductors, polymers, metals and alloys for applications in electronic, magnetic and optical devices.  A PLD system will enhance the materials preparation facility within the University.  In particular, the instrument will be used to synthesize thin films of the following electronic materials:  (1) semiconductors for photovoltaic applications;  (2) magnetic semiconductors for spintronic devices; (3) organic semiconductors for applications in infrared sensors and optoelectronic devices;  (4) perovskite ferroelectrics for nonvolatile ferroelectric random access memories; and (5) perovskite manganites for micromagnetics and charge ordering phenomena.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in areas of materials synthesis using the PLD system. The research and research training activities using the PLD system will greatly enhance students skills and experience in the synthesis of thin films allowing them to be better prepared for career related jobs in industry and academia. Since the PLD facility will be an integral part of undergraduate/graduate courses, it will attract more students.  A special summer workshop on the synthesis of electronic materials and their applications in real life problems will be conducted for students from community colleges, high schools in rural areas, and minority schools and colleges. This effort will boost career prospects in the areas of materials science of for many rural students and other underrepresented groups. In addition to strengthening the Materials Science program, the proposed equipment will broaden interdisciplinary cooperation between the other campus science departments and enhance present and future collaborations with other universities and research centers. The results from the proposed activities will be published in peer reviewed journals and presented at interdisciplinary conferences and scientific society meetings. This will enhance the scientific and technological understanding within different branches of science.  Finally, the proposed activities have important applications in the areas of defense informatics and bio technology that are of potential interest to society as it relates to homeland security and in general. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
