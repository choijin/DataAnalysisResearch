<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;NSF Proposal 0310297&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Practical yet Provably Secure Public-Key Primitives&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Victor Shoup&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses the fundamental building blocks, or primitives, of&lt;br/&gt;public-key cryptography, and attempts to design and analyze  new primitives&lt;br/&gt;that improve the state of the art, either through increased efficiency or&lt;br/&gt;increased security. The objectives are to design new primitives suitable for&lt;br/&gt;publication in academic journals, as well as for submission to relevant&lt;br/&gt;standards bodies. The methods used include (1) the "reductionist" approach of&lt;br/&gt;modern  cryptography, whereby the security of a scheme is formally reduced to&lt;br/&gt;the presumed intractability of well-studied mathematical problems (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;factoring), and (2) algorithmic techniques from number theory and algebra. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Public-key cryptography plays an essential role in securing computers and&lt;br/&gt;communication networks. The two basic public-key primitives are public-key&lt;br/&gt;encryption and digital signatures. The first primitive allows a sender to&lt;br/&gt;secretly transmit a message to a receiver, where the sender only needs to know&lt;br/&gt;a  public key (known to everyone), while only the receiver  needs to know the &lt;br/&gt;corresponding secret key. The second primitive allows a signer, using a secret&lt;br/&gt;key, to generate a digital signature on a message so that the signature can&lt;br/&gt;later be verified by any party using a corresponding public key.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although substantial progress has been made in recent years on these problems, &lt;br/&gt;there is still more work to do, in terms of improving the efficiency of the&lt;br/&gt;schemes, reducing the strength of the intractability assumptions,  improving&lt;br/&gt;the quality of the security reductions, and in developing practical distributed&lt;br/&gt;versions of these schemes so as to avoid a single point of failure. These are&lt;br/&gt;the specific tasks taken on by this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
