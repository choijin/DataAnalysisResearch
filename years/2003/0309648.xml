<AbstractNarration>Abstract, Proposal 0309648, Hunter, University of California-Davis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Nonlinear wave propagation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses fundamental and poorly understood issues in the&lt;br/&gt;theory of hyperbolic conservation laws,such as the ones that model&lt;br/&gt;compressible fluid mechanics. It also addresses problems in&lt;br/&gt;incompressible fluid mechanics and general relativity, and applies the&lt;br/&gt;results to a variety of important physical problems. A common theme of&lt;br/&gt;much of the proposed work is how nonlinearity leads to the formation&lt;br/&gt;and propagation of various kinds of singularities, such as shock waves&lt;br/&gt;in compressible fluids, or space-time singularities in general&lt;br/&gt;relativity. Specific topics proposed for study are the following:&lt;br/&gt;shock wave reflection; shock wave propagation in random media;&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear hyperbolic surface waves in elasticity and&lt;br/&gt;magnetohydrodynamics; the Prandtl boundary layer equations and&lt;br/&gt;vorticity wave, mean flow interactions in incompressible fluid&lt;br/&gt;mechanics; and the effect of nonlinearity on gravitational waves in&lt;br/&gt;general relativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waves (such as sound waves, seismic waves, light waves, quantum&lt;br/&gt;mechanical waves,or gravitational waves) are a central feature of many&lt;br/&gt;physical systems, from the atomic to the cosmological scales. At lower&lt;br/&gt;intensities, waves superpose and they may be described by linear&lt;br/&gt;theories, but at higher intensities nonlinear effects becomes&lt;br/&gt;significant, leading to qualitatively new phenomena (like shock waves&lt;br/&gt;and solitons). Nonlinear waves are much more difficult to analyse&lt;br/&gt;mathematically than linear waves, and are often of great practical&lt;br/&gt;importance. For example, shock waves form around aircraft that travel&lt;br/&gt;close to the speed of sound. One aim of this project is to study&lt;br/&gt;basic, but not fully understood, shock wave phenomena, such as their&lt;br/&gt;reflection from walls. Among other topics, the project also includes a&lt;br/&gt;study of nonlinear surface waves, such as the Rayleigh waves which are&lt;br/&gt;generated by earthquakes and are used in a variety of ultrasonic&lt;br/&gt;devices, and a study of the formation and propagation of space-time&lt;br/&gt;singularities in gravitational waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
