    <AbstractNarration>This three-year project will develop 15 units of information and computer-based learning materials keyed to the grades 3-8 National Science Education Standards. The emphasis is on helping students develop a deep understanding of science inquiry, which is supported through innovative uses of computers, probeware and networking. The PI reports that Informational and Computer Technologies (ICT) are particularly valuable at helping students understand cause-and-effect relationships, to visualize change, to gain insights into the ways systems act, to relate math, science, and technology and to support explorations of emergent behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fifteen units will be developed by experienced curriculum specialists, scientists and teachers to support an active inquiry-based learning environment, and these units will be appropriate for use with a wide range of curriculum materials. The design is such that it is possible for schools with limited resources to use the materials. Included are software, implementation assistance for teachers, an online course for teachers and materials for parents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two rounds of formative testing and a full year of summative assessment are planned. Test schools include under-resourced urban and rural schools throughout the US. Dissemination will include generic materials available free from the project website and product-specific materials from publishers and vendors.</AbstractNarration>
