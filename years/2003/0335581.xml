    <AbstractNarration>The proposers plan to develop a system for building evaluation capacity at both the instructional and institutional level of a community college that will have the potential to be disseminated to other community colleges. The CLIP process will help college faculty develop and apply assessment and inquiry sills to (a) identify meaningful student learning outcomes, (b) assess student learning sensitive to issues of women and minorities in science and mathematics, and (c) assess programs and courses to determine the relationship between instructional practices and student learning. At an institutional level, administrators and faculty will learn to apply student and program assessment and system change knowledge as they adjust institutional program review systems and identify other policies, practices and structures to support the evaluative work of the faculty.</AbstractNarration>
