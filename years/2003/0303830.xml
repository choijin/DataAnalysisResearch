<AbstractNarration>This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to Professor Kevin Kittredge supports the design of a set of experiments in sequential courses that incorporate nanotechnology into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at Miami University at Middletown.  Students benefit from these vertically integrated experiments will be involved in multiple aspects of a project in a manner that mimics a research project under a mentor's supervision.  Initially, the student synthesizes a target molecule in an organic chemistry course, and learns molecular characterization techniques, such as NMR and IR.  In their next course, either quantitative analytical chemistry and/or chemical technology, the student prepares colloidal nanoparticles and studies selective ion-binding of metal cations by titration.  In a second analytical chemistry course the student prepares a 2-dimensional self-assembled monolayer and studies ion selectivity by cyclic voltammetry.  Lastly, in their physical chemistry course, the student studies the origins of the strong plasmon emissions that appear in the UV and fluorescence spectra for these nanoparticles.  Students write a report for a particular class then rewrite it for each subsequent course, which is expected to lead to better student learning.  Experiments will be evaluated at each stage and a final assessment conducted.  Dissemination of experimental details will be made by both a web site and private publishing.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering program announcement, NSF 02-148, category NUE.  The focus is on developing laboratories that will introduce nanoscience to undergraduate students at two different locations, Miami University Middletown (a two-year regional campus) and Miami University Oxford (a traditional four-year university).  The vertically integrated nanotechnology curriculum is designed to prepare students to answer the challenges of society and the scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
