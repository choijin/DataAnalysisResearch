<AbstractNarration>Neurobiology of Drosophila Meeting&lt;br/&gt;Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory&lt;br/&gt; October 1-5, 2003&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned conference on the "Neurobiology of Drosophila" will convene a group of junior and senior scientists to discuss the latest advances in the neurosciences which are being made in the highly successful model system of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. This proposal seeks support for the 2003 conference, which is the 10th biennnial international meeting in a series that focuses on the advances made as the combined power of genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology, and behavioral analysis are brought to bear on fundamental problems in neurobiology.  The topics covered will range from molecular biology to complex behavior and include: neuronal and glial specification, axon guidance and target recognition, synaptic function, neurophysiology, neuronal cell biology and pathology, and complex behavior (e.g., circadian rhythms and learning and memory).  By vote of the previous participants, the meeting will remain of moderate size (300 participants) and will have no parallel sessions, in order to facilitate discussion, exchange of ideas and techniques, and to promote new collaborations in this rapidly evolving field.  All applicants will be encouraged to submit an abstract and the majority of participants will either give a talk or present a poster. The speakers will be chosen from the most timely and interesting abstracts submitted a few months in advance of the conference, to ensure that late-breaking science is covered in all of the talks.  In the event that the conference is oversubscribed, participants will be chosen to include at least one representative from each participating laboratory.  This conference has an established history of highlighting the work of younger investigators and women. To encourage participation by junior investigators, a special lecture is presented by the graduate student who has written the best Ph.D. thesis since the previous meeting (Elkins lecture). &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
