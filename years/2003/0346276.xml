<AbstractNarration>Award Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IBN-0346276&lt;br/&gt;PI  Stephen D. Ebbs  &lt;br/&gt;Intraspecific Variation in Thlaspi Caerulescens: The Key to Increasing Metal Sequestration in Plants&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Metal hyperaccumulation and hypertolerance are unique traits observed in a limited variety of plant species from around the world.  A relatively understudied aspect with respect to metal hyperaccumulating plant species is the natural variation in hyperaccumulation and tolerance observed between populations within a species (i.e., intraspecific variation).  For example, recent studies have shown marked differences in the hyperaccumulation of Cd and Zn across populations of Thlaspi caerulescens.  The inherent variability in hyperaccumulation displayed by T. caerulescens and the unique cellular and subcellular patterns of metal distribution (e.g. - epidermal and vacuolar sequestration) in leaves provide a natural model system in which to examine the leaf-level mechanisms that control metal homeostasis.  Understanding the basis of this variation will contribute to the ongoing efforts to develop more efficient hyperaccumulators for metal phytoremediation and metal "bio-mining".   To examine these leaf-level mechanisms, this project will (1) use cell viability assays to compare the metal tolerance of leaf mesophyll cells from different populations of T. caerulescens to determine the contribution of these cells to the intraspecific variation in metal hyperaccumulation; (2) conduct radiotracer transport studies with isolated vacuoles and/or vacuole membranes from different populations to determine whether intraspecific variation in the rate or extent of vacuolar sequestration contributes to hyperaccumulation; and (3) use 2-D protein gel electrophoresis to determine if the more efficient metal-accumulating plant populations possess novel proteins that contribute to their ability to tolerate and sequester metals in leaves.  Together the results of this study will add to our understanding of the relationship between metal distribution in leaves and the extent to which different populations of T. caerulescens hyperaccumulate Cd and Zn.  This unique insight into the metal dynamics in leaves will be instrumental in the development of higher biomass plants for phytoremediation.  The proposed research will provide training for two undergraduate students (including one female non-traditional student) in plant transport physiology and molecular physiology, including hydroponic culture techniques, use of radioisotopes, cellular and biochemical fractionation, 2-D protein gel electrophoresis, elemental analysis, experimental design, and statistical analysis (e.g., ANOVA).  This array of techniques is at the forefront of modern plant physiology and molecular biology.  Students will take primary responsibility for specific aspects of this research, through the preparation of manuscripts for submission to peer-reviewed journals, building foundation skills important to their future career goals.    &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
