<AbstractNarration>0300086&lt;br/&gt;Weikle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to investigate and develop a new approach for the non-invasive measurement and characterization of integrated microwave and millimeter-wave circuit modules.  This work, in particular, aims to address present-day difficulties and challenges associated with measuring and characterizing high-frequency subsystems that are integrated with other components on a single circuit board or chip. The ultimate goal of this program is the development of a non-contacting network analyzer for the direct, in-situ measurement of scattering parameters of integrated or on-chip microwave and millimeter-wave subsystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activities to be undertaken during this project will include the refinement and application of device and IC processing technologies to the development of fully-integrated network analyzer sampling circuits, the establishment of calibration standards and procedures for non-contacting measurement schemes, and the investigation, design, and demonstration of non-contacting reflectometers for s-parameter measurements. These activities will directly address and impact the merit review criteria set forth by the National Science Foundation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1)The intellectual merit of this project lies in its potential to significantly expand&lt;br/&gt;and improve the measurement and diagnostic capabilities currently employed&lt;br/&gt;for high-frequency integrated circuits. This will not only benefit the microwave&lt;br/&gt;measurements community but will significantly impact all fields that rely on&lt;br/&gt;millimeter and submillimeter-wave instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2)The broad impact of this proposed work will be felt by researchers working on&lt;br/&gt;high-frequency integrated systems as well as students, researchers, and faculty&lt;br/&gt;at the University of Virginia and other institutions. The instrumentation de-&lt;br/&gt;veloped through this program will enhance and complement the capabilities of&lt;br/&gt;the PI's research and teaching laboratories while the close involvement and partici-&lt;br/&gt;pation of graduate and undergraduate students will be crucial to supporting the&lt;br/&gt;educational mission of the university and provide an avenue for incorporating&lt;br/&gt;this work into the existing curriculum. In addition, through current collabora-&lt;br/&gt;tive work with other institutions, the technical achievements developed from this&lt;br/&gt;program will be shared and disseminated directly to the communities that rely&lt;br/&gt;on millimeter and submillimeter-wave systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will culminate with the demonstration of a fully-integrated non-contacting&lt;br/&gt;s-parameter measurement system operating in the millimeter-wave range and scalable to frequencies reaching into the submillimeter spectrum&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
