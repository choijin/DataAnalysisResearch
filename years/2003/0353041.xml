<AbstractNarration>This Keystone Symposium on Emerging Mechanisms of Epigenetic Regulation will focus on the study of epigenetics and its impact on many different areas of biological sciences.  Some of the aspects of epigenetic phenomena are beginning to be understood, but the underlying mechanisms are still unknown.  This Symposium will attempt to find common themes and differences across all phyla (fungi, plants, animals) in phenomena such as genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, RNA-interference, and paramutation.  The Symposium will bring together a diverse range of researchers in a meeting setting that promotes interaction and discussion.  The Symposium is devoted to providing an atmosphere that promotes the research and careers of young investigators, so the participation of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty is being strongly encouraged.  In addition, one of the Symposium's goals is to strengthen the voice of underrepresented minorities, women, and persons with disabilities in the field.  To achieve this, organizers have set aside speaking slots for young investigators and will choose additional speakers from submitted abstracts.  The Program already includes a significant number of prominent women scientist speakers who can act as role models for young women attendees.  The Symposium will defray the cost of attendance for a number of young scientists and participants from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
