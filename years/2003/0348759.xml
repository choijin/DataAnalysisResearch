    <AbstractNarration>Mimicking natural organisms to solve engineering design problems has triggered revolutionary developments in bio-medical and material sciences. In these instances the natural and the engineering design problems are most often closely related, and a direct transfer of design concepts was possible. However, to fully&lt;br/&gt;exploit natural design concepts and to apply biomimetic design approaches to a broad range of engineering design problems, a formal design framework based on abstraction and synthesis is needed to facilitate the fundamental understanding of biomimetic design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This career-development plan is motivated by the challenges of extending biomimetics into a formal design approach. The proposed work will provide a formal design framework, will allow the systematic study of a broad range of natural systems, and will foster the rapid integration of biologically inspired solutions&lt;br/&gt;into engineering design. The research projects will focus on the development and the application of unique optimization tools for the biomimetic design of adaptive, shape-controlled, macro and micro systems.&lt;br/&gt;Controlling the shape is an essential capability of most adaptive systems, such as optical micro-electromechanical switches and next generation aircraft equipped with morphing wings. Design oriented courses, enhanced by a new educational design optimization software platform, and vertically integrated design teams will promote the skills of future design engineers. Outreach activities will promote engineering design disciplines among K-12 students and underrepresented groups. The research and&lt;br/&gt;educational activities will be enhanced by comprehensive collaborations with physiologists, design groups at national laboratories, and software companies.</AbstractNarration>
