<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL NO.:   CTS-0341911&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS:  EDWIN A COWEN&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION:   CORNELL UNIVERSITY &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE NON-CONTACT DETERMINATION OF RIVER FLOW RATES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for monitoring the flow rates for over 7000 rivers across the United States. This monitoring mandate is expensive and often hazardous, as it requires direct in-the-field measurements by USGS personnel during storm events.  The USGS, as well as other agencies responsible for river flow monitoring around the world, is extremely interested in the development of remote non-contact flow rate measurement capabilities.  This grant is to develop an infrared-based quantitative imaging system for the determination of surface velocity fields and velocity fields at depth via remote non-contact means.  The latter will be accomplished by considering the vertical turbulent thermal structure of river flows under non-equilibrium conditions.  The proposed image analysis algorithms will be derived from the PI's previous development work with particle image velocimetry (PIV).  The ultimate goal of this work is to develop a robust tool for the non-contact monitoring of river flows.  The infrared measurement technique will have wide ranging uses beyond river flow monitoring including direct measurements of surface renewal for air-water gas transfer studies, near-surface transport of sediment in shallow sediment laden flows (such as the swash zone), as well as near-surface conditions in other two-phase flows such as aerated flows (e.g., the surf zone).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
