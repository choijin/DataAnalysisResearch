    <AbstractNarration>Many changes in K-12 education have created an increased and critical need for effective&lt;br/&gt;professional development for teachers. These changes include new standards; new&lt;br/&gt;curriculum and assessments; changes in student demographics; advances in classroom&lt;br/&gt;technology; and a growing shortage of qualified teachers. To address this need, many&lt;br/&gt;educational organizations are turning to web-based, online professional development,&lt;br/&gt;which can provide teachers with flexible scheduling and access to resources, mentors,&lt;br/&gt;and peers that would not be available otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significant body of research enables us to define principles of effective professional&lt;br/&gt;development in face-to-face settings, and some research is available showing that online&lt;br/&gt;courses can be effective at the college and high school levels. However, very little&lt;br/&gt;research is available about the effectiveness of online professional development in which&lt;br/&gt;the goals are to impact both the content knowledge and the classroom practices of K-12&lt;br/&gt;teachers. The proposed project will begin to establish a solid research base about online&lt;br/&gt;professional development by addressing three major questions, which fall under ROLE&lt;br/&gt;Program Quadrant III, Research on STEM Learning in Education Settings:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. What is the comparative impact on teachers' content knowledge and instructional&lt;br/&gt;practices of alternative models of online professional development, face-to-face&lt;br/&gt;models, and hybrid models that combine the two?&lt;br/&gt;2. How do the types of interactions among participants and between participants and&lt;br/&gt;workshop leaders differ across different online professional development models, and&lt;br/&gt;are these differences related to participants' satisfaction, knowledge acquisition, and&lt;br/&gt;changes in practice?&lt;br/&gt;3. What are the factors that maximize the impact of online professional development on&lt;br/&gt;teachers' content knowledge and instructional practices?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address these questions, the project will develop and implement a series of contrastive&lt;br/&gt;professional development workshops, including several online models, hybrid models&lt;br/&gt;that integrate some face-to-face meetings into the context of online workshops, and a&lt;br/&gt;more traditional onsite workshop model. The workshops will focus on topics selected&lt;br/&gt;from the middle school mathematics curriculum, and seek to both deepen participants'&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the mathematics and enhance their approaches to teaching this content.&lt;br/&gt;Within each content area, the goals, learning activities, teaching approach, and time&lt;br/&gt;requirements for participants will be held as constant as possible across workshop&lt;br/&gt;models. Multiple measures, including assessments of participants' content knowledge&lt;br/&gt;within the context of teaching tasks, participant surveys and interviews, analyses of&lt;br/&gt;lesson plans and student work, classroom observations, student surveys, and discourse&lt;br/&gt;analyses will be employed to address the three main research questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will inform educational policy makers, school and district administrators,&lt;br/&gt;professional development providers, faculty in teacher preparation programs, and&lt;br/&gt;teachers, as well as the research community.</AbstractNarration>
