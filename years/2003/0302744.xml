<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GEOMETRIC DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS AND APPLICATIONS&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Gang Tian (M.I.T.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal concerns existence and regularity problems of the Einstein &lt;br/&gt;equation, the Yang-Mills equation on Riemannian manifolds and &lt;br/&gt;pseudo-holomorphic curves, as well as applications of these equations to &lt;br/&gt;geometry and topology. For the Einstein equation, we will focus mainly on &lt;br/&gt;(1) the existence of its solutions, particularly, K\"ahler-Einstein metrics &lt;br/&gt;in complex geometry and (2) behavior of its singular solutions. I will also &lt;br/&gt;study the associated K\"ahler-Ricci flow and its soliton-type solutions. &lt;br/&gt;The Yang-Mills equation is a nonlinear equation and may have singular &lt;br/&gt;solutions. We will study the basic problem how singular solutions behave &lt;br/&gt;along their singularity, e.q., the size of singularity. It has been found &lt;br/&gt;in my previous works that there is a connection between singularity &lt;br/&gt;formation of Yang-Mills fields and classical minimal submanifolds. I intend &lt;br/&gt;to explore this more and its related compactness problem for Yang-Mills &lt;br/&gt;fields, particularly, the interaction between self-dual solutions the &lt;br/&gt;Yang-Mills equation and calibrated geometry. I also intend to continue his &lt;br/&gt;study in symplectic geometry. The problems include symplectic isotopy &lt;br/&gt;problem in a rational surface and its applications toward classifying &lt;br/&gt;symplectic four dimensional spaces, computing well-defined symplectic &lt;br/&gt;invariants, such as the Gromov-Witten invariants, constructing new &lt;br/&gt;deformation invariants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Problems in this proposal arose naturally from our attempts to &lt;br/&gt;understanding nonlinear differential equations from geometry and physics. &lt;br/&gt;These equations include static Einstein equation, Yang-Mills fields as well &lt;br/&gt;as holomorphic maps. They played a fundamental role in our understanding of &lt;br/&gt;nature through mathematical means. They also have found many deep &lt;br/&gt;applications in geometry and topology, such as Seiberg-Witten theory, &lt;br/&gt;Mirror symmetry of Calabi-Yau spaces. The resolution of these problems will &lt;br/&gt;provide mathematical foundations for some physical theories and have &lt;br/&gt;profound applications to long-standing mathematical problems. Most natural &lt;br/&gt;phenomena are nonlinear and possess singular behaviors. These are reflected &lt;br/&gt;in possible singular solutions to the differential equations which describe &lt;br/&gt;those phenomena. It is still challenging to have a complete mathematical &lt;br/&gt;understanding of these singular solutions. This proposal will address some &lt;br/&gt;of these basic problems. I will also try to find more solutions of these &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear equations -and apply them to studying basic problems in geometry &lt;br/&gt;and topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
