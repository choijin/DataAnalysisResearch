<AbstractNarration>Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;SES 0347346&lt;br/&gt;Stuart W. Leslie, Johns Hopkins University&lt;br/&gt;"Monitoring the Environment" &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funds to support young scholar travel to  participate in a workshop, "Monitoring the Environment: Scales, Methods, and Systems in Historical Perspective", co-sponsored by the Society for the History of Technology and the American Society for Environmental History.  The workshop will bring together two groups of historians who frequently read one another's work and share a number of common interests but have never organized a joint workshop.  Approaching the topic from the twin perspectives of environmental and technological history will open a dialogue on how to identify and study the key issues involved in setting and enforcing environmental standards.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the workshop is two-fold.  First, the workshop will facilitate contact between two groups of historians who approach the topic of environmental monitoring from very different points of view.  Just as importantly, the opportunity for young scholars to hear and critique one another's work will set the stage for future cooperation and collaboration.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
