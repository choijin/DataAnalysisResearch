<AbstractNarration>CNS-0340813&lt;br/&gt;Dee Weikle&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Virginia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Caches as Filters Benchmark Characterization and Demonstration&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ADVANCE Fellows award provides support to for a project to use the caches-as-filters framework to characterize benchmark suites, specifically for the purpose of cache design, and to demonstrate the use of the framework on the design of a small-scale caching system.  The caches-as-filters framework addresses difficulties in using a benchmark methodology for memory hierarchy design.  The demonstration of this framework could encourage the architecture community to use design methodologies that include more analysis resulting in a deeper understanding of design issue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in the opportunity to provide a theoretic basis for a systematic approach to cache design.  The characterizations of the benchmarks provide useful insight into the kinds of memory systems behavior found in real-world program and thus may contribute to the current understanding in the field of computer memory management. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include development of new tools that can be used by computer architecture research groups. This may include development of new ways in which researchers will frame problems and communicate about them as well as convey their ideas to students.  The project includes both graduate and undergraduate students within a supportive environment. There is a strong commitment to dissemination, through a graduate course, web site and publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
