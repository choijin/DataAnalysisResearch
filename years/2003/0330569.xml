<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;A grant has been awarded to Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory under the direction of Dr. B. Kloeppel to construct a construct a conference facility as part of Phase III of the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory Facilities Development Plan.  The comprehensive multi-phase facilities plan has been developed to meet current and future research, education, and training needs. The 2185-ha laboratory, located in the southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, is a USDA Forest Service property where the Southern Research Station (SRS) and the University of Georgia (UGA) jointly administer cooperative research. Within the past eight years, the research program has substantially broadened to include regional analyses of causes and consequences of land-use change in the southern Appalachians as part of the LTER program. When combined with other research activities, more than 100 investigators are currently conducting studies at Coweeta. Completion of this project will provide the infrastructure needed to sustain and build the science and education programs at Coweeta by providing facilities to support of more and larger groups of visiting students, scientists, land managers as well as the general public. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
