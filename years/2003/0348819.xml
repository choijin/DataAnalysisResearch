<AbstractNarration>This project will enhance and further develop an existing community air quality model to produce a truly integrated weather-chemistry model capable of better forecasting the abundance and transport of particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere.  The P.I. will initially further develop the Model of Aerosol Dynamics, Reaction, Ionization and Dissolution (MADRID) to improve how aerosols are treated in a real atmosphere.  These improvements will be combined with an existing cloud chemistry model and both incorporated into NOAA's Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) Air Quality prediction system version 1 (WRFAQV1) model, followed by a series of evaluations of model performance with a view to producing an operational version for ozone and PM forecasts.  Forecasting air quality (or "Chemical Weather") is an emerging area of research interest crossing disciplinary boundaries within the atmospheric science community, and this research has far reaching implications for human exposure, health and regulatory policy.  The broader science impacts of this study lie in making substantive and necessary contributions to improving tools required for more reliable predictions of air quality in the future.  The P.I. will integrate this research into a number of education and outreach activities.  The project will contribute substantively to the professional development of an early career female faculty at a major State research and teaching university, support research training and higher education of two graduate students and provide a number of summer undergraduate internships in collaboration with two industry partners.  The education plan also includes opportunities for course development, student participation in research, and public outreach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report NSF Project Title: CAREER: Forecasting Chemical Weather with a Coupled Meteorology-Chemistry Model System: Research and Education Challenges    Yang Zhang   North Carolina State University Raleigh, NC 27695    Air quality refers to the chemical state of the atmosphere at a given time and place.  Like weather, air quality affects everyone.  Exposure to high levels of these species may pose serious health concerns such as eye irritation, difficulty breathing, cancer, and premature death.  These pollutants and their derivatives can also cause many adverse effects on the environment including visibility impairment, acid deposition, global climate change, water quality deterioration, and plant and eco-environmental system damage. Air quality forecasting (AQF), a new discipline of applied sciences,  can predict the concentrations of pollutants of special health concerns such as surface ozone and fine particle concentrations for the next few days.  Such information can be used to issue early air quality alerts that will allow people to take precautionary measures (e.g., car pooling during Ozone Action Days) to avoid or limit their exposures to unhealthy levels of air quality.  AQF represents one of the most far-reaching development and practical applications of science and engineering and provides significant opportunities for science dissemination and community participations.   In light of severe air pollution problems worldwide and increased societal demands and public awareness, in this project, we developed a state-of-the-science AQF model system that is capable of forecasting major air pollutants in short- and long-term and that is applicable for both research-grade studies and real-time operational forecasts.  This AQF model system was developed based on the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationÆs Weather Research and Forecast model with chemistry.  It contains advanced gas-phase mechanisms and aerosol treatments.  The AQF model has been tested retrospectively for different seasons over several regions in the U.S. and abroad.  It was deployed for real-time air quality forecast for the southeastern U.S. since summer 2009.  The forecasting products are posted and updated on a daily basis at http://www.meas.ncsu.edu/aqforecasting/Real_Time.html.  The 2-day forecasts provide concentrations of gaseous and particulate species that can be utilized in many areas such as regulatory emission control, public health, health insurance costs, agriculture, work efficiency and industrial management.  This AQF model has been evaluated using real-time air quality measurements and demonstrated a very good forecasting skill in accurately simulating concentrations of air pollutants.    The results of this project led or will lead to 40 journal publications (32 published and 8 in review or preparation), 73 conference presentations, 2 book chapters, and will provide research material for one book.  These results have been and will be tremendous benefit to all stakeholders including the general public, air quality managers, and scientific community for several reasons:  (1) The development of this AQF model significantly enhanced our understanding of the formation mechanisms of major air pollutants and the results will provide a scientific basis for the development of emission control strategies;  (2) The AQF information can be used regularly by federal, state, and local agencies, as well as general public to take preventative actions and protect public health and environment;  (3) The multi-year AQF results and their evaluation using observations will provide a useful benchmark for other model development and improvement, as well as invaluable historic information on air quality climatology for the southeastern U.S.  (4) The technical and computational challenges posed by air quality forecasting fostered and will continuously foster the development of new and efficient mathematical/computational techniques to m...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
