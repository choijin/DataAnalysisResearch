<AbstractNarration>Manning&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator and his students and colleagues study&lt;br/&gt;elastic rod models of biological molecules, including DNA and&lt;br/&gt;coiled-coil proteins.  In the case of DNA, a classical rod model&lt;br/&gt;is enhanced by including intrinsic curvature, flexibility, and&lt;br/&gt;deformations imposed by protein-binding.  Among other&lt;br/&gt;applications, this model is used to analyze cyclization&lt;br/&gt;experiments, which can probe DNA and protein structure and&lt;br/&gt;flexibility under biologically realistic solvent conditions.  The&lt;br/&gt;large deformations imposed on DNA by cyclization and bound&lt;br/&gt;proteins require the consideration of DNA self-contact, a topic&lt;br/&gt;of contemporary interest in elasticity theory.  The stability of&lt;br/&gt;configurations in the presence of such self-contact is a major&lt;br/&gt;mathematical focus of the investigator's work.  On the protein&lt;br/&gt;side, the rod model is applied to alpha-helical protein regions&lt;br/&gt;that are interwound into coiled coils.  The application of this&lt;br/&gt;model to classical polymer physics experiments, such as atomic&lt;br/&gt;force microscopy and single-molecule pulling experiments, should&lt;br/&gt;shed light on the mechanical properties of these coiled coils, in&lt;br/&gt;much the same way as this combination has done for DNA.&lt;br/&gt;     The past several decades have seen the mathematical theory&lt;br/&gt;of elastic rods contribute considerably to the understanding of&lt;br/&gt;DNA.  Enhancements in both the model and DNA experiments have&lt;br/&gt;allowed researchers to address more and more biologically&lt;br/&gt;interesting questions, such as the connection between base-pair&lt;br/&gt;sequence and DNA structure.  The investigator has contributed to&lt;br/&gt;this research field, via several recent projects involving&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate research students on such questions as the&lt;br/&gt;flexibility of the TATA box sequence in DNA (which plays an&lt;br/&gt;important role in the transcribing of the genetic code to RNA)&lt;br/&gt;and the stability of rods in contact with obstacles (an important&lt;br/&gt;precursor to understanding the stability of DNA supercoiled&lt;br/&gt;around itself).  In addition to further pursuing these studies,&lt;br/&gt;the investigator extends these techniques to an area where they&lt;br/&gt;have seen little application: proteins.  There has been a growth&lt;br/&gt;in recent interest in coiled coils, a subset of proteins with&lt;br/&gt;basic structure plausibly like DNA.  The investigator is in an&lt;br/&gt;active collaboration with a group of protein biologists,&lt;br/&gt;chemists, and physicists on a nanotechnology project to design&lt;br/&gt;protein wires using coiled coils.  The expertise developed from&lt;br/&gt;this collaboration, combined with the investigator's experience&lt;br/&gt;in modeling DNA, provides an excellent opportunity to make a&lt;br/&gt;first step at designing a rod theory for coiled coils, which will&lt;br/&gt;be a useful theoretical tool in the engineering of protein wires,&lt;br/&gt;in much the same way that the rod model has proven useful for&lt;br/&gt;understanding DNA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
