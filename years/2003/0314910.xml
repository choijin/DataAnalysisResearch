<AbstractNarration>The MSTP Project: Mathematics Across the MST Curriculum is improving teaching and learning in middle-level mathematics in 10 school districts in New York.  Core partners include Hofstra University, State University of New York at Stony Brook, New York State Education Department, and 10 Long Island school districts (Amityville Union Free School District, Brentwood Union Free School District, Freeport Central School District, Hempstead Union Free School District, Longwood Central School District, Riverhead Central School District, Uniondale Union Free School District, Westbury Union Free School District, William Floyd Central School District, Wyandanch Union Free School District). Core and supporting partners are developing and implementing a model for increasing the diversity of the teaching workforce; enhancing university faculty's understanding of middle school reform, learning standards, and assessments; increasing middle school mathematics, science, and technology teachers' understanding of mathematics content and pedagogy; and improving curriculum alignment among the mathematics, science, and technology disciplines.  MSTP integrates three components: (1) collaborative professional development for school-based and higher education faculty; 2) curriculum revision and alignment; and 3) recruitment of underrepresented minority undergraduates in mathematics , science, and engineering into teaching careers.  The project is establishing ten Collaborative School Support Teams, each consisting of two university mathematics, science, or engineering faculty and five school district personnel including middle school mathematics, science, and technology teachers, a middle school principal, and a human services professional who will provide leadership for home and school initiatives. Supporting partners include the Long Island Regional School Support Center, Boards of Cooperative Educational Services, professional teacher associations in science, mathematics, and technology, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the Eisenhower Regional Alliance for Mathematics and Science Education.  The partnership expects to directly engage 300 teachers, 20 higher education faculty, and 12,000 students per year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
