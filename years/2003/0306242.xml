<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DIRECTIONS IN INDEX THEORY AND RIEMANNIAN GEOMETRY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal concerns geometric questions about various&lt;br/&gt;types of spaces, namely smooth Riemannian manifolds, measured&lt;br/&gt;metric spaces, singular spaces and noncommutative spaces.&lt;br/&gt;The questions about smooth Riemannian manifolds concern&lt;br/&gt;curvature conditions, such as when a compact manifold-with-boundary&lt;br/&gt;can admit a metric having nonnegative scalar curvature on the interior&lt;br/&gt;and nonnegative mean curvature on the boundary, and when a closed&lt;br/&gt;manifold can admit a metric with positive p-curvature tensor.&lt;br/&gt;The questions about measured metric spaces concern possible&lt;br/&gt;extensions of the Ricci tensor to such spaces.  The&lt;br/&gt;questions about singular spaces concern elliptic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;The questions about noncommutative geometry concern local proofs&lt;br/&gt;of the general foliation index theorem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As mathematics and physics have evolved, the concept of space has also&lt;br/&gt;evolved.  Some evident examples from physics are the evolution from&lt;br/&gt;flat space to curved space, and the evolution from the classical phase&lt;br/&gt;space to the quantum mechanical Hilbert space.  There have also been&lt;br/&gt;reasons intrinsic to mathematics that lead one to extend&lt;br/&gt;the notion of space. Of course, one does not want to make arbitrary&lt;br/&gt;definitions, but one rather wants to consider concepts that arise&lt;br/&gt;naturally from real problems.&lt;br/&gt;A more recent notion of space falls under the heading of&lt;br/&gt;``noncommutative geometry'', in which a traditional space is&lt;br/&gt;first considered to be defined in terms of the functions on it, and then&lt;br/&gt;the ring of functions is generalized from the commutative case to allow&lt;br/&gt;for a noncommutative ring of ``functions''.  Noncommutative geometry&lt;br/&gt;is rooted in the branch of geometric analysis called index theory.&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes problems about ordinary ``commutative'' spaces, such as&lt;br/&gt;foliations, can be translated into&lt;br/&gt;problems about noncommutative spaces and attacked from that angle.&lt;br/&gt;Many of the questions considered in this&lt;br/&gt;proposal have their roots in physics.  Throughout the years there has&lt;br/&gt;been much fruitful interaction between mathematics and physics, and&lt;br/&gt;the proposed work will hopefully contribute to this interaction.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, questions about positive scalar curvature arise in&lt;br/&gt;general relativity theory, and noncommutative geometry touches on many&lt;br/&gt;areas of modern theoretical physics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
