<AbstractNarration>0304573&lt;br/&gt;Fainman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoscale science and technology are playing an increasingly important role in development of future technologies for information systems including computing, communications, display, lighting, high-resolution imaging, and sensing.  Optical and photonic technologies are recognized as enablers in most of these applications. However, construction of engineered nanostructured optical materials, resonant nanostructures such as photonic crystals, and integrated nanophotonic active and passive devices and systems is one of the most challenging tasks. It is evident that further advances in nanophotonic technology will rely on our ability to develop (i) efficient design and modeling tools, (ii) advanced nanofabrication techniques, and (iii) visualization and imaging tools (for both structural and functional tests).  These challenges need to be investigated in an integrated program enabling evaluation and comparison of the calculated predictions and the experimental verifications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to conduct basic research by investigating theoretically and verifying experimentally the complex amplitude of the near-field on the nanoscale and with femtosecond time resolution for various nanophotonic devices at operation wavelength.  The proposed research will focus on (i) construction of a near-field optical microscope allowing measurement of the amplitude and phase of optical near-fields with femtosecond resolution; (ii) experimental investigation of the optical field and its localization in nanophotonic devices, and (iii) study of near-fields in optical nanostructures operating in a nonlinear regime. The proposed research will investigate near-field interactions in artificial nanostructured materials, which provide a variety of functionalities useful for optical systems integration. Furthermore, near-field optical devices facilitate miniaturization and simultaneously enhance multifunctionality, greatly increasing the functional complexity per unit volume of the photonic system. Since the optical properties of near-field materials are controlled by the geometry, there is flexibility in the choice of constituent materials, facilitating the implementation of a wide range of devices using compatible materials for ease of fabrication and integration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will significantly impact the development of advanced nanophotonic devices and systems utilizing nanoscale architectures. Thereby, the proposed research will not only bolster the area of near-field optical physics and engineering, but will also extend to aid in the development of nanoelectronics, nanomagnetics, nanomechanics, chemistry, and biology by providing a fundamental characterization technology.  Research and training of graduate and undergraduate students in the new field of nanotechnology will have a significant impact on the society as it will revolutionize numerous technologies of critical importance for life science, advanced information sciences, and national security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
