<AbstractNarration>0337711&lt;br/&gt;Wildenschild&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to conduct an integrated study of the role of interfacial characteristics (area, curvature, and thin films) on the flow of fluids and solutes in porous media, with particular attention to how these variables pertain to low saturation phenomena. The principle aim is to image and quantify these interfacial characteristics with micron resolution and subsequently use the measurements for comparison to and advancement of existing and new theory, as well as new pore-scale numerical model developments. As a result, we anticipate being able to improve both theory and numerical models to better include interfacial features and obtain an improved understanding of their role in multi-phase flow and transport. A thorough understanding of these features at the pore scale will allow us to constrain multi-phase flow theory such that a macroscale description can be achieved based on sound thermodynamic principles. The direct solution of conservation equations at the microscale is possible in theory, but impossible in practice for any real system due to the complex geometry of the pore space. Thus it is necessary to employ an averaging procedure to change the scale such that the governing equations can be applied. A complex pore-scale geometry and its associated distribution of fluids can be optimally simulated using the Lattice-Bolzmann approach, allowing us to investigate the averaging procedure using numerical simulations in addition to theory. By improving our insight at the pore-scale, using both theoretical and numerical modeling approaches, we will be in a far better position for developing a sound macroscopic description, which will be an intermediate step in the direction of larger scale predictions, such as those pertaining to clean-up of contaminants in the subsurface, improved agricultural irrigation and fertilization practices, as well as issues in enhanced oil recovery. &lt;br/&gt;Integration of experiments, theory, and simulation in a single project offers the best hope of developing a sound fundamental basis on which to build field scale models of multiphase flow that have predictive capability. Measuring interfacial properties in such detail as suggested here has only recently become technically feasible, and the incorporation of this information in both theory and numerical models is going to provide critical new insight into the processes involved. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
