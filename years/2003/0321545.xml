<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to the University of Wisconsin - Oshkosh under the direction of Dr. Todd Sandrin (PI) and Drs. Toivo Kallas and Teri Shors (co-PIs).   The grant will enable Dr. Sandrin and his colleagues at UW - Oshkosh and at several area academic institutions including Ripon College, Lawrence University, UW - Green Bay, and St. Norbert College, to address a wide variety of interdisciplinary research problems.  To accomplish these goals, funding has been provided for the following instrumentation: 1) electrophoresis equipment for one and two-dimensional gel analyses, 2) a versatile fluorescence scanner/imaging system to visualize nucleic acid and protein gels and to analyze DNA microarrays, and 3) a Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption - Time of Flight - Mass Spectrometer (MALDI-TOF-MS) to identify and characterize proteins.  The Core Facility is critical to advancing the research projects of individual users of the facility and will provide exciting educational opportunities for students as described below. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      The common theme of the research that will be conducted in the Core Facility is the elucidation of complex biological and chemical processes through proteomics- and functional genomics-based approaches.  Microbiologists, including Drs. Sandrin, Kallas, and Johnson, will benefit from the Core Facility in a variety of ways.  Dr. Sandrin is interested in effects of metals and their speciation on expression of bacterial metal resistance mechanisms.  Dr. Kallas will investigate the structure/function of proteins involved in electron transport, signal transduction, iron-sulfur cluster assembly, and oxidative damage.  Dr. Johnson is characterizing a global regulatory factor in E. coli. Two virologists, Drs. Hall and Shors, are characterizing poxvirus proteins (Shors) and determining how the rhinovirus interacts with genes involved in asthma (Hall).  Cell biologists will also benefit.  Vaughan will determine the impact of light-induced retinal degeneration on protein profiles in retinal cells.  Dr. Oschler is determining protein expression involved in synaptic neural impulse transmission.  Finally, investigators with research interests in biochemistry will benefit.  Dr. Hawi is investigating biomolecule monitoring using fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals.  Dr. Paulson is investigating the structure and biochemistry of mitotic chromosomes.  Education, teaching and training efforts are an additional, major focus of the project.  The new instrumentation will augment the depth and breadth of practical laboratory skills students acquire during their education.  Several laboratory courses (e.g., in Microbial Physiology, Microbial Genetics, Genetics, Immunology/Virology, and Biotechnology) will benefit from acquisition of the equipment.  New courses, including a course, entitled Introduction to Proteomics, will be offered.  Each of these activities will provide students with the requisite skills to serve as tomorrow's effective life science researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      The impacts of the proposed activity on research, teaching, training, and learning are not limited to the UW-Oshkosh campus community.  Several area academic institutions in Northeastern Wisconsin will have access to the instrumentation and will use it for their research endeavors as described above.  The Facility will enhance the infrastructure for research in Northeastern Wisconsin by fostering inter-institution and interdisciplinary collaborations.  Access to the Facility will surely attract new student and faculty researchers.  As UW-Oshkosh increases its focus on integrating research with education, the University is hiring new faculty with extensive research experience.  The Proteomics and Functional Genomics Core Facility will be an attractive asset to prospective faculty and will provide the University with a competitive advantage in recruiting new students.  In particular, the University's Women in Science, Science Outreach, and Pre-College Programs will use the Facility to attract students to the Life Sciences and for recruitment of members of underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
