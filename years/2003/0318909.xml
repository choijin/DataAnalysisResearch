    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an innovative solar cell design that combines nanotechnology with conducting polymer photovoltaics to achieve low weight, flexible solar cells of almost any size and shape that far surpass current solar cell efficiencies. This project demonstrates the potential of this design for increased efficiency and low cost by prototyping single-layer solar cells with spectral responses tuned to the solar spectrum. The research develops approaches to explore the four main technical areas that are currently limiting nanocomposite photovoltaic cell performance: illumination intensity saturation, conduction efficiency, charge-separation efficiency and dispersal control of nanomaterials in a host matrix of high concentration. In Phase I, these technical areas are explored to determine the magnitude of potential performance improvements that can be achieved by optimizing these parameters in Phase II; and compare these projections to the maximum performance predicted by theory. In Phase II, the information gathered in Phase I will be used to produce a prototype of an optimized, lightweight, low-cost, flexible solar cell with efficiency greater than 10%; amenable to large-scale, low-temperature manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial applications exist for high performance, low-cost solar cells that can provide an alternative power generation source. Specific examples of use include on-grid building integrated electricity generation systems; on-grid wholesale power generation; remote off-grid power generation; and portable power generation.</AbstractNarration>
