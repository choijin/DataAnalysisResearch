<AbstractNarration>0345538&lt;br/&gt;Gomez&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial support for the acquisition of field equipment (field seismographs and GPS receivers) and computational infrastructure for integrated, multi-disciplinary studies of continental tectonism and geodynamics at the University of Missouri - Columbia (UMC).  These studies are being conducted through close collaboration of three PIs (Gomez, Sandvol and Liu) at UMC representing neotectonics, earthquake seismology, and geodynamic modeling, respectively.  Collectively, this team aims to elucidate the relationship between multi-temporal crustal kinematics, lithospheric and upper mantle structure, and rheology of the continents.  In addition to facilitating future research, this support directly contributes to three ongoing, collaborative efforts involving all three PIs:  (1)  Intraplate tectonics and geodynamics in the Shanxi rift zone and eastern Tien Shan (China), (2)  Active tectonism and geodynamics of the African plate boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean region (Turkey, Lebanon, and Syria), and (3)  Stress evolution and earthquakes in the Central-Eastern United States.  In addition to the scientific contributions, results of these ongoing research projects also have significant implications for assessing the earthquake hazard in each of the regions.  These instruments and facilities will also increase educational opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students at UMC.  This will involve the participation of students in the ongoing and planned research activities, as well as utilization of these instruments within the classroom, including the addition of an important, new geophysical component to the UMC geology field camp in Lander, Wyoming, that attracts ~30 students from different parts of the country every year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
