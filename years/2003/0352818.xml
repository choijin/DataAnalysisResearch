<AbstractNarration>U.S.-TAIWAN WORKSHOP ON NANOTECHNOLOGY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is to take place at National Cheng-Kung University at Tainan, Taiwan during November 6 to 9, 2003.  The objectives of this workshop are (a) to bring together leading experts in nanotechnology in United States and Taiwan to discuss research progress and their future perspectives, (b) to serve as the catalyst for international collaboration and partnership in the areas nanotechnology, and (c) to tour Taiwan's R&amp;D and entrepreneurship infrastructure in nanotechnology.  &lt;br/&gt;The technical program of this workshop is to focus on the areas related to nanocomposites, nanomechanics, and nano-biology.  These areas will address the fundamental theories relating quantum/nano phenomena to micro/macro characteristics, the manufacturing science at nano/micro scale, and the characteristics of bio-molecular mechanisms.  An overview on the large research initiatives/programs at U.S. and Taiwan will be included in the workshop agenda.  A discussion session regarding the mechanisms to promote bi-lateral collaboration through academic institutions between researchers in Taiwan and the United States will be developed.  The collaboration is intended to begin at individual research teams between two countries.  A technical tour will be organized for the participants to witness the success stories of the development of federally-assisted industrial parks.  Specifically, a tour to the Tainan Science Based Industrial Park, the center of bio-technology research in Taiwan, is being organized.  .  It is believed that the immediate impact of this workshop will (a) accelerate dissimilation of emerging results on nanotechnology and (b) build partnership toward international collaboration and entrepreneurship.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
