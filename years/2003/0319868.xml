    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop the detector portion of a novel Digital Magnetic Biosensor ("DIBS"). The primary goal is to establish the feasibility of detecting and counting individual protein molecules using magnetic reagents and digital detector technology adapted from existing magnetic data-storage devices. A prototype microfluidic device will be built and used to investigate detection limits. Products are envisioned that use multiple DIBS in a wide range of disposable diagnostic "cards" that are driven by a hand-held analyzer based on a popular PDA platform. The device will be capable of single molecule detection/resolution, simultaneous analysis of multiple analytes in a single pinprick-sized sample, giving results within minutes. An initial conservative target of 1000 molecules per sample is a first objective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this product will primarily be in diagnostic medicine. Applications in remote environmental testing and homeland defenses monitoring are also possible. The initial targeted customers for these products are distributed healthcare providers who wish to provide rapid and cost-effective quantitative immunoassay-based diagnostic tests on site. These include primary healthcare physician practices, specialist healthcare centers, and hospital emergency rooms. A large potential secondary market for home testing is also anticipated.</AbstractNarration>
