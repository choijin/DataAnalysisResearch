<AbstractNarration>This project improves on MPICH-G2, an implementation of the MPI v1.1 standard delivering MPI application-level middleware functionality based on the popular MPICH library. MPICH-G2 is the only MPI that is built on top of Globus Toolkit services and is the only MPICH-based implementation that supports a vendor-supplied MPI as a low-level transport method for intra-machine or intra-cluster messaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MPICH-G2 relies on two software projects, the Globus Toolkit and MPICH library, both of which have recently undergone significant revisions. Globus developers are implementing their next-generation software, the Globus Toolkit 3.0 (GT3), based on the integration of Grid services from their current Globus Toolkit 2.0 (GT2) and Web services concepts and technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will augment GT3 by adding the multi-site startup functionality and  bootstrap message passing libraries found in GT2 but not yet brought forward to GT3. Support for dynamic process creation and management introduced by the MPI-2 standard will also be investigated. These activities will bring GT3 to a minimum level of utility as required by MPICH-G2. The project will also collaborate with the MPICH group in the design of ADI-3 by investigating the unique challenges associated with supporting a vendor-supplied MPI as one of the low-level transport methods that has not yet been addressed. The project will incorporate the additions to GT3 and the new ADI-3 design to render a high-quality and uniquely Globus-enabled implementation of the MPI-2 standard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of this project is embodied in the investigation of the unique challenges presented by supporting vendor-supplied MPI, and by investigating issues surrounding the support of the  dynamic process creation and management introduced by the MPI-2 Standard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impact of this work will be realized by MPI application developers because the proposed activities will significantly increase the utility of MPICH-G2 as an effective middleware tool.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
