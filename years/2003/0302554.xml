<AbstractNarration>This proposal deals with investigating the feasibility of developing a new class of sensors.The&lt;br/&gt;target application of these sensors is semiconductor manufacturing.The common theme shared by&lt;br/&gt;this class of sensors is that they are based on Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT).EIT is an&lt;br/&gt;in vivo imaging technology that has found widespread use in biomedical applications, but its use&lt;br/&gt;in semiconductor manufacturing applications as suggested in this proposal is novel.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Semiconductor manufacturing is a vital industrial engine that continues to drive worldwide eco-&lt;br/&gt;nomic growth.The next generation of integrated electronics calls for the reliable and cost-effective&lt;br/&gt;manufacture of 0 .13 micron linewidth circuits across large 300 mm substrates.It is widely recog-&lt;br/&gt;nized that sensors will play a vital role in realizing this objective,by providing the means to optimize&lt;br/&gt;process parameters,engineer more complex equipment,and by enabling integrated process control.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research offers the possibility of in situ sensors for monitoring processing conditions at&lt;br/&gt;the wafer surface during semiconductor processing.The EIT based sensors that will be developed&lt;br/&gt;in this work can offer unprecedented spatial resolution with modest cost-of-ownership.These&lt;br/&gt;sensors would enable rapid equipmen diagnostics,recipe optimization,and eventually closed-loop&lt;br/&gt;equipmen control.Effectively,this would lead to improved yield,time-to-yield,and throughput.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is the seed componen in this overall vision.&lt;br/&gt;Finally,and most importantly,is the immediate and direct impact of the proposed work in bring-&lt;br/&gt;ing students uniquely versatile in both hardware and system aspects to the semiconductor industry.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal is its novelty.The proposed work is interdisciplinary in&lt;br/&gt;nature,bringing techniques and ideas from biomedical applications to the semiconductor industry.&lt;br/&gt;This will require the imaginative blend of analytical ideas with hardware design.&lt;br/&gt;Sensors are traditionally viewed as stand alone hardware components.The proposed work takes&lt;br/&gt;a more nuanced approach where the systems aspect of sensors is vital to their function.The&lt;br/&gt;particular tomography problems that arise in the context of this proposal are novel and will require&lt;br/&gt;innovative analytical approaches.In contrast with biomedical tomography,the objects being imaged&lt;br/&gt;(the proposed sensors)have the luxury of being optimized.The medical analogue is that of being&lt;br/&gt;able to arrange bones,organs,and tissue in positions that are favorable to the imaging technique.&lt;br/&gt;First principles analysis will permit the design of the proposed sensors for optimal sensitivity.</AbstractNarration>
