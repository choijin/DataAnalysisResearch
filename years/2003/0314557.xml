<AbstractNarration>The Puerto Rico Math and Science Partnership (PR-MSP) involves four universities within the Puerto Rico System (The University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras, Mayaguez, Cayey and Humacao campuses) in partnership with the Puerto Rico Department of Education and supporting institutions that include the other seven campuses of  the UPR system, the Inter American University  of Puerto Rico System,  and the Arecibo Observatory as well as informal science education centers and industry partners.  The Partnership's activities center on four goals: &lt;br/&gt;1. Empowering schools through challenging K-12 Math and Science curriculum and professional development&lt;br/&gt;2. Increasing K-12 mathematics and science teacher quality through the preparation of future teachers and certified teachers&lt;br/&gt;3. Strengthening the mathematics and science knowledge base through educational research, assessment, and evaluation&lt;br/&gt;4. Creating sustainable K-20 partnerships &lt;br/&gt;Over 300 mathematics and science faculty and scientists from university partners and supporting organizations, forming four regional supporting teams, are working directly with K-12 Mathematics and science teachers and school and district personnel to provide professional development supporting the implementation and evaluation of challenging research-based curriculum and assessment to optimize math and science education for 305,000 students in 584 K-12  schools across the Island.  The provision of new professional development and credentialing opportunities for mathematics and science teachers is impacting over 5,000 in-service teachers. The partnership is establishing 30 school-based Math and Science Resource Centers and a Math and Science Education Website to disseminate the challenging curricular and educational improvements among all schools in Puerto Rico.  School Learning Communities and Mathematics and Science Leading Teachers at each school are working with science and mathematics faculty from the partnering institutions and industry to implement the curricular enhancement activities.  Teams of teachers, faculty, and researchers are designing curricular activities that incorporate field trips using the local context as science laboratory, and engage students as active learners, enhancing their motivation and preparation for M&amp;S advanced courses and research opportunities. Core partner universities are engaged in reform of teacher preparation programs reaching over 3,000 future K-12  teachers to ensure  they are highly qualified to  implement  and  sustain  the PR-MSP educational improvements.  Preservice students participate in structured scientific research experiences in collaboration with the supporting partners including the Arecibo Observatory, the U.S. Forest Service Institute of Tropical Forestry, and industry labs.  Teams of teachers and faculty are conducting action research on student learning to provide evidence on the effectiveness of their innovations in the classroom. The impact of the PR-MSP on student achievement is measured through standardized tests based on TIMSS and NAEP assessments.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
