<AbstractNarration>Networks of interacting agents play a fundamental role in many&lt;br/&gt;domains, ranging from physical communication networks such as the&lt;br/&gt;Internet to social networks arising from relationships between people.&lt;br/&gt;These networks grow and evolve through interactions of large numbers&lt;br/&gt;of participants, yielding complex global structure and dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;Often this leads to systems that function efficiently and reliably;&lt;br/&gt;but in other, seemingly similar settings, networks can exhibit latent&lt;br/&gt;inefficiency or cascading failures.  Such failures occur not only in&lt;br/&gt;physical networks but also in social ones, as illustrated by recent&lt;br/&gt;financial crises which propagated through networks of relationships and trust.&lt;br/&gt;Despite considerable interest in these topics, the research community&lt;br/&gt;is only beginning to understand the behavior of networks such as&lt;br/&gt;these; small variations in the incentives, information, and&lt;br/&gt;computational power possessed by the agents in a network can have&lt;br/&gt;profound effects on network behavior, yet the principles underlying&lt;br/&gt;these effects remain elusive.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops theoretical and algorithmic underpinnings of networks&lt;br/&gt;that arise from the interaction of strategic agents.  By combining&lt;br/&gt;game-theoretic approaches with computational models of interacting&lt;br/&gt;agents, the work develops models that are richer and&lt;br/&gt;more informative than either those that consider strategic agents in&lt;br/&gt;the absence of interaction networks or those that consider network&lt;br/&gt;structure in the absence of game-theoretic models of the agents.&lt;br/&gt;Networks of strategic agents are investigated at several different levels, &lt;br/&gt;extending from questions of structure to those of function and behavior.  &lt;br/&gt;One of the project's central goals is to examine the&lt;br/&gt;inter-relationships between these three levels.  In contrast, most&lt;br/&gt;current techniques are tuned to a single level in isolation, with&lt;br/&gt;work in computer science and mathematics focusing primarily on structure &lt;br/&gt;and work in economics emphasizing strategic behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's inter-disciplinary nature exposes similarities between&lt;br/&gt;questions in communication networks, including the Internet, and&lt;br/&gt;those arising in social networks, such as trust in markets.  &lt;br/&gt;Beyond analyzing questions arising from these networks in general,&lt;br/&gt;a particular goal is to better understand the&lt;br/&gt;networks of interactions underlying electronic markets.  &lt;br/&gt;Indeed, while it was widely predicted that such marketplaces would &lt;br/&gt;revolutionize trading of goods and services, very few have survived.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project participants contribute expertise from several perspectives.  &lt;br/&gt;They have made some of the fundamental contributions to&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic game theory, computational and economic analysis of&lt;br/&gt;interacting agents, and models for complex networks, as well as to the&lt;br/&gt;understanding of market microstructure and the design of electronic markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further, the investigators have been key participants in &lt;br/&gt;the new Information Science program at Cornell.  &lt;br/&gt;This program seeks to broaden the reach of computational&lt;br/&gt;ideas by attracting students from non-technical backgrounds, and&lt;br/&gt;incorporating notions of computation as a human-centered activity&lt;br/&gt;that is intrinsically embedded in social, legal, and economic contexts.  &lt;br/&gt;The scientific results of the project support&lt;br/&gt;the intellectual underpinnings of this program at both&lt;br/&gt;the graduate and undergraduate levels.&lt;br/&gt;Many of the models involved in the research have an immediate intuitive &lt;br/&gt;appeal, and are well suited to interactive graphical demonstrations.&lt;br/&gt;These demonstrations can be used to broaden general understanding &lt;br/&gt;of the nature of strategic interaction and its networked character, &lt;br/&gt;and can be made broadly available through the National Science Digital Library &lt;br/&gt;(NSDL) where appropriate to pre-collegiate educational levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Internet is but the newest of many networks of strategic agents.&lt;br/&gt;However, it has served to change the structure and function of other&lt;br/&gt;networks, as it enables instantaneous, always-on, global communication.  &lt;br/&gt;Understanding the theoretical underpinnings of these&lt;br/&gt;changes can provide important societal benefits in terms of more&lt;br/&gt;secure, stable communication and economic systems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
