<AbstractNarration>Modules in introductory materials science and engineering are being developed that engage early engineering students in design experiences. These classroom modules help teach materials science and engineering within the context of modern technologies. Laboratory modules are being developed to emphasize how materials engineers function in industry. Forms of the modules appropriate for high school demonstrations are also being created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development is being carried out by faculty from research universities, comprehensive universities, and community colleges who have significant curriculum development experience and diverse materials science and engineering research interests. The modules are being structured around learning objectives and include active learning exercises, design problems, open ended project labs, and assessment tools. During the development of the modules, feedback is being solicited from an industry advisory board and a community college partnership. The modules are being beta tested by community colleges, research universities, and teaching colleges. Assessment is being done on whether the learning objectives are achieved and on the ease of adaptability of the modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most engineering departments, including community colleges, require their students to take an- Introduction to Materials - course. With annual course enrollments of over 50,000 in the U.S., innovations in the curriculum have widespread applicability. The assessment of the modules contribute to educational research on the effectiveness of design problems and project based labs. The results of the assessment are being presented at national conferences and published in engineering education journals. National dissemination of the modules is being supported by McGraw-Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
