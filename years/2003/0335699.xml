<AbstractNarration>The overall focus of the project is to develop an empirically-based conceptual framework operationalizing "culturally responsive evaluation", investigating the efficacy and utility of this framework in a professional development workshop of school personnel (principals and teachers), and critiquing the evaluation designs which result from application of the framework. The Relevance of Culture in Evaluation Institute (RCEI) includes a professional development workshop to equip teachers and principals with basic skills in culturally responsive program evaluation and an opportunity to utilize those skills in developing a design for use in their school. The project additionally provides participating schools with four months of technical support by an expert evaluator supporting development of evaluation plans linked to the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Legislation. The RCEI is based on a model developed and implemented by Dr. Stafford Hood (Relevance of Culture in Evaluation Workshop RCEW) and previously funded by NSF. Upon successful completion of this research and development activity, the project will have significantly impacted capacity within the field of evaluation by increasing both the number of evaluators who employ evaluative practices that are culturally responsive, and the number of evaluators of color practicing in the field. The project will also provide beginning validation of a tool for building culturally responsive evaluation capacity.</AbstractNarration>
