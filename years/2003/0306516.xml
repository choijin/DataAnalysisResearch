<AbstractNarration>The goal of the proposed research is the analysis of mathematical models&lt;br/&gt;for partially ordered  materials. The focus is on electro-magnetic, electro-optical, &lt;br/&gt;and electro-mechanical interactions, emphasizing  ferroelectric and piezoelectric &lt;br/&gt;responses in smectic liquid crystals and elastomers and flux pinning in superconductors.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding these interactions is central to the design process where&lt;br/&gt;one strives to make smaller, faster, and more accurate devices. Liquid crystals &lt;br/&gt;and elastomers are used to make optical switches, nano devices, and displays. They  have &lt;br/&gt;also been used by physicists to model artificial muscles. Superconductors are used&lt;br/&gt;for power transmission and to make extremely strong magnets. A hierarchy of mathematical&lt;br/&gt;problems will be considered for each material taking into account increasingly &lt;br/&gt;complex interactions. Special emphasis will be given to scaling-up from&lt;br/&gt;meso-scale models where the physical interactions are delineated to macro-&lt;br/&gt;scale models used in applications. The PI seeks to find qualitative features of&lt;br/&gt;solutions for the models. In superconductivity the PI will try to exhibit solutions&lt;br/&gt;with large stationary currents (pinned currents). One reason for the interest in &lt;br/&gt;smectic liquid crystals is the dramatic decrease in switching times between optical &lt;br/&gt;states relative to those for dielectric liquid crystals . A major&lt;br/&gt;goal here is to estimate these switching times for the models considered. &lt;br/&gt;Techniques from mathematical modeling, partial differential equations, and finite  &lt;br/&gt;elasticity will be employed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The  proposed research centers on the study mathematical models for  electro--mechanical  &lt;br/&gt;and electro-optical interactions in liquid crystals and models describing the  &lt;br/&gt;electro--magnetic properties of superconductors. With regard to liquid crystals, the  &lt;br/&gt;applications that we address are motivated by optical and biological systems and focuses on  &lt;br/&gt;the design of optical switches and  nanodevices, including detectors, actuators, and  &lt;br/&gt;valves. These applications are found in a wide range of products such as artificial muscles &lt;br/&gt;and liquid crystal displays for monitors. The development and analyses of analytic models  &lt;br/&gt;for these materials serves as an important  complement to  experimental investigations  &lt;br/&gt;carried out by materials scientists and physicists. An example of the phenomena we are  &lt;br/&gt;addressing  is switching times in liquid crystal displays. Recent studies using smectic  &lt;br/&gt;liquid crystals show a dramatic decrease in switching times between optical states,  &lt;br/&gt;relative to those for standard (nematic) liquid crystals. We study a hierarchy of  &lt;br/&gt;mathematical problems  for these materials, taking into account increasingly complex  &lt;br/&gt;interactions with the goals of capturing the correct physics and to accurately estimate and  &lt;br/&gt;compare the switching times for the models considered.</AbstractNarration>
