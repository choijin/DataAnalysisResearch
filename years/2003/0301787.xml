<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This research will address the critical problem of movement-induced &lt;br/&gt;vibration that limits the operating speed of Scanning Probe Microscopes &lt;br/&gt;(SPMs). It is noted that SPMs are key enabling tools in the experimental &lt;br/&gt;investigation and manipulation of nano scale (and sub-nano scale) phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;However, during high-speed operation of SPMs, movement-induced vibration &lt;br/&gt;leads to damage of the sample and/or probe as well as modification of the &lt;br/&gt;surface properties being investigated. Therefore, current SPM systems are &lt;br/&gt;operated at low speeds; for example, high-resolution SPM systems operate at &lt;br/&gt;around 1/100th of the lowest resonant frequency that excites significant &lt;br/&gt;vibrations in the system. Thus, movement-induced vibration limits the &lt;br/&gt;operating speed of current SPM systems. This work proposes to compensate-for &lt;br/&gt;the movement-induced vibration and, thereby, to enable high-speed operation &lt;br/&gt;of SPMs with sub-nanometer resolution, and without adverse affects such as &lt;br/&gt;sample and probe damage. The novelty of the proposed approach is that it &lt;br/&gt;will exploit the extant imaging capability of the SPM to increase the &lt;br/&gt;operating speed. The proposed research consists of following three tasks: &lt;br/&gt;(1) measure effects of dynamics using SPM images; (2) compensate-for the SPM &lt;br/&gt;dynamics; and (3) evaluate increase in operating speed using Scanning &lt;br/&gt;Tunneling Microscope (STM). The proposed approach will be used to evaluate &lt;br/&gt;the maximum speed at which a STM can image standard samples such as carbon &lt;br/&gt;atoms in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). The proposed &lt;br/&gt;improvements of SPM, a key-enabling tool, will have a broad impact on &lt;br/&gt;research and development in nanosciences and nanotechnologies. The proposed &lt;br/&gt;work will also build the research and human resource infrastructure needed &lt;br/&gt;to remain competitive in emerging nanotechnology industries.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
