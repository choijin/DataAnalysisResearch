<AbstractNarration>The research objectives of this study are to (1) develop a reliable finite element process model for ball burnishing, which is a mechanical surface-finishing process that is often used to improve the surface quality and fatigue life of highly stressed machined components, (2) use this model to understand the process mechanics and analyze the effects of the initial surface layer properties generated by (hard) turning, and (3) demonstrate process optimization using the proposed model. The approach to be employed includes (1) determining material properties of the machined surface layer as input to the process model, (2) developing a finite element simulation model (in 2 and 3 Dimensions) and using the model to analyze the effect of process parameters, (3) conducting ball burnishing experiments to verify/refine the model predictions, and 4) demonstrating the process optimization of a representative hard burnished component using the developed model and validate the results in production conditions. This work will comprise a collaboration between Ohio State University, the Technical University of Aachen, Germany, and the University of Toledo, and three interested industrial partners, Hardinge, Scientific Forming Corporation, and Ecoroll, that will provide free software, hardware, and suggestions to the study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The process combination of hard turning and ball burnishing provides a good alternative to grinding and honing operations and helps to improve the fatigue life of structured components. The results obtained from this research will provide an efficient analysis tool for many industries to optimize the burnishing operation and to improve the surface quality. In addition, the results of this project will contribute to cost reduction and increased competitiveness in machining industry. Through the collaborative effort with the academic and industrial partners, the results will be conveniently transferred to the scientific community and applied in production. This study will also demonstrate to industry and universities, as an example, how Finite Element Method-based process modeling can be used efficiently to optimize process conditions and enhance the effectiveness of manufacturing operations.</AbstractNarration>
