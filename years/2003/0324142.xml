<AbstractNarration>This project is providing a combination intensive mentoring and scholarships to low-income, academically talented students in mathematics and computer science.  The objective is to increase retention of students in the Mathematics and Computer Science department and prepare them for industry and government internships that enhance their academic experience.  By providing financial support, computer equipment, and extra advising and group study activities, the program is helping students focus on their academic studies and prepare them for future jobs in computing and the mathematical sciences. This program targets the stages at which our students have the highest attrition rate.  For our undergraduates, the program is directed at students who have completed the introductory courses in their major. The specific goals for these students are to finish their gateway courses, especially mathematics, computer science, and English, and provide them with the necessary skills to get an internship and to graduate in a timely fashion.  For masters level students, the program is focusing on addressing the barriers to pursuit of a graduate degree and the transition from undergraduate to graduate work. To increase the number of well-prepared graduates in CSEM fields, we are undertaking a program with the following goals:&lt;br/&gt;o Financial Support: Alleviate the financial problems for students entering their sophomore year or beginning their masters degree.&lt;br/&gt;o Mentoring and Group Study: Address personal barriers to continuation with academic support in the form of intensive one-on-one interaction with computer science and mathematics faculty and with group work.&lt;br/&gt;o Career Counseling: Increase students' competitiveness through career counseling and workshops.&lt;br/&gt;o Internships: Strengthen students experience and job readiness through internships in industry and on campus.&lt;br/&gt;o Computer Equipment: Increase access to computers and students' ability to use emerging systems by providing laptop computers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
