<AbstractNarration>The genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has been annotated to show the presence of&lt;br/&gt;close to 30,000 genes. Many of these genes are both predicted by computer programs and&lt;br/&gt;supported by experimental evidence ' their similarity to characterized genes from plants, animals&lt;br/&gt;and microbes. However, 15-20 % of the gene annotations are based only on computer evidence.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, comparison of the Arabidopsis genome sequence with its close relative Brassica&lt;br/&gt;oleracea (the cabbage/cauliflower/Brussels sprouts family) reveals many regions of sequence&lt;br/&gt;conservation that are not at present annotated as genes. Preliminary experimental analysis of&lt;br/&gt;some of these regions indicates that a significant fraction do encode genes that have so far been&lt;br/&gt;unrecognized by the annotation process. Full-length cDNAs provide both the basis for greatly&lt;br/&gt;improved gene structure annotation by alignment of their sequences with genomic DNA, and&lt;br/&gt;also the reagents with which to analyze their function by expression and other kinds of analysis.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to generate full-length cDNAs for approximately 2,000 of these&lt;br/&gt;genes that represent the least well-understood genes in the genome. We will use 5 and 3 RACE&lt;br/&gt;to define the precise structure of each gene and then generate full-length cDNA clones for&lt;br/&gt;protein-coding genes (ORFs) in a recombination vector suitable for functional studies by the&lt;br/&gt;research community.&lt;br/&gt;We will generate clones and sequence at a rate of approximately 100 clones per month within&lt;br/&gt;three months of the start of the project with a goal of producing 2,000 novel and previously&lt;br/&gt;uncharacterized clones over the period of the project.&lt;br/&gt;Sequences of the clones will be submitted to GenBank as they are generated and will also be&lt;br/&gt;available from the TIGR ftp site. The clones themselves will be made freely available to the&lt;br/&gt;research community through the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC). Details of the&lt;br/&gt;project will be maintained at a project-specific web site&lt;br/&gt;http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/ath1/2010_cDNAs&lt;br/&gt;At the scientific level, this project will enhance the Arabidopsis genome annotation by increasing&lt;br/&gt;the total gene count in Arabidopsis by ~10% and will be a major step towards completing the&lt;br/&gt;identification and validation of all the genes in the first fully sequenced plant genome&lt;br/&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana. The cDNAs will be available as community resources. Integrated into the&lt;br/&gt;proposed research is a curriculum development component that will provide research experience&lt;br/&gt;to high school science educators in which they will work on the project and use project materials&lt;br/&gt;for the development of new curricular modules designed to provide exposure to fundamental&lt;br/&gt;concepts in plant genomics to high school students.</AbstractNarration>
