    <AbstractNarration>ISI 2003 Travel Grant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: W. B. Smith&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: DMS-0303688&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American statistical Association (ASA) will use this travel grant for 12 United states participants to attend the 54th Session of the International Statistical Institute (ISI) in Berlin, Germany, from august 13-20, 2003. The ISI meeting holds an umbrella meeting of several allied societies with sessions of interest for thousands of statisticians. This travel grant will provide travel awards to partially defray transportation costs for individuals selected from educational institutions and other non-profit organizations. An emphasis of the award is to encourage and provide opportunity for younger statisticians to participate in the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants will be notified of the availability of the travel grant through AMSTAT News, a membership publication with over 16,000 circulation and on the ASA Home Page on the internet. Also, notices will be sent to university and college Statistics departments to encourage younger statisticians to apply for travel support. An ASA committee will do the review and selection of applications. Special consideration will be given to statisticians who have recently received their doctorates and to women and minorities in order to broaden research, educational and networking opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
