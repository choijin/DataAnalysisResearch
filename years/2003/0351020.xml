<AbstractNarration>SES - 0351020&lt;br/&gt;Murray Webster&lt;br/&gt;Lisa Rashotte&lt;br/&gt;Joseph Whitmeyer&lt;br/&gt;University of North Carolina, Charlotte&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project plans to develop, assess, and improve theoretical models that explain the effects of certain kinds of behaviors on inequality structures in small groups.  While social scientists long have recognized the importance of behavior in affecting impressions of competence, these models are the first to permit precise predictions of those effects, and to integrate the effects with other sources of inequality such as status differences among individuals. Variant models, developed from a well-established tradition of status characteristics, performance expectations, and group structures, will be constructed and tested in laboratory situations designed to permit a high degree of control over initial situations and good visibility of predicted effects. The theoretical outcomes of the project will be increased understanding of causes and consequences of inequality in small groups, and improved models of face-to-face behavior.   The theoretical work adds to a cumulative body of knowledge regarding status and behavior developed by many investigators at different universities since the 1960s. The empirical work develops new techniques to create theoretically meaningful behavior and observe effects, and puts theoretical extensions on a sound evidential footing.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: (1) Benefits to society:  Because status hierarchies and status behaviors are ubiquitous, this research advances precise understanding of factors affecting most social groups.  The PIs intend to predict how behaviors affect hierarchies, and to identify behavioral techniques for weakening or reinforcing effects of status advantages and disadvantages, such as those resulting from gender and ethnicity.  (2) Broad dissemination to enhance scientific and technological understanding:  Results will be published in academic journals and in non-technical outlets where appropriate.  The data, as well as operational programs developed will be made publicly available to other researchers and students.  (3) Advancing discovery while promoting teaching, training and learning:  Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in most parts of this modeling process, especially in developing the experimental designs, running of the laboratory studies, interviewing, and analyzing data. Results, data and experimental designs will be incorporated in the PIs courses and courses taught at other universities, as well as in chapters of college textbooks. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
