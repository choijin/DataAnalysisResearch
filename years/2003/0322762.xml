<AbstractNarration>This proposed research investigates semiconductor surfaces free of surface states and their applications in nanoelectronic fabrication. The uniqueness of this research is that it adopts the concept of valence-mending, which eliminates both dangling bonds and strained bonds, and thus surface states, on a semiconductor surface with an atomic layer of valence-mending atoms. This research will fundamentally improve our knowledge of semiconductor surfaces and interfaces and lead to new nanoelectronic devices and new fabrication methods. For example, low Schottky barrier heights are realized on n-type silicon (001), which enable a terahertz nanoelectronic device, the Schottky source/drain complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor. Other important applications include reduction of silicon consumption over the source/drain regions and suppression of interfacial oxidation between hafnium dioxide and silicon in next-generation complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors. On the basic science side, a clear link between different types of surface states and their corresponding dangling bonds will be established. The decades-old data on Schottky barrier height between metal and silicon (001) will be updated. Major educational activities proposed include curriculum development by the PI, participation in workforce development for economic development of the community, and participation in the new Nano-at-the-Border initiative to promote nanotechnology education and research to the Texas-Mexico border. The proposal describes the detailed plan for these activities, including the incorporation of recent results from this research to the electrical engineering curriculum; the development of web-based instruction for the educational component of the Nano-at-the-Border initiative; curriculum development and faculty training for community colleges as part of the workforce development plan; and proposal development to secure funds for supporting community-wide initiatives in workforce development.</AbstractNarration>
