<AbstractNarration>This grant is focused primarily on developing a series of educational electronic modules for graduate and undergraduate course offerings in materials science and engineering. Modules will be developed using the popular electronic PowerPoint format for the subject of kinetics in materials processing. This particular subject comprises an upper-divisional course in materials science and engineering, and explores the fundamental aspects of kinetic processes in materials, including diffusion-based processes, defect-mediated processes, surface processes, phase transformations, precipitation and coarsening, etc. The content of these modules, presented in a highly quantifiable manner, provides a study and lecture aid to students, and form the basis of approximately 20 lectures for the instructor. The modules can be used in conjunction with a textbook or as a stand-alone instructional framework. Approximately new 20 modules will be developed for the topics of crystal growth and solidification- comprising important subjects for a graduate-level education in materials science and engineering course. Areas such as phase transformations, nucleation, heat and mass transport, chemical segregation, crystal texture, dendritic and eutectic growth, will be developed sequentially and logically connected. These subjects have matured dramatically over the past twenty years, and now can be taught on a highly quantitative basis, for which few suitable texts exist. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The modules being developed under the subject NSF grant will be offered to all interested parties via a cost-free down-load via the Rensselaer WEB-site, or as a CD. The new modules should rectify the lack of tutorial support by providing a new robust pedagogical framework. In addition, original exercises, instructional programs, Java applets, etc. will be added to strengthen the existing modules, as feedback is received from students upon their use in a real classroom setting. These modalities for distribution will effectively publish the educational research and form a meaningful deliverable. In this manner, as wide an audience as possible in materials science and engineering, and in allied fields of science and engineering, will be served through the teaching tools.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
