    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to research the metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) epitaxial growth and explore new passivation techniques for very low-noise aluminum gallium antimonide (AlGaSb) avalanche photodiodes (APDs). At one particular composition (~6% Al), the AlGaSb bandgap and valence spin-orbit splitting energy become equal, resonantly enhancing the hole ionization rate. Several groups have reported high (7 to 20) hole-to-electron ionization ratios in AlGaSb. Other semiconductors with 1.0-1.7 micron response lack high hole/electron or electron/hole ionization ratios InGaAs~2, e~1.5, InGaAsP~3) crucial for low noise APDs. For example, the AlGaSb APD excess noise factor should be 2, versus 7.5 for Ge APDs at a gain of 10. Previous AlGaSb APDs were made 10-20 years ago by liquid phase epitaxy (LPE), which had quality and uniformity (e.g. 20% thickness variation) issues, and different optimal compositions were reported. MOCVD with high purity sources will be used to grow more uniform (&lt;3% doping variation, &lt;1% for thickness and composition), higher quality epilayers that can now be better characterized. This should enable the exact composition and epi structure to best use the fairly sharp resonant enhancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Available APDs in the 1.0 to 1.7 micron range are noisy compared with PIN/trans-impedance amplifiers. The proposed low-noise AlGaSb APDs would allow a single component to replace most of the PIN/trans-impedance amplifier front end, and significantly extend the design space in which optical communications and laser radar systems are constrained.</AbstractNarration>
