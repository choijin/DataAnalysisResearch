<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the development of a nondestructive, general-use nanomechanical imaging system (GNIS) based on ultrasonic and heterodyne force microscopy at SUNY at Albany. This analytical system will be capable of quantitatively mapping/imaging the elastic (static) and viscoelastic (dynamic) response of a variety of nanoscale materials and device structures with nanometer length spatial resolution. By combining the nanometer spatial resolution of conventional SPMs with the elastic imaging capabilities of acoustic or ultrasonic microscopes, this instrument will fill a current void in the quantitative characterization of the static and dynamic mechanics of nanoscale systems.   In laboratory use, this instrument will operate in a manner analogous to commercially available scanning probe microscopes (SPMs) in that quantitative, digital, rastered, nanometer scale images will be obtained of sample elastic modulus and viscoelastic response frequency.  Applications for this instrument are numerous and represent areas of critical need in a broad range of fields including nanoelectronics, microsystems (MEMS), integrated circuit (IC) fabrication and nanotechnology.  Areas of research include (1) the mechanical uniformity and process-induced mechanical modification of materials/devices in IC and MEMS fabrication; (2) cross-sectional analysis for characterization of depth-dependent modulus variation in MEMS and IC structures; (3) elastic/viscoelastic imaging of nanotube structures and correlation with electrical performance; (4) nanomechanical imaging of metallic nanowires; and (5) investigation of nanomechanical defects in organic photoresist films. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GNIS development program will significantly contribute to achieving the research/educational goals of the University at Albany and our research/education partners. It will provide a unique nanomechanical characterization system to advance our fundamental and applied nanotechnology research projects (see projects section) and also complement nanoscience curriculum development in the University's newly formed School of Nanosciences and Nanoengineering (SNN). The successful development of GNIS will also enhance the ability of the University at Albany's newly formed SNN to attract both research programs and, consequently, students in the fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology. The presence of such a unique system at the SNN will strengthen our recruitment efforts for new scientists and faculty in the fields of nanomechanics and nanoscale device reliability.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
