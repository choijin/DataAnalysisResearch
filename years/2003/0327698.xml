<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for student attendance at the 34th annual meeting of the Division of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics (DAMOP) of the American Physical Society.  The meeting will be held at the University of Colorado, Boulder, 20-24 May, 2003.  This is the principal meeting covering principles of AMO physics held each year, and this award gives students the opportunity to participate in DAMOP sponsored events.
