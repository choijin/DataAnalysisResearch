<AbstractNarration>Collapse Analysis and Displacement Estimates of Degrading MDOF Structures for Performance-Based Seismic Design, CMS proposal 0324442&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ayoub, USF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seismic design methodologies have recently  adopted the new  general concept of performance-based procedures. The new concept has been reflected in several codes of practice. New analysis procedures have been developed to estimate seismic demands for performance  evaluation.  Most of these procedures are based on simple models, and do not take into account degradation effects, a major factor influencing structural behavior under earthquake excitations. More importantly, most of these models  do not predict &lt;br/&gt;collapse of structures under seismic loads. The main objective of this research project is to develop  a procedure for incorporating degradation  effects for seismic demand evaluation  of  MDOF  systems.  A  new  numerical  platform  that  permits  analysis  of degrading structural systems was already developed by the P.I. Energy-based approaches were used to define several types of degradation effects. The newly developed models were  added  to  the  material  library  of  a  widely  used  commercial  software  for  seismic analysis  of  MDOF  structural  systems.  The  models  also  permit  collapse  prediction  of MDOF structures under seismic excitations. The proposed work consists of several tasks. First, a numerical study on collapse prediction and displacement estimates of degrading SDOF systems will be conducted. Second,  a statistical parameter study is performed in order to study the effectiveness of scaling earthquake records for MDOF analysis of degrading systems. Third, an extensive numerical study is conducted on degrading &lt;br/&gt;MDOF systems to estimate maximum inelastic displacements for use in performance-based seismic code provisions, and to determine strength levels that subject the structures to collapse for collapse-prevention limit state design purposes. Finally, seismic fragility analysis  will  be  performed,  where  fragility  curves  for  a  collapse  criterion  for  a  large spectrum of structural systems will be generated numerically. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The  intellectual  merit  of  the  research  project  is  to  include  degradation  effects  in performance based seismic design methodologies. To perform this task, accurate constitutive models  of  degrading materials  have  to  be  developed.  Currently,  few  if  any deterioration  models  exist  in  a  general  three-dimensional  frame  analysis  program.  The research project employs newly defined energy-based degrading models that have been incorporated into a commercial nonlinear seismic analysis program. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of  the proposed research project is to provide an opportunity to expose students and structural engineers in the Tampa Bay area to new design techniques. This will be performed through the development of new courses on inelastic analysis of structures,  and  performance-based  procedures,  that  will  be  available  on  the  interactive web-based teaching tool Blackboard5. The project also  represents  an  opportunity to involve students at USF, especially of underrepresented  groups, in a research  work of &lt;br/&gt;national interest on seismic hazard mitigation, as currently one such minority student is already involved in a similar work. Finally, the statistical outcomes of the proposed research will be documented in a database format to be available on the internet, which will provide important information to the whole structural community.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
