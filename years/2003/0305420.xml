<AbstractNarration>Computer algebra (also known as symbolic computation) is an area of research involving both mathematics and the computer sciences.  Computer algebra systems are widely used in many areas for research, education and practical problem solving.  Research in computer algebra is the driving force for technological advances in commercially available computer algebra software.  Its major goal is the development of highly efficient algorithms and automated software systems that can solve a wide variety of mathematical problems symbolically, numerically, or in a hybrid way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The East Coast Computer Algebra Day (ECCAD) is one-day regional conference on computer algebra, its applications and related technological developments.  Since 1994, ECCAD has been held annually at various North American locations on the East Coast.  This meeting in the series is being held on Saturday, April 5, 2003, at Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina.  Three internationally recognized invited speakers will make featured presentations.  There will be contributed poster/software demo sessions, covering many aspects of computer algebra. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
