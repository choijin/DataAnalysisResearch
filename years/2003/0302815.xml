<AbstractNarration>Phi Theta Kappa, the honor society for two-year colleges, in cooperation with the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC), is conducting a three-year multi-disciplinary, nationwide mentoring project to expand and enhance community college teacher preparation programs for future K-12 science and mathematics teachers, and to identify "best practices" within these programs. The project employs the same conceptual and implementation format used by Phi Theta Kappa in its recent NSF/DUE/ATE-supported projects, Preparing Tomorrow's Science &amp; Mathematics Teachers: The Community College Response; and Improving Science &amp; Technology Education at Community Colleges: Rounds I &amp; II.&lt;br/&gt;A set of proven mentoring activities is being used to share the knowledge base, experience, practices and materials achieved by six exemplary community college teacher preparation programs with 18 competitively-selected community colleges.  These exemplary practices and materials also are being disseminated widely to other community, technical, and junior colleges nationwide.&lt;br/&gt;The 18 selected community colleges each work with one of six two-member mentoring teams.  The six community colleges are Green River Community College, WA; William Rainey Harper College, IL; Tulsa Community College, OK; Cerritos College, CA; J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College, VA; and Delaware Technical &amp; Community College, DE.  Mentors represent disciplines of mathematics, chemistry, biology, physics and education.  &lt;br/&gt;Project activities include: national competition to select 18 colleges; two National Teacher Preparation Conferences, at which six teams of mentors, from two and four-year colleges, work with assigned four-member college teams to develop action plans; mentor services, including site visits over a one year period; networking newsletter available electronically and in print; case study monograph for distribution to presidents, academic deans, education chairs and STEM chairs; a Best Practices Competition; a Best Practices Conference to recognize and share "best practices" in mathematics and science teacher preparation programs at two-year colleges; Best Practices Conference proceedings and recommendations report; and a broad range of other dissemination activities through Phi Theta Kappa and AACC websites, conferences, and publications.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
