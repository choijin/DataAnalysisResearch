<AbstractNarration>This group proposal has two parts, one is to investigate supersymmetric field theories and String Theories to better understand their properties, and second to understand the phenomenological consequences of the Standard Model (QCD) as well as non-standard generalizations.  Part of the proposal is to understand the recent non-standard model experimental fact that neutrinos have mass. A major effort to understand present neutrino oscillation experiences both long base line, solar and atmospheric data to put constraints and alternative scenarios for explaining neutrino masses and mixing.  Sources of electroweak symmetry breaking will be investigated and the properties and constraints on alternative scenarios for symmetry breaking will be investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; String theory research will focus on the effect of boundary conditions on filed theories in spaces with boundaries, solitons, in non-commutative spaces as well as dualities and AdS/CFT correspondences. Detailed study will be made of String Theories with N=2 and N=3 Supersymmetry.  The covariant quantization of the Green Schwarz superstring will also be investigated.  A rigorous way to study quantum corrections to the masses of Solitons, vortices and eventually branes are being developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QCD projects are connected with understanding collider physics experiments.  To better analyze these experiments it is necessary to calculate perturbatively next to next to leading order contributions to the partonic cross sections, and to apply resummation techniques to these results. These are important for understanding the production of the Higgs, minijets as well as dileptons at RHIC&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
