<AbstractNarration>AST-0349075&lt;br/&gt;Stassun&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Keivan Stassun, at Vanderbilt University, will execute a multi-faceted, collaborative research plan, involving both observational and numerical research components, with the goal of addressing order-of-magnitude problems in star formation. In his research, he will address:&lt;br/&gt;1. Empirical determinations of masses for low-mass pre-main-sequence stars: 2. Angular momentum evolution of young stars: 3. Interpretive 3-D computer models of protostellar environments.  Leveraging extant Vanderbilt resources, this work encompasses a broad, international research program that will provide measurements of masses and angular momenta for young stars, as well as state-of-the-art computer simulations of the complex environments of protostars.  These measurements will then be used in simulations to test forefront theories of star formation and early stellar evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Stassun will execute a coherent, systemic education and outreach plan, integrated into the research, with the goal of addressing the order-of-magnitude under representation of minorities in astronomy and astrophysics. His work will: 1. Enhance science learning for minority K-12 students: 2. Increase professional development opportunities for K-12 science teachers, especially those teaching at minority high-schools: 3.  Train a cadre of minority undergraduate and Masters-level students for PhD study in astronomy and astrophysics: 4. Prepare graduate students for their future roles integrating research and education.   This ambitious plan will be made possible by working in partnership with nearby Fisk University, an Historically Black University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
