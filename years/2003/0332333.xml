<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0332333&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Mohammad Ghomi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator is interested primarily in the&lt;br/&gt;interplay between the geometry and topology of submanifolds,&lt;br/&gt;including low dimensional problems in Euclidean space (curves and&lt;br/&gt;surfaces). These investigations often involve some notion of&lt;br/&gt;convexity, and include the following categories: (i) Shadows (or&lt;br/&gt;shades) on illuminated hypersurfaces, and their application to&lt;br/&gt;geometric variational problems; (ii) Embeddings of manifolds in&lt;br/&gt;Euclidean space without creating parallel or intersecting tangent&lt;br/&gt;lines (totally skew embeddings), and their relation to quadric&lt;br/&gt;hypersurfaces and nonsingular bilinear maps; (iii) Global&lt;br/&gt;properties of locally convex hypersurfaces with boundary,&lt;br/&gt;including connections with Monge-Ampere equations, and a new&lt;br/&gt;convex hull property which is dual to that of negatively curved&lt;br/&gt;surfaces; (iv) Certain deformations of space curves (unfoldings),&lt;br/&gt;and their application to study of extremals of knot energies and&lt;br/&gt;distortion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curves and surfaces are to geometry what numbers are to&lt;br/&gt;algebra. They form the basic ingredients of our visual&lt;br/&gt;perception, and inspire the development of far reaching&lt;br/&gt;mathematical tools. For instance, those aspects of the PI's work&lt;br/&gt;dealing with shadows on illuminated surfaces are motivated in&lt;br/&gt;part by a study of soap films, and have connections to computer&lt;br/&gt;vision (the ``shape from shading" problems).  Further, the&lt;br/&gt;investigations on knot energies may be of interest in studying&lt;br/&gt;DNA. Yet, despite an abundance of potential applications and&lt;br/&gt;centuries of pure study, there are still numerous open problems&lt;br/&gt;in submanifold geometry and topology which are strikingly&lt;br/&gt;intuitive and elementary to state.  The PI believes that&lt;br/&gt;advertising these problems at an early stage is an excellent tool&lt;br/&gt;for sparking the interest of students in mathematical&lt;br/&gt;research. With the aid of computer workshops, courses, seminars,&lt;br/&gt;and the lecture series proposed in this project, the PI plans to&lt;br/&gt;communicate the beauty and excitement of geometric problems to as&lt;br/&gt;wide an audience as possible.</AbstractNarration>
