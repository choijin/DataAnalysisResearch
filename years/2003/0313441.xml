<AbstractNarration>The funds in this grant will be used to support U.S. &lt;br/&gt;researchers, postdocs and graduate students to attend and &lt;br/&gt;present lectures and posters in a Workshop on Group &lt;br/&gt;Theory and Numerical Analysis at the Centre de &lt;br/&gt;Recherches Mathematiques, Universite de Montreal, during &lt;br/&gt;the week May 26-31, 2003.  The workshop features one &lt;br/&gt;aspect of the emerging theory of "geometric integration," &lt;br/&gt;that advocates incorporating known qualitative features of &lt;br/&gt;systems of differential equations, such as invariants, &lt;br/&gt;symmetries, conservation laws, phase-space dynamics, and &lt;br/&gt;symplectic structure, in their numerical solution &lt;br/&gt;algorithms.  In particular, the symmetry properties of a &lt;br/&gt;system of differential equations have proven to be a very &lt;br/&gt;powerful means of understanding the qualitative properties &lt;br/&gt;of its solutions as well as facilitating the determination of &lt;br/&gt;exact analytical solutions.  Such special solutions often &lt;br/&gt;serve as prototypes and govern the asymptotics for more &lt;br/&gt;complicated situations, and also as useful testing grounds &lt;br/&gt;for developing numerical integration schemes.  The &lt;br/&gt;methods of symmetry analysis and integrability for &lt;br/&gt;differential equations have, more recently, been adapted &lt;br/&gt;with considerable success to analyze discrete equations.  &lt;br/&gt;On the other hand, the incorporation of symmetry in the &lt;br/&gt;design of invariant geometric numerical schemes for a &lt;br/&gt;variety of differential equations arising in applications has &lt;br/&gt;recently been the subject of increasing research activity and &lt;br/&gt;advances.  The key objective of the workshop is to bring &lt;br/&gt;experts on applications of group theory to discrete &lt;br/&gt;equations together with practitioners of geometric &lt;br/&gt;numerical methods, thereby stimulating a mutually &lt;br/&gt;beneficial exchange of ideas and recent developments and &lt;br/&gt;fostering a cross-fertilization between such closely related &lt;br/&gt;subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Group theory is the mathematical formalization of the &lt;br/&gt;concept of symmetry.  Most interesting systems that arise &lt;br/&gt;in applications in physics, engineering, chemistry, &lt;br/&gt;computer vision, biology, etc., possess a rich variety of &lt;br/&gt;symmetries.  While exploiting the symmetries of &lt;br/&gt;continuous systems has a long and distinguished record of &lt;br/&gt;achievement, only recently have significant developments &lt;br/&gt;occurred within the discrete regime.  Indeed, standard &lt;br/&gt;numerical solution methods used by computers typically &lt;br/&gt;fail to properly respect the underlying symmetry properties. &lt;br/&gt;This workshop will build on recent developments in &lt;br/&gt;symmetry analysis of discrete systems and the development &lt;br/&gt;of symmetry-preserving numerical solution techniques. The &lt;br/&gt;participants are experts in symmetry methods and in &lt;br/&gt;geometric numerical integration. The workshop will &lt;br/&gt;promote interactions and significant progress in both &lt;br/&gt;subjects, as well as their applications in mathematics and &lt;br/&gt;the sciences.   The results of the workshop, as presented in &lt;br/&gt;the talks and discussions, will be summed up in a book to &lt;br/&gt;be so focused as to be of permanent value.  In addition, an &lt;br/&gt;assessment of the current state of the art in the subjects and &lt;br/&gt;new scientific opportunities stemming from this workshop &lt;br/&gt;will be the focus of a panel discussion and white paper to &lt;br/&gt;be distributed and posted on the web.</AbstractNarration>
