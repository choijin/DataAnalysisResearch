<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes the development of a portable and fully automated chromatographic based analyzer.  This analyzer will integrate several proven technologies to produce  an automated instrument that is compact, robust and easily implemented for  on-line, at-site, or field-ready use, especially where complex HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) analyses are needed.  Based on Sequential Injection (SI) protocol and HPLC instrumentation, this instrument will  be  full  automated  and  provide  an  integrated  approach  with  respect  to  sample  collection, pretreatment, chemical modification, separation and detection of target analytes.  This chemical analyzer will exploit several novel technologies including sequential injection, portable high-pressure  syringe pumps  and  sol-gel HPLC  columns  in  its  development  of  this  hybrid  analyzer referred to as Sequential Injection for High performance Liquid Chromatography (SI-HPLC). Although HPLC is a fundamental fixture in many laboratories; it remains largely a bench-top instrument due to its overall large size, high power consumption and need for manual sample retreatment/preparation prior to analysis.  By integrating several evolving technologies, HPLC analysis can be fully  automated and conducted at much lower pressures, which will also make this analyzer very compact and truly portable as well as energy efficient. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed SI-HPLC instrument will find applications at on-line process control, at-site environmental monitoring or as a multipurpose field-ready analyzer for medical, law-enforcement or military use.  The SI-HPLC instrument will be a low cost, portable  system  that  is  highly  adaptable  to  different  applications  since  it  will  rely  on  an open  architecture made  possible  by  software  programmability.    Sequential  Injection technologies make this  analyzer ideally suited for use by  untrained personnel or  for  remote autonomous analysis since sample handling and preparation can be  completely  automated.  Examples for SI-HPLC  use will be for online process control (e.g. pharmaceuticals) to provide real-time feedback for Quality Control or optimal product yield; at-site monitoring of pesticide or leachate contamination of water sources; or as a field-ready analyzer for mobile hospital units.  The  SI-HPLC  instrument  will  have  broad  application  since  it  will  employee  widely accepted/desired HPLC methodologies into a completely portable and cost-effective field analyzer. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
