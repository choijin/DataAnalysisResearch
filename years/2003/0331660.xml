<AbstractNarration>A  national glass fiber network to serve 100 million households with two-way&lt;br/&gt;symmetric data communications service at 100 Mb/sec per household will&lt;br/&gt;inevitably be constructed during the next few years. The barriers to the&lt;br/&gt;creation of such a network are not simply questions of deployment issues or&lt;br/&gt;the cost of the network.  Rather, fundamental innovations will be required in&lt;br/&gt;the way networks are organized and managed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses a three pronged approach to investigate the possibilities and&lt;br/&gt;technical consequences of this once-in-a-century event.: (1) a holistic&lt;br/&gt;network architecture designed from first principles, (2) interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;fundamental research that addresses the design of an economical, robust,&lt;br/&gt;secure and scalable 100x100 network, and (3) proof-of-concept network&lt;br/&gt;implementations to demonstrate how the network of the future can be built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from the project will take several forms.  First, the blueprint&lt;br/&gt;for the 100x100 network will offer a coherent intellectual framework on how&lt;br/&gt;the next generation network could be built.  The resulting architecture and&lt;br/&gt;design can serve as a compass to guide investment in network development, and&lt;br/&gt;will be disseminated to government and industry through presentations and&lt;br/&gt;partnerships.  Second, in preparing the 100x100 blueprint, fundamental&lt;br/&gt;research advances will be made in security, economics, protocol design, switch&lt;br/&gt;architecture, and network management.  These will be disseminated through the&lt;br/&gt;research community.  Third, the physical testbeds created through the project&lt;br/&gt;can be used as a platform for further studies, for example, the development of&lt;br/&gt;applications demanding high bandwidth or social science research on the impact&lt;br/&gt;of connectivity in the home.  Forth, the software and tools used to design and&lt;br/&gt;validate the 100x100 network, particularly the emulation systems, will be used&lt;br/&gt;to create new curricula for network education for two- and four-year colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
