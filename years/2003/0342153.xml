<AbstractNarration>De Leenheer&lt;br/&gt;     Recent advances in the life sciences have been aimed at&lt;br/&gt;developing and analyzing mathematical models for complex&lt;br/&gt;biological systems.  This has been triggered by the need for&lt;br/&gt;knowledge of their long term behavior.  Moreover, a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of these systems might lead to insights in the&lt;br/&gt;underlying mechanisms, which are usually much more complicated&lt;br/&gt;and less well understood than in the physical sciences.  An&lt;br/&gt;in-depth analysis sometimes reveals unsatisfactory behavior, e.g.&lt;br/&gt;extinction of a certain species or -- at the opposite end of the&lt;br/&gt;spectrum -- persistence of an infectious disease, and require&lt;br/&gt;appropriate modifications.  In this project the investigator uses&lt;br/&gt;control theory in both analysis and possible modification of the&lt;br/&gt;behavior of biological models.  The main idea is to consider these&lt;br/&gt;models from a feedback perspective -- provided this is possible&lt;br/&gt;of course --, which is a central topic of interest in control&lt;br/&gt;theory.  It is argued that certain biological (sub)systems are&lt;br/&gt;actually feedback systems.  Two examples are studied from this&lt;br/&gt;point of view.  The first is the chemostat model with crowding&lt;br/&gt;effects, while the second concerns certain classes of&lt;br/&gt;predator-prey systems.  Stability issues are of primary concern in&lt;br/&gt;this study.  A second part of the work is devoted to control (or&lt;br/&gt;modification) of the behavior of chemostat models with possibly&lt;br/&gt;multiple resources.  The novelty of the approach lies in the way&lt;br/&gt;the control is implemented, by means of feedback control.  The&lt;br/&gt;very principle of this type of control is that the control action&lt;br/&gt;is based on the state of the system.  The usual strategies&lt;br/&gt;appearing in the literature consider constant controls leading to&lt;br/&gt;bifurcation analysis or control signals that depend only on time&lt;br/&gt;-- but not on the state of the system.&lt;br/&gt;     Many biological systems are under close examination these&lt;br/&gt;days.  The human genome project, infectious diseases such as AIDS,&lt;br/&gt;the flu, or even those caused by a bio-terror attack are but few&lt;br/&gt;of the compelling examples.  Usually these systems are very&lt;br/&gt;complex and hard to understand, let alone control.  The aim of&lt;br/&gt;this project is to use the perspective of control theory in&lt;br/&gt;dealing with these problems.  Ideas from control theory have been&lt;br/&gt;very successful in applications in more traditional areas.&lt;br/&gt;Chemical and nuclear plants, airplanes, vehicles and satellites,&lt;br/&gt;robots and audio-visual equipment are nowadays equipped with&lt;br/&gt;computers controlling the smooth operation of the specific&lt;br/&gt;application.  The question is whether control theory can&lt;br/&gt;contribute to rapid developments in the biological sciences.  As&lt;br/&gt;an example, consider a biological system in which a number of&lt;br/&gt;organisms compete against each other.  A basic question is whether&lt;br/&gt;or not the species survive.  Depending on the application one&lt;br/&gt;would like the answer to this question to be yes (for example if&lt;br/&gt;some of the species are endangered) or no (for instance if one of&lt;br/&gt;the species is a malignant virus).  Sometimes the answer turns out&lt;br/&gt;to be no where a yes is desired or vice-versa, and then the issue&lt;br/&gt;becomes whether this can be modified by suitably manipulating the&lt;br/&gt;system.  This type of problem is central in control theory.  The&lt;br/&gt;lessons learned in the areas mentioned above should prove&lt;br/&gt;valuable in a biological setting.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
