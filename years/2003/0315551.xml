<AbstractNarration>Melissa A. Harrington&lt;br/&gt;Proposal # 0315551&lt;br/&gt;RUI: The Neurobiology and Behavior of Slime Trail Tracking in a Predatory Snail&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Euglandina rosea, a carnivorous snail native to the South East, eats slugs and other snails. It finds its prey and potential mates by following slime trails laid down as the animals move. Euglandina are capable of discriminating trails of prey snails from trails left by other Euglandina, and can distinguish trails of preferred from less preferred prey. Individual Euglandina do not follow their own trails.  In addition, the predators can be trained to follow artificial trails of novel chemicals if they are associated with eating prey or with exposure to a potential mate. &lt;br/&gt;Detection of slime trails by Euglandina results in two behavioral outputs: a change in direction to follow the trail; and once the animal leaving the trail is encountered, a choice between an aggressive versus an agonistic interaction (predation versus mating). These reliable and easily detected behavioral changes provide an excellent model system for studying the mechanisms of sensory discrimination and control of behavior. Experiments are proposed to identify and characterize the neural systems and signals that represent slime trail stimuli, and determine a snail's response. Electrophysiological and imaging techniques will be used to identify and record from slime-responsive neurons in the ganglia of Euglandina.  Studying the physiological basis of slime trail tracking will lead to identification of the neural circuits through which slime trail stimuli control the behavior of the whole animal &lt;br/&gt; Funding of this proposal will further the development of a novel and useful model system for studying the neurobiology of sensory processing and learning.  Moreover, since Delaware State University is an historically black, undergraduate institution with a 78% African-American enrollment, this research will increase opportunities for minority undergraduates to directly experience the scientific process by taking part in basic research in a laboratory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
