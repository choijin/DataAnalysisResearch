<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)  The Peer-Led Team Learning workshop chemistry model is being adapted to an environment where peer leaders who have previously taken the workshop course are unavailable.  In particular, two institutions, Northampton Community College and the Berks Lehigh Valley campus of Pennsylvania State University, which only offer two years of chemistry courses are using the PLTL model in the second year organic chemistry course.  Since neither institution has students who took the course in the previous year, students who are currently taking the course serve as "in-class" peer leaders.  This implementation is also being tested on the Lehigh University campus as well.  Comparisons will be made between student performance with and without in-class peer leaders.  Also on the Lehigh University campus a comparison between using an in-class peer leader and a peer leader who completed the course in a prior semester will also be made.  Results of these comparisons will be submitted to the Journal of Chemical Education and presented at national meetings.</AbstractNarration>
