<AbstractNarration>0325940&lt;br/&gt;Trivedi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award facilitates collaborative research on high temperature alloys between Professor Rohit Trivedi of Iowa State University and Professor Jehyun Lee of Changwon National University in Korea.  They are examining processing variables that affect the solid-state transformation and microstructure of alloys composed of various combinations of Iron, Chromium and Aluminum.  The two research groups have unique and complimentary expertise and facilities. The Iowa State group will produce the alloy ingots for processing in Korea and will be responsible for the development of the theoretical model and for some of the materials characterization. Most experimental work will be carried out in Korea using state of the art directional solidification apparatus at Changwon University that can heat the samples several hundred degrees Celsius higher than the equipment at Iowa State University.  The groups have complementary optical and electron microscopy equipment to examine the resulting material structure in various ways, and the two investigators will analyze the data jointly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training and research experience of students is an important part of the project plan. An U.S. graduate student will obtain international research experience and access to equipment in the Korean Lab that is not available at Iowa State, and will then contribute to constructing comparable equipment at Iowa State.  The project also includes plans for an undergraduate student to gain research experience with the Korean investigator during his visit to Iowa State. The results obtained from this study will be of significance to steel industries because they are relevant to improved selection of alloys and processing approaches for the design and processing of stainless steels. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
