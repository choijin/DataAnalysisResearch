<AbstractNarration>Project Summary (Song Wang) &lt;br/&gt;EIA-0312861&lt;br/&gt;Song Whang&lt;br/&gt;USC Research Foundation&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is to develop an integrated and practical framework for shape modeling and use it to achieve more reliable segmentation of medical images. This research is motivated by the fact that reliable extraction, representation, and incorporation of some prior shape information can greatly reduce the segmentation error resulting from image noise. Three important problems will be addressed and integrated to effectively explore shape information for medical image segmentation:  shape representation, shape correspondence,  and  shape  deformation.  The shape representation is to compactly describe a shape in terms of a set of landmark points. The shape correspondence is to establish landmark-based correspondence among a set of shape samples. &lt;br/&gt;The shape deformation is to first construct a shape template that captures representative shape characteristics of a particular object class, and then use it to delineate an object of the same class from a new image. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual  Merits:  This  research  studies  the  shape  modeling  method  from  a  unique systematic perspective. While previous researches usually focus on a particular problem in shape modeling, we will investigate all three interrelated key problems, i.e., shape representation, shape correspondence, and shape deformation, in an integrated and unified framework, specifically for medical image segmentation.  Under this unified framework, we develop novel methods to address most important issues in each of these three problems.  In the shape representation,  we will  incorporate  our  resolution-independent  feature  extraction  method  to  estimate  key  shape parameters such as position, tangent direction, and curvature more accurately. This will provide a representation format that is accurate, compact, and flexible in describing a group of shape instances. In the shape correspondence, we will develop global and local correspondence methods to choose landmarks based on the following criteria: (1) simple shape representation, (2) small representation error, and  (3) optimal inter-shape landmark correspondence.  An advanced network-flow technique will be used to integrate these three measures into a new unified formulation. In the shape deformation, we will develop effective shape-learning techniques based on a  group  of  well-corresponded  training  samples.  The techniques employ more general and &lt;br/&gt;accurate probability distribution models than simple Gaussian distributions. Based on the models, &lt;br/&gt;we  will  further  develop  our  shape  deformation  method  to  deal  with  important  issues  like &lt;br/&gt;algorithm robustness and topology preservation.  &lt;br/&gt;Broad Impacts: Fast growth of medical imaging industry provides us tremendous amount &lt;br/&gt;of data in many forms like MRI, CT, PET, cryosection, microscopic, etc. It is urgent to develop &lt;br/&gt;advanced information technology to convert those medical data into useful information. Among &lt;br/&gt;them, geometric shape information is of particular importance as they are widely used in clinical &lt;br/&gt;diagnoses. The proposed research will greatly facilitate the shape information exploration from &lt;br/&gt;medical images and provide physician and radiologists new and powerful computational tools. In &lt;br/&gt;the  long  term,  this  research will  further  intensify  the  current  efforts  to  bridge  the  gap  between information  technology  and  medical  applications.  Furthermore,  the  proposed  research  can  be applied  to  many  other  applications  like  video  tracking  and  biometrics  that  shares  the  same problems as in shape exploration from medical images. This  research  also  provides  many  educational  contributions.  We  will  integrate  the medical image processing into a series of image processing and computer vision courses in the University  of  South  Carolina  (USC).  This  research  will  also  actively  contribute  to  the  K-12 education in the state by assisting the NSF Bridges for Engineering Education Program awarded to  the  University  and  participating  in  the  summer  mentor  program  by  the  South  Carolina Governor's  School  for  Science  and Mathematics.  Biomedical  engineering  has  been  selected  as one  of  three  main  focus  areas  for  research  at  USC.  Thus,  our  research  effort  will  directly contribute to the university wide efforts. In particular, our effort can be integrated with the neuro-imaging initiative at the Psychology Department and the new Center for Colon Cancer Research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
