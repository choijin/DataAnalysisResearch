<AbstractNarration>Over a three year period, the Museum of Science, Boston will develop a national traveling exhibition and associated programs that will support the goals and standards for technological literacy that were recently articulated in reports by the National Academy of Engineering and the International Technology Education Association. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit.  The exhibit will take advantage of the widely known characters and images of future technology from the Star Wars movies to attract visitors and to engage them in learning about potential technologies that may impact our lives.  It incorporates new and adapted interactive devices that will involve visitors in inquiry-based learning about technologies related to frictionless land vehicles, robotic mobility mechanisms, and habitats for living underwater and in space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact.  The exhibition will reach a large national audience by traveling to the members of the Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative as well as other institutions.  Use of popular culture, science fiction and futuristic technology will help attract those who may not be traditional science center visitors. Educational impact will be extended through programming for the public and school groups, including materials for institutions that do not host the exhibition, along with a website. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
