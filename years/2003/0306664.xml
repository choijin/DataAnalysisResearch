    <AbstractNarration>For medical, biological and chemical applications, microfluidic devices such as valves, mixers and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) cantilevers are of particular importance, but the simulation tools available to design these devices are quite limited. This research focuses on development of fast integral equation based solvers for the convection-diffusion equations associated with mixing and for the Navier-Stokes problems associated with microvalves and AFM cantilever tips. We plan to interface these fast nonlinear solvers with model reduction techniques so as to automatically extract system models of these microfluidic components, making it possible for designers to perform system level simulation and optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research developed in this proposal will be carried out in conjunction with an educational program. The educational objectives are to promote the involvement of minorities and women in the research area of design of Micro/Nano systems. To create impact of the proposed research on MEMS industry, software resulting from this research will be placed in the public domain and will be available via the web.</AbstractNarration>
