<AbstractNarration>ITR: Reliable Distributed Programming with Speculations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been well established that the United States needs better&lt;br/&gt;programming technology to assure the safety and reliability of the&lt;br/&gt;nation's software infrastructure.  The National Research Council, the&lt;br/&gt;President's commission on critical infrastructure protection, and the&lt;br/&gt;PITAC report reach similar conclusions: that the nation depends on&lt;br/&gt;fragile software, and technologies for building reliable software are&lt;br/&gt;inadequate.  To address these problems, this research develops a new&lt;br/&gt;programming model, called speculations, for ensuring software&lt;br/&gt;reliability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A speculation is a computation that depends on an assumption that may&lt;br/&gt;be difficult or impossible to verify prior to evaluating the&lt;br/&gt;computation.  If the assumption is later found to be false, the&lt;br/&gt;computation is rolled back.  Speculations are especially useful in&lt;br/&gt;distributed systems, where failures are inevitable: the network may&lt;br/&gt;fail, processors may fail, and the code itself may have errors.  In&lt;br/&gt;this new approach, speculations are used to wrap potentially unsafe&lt;br/&gt;computations.  If a fault occurs, the program is restored to a&lt;br/&gt;well-known program state where the fault can be easily resolved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research develops the theory and design automation tools for&lt;br/&gt;speculations in three parts: first, the programming language theory is&lt;br/&gt;expanded to provide a basis for speculation; second, the theory is&lt;br/&gt;used to implement compiler and operating system extensions that&lt;br/&gt;automate the support for speculations; and third, speculations are&lt;br/&gt;used to develop new distributed communication protocols and&lt;br/&gt;algorithms.  Speculations conform to a widely-understood design model&lt;br/&gt;based on transactions, easing deployment as a general-purpose&lt;br/&gt;programming tool.  The results of the research are open source and&lt;br/&gt;freely available.</AbstractNarration>
