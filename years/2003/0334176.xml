<AbstractNarration>The Network Startup Resource Center (NSRC) project provides technical information, engineer-&lt;br/&gt;ing assistance, training, and equipment to research institutions and networking organizations in &lt;br/&gt;developing areas. The  primary goal is to make it easier for US scientists and engineers, and those &lt;br/&gt;in developing areas, to collaborate via the Internet. In FY04 the project will transition this year to other programs and continue to develop network infrastructure in the less-connected parts of the &lt;br/&gt;world continuing its tradition of high leveraging through these ongoing partnerships and alliances.  &lt;br/&gt;The NSRC.s activities develop and enhance network infrastructure for collaborative research, education, and international partnerships, while promoting teaching and training via the transfer of technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work provides significant benefits for US scientists and the international research community by &lt;br/&gt;facilitating better access for researchers in developing countries who participate in the global &lt;br/&gt;research enterprise. Regarding intellectual merit, NSRC.s work advances knowledge and under-&lt;br/&gt;standing within the fields of networking and telecommunications through a clearly focused strat-&lt;br/&gt;egy: working on the specific problems of engineers and technologists in the research and &lt;br/&gt;educational environments of poorer, less developed countries. The improved communications &lt;br/&gt;resulting from these efforts are then available to scientists and engineers, on both ends of the &lt;br/&gt;spectrum, enabling the application of a wide variety of ideas, information, talent, and resources to &lt;br/&gt;a given research question. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The NSRC.s main focus areas are: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Helping develop and deploy Internet infrastructure in overseas R&amp;E networks &lt;br/&gt;Assisting US scientists with international collaboration and research partnerships&lt;br/&gt;Providing technical information and resources to network operators &lt;br/&gt;Providing direct network engineering and planning assistance  &lt;br/&gt;Helping organize regional training workshops and centers  &lt;br/&gt;Coordinating donations and shipments of networking books and equipment  &lt;br/&gt;Developing Internet exchange points &lt;br/&gt;Helping build and deploy wireless network infrastructure  &lt;br/&gt;Hosting network engineering interns  &lt;br/&gt;Advising on the establishment of help desk and user support services  &lt;br/&gt;Maintaining a historical archive of Internet connectivity  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The NSRC and University of Oregon team brings considerable operational experience in design-&lt;br/&gt;ing networks and deploying Internet technology in places with minimal infrastructure and limited &lt;br/&gt;resources. Colleagues from the extensive international contacts and relationships that we have &lt;br/&gt;established over the past fifteen years are willing to contribute their time and expertise to NSRC &lt;br/&gt;initiatives and activities, putting special emphasis on scientific institutions when we request their &lt;br/&gt;help on behalf of NSF and US scientists. Having assisted many of the initial network efforts in &lt;br/&gt;developing economies, the NSRC is transitioning to assisting those networks with issues of scal-&lt;br/&gt;ability, enrichment of services and applications for end users, and national and regional coopera-&lt;br/&gt;tion. The substantial in-kind support we have received from  industry, equipment vendors, and &lt;br/&gt;book publishers, in part because of NSF.s imprimatur, has significantly multiplied the return of &lt;br/&gt;NSF.s investment in the NSRC project. By building on past successes and current working rela-&lt;br/&gt;Tionships this project will formalize strategic alliances with  partners in industry and academia that support the NSRC.s activities.</AbstractNarration>
