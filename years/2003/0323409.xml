<AbstractNarration>This exploratory research project is aimed at the development of an integrated manufacturing process that can directly produce functional synthetic fibers for biological and chemical protective clothing.  Such protective clothing materials are extremely important and urgently needed by medical workers, first responders, and military personal.  Most protective clothing and respirators (such as N-95) are made of polyolefin fibers by directly using fiber entanglements or adhesives to hold fibers together in dense and stable sheet forms.  A melting extrusion process is the only process that can be potentially used for incorporation of new functions on the fibers, which is the reason for proposing this research for reactive extrusion.  The researchers propose to employ halamine structures as candidates for self-decontaminating agents and ally group as reactive group in controlled radical reactions to incorporate halamine structures to polymers in the reactive fiber extrusion process. According to the requirements of possessing both halamine and reactive, allyl groups, 3-allyl-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (ADMH), is proposed as the first reactive monomer for this process.  The aim is that the functional synthetic fibers incorporated with ADMH structure will be able to provide self-decontaminating functions on chemical and biological protective clothing.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this research can significantly increase protection for first responders and military personnel.  This proposed integrated manufacturing process is an environmentally friendly and energy efficient process.  The study has great impact to homeland security as well as to textile education and textile materials research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
