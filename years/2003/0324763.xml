    <AbstractNarration>This grant is a one year NSF/CONACyT collaborative research award to design, develop and form a network of US and Mexican universities working on research and educational projects in the area of electronics manufacturing. The objective is to advance scientific and engineering knowledge through joint research efforts of investigators from the United States and Mexico having complementary talents and interests taking advantage of Network infrastructures. The collaborating universities are: Arizona State University, Texas A&amp;M University, and Universidad de Guadalajara). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emphasis will be on the establishment of a MANufacturing NETwork (MANET). It is expected that the proposed network will serve as a model to be extended later to other universities in both the United States and Mexico. It is also envisioned that the formation of MANET can be a catalyst for development of an integrated electronics manufacturing industry in the Southwest US and Northern Mexico, with consequent economic benefits to both countries. Once the network is well established in manufacturing research projects, it will be natural to extend it to other technological areas and industries. The project activities include: (1) access to laboratory equipment and student support to implement remote connection among the universities (TAMU), and (2) provide access to 2D and 3D flexible inspection systems and student support to implement the remote connection among the universities (ASU).</AbstractNarration>
