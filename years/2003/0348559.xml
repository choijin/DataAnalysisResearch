<AbstractNarration>In view of the large amount of high-quality data that started to flow from RHIC recently, and the central role of RHIC for the nuclear physics community, this proposal is very timely. &lt;br/&gt;Professor Gavin proposes to further develop and apply tools for the identification and study of what is commonly referred to as the "quark-gluon plasma". He is suggesting to continue and expand the study of correlations and fluctuations in collaboration with experimentalists. He also proposes to apply concepts of non-equilibrium and equilibrium statistical physics to the QCD phase transition. Finally, Professor Gavin plans to revisit charmonium production in RHIC collisions, an area where he has made substantial contributions in the past. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two of the ratings of the mail reviewers are "very good", with one "excellent". Some of the reviewers believe that the PI is well positioned to make a major contribution to the field. The mail reviewers and the Panel appreciate the solid impact of Prof. Gavin's prior work, the originality of his ideas, and his ability and willingness to work with experimentalists. In the opinion of the Panel, it is extremely important to support young theorists who can interpret the very large amount of data and have the potential to take full advantage of them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational activities and broader impact: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational aspects and broader impact of the proposal are seen as strong by the Panel. It is natural for Prof. Gavin to participate in the education of minorities in an urban setting due to the location of his home institution. By collaborating with Dr. Ferreira and planning a case-study based course for pre-service teachers, the PI goes well beyond the call of duty and is building a firm foundation for a lifetime of integrated contributions to research and education. He should get an opportunity to try out his ideas.</AbstractNarration>
