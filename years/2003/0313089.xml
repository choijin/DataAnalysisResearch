<AbstractNarration>One consequence of the phenomenal storage density improvement is the&lt;br/&gt;emergence of highly compact disk storage that can be integrated into&lt;br/&gt;various computing and networking devices of various shapes and forms.&lt;br/&gt;Our conjecture is that mobile storage will become a dominant form of&lt;br/&gt;storage in the near future, especially for personal user data,&lt;br/&gt;subsuming conventional disks enshrined in server rooms.  This proposal&lt;br/&gt;describes a project that studies how to build, manage, and use&lt;br/&gt;discrete storage devices to form ad hoc, distributed storage systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we propose to build system software to intelligently&lt;br/&gt;coordinate the discrete storage elements.  The system has four core&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms: (1) a multicast-like data location mechanism, (2) an&lt;br/&gt;invalidation mechanism for purging obsolete data from the system, (3)&lt;br/&gt;a snapshot mechanism for supporting sharing and backup, and (4) a&lt;br/&gt;storage level solution that can support existing file systems.  In&lt;br/&gt;this proposal, we describe how combinations of these four core&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms allow us to achieve our consistency, transparency,&lt;br/&gt;reliability, security, and performance goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, the data management needs addressed by this project are&lt;br/&gt;by no means limited to traditional desktop applications.  As the data&lt;br/&gt;management functionalities are separated from cumbersome generic&lt;br/&gt;computing devices, and as these functionalities are cleanly&lt;br/&gt;encapsulated in modular small form factor devices that can readily&lt;br/&gt;interact with other consumer electronic devices (such as cameras, MP3&lt;br/&gt;players, phones, and email devices), these application-specific&lt;br/&gt;devices would be freed from the burden of having to solve and re-solve&lt;br/&gt;a difficult mobile storage problem, and we may multiply the utility of&lt;br/&gt;these devices and potentially foster new applications.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
