    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II project will develop and test remote radio frequency measurements for integrity monitoring of gas fuel-pipelines. This novel application of&lt;br/&gt;RF measurements uses the pipe as a transmission line. Antennas launch pulses that travel inside the pipe, without disturbing the transported fluid. Pulses reflect-off obstructions/breaches in the pipe and are measured by distributed low-cost receivers to locate the fault. Phase-I research demonstrated the proof of concept for this automated monitoring system and defined interfaces with an emergency management telecommunications system that provides notification to the pipeline response team and warning to affected residents/businesses - all within minutes of the event. The objectives for Phase-II are to develop an engineering model FloWatch system, to install this system in an operating gas pipeline, and to perform end-to-end testing of the sensors and emergency notification system. &lt;br/&gt; The outcome of this research will lead to a marketable product, which when implemented by pipeline operators, can save millions of dollars annually in pipeline spills and avert potential loss of life and property. Further benefits will result through improved pipeline operations that will result in lower-cost and reliable delivery of energy needs for businesses, industry and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
