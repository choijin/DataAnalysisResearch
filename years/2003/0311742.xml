<AbstractNarration>Project Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, we develop efficient congestion control&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms for high-performance interconnection networks used in&lt;br/&gt;multiprocessors, distributed network-based multicomputer clusters,&lt;br/&gt;storage systems, and IP router fabrics.  Techniques will be&lt;br/&gt;explored that allow rapid advancement of packets directly involved&lt;br/&gt;in network congestion.  Our approach is based on adding minimal&lt;br/&gt;intelligence to routers and network interfaces---in the form of&lt;br/&gt;speculative scheduling capability---such that resources are maximally&lt;br/&gt;utilized while packets are efficiently routed.  This can be done by&lt;br/&gt;more effectively steering packets around congested areas and by more&lt;br/&gt;precisely detecting and handling potential deadlock situations arising&lt;br/&gt;from cyclically-correlated congestion on a closed set of resources.&lt;br/&gt;A by-product is that global expansion of congestion trees/cycles which&lt;br/&gt;can seriously degrade performance is prevented.  In addition to&lt;br/&gt;developing formal theoretical support for the approach, detailed&lt;br/&gt;evaluations will be carried out through modeling and simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The significance of this research is two-fold. First, by effectively&lt;br/&gt;dispersing packets out of congested regions of the network, higher&lt;br/&gt;sustained throughput and lower, more predictable latency can be&lt;br/&gt;achieved.  That is, more data can be sent and received through the&lt;br/&gt;network over a given period of time, and the time it takes for the&lt;br/&gt;network to deliver the data can be reduced, with less variability.&lt;br/&gt;Second, by efficiently resolving deadlock in the network, the&lt;br/&gt;routing of packets is guaranteed never to come to a halt.  These&lt;br/&gt;important factors allow computer applications which require a great&lt;br/&gt;amount of communication between system components to run much&lt;br/&gt;faster and dependably.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
