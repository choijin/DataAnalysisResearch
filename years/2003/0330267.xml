<AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposal is the development and study of novel, inherently conductive&lt;br/&gt;polymer thin films that will be used for selective sensing of inorganic anions with emphasis on&lt;br/&gt;phosphate- and phosphonate-related species. The detection and quantitative measurement of levels of&lt;br/&gt;phosphate and phosphonate anions is an important requirement for drug testing and pharmacological&lt;br/&gt;(pharmacokinetic) studies as well as environmental monitoring. The sensing of these anions, found in&lt;br/&gt;fertilizers and pharmaceuticals, is aimed at aqueous environment and low concentrations (&lt; 10 -6 mol/l).&lt;br/&gt;Sensor materials capable of reacting to the presence of analyte by change of optical&lt;br/&gt;(color/emission) and electrical properties in a simultaneous regime will be developed. The combination of&lt;br/&gt;two independent modes of signal transduction will improve the selectivity and reliability of the sensing&lt;br/&gt;process. This will be accomplished by preparing novel polythiophene-based polymer materials with&lt;br/&gt;anion-selective receptors integrated into the pi-conjugated backbone of the polymer. The critical&lt;br/&gt;knowledge amassed during the PI's previous studies will be used to prepare monomers bearing suitable&lt;br/&gt;receptors and electropolymerizable thiophene derivatives. These sensor monomers will be&lt;br/&gt;electrochemically polymerized on the surface of transparent electrodes. Such transparent electrodes&lt;br/&gt;coated with anion sensor material will be used to fabricate spectroelectrochemical cells, which will allow&lt;br/&gt;for investigation of anion binding using two modes of signal transduction: changes in optical and&lt;br/&gt;electrical properties. The two-mode signal transduction is expected to increase the accuracy of the whole&lt;br/&gt;sensing process, enhance specificity and make these materials capable of anion sensing in multi-anion&lt;br/&gt;environments. Reliable anion sensing in multi-anion environments will be achieved by using individually&lt;br/&gt;addressable transparent microelectrodes with multiple deposited materials bearing different receptors.&lt;br/&gt;Alternatively, similar effect may be achieved by copolymerization of two or more sensor monomers&lt;br/&gt;bearing different receptor units. These sensor-coated electrodes will be used to build sensor devices and&lt;br/&gt;will be tested in multi-analyte environments.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed research is diverse. Polymer materials capable of sensing&lt;br/&gt;of anionic substrates in polar/aqueous solutions at low concentrations are rare. Efforts toward&lt;br/&gt;implementing successful molecular sensors into polymer materials, which may allow the development of&lt;br/&gt;robust/stable materials with improved performance, are therefore desirable. Particularly important in this&lt;br/&gt;regard is the idea of improved reliability and accuracy of the sensing process by simultaneous&lt;br/&gt;implementation of two independent modes of signal transduction. This may allow for reliable sensing of&lt;br/&gt;anionic substrates that are otherwise difficult to sense. The approach of detecting the anion by change of&lt;br/&gt;two variables in a simultaneous regime may allow for sensing of multiple anionic analytes. This is&lt;br/&gt;particularly important because, despite the great need, materials and devices that would provide both high&lt;br/&gt;selectivity and allow for multi-analyte sensing have not been successfully prepared so far.&lt;br/&gt;In terms of the broader impacts, this PI would like to emphasize that the proposed research will&lt;br/&gt;serve for the advancement of general knowledge by investigating novel sensor materials. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;multi-anion sensors would be highly useful in a wide variety of applications, mostly medical and&lt;br/&gt;environmental, for example to allow for a precise monitoring of drug metabolization thus stimulate a&lt;br/&gt;development of novel drug-metabolization assays. The development and investigation of such novel,&lt;br/&gt;conductive polymers with dual mode of signal transduction for sensing anionic multi-analytes represents&lt;br/&gt;a venture into an emerging and far reaching area of research and technology. This PI's team will also take&lt;br/&gt;active part in an interdisciplinary discussion focused on various aspects of anion sensing through&lt;br/&gt;publication and active participation in scientific meetings. Last but not least, the broader community will&lt;br/&gt;benefit through the advancement of education thus contributing to professional training of qualified&lt;br/&gt;workforce.</AbstractNarration>
