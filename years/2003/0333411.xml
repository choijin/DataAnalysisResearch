<AbstractNarration>This IGERT program is focused on the creation of a training environment that combines cellular and systems neuroscience with microelectronics/computing technology and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).  The novel combination of disciplines will result in a program whose intellectual merit is embodied in the development and application of systems that integrate neural tissue and engineered components.  Research applications range from enhancing knowledge of living organisms, to augmenting damaged neuronal tissue, to creating biologically-inspired engineered systems.  The participating faculty members have a strong track record of interdisciplinary education and research that has laid the foundation for this effort.  The IGERT program will build upon this foundation through a combination of educational infrastructure and interdisciplinary research opportunities that will facilitate the training of IGERT fellows, who will emerge from the program as a new breed of scientist-engineer that understands and can apply knowledge that crosses these two, previously disparate disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will impact the participating institutions and the broader neuroengineering community through its educational, recruitment, and professional-development components.  Educational efforts formalize interactions among programs at Georgia Tech and Emory, resulting in the integrated training of biology and engineering students to address issues at the intersection of these two disciplines.  The program includes many interlinked educational components, including the capstone Hybrid Neural Microsystems course, which combines laboratory experience, problem-based learning, and implicit mentoring.  The recruitment and retention efforts target the creation of a candidate pool of potential neuroscience and engineering students who are prepared for this program.  These efforts will focus on the recruitment of a significant population of under-represented minority students, capitalizing upon existing partnerships between Georgia Tech, Emory, and the colleges of the Atlanta University Center.  Career development will be fostered by engaging the fellows in collaborative international experiences and in industrial internships, enhancing, in the process, existing relationships with these international and industrial partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. In this sixth year of the program, awards are being made to institutions for programs that collectively span the areas of science and engineering supported by NSF.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This IGERT program, funded from 2004 through 2011, was focused on training PhD students at Georgia Tech (Bioengineering, Biomedical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering) and Emory University (Neuroscience) in the area of "hybrid neural microsystems" - the science and technology of interfacing neural systems with engineered systems, with a primary focus at small scales.   Intellectual Merit.  This program was very successful at cross-training neuroscience and engineering graduate students. A majority of the students were in bioengineering or biomedical engineering, and many were placed in co-advisor situations on projects that had both a neuroscience and a technology component.  Novel results included new preparations and techniques for studying the neural control of movement and novel technologies for stimulating neural activity in in vitro experiments.  Several of these co-advised projects became catalysts for longer collaborations that led to subsequent funding from extramural funding sources.  Broader Impact. Over the course of the project, 45 PhD students received funding for one or two years of their initial graduate training, with cohorts of students enrolling in the Fall 2004 through Fall 2008 entering classes.  This cohort of students included 6 underrepresented minorities and 16 female students.  Of these 45 students, 17 have received the PhD, 2 graduated with a MS degree, and 21 are still actively pursuing their PhD.  Of this cohort, 11 also received NSF Graduate Research Fellowships.  Graduated students are now pursuing both academic careers as well as cutting edge industry positions. The students were trained in a novel curriculum that combined problem-based learning with graduate-level laboratory exercises, and these activities led to the creation of permanent courses at Georgia Tech embodying similar principles (e.g., a senior elective titled Neuroengineering Fundamentals).   Research performed by the students has advanced many areas of basic neuroscience, enhanced understanding of how animals and humans coordinate motor activity by the nervous system, and advanced understanding how neural circuits process information.  Finally, an international travel supplement funded over 30 individual student trips to spend 3-5 weeks working in the laboratory of an overseas collaborator.  Several students engaged in repeated trips and catalyzed long-term research collaborations resulting in peer-reviewed manuscript publications.
