<AbstractNarration>A new program US-Japan Young Scientists Exchange Program has been marked between MEXT, Japan and NSF. An exchange visits to several Japanese universities for twelve US scientists, with research interests broadly defined as Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, at the early stages of their academic careers is proposed. The Japanese government will sponsor an equivalent trip of twelve young scientists from Japan to several US universities as the other part of this exchange visit. The US scientists will visit Japan for ten days November 3-14, 2003. The format of the trip will consist of a one-day workshop in Tokyo followed by site visits to various Japanese universities. Both the US as well as the Japanese team will present brief summaries of their research at the workshop, allowing the scientists to learn about their areas of research. The laboratories to be visited will depend upon the research interests of the team members, with one day for each site. The Japanese colleagues, in equivalent stages of their careers, will be visiting US universities September 24-October 4, 2003. The format for their trip will be similar, a workshop, followed by site visits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Links established between scientists in the US and Japan at the very early stages of their academic careers will lay the foundation for a long-term fruitful collaboration over an extended period, maximizing the probability for a successful global interdisciplinary effort. Besides the presenters, several additional university colleagues are expected to attend the symposia at MIT and in Japan. This exposure will translate directly to education of graduate students, potentially as visiting students or as postdoctoral fellows. Undergraduate students in research groups will also benefit from this experience. A side benefit of this program is the exposure of US and Japanese scientists to research programs in their own groups.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
