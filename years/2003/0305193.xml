<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigators will study several related&lt;br/&gt;   asymptotic limits of nonlinear partial differential&lt;br/&gt;   equations arising in fluid mechanics. Interest is focused&lt;br/&gt;   on how solutions behave in limits where certain terms in&lt;br/&gt;   the equations become increasingly negligible.  For the &lt;br/&gt;   situations in view here, these terms correspond to the&lt;br/&gt;   physical effects of dissipation and dispersion. It is&lt;br/&gt;   planned to work at two levels of complexity. The first,&lt;br/&gt;   and easier level is that of model equations for wave&lt;br/&gt;   propagation where nonlinear, dispersive and dissipative&lt;br/&gt;   effects are all present. Both qualitative and quantitative&lt;br/&gt;   information will be sought. The information obtained&lt;br/&gt;   will yield information helpful to modelling near-shore&lt;br/&gt;   zone processes. At a more complex level, it is planned&lt;br/&gt;   to investigate various limits of the Navier-Stokes&lt;br/&gt;   equations including the inviscid limit for the &lt;br/&gt;   Navier-Stokes equations in bounded domains with fixed &lt;br/&gt;   boundaries, and for statistical solutions with periodic &lt;br/&gt;   boundary conditions (or in all of space). It is also&lt;br/&gt;   intended to investigate how well the Navier-Stokes&lt;br/&gt;   equations posed in a channel are modelled by dissipative&lt;br/&gt;   nonlinear wave equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   The present award will support research on several interesting &lt;br/&gt;   and important asymptotic limits for mathematical models. The&lt;br/&gt;   kind of limits under consideration here arise in various&lt;br/&gt;   areas of physics, mechanics, oceanography, materials science,&lt;br/&gt;   biology, and elsewhere when partial differential equations&lt;br/&gt;   are used as models. The problems considered here derive&lt;br/&gt;   principally from fluid mechanics, but in so far as we are&lt;br/&gt;   successful in our program, there is a broader implied  scope.&lt;br/&gt;   The zero-limits under study are those associated with &lt;br/&gt;   dissipation and dispersion in fluid motion.  In various&lt;br/&gt;   modeling situations, one or the other of these effects may&lt;br/&gt;   be ignored.  The question then arises whether or not such &lt;br/&gt;   approximations are justified and, if so, under what flow conditions &lt;br/&gt;   and over what time scales.  These questions are of &lt;br/&gt;   theoretical and practical importance since the approximating &lt;br/&gt;   equations are often easier to use. This award will support work that&lt;br/&gt;   aims to address issues including fundamental points and aspects&lt;br/&gt;   that arise in the use of these equations as descriptions of&lt;br/&gt;   real phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
