<AbstractNarration>This proposal involves acquisition of replacement laboratory instrumentation for the Experimental and Analytical Geochemistry Laboratory (EAGL) in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Michigan. Several of EAGL's main analytical tools, a Leeman simultaneous ICP-OES, a Dionex ion chromatograph, UIC coulometric titrators, and a GBC dual beam spectrophotometer, have been used routinely in research and teaching since they were purchased in 1986, and are now in need of replacement. Walter's research group has made contributions in the areas of marine carbonate geochemistry, the geochemistry of natural waters, experimental geochemistry, and sedimentary basin hydrogeochemistry. Given EAGL's capabilities, the laboratory not only has served Walter's research group but others at the UM and elsewhere on a recharge basis, particularly researchers in aqueous chemistry, and marine biogeochemistry. It has been maintained by an Instrumental Analyst (50% institutional salary support) over the years and has accrued considerable experience in managing a productive research and educational facility. The EAGL has also had a broad societal impact in terms of working on practical problems (applied geochemistry, environmental problems, hydrocarbon and groundwater pollution and resource issues, climate change and human impacts on natural forested watersheds). Over the years, many graduate students have trained in the lab and have used the facilities to produce a variety of research studies, which have advanced the state of scientific knowledge. Furthermore, the hands-on training they received gave them the expertise and confidence to set up their own research laboratories at other institutions. The requested instrumentation includes a JY Horiba Ultima 2C ICP- OES, a Milestone Ethos Microwave Digestion Station, a Dionex DX 600 High Performance Ion Chromatograph with conductivity and photodiode array detector, a UIC Coulometrics Carbon Coulometer with additional acidification module, and a Perkin Elmer Lambda 25 UVNIS spectrophotometer. The acquisition of this new generation of equipment, with its quantum leap in analytical capability and ease of use, will facilitate even greater scientific research contributions, while at the same time having broader impacts on societal concerns, real-world applications, student education and training, and on mentoring the next generation of geoscientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
