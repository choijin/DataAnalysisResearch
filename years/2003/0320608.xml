<AbstractNarration>We are developing educational materials to bring modern content into&lt;br/&gt;introductory physics. With the aid of previous NSF funding we have created&lt;br/&gt;a new calculus-based introductory textbook on mechanics and thermal physics&lt;br/&gt;that addresses the following problems: 1) Many students have already&lt;br/&gt;studied mechanics in high school and are bored by repeating nearly the same&lt;br/&gt;material in college. 2) Students and instructors are unhappy with the lack&lt;br/&gt;of contemporary science in the traditional course. 3) Students in the&lt;br/&gt;traditional course are not involved in the modeling of physical systems,&lt;br/&gt;including making idealizations, approximations and simplifying assumptions.&lt;br/&gt;4) Thermodynamics and mechanics are traditionally treated as completely&lt;br/&gt;separate topics, rather than as an integrated science based on a small&lt;br/&gt;number of fundamental principles. The new curriculum emphasizes&lt;br/&gt;atomic-level description and analysis, and physical modeling including&lt;br/&gt;computer modeling. The material deliberately looks to the students very&lt;br/&gt;different from what they had studied earlier. Thermal physics is integrated&lt;br/&gt;with mechanics throughout the textbook, climaxing with an accessible&lt;br/&gt;statistical mechanical treatment of the Einstein solid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We believe that the new textbook provides a needed alternative to&lt;br/&gt;traditional texts, but it is not yet pedagogically robust and&lt;br/&gt;transportable. It already works well with exceptionally strong students;&lt;br/&gt;this is important because such students are at special risk of boredom, and&lt;br/&gt;we do not want to lose them. However, we would like to make this&lt;br/&gt;interesting subject matter accessible not just to the honors student but&lt;br/&gt;also to the average student who has had a decent high school physics&lt;br/&gt;preparation. It is also important to make the curriculum teachable by other&lt;br/&gt;instructors; this requires the creation of additional kinds of materials,&lt;br/&gt;including an instructor's manual and support packages for introducing&lt;br/&gt;computer modeling into the course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to continue work on pedagogical aspects of the reform, with&lt;br/&gt;further revisions of the textbook in response to our teaching experiences&lt;br/&gt;and ongoing formative assessment activities. A key component will be a&lt;br/&gt;national beta test in Fall 1999 for which we are currently recruiting&lt;br/&gt;participants. We believe that we now have something well worth teaching but&lt;br/&gt;we need to address shortcomings in how well we and others can teach it. We&lt;br/&gt;also propose to revise and extend our earlier E&amp;M textbook to match the new&lt;br/&gt;material, thus providing a coherent, modern one-year introductory physics&lt;br/&gt;textbook. We propose to engage in additional evaluation and dissemination&lt;br/&gt;activities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
