<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The international Advanced Robotics Project (IARP) is an international organization,&lt;br/&gt;consisting of fourteen countries and the European Union, devoted to monitoring and&lt;br/&gt;promoting robotics related technology and utilization. The United States helped to&lt;br/&gt;formulate this organization and has been an active member participating in technology&lt;br/&gt;evaluations, workshops, and joint study missions. Participation involves US technical&lt;br/&gt;experts traveling to various functions, and interacting with their colleagues to discuss&lt;br/&gt;ongoing research and developing technology relating to intelligent machines. This grant&lt;br/&gt;provides the mechanism to insure that the selection process and procedure for selecting&lt;br/&gt;participants is fair, efficient, organizationally viable.&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVES AND METHODS TO BE EMPLOYED&lt;br/&gt;Since the IARP meetings are generally technology specific, the selection of US&lt;br/&gt;participants must not only reflect the person's expertise but also his or hers ability to&lt;br/&gt;communicate and interact with other participants. The selection process will be&lt;br/&gt;performed by an ad hoc committee drawn from the IEEE, Robotics and Automation&lt;br/&gt;Society. The traveler will receive reimbursement for expense but an honorarium will&lt;br/&gt;only be provided in exceptional circumstances. This rule also applies to attendance at the&lt;br/&gt;IARP, Joint Coordinating Forum (JCF) which is the management, planning, and policy&lt;br/&gt;planning body. The representatives of member and observer countries attend this meeting&lt;br/&gt;in one of the host countries. A detailed description of the host country's robotics program&lt;br/&gt;is an essential part of the agenda.&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT OF THE PROPOSAL ACTIVITY&lt;br/&gt;Since NSF is the US representative to the IARP it is necessary to seek the best, and&lt;br/&gt;most appropriate researchers to contribute to the intellectual output of the meetings. This&lt;br/&gt;is a difficult and challenging task because the subjects under discussion at the Workshops&lt;br/&gt;and the JCF require participation by a variety of individuals who are knowledgeable of&lt;br/&gt;the specific technology. Their intellectual contribution is critical to the success of the&lt;br/&gt;event and the ability of the outcome to advance the technology. In the past, contributors&lt;br/&gt;have made excellent contributions, but a need now exists to help NSF to select new&lt;br/&gt;people in a fair minded and knowledgeable manner. The Robotics and Automation&lt;br/&gt;Society, representing 6000 members, is a logical choice to perform this selection by using&lt;br/&gt;senior, experienced, and knowledgeable decision makers.&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT RESULTING FROM PROPOSED ACTIVITY&lt;br/&gt;The technical areas that the IARP deals with include medical robotics, personal&lt;br/&gt;robotics, undersea robotic vehicles, and others having a direct societal impact. Recently&lt;br/&gt;new Working Groups have been formed to consider safety and security technology and&lt;br/&gt;other applications that are central to society needs. The quality of the United States&lt;br/&gt;participation is essential to enhancing these Working Groups so that their deliberations&lt;br/&gt;and results will help to promote the advanced concepts needed for success. The impact of&lt;br/&gt;this contribution cannot be underestimated.</AbstractNarration>
