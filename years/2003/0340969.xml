<AbstractNarration> The project develops curriculum material that bridges the gap between digital media (as a subfield of computer science) and digital art. The material is arranged around a Primer of material relevant to both computer science and art students; an advanced Computer Science (CS) Module emphasizing the mathematics and technology underlying digital media; and an advanced Art Module emphasizing aesthetics and design. The learning units topic areas are digital imaging, audio, and video and multimedia programming. The material is web-based and text-based and is divided in a fine-grained manner into recombined topics, interactive exercises, and demonstrations. The material emphasizes concepts over application programs and is designed to promote the students' informed use of digital media tools. The students' ability to synthesize what they have learned is incorporated in the assessment of pedagogical effectiveness. Content analysis, the development of a learning hierarchy, and the non-linear linking of concepts are also assessed. The material is used either for courses or faculty development at schools ranging from the elementary to university level. The material is tested in four sites: a university with large digital media courses, a largely-minority university, a community college, and a technology-magnet high school. Professional development workshops are for elementary, middle, and high school teachers. The material is further disseminated through commercial and academic publication.</AbstractNarration>
