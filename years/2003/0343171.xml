<AbstractNarration>This planning grant will fund department level reform the manufacturing program at the University of Cincinnati.  The approach is to place students in a virtual corporate setting, where classes are linked to job functions and the curriculum becomes a form of job rotation exposing students to traditional theory with links to practical applications. The central hypothesis and of the proposed activities is that a virtual manufacturing corporation can unify and energize the curricula motivating students and faculty to learn, provide a mechanism for addressing industry wants and needs, and can be marketed to K-12 students and teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this planning project, the goal is to restructure the entire manufacturing curriculum so&lt;br/&gt;that it can be mapped into a virtual corporate structure supported by an information technology&lt;br/&gt;based integration mechanism. A corporate oversight panel will be established, along with a&lt;br/&gt;framework for eliciting and integrating corporate and K-12 suggestions and feedback, taking&lt;br/&gt;advantage of the existing Co-Op program. Finally, evaluation and accountability guidelines will&lt;br/&gt;be developed along with activities to prepare other faculty members for strategy implementation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
