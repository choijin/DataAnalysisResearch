<AbstractNarration>Engineering-Engineering Technology (58)  This is a collaborative project between the University of Florida and Clemson University with award numbers of 0341203 and 0340984, respectively. The project is developing two of the most valuable skills that students need today to enter the IT-dominated workplace; the ability to extract data from external sources and to embed analytical decision models within larger systems. This project is producing educational materials that integrate information technology (IT) with industrial engineering and operations research (IE/OR) curricula. The materials guide guiding students through the process of learning how to develop intelligent information systems, or decision support systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten instructional modules are being prepared to provide instruction on developing decision support systems using databases and spreadsheets and to illustrate the use of decision support systems in the practice of IE/OR. The most innovative feature of the instructional material is the use of case studies and team projects that illustrate (1) how information systems arise in the practice of IE/OR, and (2) how IE/OR techniques can be used to build intelligent information systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quiz and examination materials are being prepared for each of the ten modules to provide direct evidence of student achievement of learning. An industry panel and faculty members from eight universities who teach IE/OR are participating in the assessment process.  The materials are being disseminated through conference presentations and faculty training workshops. The goal of these activities is to facilitate the development of several information-systems-development courses in the IE/OR departments at multiple universities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
