    <AbstractNarration>Kaper&lt;br/&gt;0306523&lt;br/&gt; This project concerns systems with multiple length and time&lt;br/&gt;scales, with the goals of analyzing recent experiments, of&lt;br/&gt;improving computational methods, and of establishing new&lt;br/&gt;mathematical theory for such systems. First, in the area of&lt;br/&gt;chemical patterns with multiple length scales, the&lt;br/&gt;recently-discovered phenomena of self-replicating spots and&lt;br/&gt;pulses has posed new challenges for modeling and for stability&lt;br/&gt;analysis of solutions of partial differential equations. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator and collaborators build on their analysis of the&lt;br/&gt;dynamics, time scales, and mechanisms responsible for&lt;br/&gt;self-replication to study the underlying bifurcation hierarchies&lt;br/&gt;that organize the self-replication regime, to further examine the&lt;br/&gt;zero-pole cancellation phenomenon in the nonlocal eigenvalue&lt;br/&gt;problem stability analysis, to extend the renormalization group&lt;br/&gt;technique to establish the fully-nonlinear stability of pulses,&lt;br/&gt;and to develop extensions to systems with more than two length&lt;br/&gt;scales. Second, in the increasingly-important area of reduction&lt;br/&gt;methods for large systems of chemical reactions with multiple&lt;br/&gt;time scales, the validity and accuracy of certain methods are&lt;br/&gt;analyzed, with special focus on the computational singular&lt;br/&gt;perturbation method of Lam and Goussis. Third, the investigator&lt;br/&gt;analyzes the Oya-Vallochi model of subsurface bioremediation.&lt;br/&gt;Bioremediation is a process in which microorganisms, in the&lt;br/&gt;presence of electron acceptors, degrade environmentally-harmful&lt;br/&gt;organic compounds. The investigator studies traveling waves of&lt;br/&gt;biomass activity and advection versus dispersion. Fourth, he&lt;br/&gt;conducts fundamental studies of nonspherical deformations of gas&lt;br/&gt;bubbles in Newtonian fluids. Finally, a challenging open problem&lt;br/&gt;concerning the existence of self-similar, blow-up solutions of&lt;br/&gt;the nonlinear Schroedinger equation in spatial dimensions between&lt;br/&gt;two and four is attempted.&lt;br/&gt; This project concerns mathematics for problems of&lt;br/&gt;significant current interest in biology, chemistry, engineering,&lt;br/&gt;and physics, which exhibit both fast and slow dynamical&lt;br/&gt;processes. First, with collaborators and a doctoral student, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator analyzes computational methods used to simulate&lt;br/&gt;large, complex systems of reactions in biochemistry, combustion,&lt;br/&gt;and air pollution engineering. These processes, such as the&lt;br/&gt;production of certain proteins, the burning of natural gas, and&lt;br/&gt;the formation of nitrous oxides in the atmosphere, typically&lt;br/&gt;involve a few hundred species, each of which participates in&lt;br/&gt;several reactions, with the reaction times ranging from&lt;br/&gt;nanoseconds to milliseconds, even to minutes. Methods that reduce&lt;br/&gt;the system complexity, while retaining a desired accuracy, are&lt;br/&gt;critical for modeling these processes. The investigator aims to&lt;br/&gt;show that there is a highly accurate method that can be used to&lt;br/&gt;improve the accuracy of other widely-used methods, which are&lt;br/&gt;embedded in major computer codes. Second, the investigator and a&lt;br/&gt;doctoral student study mathematical models of bioremediation, in&lt;br/&gt;which microorganisms are used to degrade environmentally-harmful&lt;br/&gt;organic compounds. Mathematics provides an advantageous approach&lt;br/&gt;to determine important quantities, such as the wave speed with&lt;br/&gt;which the biologically-active zone propagates through a wet soil&lt;br/&gt;column and how this speed depends on the many physical&lt;br/&gt;parameters. Third, fundamental research is conducted on the&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of gas bubbles in water. Deformations of spherical&lt;br/&gt;bubbles lead to oscillations on time scales much shorter than&lt;br/&gt;that on which the spherical mode itself oscillates, and the main&lt;br/&gt;goal is to model the nonlinear transfer of energy between the&lt;br/&gt;spherical and nonspherical modes that can lead to bubble&lt;br/&gt;cavitation and the attendant production of underwater sound by&lt;br/&gt;turbine blades, for example. Finally, the investigator develops&lt;br/&gt;further theory for self-replicating chemical patterns and for a&lt;br/&gt;prototypical equation that governs nonlinear wave propagation.</AbstractNarration>
