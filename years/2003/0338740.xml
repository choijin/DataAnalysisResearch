<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL NO:  0338740&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION:  University of Florida&lt;br/&gt;NSF PROGRAM:  ENHANCING HUMAN PERFORMANCE&lt;br/&gt;PI:    Figlio, David N&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Understanding the Interactions Between Starting Values and Early Interventions that Explain Children's Academic Performance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At entrance to public school, there exist very large average performance gaps across students of different races, ethnicities, and socio-economic groups. Moreover, the within-group variation in performance far exceeds the differences among normatively measured groups. This suggests that race, ethnicity, and poverty, and school-specific factors, explain only a small portion of the differences in subsequent academic performance. Policymakers have for decades designed health, education, and social welfare policies to help level the playing field for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates the determinants and evolution of performance gaps across and within groups during elementary and middle school, focusing on the roles of educational, medical, and social welfare policy interventions experienced during early childhood. Earlier studies of early childhood interventions have several data problems that may impede our understanding of the role of public policy in explaining early and mid-run educational outcomes. This research will overcome the major weaknesses in previous studies on the subject; it merges cohorts of birth vital statistics to elementary school records, and administrative records on early childhood intervention participation drawn from multiple sources.  A wide array of early intervention programs, ranging from follow-up programs serving neonatal intensive care graduates to Head Start and Even Start will be considered. The data sets are extremely large and very detailed, and the analysis data set will be constructed using every student in the state of Florida whose birth records can be matched with education data, including special education placement, attendance, behavioral referrals and scores on the state's mandated comprehensive assessment test. The use of large administrative data sets reduces measurement problems, and also facilitates the study of heterogeneous policy effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The large and rich data allows a study of a wide variety of interrelated problems, including: (i) whether school-based pre-kindergarten programs improve the performance of children from low-income families and (ii) the effects of social service program participation on children's performance.  The statistical techniques are straightforward and appropriate.  Some of the variables are endogenous but the data is rich enough for the PI to provide credible identification strategies to determine causal effects.  The results of this research will have important educational policy implications, not only in the US but probably throughout the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
