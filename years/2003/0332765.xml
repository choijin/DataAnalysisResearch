    <AbstractNarration>WAMC will produce 20-30 (bi-weekly) 2-minute radio modules on historical and contemporary women in STEM fields and careers (Women STEM Pioneers in History); and 6 (bi-monthly) 7-15 minute radio segments covering current gender diversity in STEM mentoring and professional development programs, with a priority on coverage of programs serving minority women. These segments will have a specific focus on program participants (Creating the Women STEM Pioneers of the Future). Both series will be produced for national radio broadcast and targeted dissemination to young women, parents, educators and institutions (with a priority on reaching minority populations) via the Internet, print media, and distribution of tapes and CDs. The first all new Women in STEM radio website will also be created with audio archives of the radio programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed project lies in the research, production and presentation of quality radio programs that: 1) depict the lives of successful women in STEM fields and careers; and 2) provide in-depth coverage of successful and replicable projects addressing gender gaps in STEM fields. Multiple venues will maximize access to the shows, for use in formal and informal educational settings for adults and students. The broader impacts of this work include reaching and educating the general public and target audiences nationwide, providing them with information and tools for promoting greater participation of women--including those from traditionally underrepresented populations--in STEM education and careers.</AbstractNarration>
