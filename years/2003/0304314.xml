<AbstractNarration>In this NIRT project, nanospintronic and nanomagnetic systems will be explored utilizing a unique, unprecedented combination of spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM), STM atom manipulation, and theoretical modeling.  The nanostructures will be prepared on novel nitride substrates (including GaN and Mn3N2 surfaces) prepared by molecular beam epitaxy and then introduced into the atom manipulation system. The nanostructures will be formed by selectively removing single atoms one by one from the nitride surface and then replacing them with magnetic atoms placed on, in, and above magnetic and nonmagnetic nitride surfaces using atom manipulation. The unique insertion/extraction procedures of magnetic atoms into/out of nitride surfaces will be investigated. From beginning to end, the substrates and nanostructures will be characterized using STM, obtaining direct real space pictures of the surface and the nanostructures, as well as obtaining the electronic properties via tunneling spectroscopy. Spin-polarized microscopy and spectroscopy will be simultaneously under investigation as a tool to directly probe the spin structure of the surfaces and nanostructures at every stage of the process.  The experimental results will provide important input for theories to explain the interaction of local moments with non-magnetic or magnetic Fermi seas of varying density.  The theoretical complement in this project will also involve the collaborative efforts of scientists from Germany and Brazil.  The work has the potential for making important impact in the understanding of the fundamental physics involving spins at the nanoscale.  Students and postdocs will receive exceptional training oportunities in nanoscience and will be positioned to become the top nanoscientists of tomorrow.  Another important part of this NIRT project is public outreach. The projects seeks to inform a broad audience about nanoscience and nanotechnology via professional media, an attractive and informative nanoscience website, and direct visits to regional K-12 schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanospintronic and nanomagnetic systems are a new class of nanoscale objects at the intersection of two important, emerging scientific fields: spintronics and nanoscience.  Spintronics seeks to employ the property of electron spin, which is the basis of magnetism, in conventional electronics which currently makes use only of the electron's charge. This could result in hybrid spin-electronic devices.  Nanoscience seeks to explore and understand objects having the dimension of only a few atoms. This NIRT project involves the atom-by-atom construction and simultaneous measurement of the properties of nanospintronic and nanomagnetic structures. The nanostructures themselves will be constructed on both magnetic as well as non-magnetic substrates using a needle-shaped probe which is able to position one atom at a time using atom manipulation.  Atoms from the surface will  be removed and replaced with magnetic atoms such as iron, chromium, or cobalt.  Such magnetic atoms will be positioned to form 10 or 20 atom nanomagnets or nanospintronic structures.  Such nanoscale magnets will be some of the smallest synthetic magnets ever made.  Such small spintronic structures are expected to be important for future devices.  This NIRT project will allow not only the formation of the magnetic nanostructures but also their direct imaging using the needle probe to take pictures of the surface. The probe tip is also able to measure the electronic and magnetic properties of these tiny nanostructures.  Theoretical work will complement these experiments to provide a complete understanding which will also be aided by the theoretical expertise of foreign scientific collaborators from Germany and Brazil.  Students and postdocs will receive exceptional training oportunities in nanoscience and will be positioned to become the top nanoscientists of tomorrow.  Another important part of this NIRT project is public outreach.
