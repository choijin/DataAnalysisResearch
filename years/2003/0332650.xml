<AbstractNarration>0332650&lt;br/&gt;Brown&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to University of North Carolina at Pembroke to support the activity described below for 24 months.  The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF-03521).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners&lt;br/&gt;The partners include University of North Carolina at Pembroke (Lead Institution), Central Carolina Community College, Fayetteville Tech Community College, Richmond Community College, Robeson Community College, Southeastern Community College, Carolina Commerce and Technology Center, Embrex Incorporated, Kelly Scientific Resources, New Brunswick Scientific Company, Wyeth Vaccines, Lumber River Council of Governments/Workforce Development Board, Robeson Office of Economic Development, and Scotland County Government. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports regional efforts to foster the establishment and growth of a biotechnology cluster in southeastern North Carolina. It has a broad goal to stimulate economic growth and increase the economic well being of the region. The University of North Carolina Pembroke Regional Center for Economic, Community and Professional Development will coordinate the establishment of a University of North Carolina Pembroke Biotechnology Business and Industrial Training Center. The center will house a bench-to-pilot-scale fermentation and biotechnology facility and will provide the resources, curriculum, and programs for biotechnology-related training, as well as academic activities. The goals for the activity are to increase the number of regional higher paying jobs by accelerating the growth of biotechnology companies, increase the trained workforce in the biotechnology sector, mobilize the underrepresented populations in the region by providing training, and offer entrepreneurs technological and business support, including connections to sources of capital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Economic Impact&lt;br/&gt;Southeastern North Carolina is economically distressed. The effort will provide education and training for underrepresented groups to make them employable by an emerging biotechnology cluster sector. The availability of a workforce will help attract other biotechnology companies creating more jobs. The effort is part of North Carolina's Biotechnology Initiative. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the activity lies in its focus on providing state-of-the-art knowledge and skills in biotechnology to academic and industrial participants. It will serve as a model for academic-led economic development that can be transferred to other economically distressed rural regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the activity include improving technical workforce skills and training K-16 teachers in biotechnology, increasing participation of underrepresented group in the innovation enterprise, and increasing the economic well being of a distressed region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
