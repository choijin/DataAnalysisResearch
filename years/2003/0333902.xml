<AbstractNarration>This proposed research program will address the challenges posed by the continuing &lt;br/&gt;growth of the Internet and shared-spectrum networks in a finite-spectrum world.  Current &lt;br/&gt;spectrum allocations are generally either "static," or allow user transmissions insensitive &lt;br/&gt;to nearby users and overall network efficiency.  To maximize wireless network &lt;br/&gt;performance it will be  necessary to understand and develop  efficient "self-organizing &lt;br/&gt;methods of spectrum allocation" in which transceivers cooperate using new wireless &lt;br/&gt;prototcols  to  locally  maximize  total  wireless  channel  capacity  (bits  s-1 Hz-1  m-2) and &lt;br/&gt;network utility (reliability, latency, equity, and economic factors). &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;  The performance limits of alternative architectures for spectrum self-organization will &lt;br/&gt;be explored, including networking schemes: 1) without "side-channel" control &lt;br/&gt;information, 2) with side-channel information from active transmitters only, and 3) side-&lt;br/&gt;channel information from passive ports too, permitting power and antenna control by &lt;br/&gt;local transmitters that boosts network performance.  Any side-channel information would &lt;br/&gt;supplement that which is always available by monitoring transmitter emissions. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Methods to be Employed &lt;br/&gt;  Urban  user  and  multipath  propagation  models  will  be  formulated  using  existing &lt;br/&gt;and/or new wireless data recorded using equipment to be developed.    Based on these &lt;br/&gt;models,  wireless  multi-user  network  configurations  will  be  statistically  analyzed  using &lt;br/&gt;quantitative metrics that facilitate understanding and development of  alternative self-&lt;br/&gt;organizing approaches to spectrum allocation.  New methods for multivariate blind signal &lt;br/&gt;separation  will  be  developed  for  multi-antenna  systems  that  employ  self-organizing &lt;br/&gt;spectrum-allocation  strategies.    Strategies  and  protocols  for  self-organizing  wireless &lt;br/&gt;networks  will  be  formulated  and  tested  using  these models  and metrics,  and  the  results &lt;br/&gt;will be integrated to inform policy makers and technologists of limits and new options. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity &lt;br/&gt;  The intellectual merit lies in the development and evaluation of: 1) new strategies for &lt;br/&gt;efficient cooperative use of wireless spectrum in crowded urban environments, 2) &lt;br/&gt;effective new methods for blind multivariate signal separation, 3) stochastic models for &lt;br/&gt;multi-user  wireless  multipath  environments,  and  4)  integrated  models  for  the  nominal &lt;br/&gt;limits to wireless performance and economics. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;  Successful completion  of these program  elements should provide  a useful &lt;br/&gt;foundation for: 1) formulating telecommunications regulations that promote increased &lt;br/&gt;spectral efficiency and wireless utilization for internet and other services, 2) development &lt;br/&gt;of devices  and systems by the private sector that increase spectrum capacity and &lt;br/&gt;utilization, and 3) further research utilizing: the models to be developed for the wireless &lt;br/&gt;environment,  the  multi-antenna  multi-channel  wireless  sensor,  the  databases &lt;br/&gt;characterizing the observations and models, improved algorithms for blind separation of &lt;br/&gt;multivariate signals, and new algorithms for self-organizing spectrum allocation.</AbstractNarration>
