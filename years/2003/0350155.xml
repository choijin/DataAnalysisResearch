<AbstractNarration>This project evaluates the impact of a unique program aimed at promoting peaceful co-existence between national and ethnic groups currently involved in intense and protracted conflict. One aim of the research is to develop a developmental model of how changes in perceptions of the self, ingroup, and outgroups relate to improving intergroup relations over time. Participants include adult leaders and adolescent males and females (ages 13-16) from several regions of tension including the Middle East and Cyprus. Participants spend three weeks at the Seeds of Peace International Camp, in a summer camp in Maine. The camp program includes activities designed to enhance cooperative equal status contact between group members, promote the exchange of information, and teach skills of communication and co-existence. Since its inception in 1993, over 1400 individuals have "graduated" from the camp. Although the program has received significant national and international attention, there has been no study of its impact. Changes in the cognition and behaviors of camp participants will be compared with a Control Group composed of individuals who do not attend the camp. Data will be collected on a variety of dimensions that have both applied and theoretical importance. These data include self-esteem, self-identity, stereotypes of ingroup and outgroups, perceptions of group homogeneity and threat, and behaviors between members of the different groups. The results of the study will address three issues: 1) The degree to which the camp experience has a positive effect on the relationship between the different groups at the camp;  2) Whether changes in the perceptions and behaviors that occur at camp generalize to the larger groups represented by the campers; and 3) The extent to which these changes endure over an extended time period (20-24 months). The project represents a special opportunity to test and extend theories of intergroup relations. The measures employed to evaluate the program are based on existing social psychological theories and research. The results will indicate the longevity of the effects of intergroup contact on intergroup attraction. Hypotheses relating to how intensity of conflict affects the influence of intergroup contact will also be examined. The design allows a comparison of the effects of contact on perceptions of the self, the ingroup, and outgroups. Several components of stereotypes (competence, warmth, salience, and homogeneity) will be measured and related to improving intergroup relations. Underlying processes such as recategorization and cross-categorization will be inferred from responses. The research is significant because it employs theoretically-based measures to examine a program that is designed to address a critical social problem. The research program also represents a cooperative effort between an academic institution and private nonprofit organization.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
