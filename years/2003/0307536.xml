<AbstractNarration>Title: Geometric Tools for Algorithms&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a set of general algorithmic tools&lt;br/&gt;based on geometry and randomness. Four specific approaches will be&lt;br/&gt;investigated -- geometric random walks, convex relaxations, random&lt;br/&gt;projection and spectral projection. There are basic problems that can be&lt;br/&gt;solved by each technique (i.e., yielding efficient algorithms). These&lt;br/&gt;include convex optimization, approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems&lt;br/&gt;and learning mixtures of distributions. The solutions to these problems&lt;br/&gt;lead to several questions about the applicability and efficiency of these&lt;br/&gt;techniques (e.g. What functions can be sampled efficiently by the random&lt;br/&gt;walk approach? How quickly can the volume be computed? Is there a&lt;br/&gt;relaxation refinement method that improves the integrality gap? What are&lt;br/&gt;the limits of the spectral method?). The PI plans to address these&lt;br/&gt;questions and use the answers to tackle basic open problems in algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;Geometric insights and approaches play an increasingly central role in the&lt;br/&gt;discovery of polynomial-time algorithms for fundamental problems. At a&lt;br/&gt;time when the field of algorithms is growing rapidly, such tools will be&lt;br/&gt;crucial in crystallizing a theory of algorithms that will deepen our&lt;br/&gt;understanding as well as advance the field by aiding in the solution of&lt;br/&gt;key open problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad impact:&lt;br/&gt;The problems this proposal sets out to explore are of a basic nature, and&lt;br/&gt;originate from a variety of areas, including combinatorial optimization,&lt;br/&gt;machine learning, information retrieval, and Euclidean geometry. Progress&lt;br/&gt;on these problems, in addition to its potential practical impact, is sure&lt;br/&gt;to unravel combinatorial/geometric structure, and is likely to yield new&lt;br/&gt;analysis tools. The research results will form the basis of an&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate course on combinatorial optimization as well as two graduate&lt;br/&gt;courses; course notes for all of these will be available online.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
