<AbstractNarration>HRD 03-26177&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Chellu Chetty, a professor of biology, has a strong record of service in working with students at the undergraduate and graduate level, particularly the "high ability minority" students (generally African-American). He has developed strategies that involve and challenge students in their academic and career development pursuits. He has been an active mentor for a number of years and has invested much time and energy to working with underrepresented communities. Among his many approaches to mentoring and advising students is his direct involvement of undergraduate students in co-authoring more than 15 professional papers. He has worked with HBCU's and has been very effective in obtaining grants from both government and non-government funding sources. Dr. Chetty plans to utilize the PAESMEM grant, if awarded, to support the establishment of a mentoring and advising office for the College of Sciences and Technology.</AbstractNarration>
