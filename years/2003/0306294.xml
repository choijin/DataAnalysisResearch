<AbstractNarration>Abstract for NSF Proposal DMS-0306294, "Singularity Behavior in&lt;br/&gt;Some Geometric Variational Problems", Robert Hardt, P.I.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project lies in the area of geometric variational calculus,&lt;br/&gt;treating the behavior of singularities and energy concentration&lt;br/&gt;for various optimal or stationary functions, fields, or geometric&lt;br/&gt;structures subject to geometric or analytical constraints.&lt;br/&gt;Specified investigations focus on the relation between energy and&lt;br/&gt;topological obstruction in mappings between manifolds, liquid&lt;br/&gt;crystal materials, improper slicing of polynomial varieties,&lt;br/&gt;transport problems, and the regularity of relaxed energy&lt;br/&gt;minimizers.  In various higher dimensional cases, energy&lt;br/&gt;concentration of limits of smooth mappings may occur along sets&lt;br/&gt;of infinite measure and is related to homotopically nontrivial&lt;br/&gt;mappings of spaces. This concentration behavior corresponding to&lt;br/&gt;any rational homotopy invariant of the target mapping can now be&lt;br/&gt;described.  Singularities in liquid crystal materials will be also&lt;br/&gt;studied in several contexts.  The theories of improper&lt;br/&gt;intersections of polynomial zero sets from algebraic geometry&lt;br/&gt;will be investigated to understand related behavior in analysis&lt;br/&gt;and partial differential equations.  Combined  transport systems&lt;br/&gt;such as occurs in postal routes, the circulatory system, and&lt;br/&gt;plant root systems can be described variationally with recently&lt;br/&gt;discovered geometric structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Underlying many physical phenomena is a least energy principle&lt;br/&gt;whereby certain configurations or fields or geometric shape are&lt;br/&gt;distinguished by their property of having less energy or area than&lt;br/&gt;competing objects.  The external constraints often lead to&lt;br/&gt;singularities, which are characterized by rapid changes of&lt;br/&gt;structure occurring in very small spatial regions.  For example,&lt;br/&gt;one observes dislocation faults in solids under stress, domain&lt;br/&gt;walls in magnetized materials, liquid edges and corners in soap&lt;br/&gt;films, and point, curve, and surface defects in various liquid&lt;br/&gt;crystal materials.  We deal with new mathematical structures and&lt;br/&gt;theories necessary to explain and predict such phenomena.  In&lt;br/&gt;these problems, the theoretical studies of pure mathematics, the&lt;br/&gt;numerical computational studies of applied mathematics, and the&lt;br/&gt;phenomenological studies from observation and experiment all&lt;br/&gt;benefit each other and all have a crucial scientific role. The&lt;br/&gt;present proposed research has many problems motivated by and&lt;br/&gt;applicable to science and engineering. The new geometric&lt;br/&gt;variational tools are not presently well-known in the broader&lt;br/&gt;scientific community, and communication of these mathematical&lt;br/&gt;topics and techniques will be very useful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
