<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science (DMNS) under the direction of Dr. Paula E. Cushing, Curator of Invertebrate Zoology, to curate, identify, and database backlogged arachnid specimens (spiders, scorpions, etc.) and to stabilize and re-curate recently acquired arachnid specimens from the Colorado State University (CSU) collection.  The arachnid collection at the DMNS was established in 1998 and has grown from fewer than 50 vials to nearly 21,000 vials (100 - 300,000 specimens) representing 947 species, making the collection the largest of its kind in the Rocky Mountain / Great Plains region.   Support from NSF will provide personnel support to assist in curation and identification to species of backlogged specimens.  The funding also will enable the immediate re-curation and stabilization of the CSU specimens transferred to DMNS.  &lt;br/&gt;The DMNS is now the primary repository for arachnids in the Rocky Mountains / Great Plains region.  The data from the identified backlogged material will be made readily accessible to a broad range of users including students, teachers, researchers, land managers and the general public through the currently existing web page and online database.  The project will have a major impact on the Museum's ability to serve the research and educational needs of a broad and diverse audience and will strengthen the arachnology program at the DMNS.    &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
