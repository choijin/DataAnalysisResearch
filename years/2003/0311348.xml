<AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hybrid systems  consist of  discrete time systems  interacting with&lt;br/&gt;continuous time systems. Most frequently they arise when a discrete&lt;br/&gt;computational device functions in a continuous physical environment.&lt;br/&gt;Such systems have become very common, thanks to the proliferation of&lt;br/&gt;software in  controlling physical systems. Modeling and analysis of&lt;br/&gt;hybrid systems is, therefore, paramount for efficient development of&lt;br/&gt;high quality safe devices.  Formal models of hybrid systems have been developed by combining discrete&lt;br/&gt;state transition formalisms with continuous dynamical systems. Developing&lt;br/&gt;analysis technology for such expressive formalisms is a challenging task.&lt;br/&gt;In  recent  years,  several  analysis  tools  have  been  developed  for&lt;br/&gt;specialized classes of hybrid models that either restrict the continuous&lt;br/&gt;behavior or the discrete behavior severely. The continuous component of a&lt;br/&gt;hybrid  system,  in  particular,  presents a  great  challenge  to  the&lt;br/&gt;development of sound analysis techniques.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop sound and effective techniques and tools for&lt;br/&gt;analysis of large hybrid system models.  The approach centers around the&lt;br/&gt;construction of  approximate  abstractions  for hybrid  systems  using&lt;br/&gt;intelligent abstraction mappings that yield effective  computability  and&lt;br/&gt;scalability.  The project builds on the hybrid abstraction technique that combines&lt;br/&gt;predicate abstraction for discrete systems with qualitative abstraction of&lt;br/&gt;continuous  dynamical  systems.  It focuses on (i) improving techniques to generate&lt;br/&gt;the most appropriate abstraction mappings by structurally analyzing the&lt;br/&gt;continuous dynamics; (ii) the exploitation of the modular structure of the&lt;br/&gt;discrete and continuous components, and the compositional structure of the&lt;br/&gt;hybrid system; and (iii) developing the necessary symbolic methods for&lt;br/&gt;effective automation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tools and techniques developed under this project will have broader impacts by making analysis&lt;br/&gt;amenable to intermediate and large hybrid system models in application areas such as embedded system&lt;br/&gt;design for automotive and other applications and bioinformatics.  It also&lt;br/&gt;helps students develop intuitions about complex system behaviors without&lt;br/&gt;analytically solving them. The results are disseminated through research&lt;br/&gt;publications and the tools are made available for academic use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
