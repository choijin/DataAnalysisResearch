    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research seeks to answer fundamental questions about the structure of the nucleon and of the nuclear few-body systems. Experiments are carried out at electron accelerators of intermediate energies. Developments in the last two decades in terms of producing polarized, continuous electron beams and the advent of polarized internal gas targets have introduced a new technique of measurements that fully exploit the spin degrees of freedom. This new technique opens the window to perform definite measurements of fundamental quantities like the charge distribution of the neutron. Precise knowledge of the structure of the neutron at intermediate energies is essential to constrain models of nucleon structure based on the fundamental theory of the strong interaction, quantum chromodynamics. It is also a key ingredient in understanding the nuclear physics of the few-body systems as well as the results derived from other fundamental electron scattering experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities will produce new scientists at the Ph.D. level, will train young scientists at the postdoctoral level, will give research experience in fundamental physics to undergraduate students, and will contribute to the ascent of a large state university as a premier research institution. The advancement of the careers of women and ethnic minorities is an integral part of this process. Furthermore, the demand for state-of-the-art equipment utilizes the University's technical workforce and that of the society at large.</AbstractNarration>
