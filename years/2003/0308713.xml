    <AbstractNarration>Traub and Wozniakowski&lt;br/&gt; The goal of information-based complexity is to create a&lt;br/&gt;theory of computational complexity and optimal algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;problems with partial, contaminated, and priced information, and&lt;br/&gt;to apply the results to solving specific problems in varied&lt;br/&gt;disciplines. For brevity, information-based complexity will be&lt;br/&gt;called IBC. The theory is developed over abstract spaces,&lt;br/&gt;typically Hilbert and Banach spaces, while the applications are&lt;br/&gt;to multivariate problems. Because the information is partial and&lt;br/&gt;contaminated, only approximate solutions can be obtained. IBC&lt;br/&gt;studies computational complexity and optimal algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;computing e-approximations in various settings. Because the&lt;br/&gt;worst case setting often leads to negative results such as&lt;br/&gt;unsolvability and intractability, settings with a weaker&lt;br/&gt;assurance such as average, probabilistic, and randomized settings&lt;br/&gt;are also studied. A fairly new area of IBC research is quantum&lt;br/&gt;computing. The best known algorithms discovered to date, Shor and&lt;br/&gt;Grover, are for discrete problems. But many problems occurring&lt;br/&gt;in science and engineering are continuous. Examples include&lt;br/&gt;high-dimensional and path integration, high-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;approximation, and partial differential equations. To understand&lt;br/&gt;the power of quantum computation for continuous problems one must&lt;br/&gt;know the computational complexity of these problems on a&lt;br/&gt;classical computer in various settings. This is exactly what has&lt;br/&gt;been studied in IBC. Questions to be answered include: For what&lt;br/&gt;problems is quantum computation (exponentially, polynomially)&lt;br/&gt;faster than classical computation? For what problems is there&lt;br/&gt;provably no speed-up of quantum over classical computation?&lt;br/&gt; For some 40 years, computing has been driven by Moore's law,&lt;br/&gt;which is the empirical observation that computing power doubles&lt;br/&gt;about every 18 months. This has made it possible for people to&lt;br/&gt;have computers in their homes as powerful as computers owned by&lt;br/&gt;corporations just 20 years ago. It has made the internet&lt;br/&gt;possible. Finally, powerful computers are indispensable to our&lt;br/&gt;national security. Computer chips and wires are getting so small&lt;br/&gt;that there is a consensus among technologists that Moore's law&lt;br/&gt;will end in 10 to 15 years using current silicon technology.&lt;br/&gt;Because it is critical for our country to maintain the Moore's&lt;br/&gt;law trajectory, new ways to compute are being considered. One of&lt;br/&gt;the most promising ideas is to use the principles of quantum&lt;br/&gt;mechanics to do quantum computing. The investigators and their&lt;br/&gt;colleagues are studying the following question: If physicists&lt;br/&gt;and chemists succeed in building quantum computers, for which&lt;br/&gt;problems are there big payoffs? That is, what are the killer&lt;br/&gt;applications?</AbstractNarration>
