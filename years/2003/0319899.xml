<AbstractNarration>The current and future generations of wireless systems require compact, broadband/high-speed Monolithic&lt;br/&gt;Microwave Integrated Circuits and Antennas. Higher speed circuits need large bandwidth that can be realized at&lt;br/&gt;higher frequencies. There are FCC bands for wireless applications up to and beyond 67 GHz. In order to facilitate&lt;br/&gt;research in these bands the following instruments need to be acquired: a) Network Analyzer (67GHz), b) Spectrum&lt;br/&gt;Analyzer (50GHz), c) Signal Generator (40GHz), d) Wafer Probe Station (67GHz), e) Printed Circuit Scriber, and f)&lt;br/&gt;Printed Circuit Through-Hole Plating System. These are the highest performance equipment currently available.&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the proposed activity are:&lt;br/&gt;1) To enhance the capabilities of the Microwave Engineering laboratory facilities for continued research and design&lt;br/&gt;at high frequencies in the areas of Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMICs), Hybrid-MICs and, printed&lt;br/&gt;Antennas, 2) To expand the scope of collaborative efforts with industry in the design of novel MMICs for current&lt;br/&gt;and future generation communication systems, 3) To increase the extent of training in advanced research, design,&lt;br/&gt;tests and measurements imparted to students, and 4) To strengthen the Universitys position to seek research funding&lt;br/&gt;from industry and government agencies.&lt;br/&gt;Industry-sponsored collaborative research and design activities in the areas of MMICs have been going on at&lt;br/&gt;Bradley University for the past 12 years with Northrop-Grumman Corp. and Fujitsu Compound Semiconductor, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;These projects have involved MMIC designs in which students have been trained in advanced research and design.&lt;br/&gt;The outcome was the development of novel circuits for applications in current and future generation communication&lt;br/&gt;and radar systems. The MMICs were designed at Bradley University, but fabrication, tests and measurements were&lt;br/&gt;conducted at the laboratories of the industry. The MMICs could not be measured at Bradley University because of&lt;br/&gt;the frequency limitation (40 GHz) of the existing Network Analyzer and lack of Wafer Probe Station. This deprived&lt;br/&gt;the students of valuable research experience. Also, active device modeling projects from industry had to be turned&lt;br/&gt;down due to lack of Wafer Probe Station. Therefore, acquisitions of a 67GHz Network Analyzer and a Microwave&lt;br/&gt;Wafer Probe Station will alleviate this deficiency. It will allow the students to do tests and measurements and&lt;br/&gt;expand opportunities to seek more industry-supported research projects. The fabrications of MMICs however will&lt;br/&gt;continue to be done at industry. The Principal Investigator has been exploring potential collaboration with TriQuint&lt;br/&gt;Semiconductor. He will also explore collaborations with the following companies: Hughes, US Monolithics, iTerra&lt;br/&gt;Communications, TRW, TLC Precision Wafer Technology, Motorola, Conexant, and M/A-COM where he has&lt;br/&gt;established connections or his former students are working.&lt;br/&gt;Other research projects included development of novel, Hybrid-MICs, sub-systems, and printed antennas for&lt;br/&gt;wireless Communication systems. In these projects, the existing microwave Anechoic Chamber/Antenna Data&lt;br/&gt;acquisition system, Microwave Source (18 GHz), Spectrum Analyzer (22 GHz) and Network Analyzer (40 GHz)&lt;br/&gt;have been used. The circuits and antennas have been fabricated using the existing printed circuit fabrication&lt;br/&gt;(chemical etching) facility. Again, the extent of research and design activities has been limited due to frequency&lt;br/&gt;limitation of the current Signal Source and Spectrum Analyzer, and lack of precision printed circuit fabrication&lt;br/&gt;facility. For example, a 24 GHz printed array antenna for Automobile Collision Avoidance System project could not&lt;br/&gt;be undertaken. Therefore acquisition of the instrumentation requested above will overcome this limitation, enabling&lt;br/&gt;research and design work at higher frequencies, and enhance the research training of students.&lt;br/&gt;There is a critical shortage of microwave engineers in this country. Bradley University is one of the few select&lt;br/&gt;institutions that offers advanced education and training in this area of specialization. Graduate and senior&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students are educated and trained through capstone thesis and design projects as well as courses. The&lt;br/&gt;projects are intensive and involve planning, design, fabrications, tests and measurements, documentation and&lt;br/&gt;presentation. The projects have resulted in numerous refereed publications. Industry has been a partner in&lt;br/&gt;microwave education and training by supporting projects and, providing assistantships and internships.&lt;br/&gt;The acquisitions of the requested equipment will have the following impact: a) Enhance the capability to provide&lt;br/&gt;advanced research and design experience in RF and Microwave Engineering, including tests and measurements, b)&lt;br/&gt;Expand the scope of projects and partnerships with industry, c) Strengthen the University's position to seek research&lt;br/&gt;funding from industry and government agencies, d) Help attract and train students in the critical area of RF and&lt;br/&gt;Microwave Engineering, and e) Enrich the Microwave Engineering curriculum and education at Bradley University.</AbstractNarration>
