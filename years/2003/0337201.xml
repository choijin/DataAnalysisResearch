<AbstractNarration>0337201&lt;br/&gt;Benoit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scarce metals can have a disproportionate influence on biogeochemical cycles by limiting growth or function of key planktonic species or assemblages.  It is already known that Fe limits primary productivity in high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll regions of the world's oceans, with potentially important consequences for global carbon cycling.  Largely unexplored is the question of limitation in fresh water environments by micronutrient metals.  This proposal is for preliminary research to investigate the influence of dissolved Cu speciation (and consequent reactivity and bioavailability) on denitrification by bacteria in stratified lakes.  We propose to study this specific example as a starting point to explore the much broader general question of the influence of trace metals on major aquatic biogeochemical cycles.  This system is targeted because of: (1) the well-studied speciation of Cu and its low bioavailability in some fresh waters, (2) the essential nature of Cu for bacterial enzymes that effect denitrification, (3) the utility of stratified lakes as natural, large-scale batch reactor experiments, and (4) existing circumstantial evidence that Cu can limit denitrification in lab cultures, and that denitrification intermediaries (esp. N2O) build-up in many stratified lakes.  While such systems represent a logical starting point, the results of this research could have much broader implications on the topic of micronutrient limitation in fresh waters, including lakes, rivers, and ground waters.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt; The proposed research will have broader impacts in three separate ways.  (1) Promoting Teaching, Training and Learning: Lakes are especially well-suited as examples for teaching principles of geosciences, because they are familiar systems in which chemical and physical processes are clearly and simply expressed.  Yale's Environment School is home to about 220 masters students who are often going on to careers in environmental policy and management, rather than science, but are eager to obtain an understanding of the fundamental principles of environmental science.  The proposed research provides an ideal opportunity for teaching and training this group.  Results will be incorporated into the curriculum of three courses: Biogeochemistry and Pollution, Methods of Field Environmental Analysis, and Aquatic Ecology.  In addition, two master's students receiving Research Assistantships from the School will be directly involved in the research.  (2) Broadening Participation of Underrepresented Groups: The two most likely candidates for the PhD student supported by this project are both women.  Either would play a major role in the research if selected.  (3) Benefits to Society: This research addresses the possible linkage of two environmental chemical issues of considerable importance to public welfare: trace metals and the nitrogen cycle.  Metals have generally been of interest because of possible harmful effects in lakes and streams.  Here we consider whether they may also function as limiting micronutrients.  The nitrogen cycle involves a number of issues of societal concern, including eutrophication (from excess NO3-), N2O as a greenhouse gas, acid deposition (HNO3), and perturbations caused by human intervention (50% of global N fixation is estimated to be industrial).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
