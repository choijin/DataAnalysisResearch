<AbstractNarration>Abstract. VARIATIONAL AND TOPOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO   THE THREE-BODY&lt;br/&gt;PROBLEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposer will investigate several aspects&lt;br/&gt;of the Newtonian three-body problems using&lt;br/&gt;techniques from geometric analysis and&lt;br/&gt; classical ODEs. &lt;br/&gt;The main new direction proposed is &lt;br/&gt;to understand scattering in the&lt;br/&gt;Newtonian three-body problem using the technique of ``gluing'' borrowed&lt;br/&gt;from geometric PDE.  An unbounded solution with negative energy&lt;br/&gt; consist of two ``bound masses'' orbiting each other&lt;br/&gt;in a nearly Keplerian orbit while the third mass&lt;br/&gt;sails away, asymptoting to  a Keplerian&lt;br/&gt;hypebolic orbit. Each of the  two Jacobi vectors &lt;br/&gt; asymptotes to a solution   to  a   Kepler&lt;br/&gt;two-body problems -- an elliptic one for the   bound pair,&lt;br/&gt;and a hyperbolic one for the vector joining the  &lt;br/&gt; receding mass to the center of mass of the bound pair.&lt;br/&gt;If the solution is unbounded in  both the past and future,&lt;br/&gt;there can, and typically will,  be different Keplerian orbits in the past&lt;br/&gt;and&lt;br/&gt;the future -- indeed the pair which is bound in the distant past&lt;br/&gt;might be different from the pair bound in the future. &lt;br/&gt;Which Kepler parameters can be connected to which by &lt;br/&gt;an unbounded three-body orbit? This scattering problem is one of &lt;br/&gt;the central questions we will investigate.  &lt;br/&gt; Other problems to be investigated&lt;br/&gt;follow past lines of investigation initiated by the proposer.&lt;br/&gt;We give two examples. Planar three body solutions can be partially encoded&lt;br/&gt;by&lt;br/&gt;their syzygy sequence. Is every syzygy sequence possible?&lt;br/&gt;Initial computer investigations suggest not.   &lt;br/&gt;Is it true that every zero-angular momentum negative energy&lt;br/&gt;solution which tends to the Lagrange homothety orbit&lt;br/&gt;either is the Lagrange homothety orbit, or suffers a syzygy? &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Newtonian &lt;br/&gt;three-body problem concerns the dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;three bodies,    &lt;br/&gt;modelled as  point masses, attracting each other by Newton's&lt;br/&gt;$1/r^2$ gravitational force.  Think of the bodies&lt;br/&gt;as the earth, moon, and sun, or as three stars.  &lt;br/&gt;The ``problem'' is not a single problem,&lt;br/&gt;but rather  a large  collection&lt;br/&gt;of problems concering the         &lt;br/&gt;long-term qualitative behavior of such a system of masses.  &lt;br/&gt;A solution is called ``bounded'' if the three interbody distances&lt;br/&gt;remain finite and bounded by some fixed distance for all time.  &lt;br/&gt;  A central open question is: how&lt;br/&gt;big is the set of bounded solutions? &lt;br/&gt;Is it true that arbitrarily close to a bound solution there is an&lt;br/&gt;unbounded one? &lt;br/&gt;The traditional approach to this question has involved ``Arnol'd&lt;br/&gt;diffusion''&lt;br/&gt;-- a mechanism discovered by V.I. Arnol'd through which seemingly stable&lt;br/&gt;regions and orbits become unstable and perhaps eventually unbounded.&lt;br/&gt;The  Arnol'd diffusion method or mechanism is in essence perturbative: one&lt;br/&gt;tries to perturb away from an apparently stable situation.&lt;br/&gt;As an alternative, we propose to start at infinity and sweep in from&lt;br/&gt;infinity to see what parts of phase space are swept out.  &lt;br/&gt;``Starting at infinity'' means thinking of the scattering problem --&lt;br/&gt;the situation of one body infinitely distant from the other two.&lt;br/&gt;The most interesting case is that in which  two of the masses remain &lt;br/&gt;bounded, orbiting each other in a nearly Keplerian orbit as the third mass&lt;br/&gt;recedes.&lt;br/&gt;Imagine beginning in such a manner in the infinite past, and ending up in&lt;br/&gt;such a manner in the infinite future, &lt;br/&gt;but with the past and future bound pairs perhaps different,&lt;br/&gt;or their  Keplerian ellipse having   different eccentricities,&lt;br/&gt; energies, etc.  In this way we get a kind of ``scattering map'' from&lt;br/&gt;Kepler orbits&lt;br/&gt;(or parameters) to Kepler orbits. &lt;br/&gt;What does this scattering map look like?  This ``scattering problem''&lt;br/&gt;is one of the main new directions we propose to investigate.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, we propose several questions more  in line with&lt;br/&gt;our past investigations.  Here is one example.  A ``syzygy'' is an instant&lt;br/&gt;at which all three masses lie on a  line.   &lt;br/&gt;At such an instant one   mass  ``eclipses'' (lies between) the other two.&lt;br/&gt;Label the syzygies   by the mass doing the eclipsing.&lt;br/&gt;List the labelled  syzygies in order of appearance, thus  associating to&lt;br/&gt;each solution&lt;br/&gt;a syzygy sequence.  &lt;br/&gt;In the planar three-body problem, are all syzygy  sequences possible?&lt;br/&gt;This is an open problem.  The proposer has made partial progress.  Initial&lt;br/&gt;computer investigations with&lt;br/&gt;the help of an undergraduate researcher  suggest that the answer might be&lt;br/&gt;``no''.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
