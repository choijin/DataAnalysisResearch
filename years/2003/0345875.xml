    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to the University of Colorado Museum under the direction of Dr. Dena M. Smith to improve the Invertebrate Paleontology Collections and incorporate all specimen data into a secure computer database. The Invertebrate Paleontology Collections at the University of Colorado Museum currently contain 277,520 catalogued invertebrates and 11,500 plants. There are an additional 4,800 specimens that have yet to be catalogued. Although the Invertebrate Paleontology Collections have been heavily utilized in the past and contain one of the best invertebrate paleontology collections for the Rocky Mountain Region, including a sizeable and historically important fossil insect and spider collection, the Invertebrate Paleontology Collections have had little curatorial supervision for nearly 100 years. The planned improvements will improve the collections, ensure that specimens are available for study and provide the staff necessary to maintain and promote the collection.&lt;br/&gt;The primary goals of the project are to: 1) bring the Invertebrate Paleontology collections up to the highest curatorial standards by stabilizing and reorganizing all invertebrate specimens; 2) to prepare and identify invertebrate and plant material that has not yet been attended to; and 3) to incorporate all specimen data into a new, secure computer database. &lt;br/&gt;The improvements to the Invertebrate Paleontology Collections will have a major impact on the University of Colorado Museum's ability to serve the research and educational needs of both academic and public communities. Not only will specimens be properly stored, but they will also be better-organized and more accessible for research, teaching and exhibits. Creating a relational database for the collections will make it easier to manage specimens, process loans, and extract data for curatorial and research purposes. Placing the collection database online will allow a wide audience to view collection materials and gather valuable information. The online database will be especially important for producing national and international research collaborations and will also serve as a valuable tool for teachers and the public. Finally, the project will have a major impact on the University of Colorado Museum's ability to train future students and museum personnel.</AbstractNarration>
