<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This proposal describes a new more comprehensive approach to the&lt;br/&gt;design of feedback controls for a wide variety of systems. The basic &lt;br/&gt;idea is to replace the usual&lt;br/&gt;differential equation description of the system being controlled by a &lt;br/&gt;corresponding&lt;br/&gt;Louiville equation and to formulate an optimization problem that takes &lt;br/&gt;into account a range of initial&lt;br/&gt;conditions and the way in which the control depends on time and state. &lt;br/&gt;The mathematical problems that&lt;br/&gt;arise do not seem to have been explored up until now and so an important &lt;br/&gt;intellectual challenge to&lt;br/&gt;be overcome in this research will be to develop methods for solving the &lt;br/&gt;type of variational problems&lt;br/&gt;involving partial differential equations that arise in these problems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential for this work to benefit society rests on two main lines &lt;br/&gt;of thought.  First of all, control&lt;br/&gt;systems are now found in almost all durable goods, including &lt;br/&gt;dishwashers, heaters,&lt;br/&gt;toasters, automobiles, etc. and are becoming common in building &lt;br/&gt;management involving lighting, heating and&lt;br/&gt;security. The use of conventional optimal control often defines a &lt;br/&gt;control law that is too expensive to&lt;br/&gt;implement and so that ad hoc schemes are used that yield a performance &lt;br/&gt;level that is not all that it&lt;br/&gt;could be. The ideas discussed here are directed toward developing a &lt;br/&gt;methodology for finding less expensive,&lt;br/&gt;higher performance solutions. Secondly, although biological systems are &lt;br/&gt;replete with feedback control&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms, conventional control theory has had only limited success in &lt;br/&gt;predicting and explaining the&lt;br/&gt;structures identified so far. Arguing that living systems, through &lt;br/&gt;evolution, are attempting to optimize a&lt;br/&gt;trade-off between the performance of the system and its complexity, we &lt;br/&gt;make the case that better&lt;br/&gt;success will be had in explaining biological phenomena using theories of &lt;br/&gt;the type proposed here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposer has a long history of educating students at both the &lt;br/&gt;graduate and undergraduate level. For&lt;br/&gt;example, this spring one of his undergraduate students received one of &lt;br/&gt;only three ``Fay" prizes&lt;br/&gt; given to graduating seniors for research  work.  The student designed  &lt;br/&gt;and fabricated  a VLSI chip&lt;br/&gt;implementing a very sophisticated  motor controller. This is the second &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate student of his in&lt;br/&gt;the last two years that has received University wide recognition for &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate research.  The funds&lt;br/&gt;requested are absolutely essential if he is to make these kinds of &lt;br/&gt;opportunities available to tomorrow's&lt;br/&gt;students, both at the graduate and undergraduate level.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
