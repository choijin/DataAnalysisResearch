    <AbstractNarration>This grant supports the purchase of an X-ray diffractometer for materials research at James Madison University, a state-supported, predominantly undergraduate institution committed to the inseparability of scholarship, research and teaching. The instrumentation will be used for investigations on the preparation of phosphate and phosphonate framework materials, the synthesis of ceramics for electronic devices, polymer processing by selective laser sintering and the study of novel aluminum fluoride minerals. The goal of the group is to obtain an instrument that expands the range of materials that can be structurally characterized and improves the quality and quantity of data available to researchers. This instrument will significantly enhance the laboratory environment in research and formal coursework, and will enable more cutting edge research projects that challenge and motive undergraduate students. It will provide a powerful teaching tool to introduce students to modern materials characterization techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This X-ray instrumentation will be used both in undergraduate research and for education by the Center for Materials Science at James Madison University. The Center involves faculty from the departments of Chemistry, Geology and Environmental Studies, Integrated Science and Technology, Mathematics, and Physics. The plan describes course development in powder X-ray diffraction, materials characterization, mineralogy and inorganic synthesis. This equipment will be available to students who are encouraged to do independent research for academic credit. The research activities are well suited for undergraduate participation and should result in quality publications, and students trained in useful materials characterization techniques.</AbstractNarration>
