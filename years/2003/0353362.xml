<AbstractNarration>This project aims to investigate the charge-ordering (CO) phenomenon in mixed-valent oxides with perovskite-related structures and to explore the design of materials with a high dielectric constant. The  evolution  of  the  dielectric constant  at  the  crossover  from  localized  to  itinerant  electronic  behavior will be studied.  The  evolution  of  physical  properties  at  this  transition  continues  to  be  a  subject  of  extensive  and  intensive investigation  because  there  is  still  no  accepted  theory  of  the  character  of  this  transition,  which manifests a number of novel phenomena.  Surprisingly, the evolution of the dielectric properties has received little attention, yet it promises to provide novel phenomena of technical interest.   &lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;Two of the key investigators of the group in Spain have worked in Texas with Professor Goodenough, so excellent working relationships have been established.  In addition, a University of Texas graduate student who is a U.S. citizen will study in Spain. The several universities involved bring different synthetic and/or measurement techniques to this complex problem, and the  students  of  each  country  have  an  excellent  opportunity  to  benefit  culturally  as  well  as scientifically  from  this  collaboration.    The possibility of designing a material with  an anomalously  high  dielectric  constant  would  open  a  field  of  technical  as  well  as  fundamental interest.  &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
