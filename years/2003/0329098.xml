<AbstractNarration>This project's goal is to develop new motion capture and movement representations inspired by Laban Movement Analysis (LMA). Consider a statement such as: "Hey, that's John striding across the quad, I'd recognize his bold confident walk anywhere!"  Every human being has his/her own unique perceivable movement style-repeated recognizable movement elements that can be notated-which a Laban movement analyst would call a "movement signature."  These elements in their combinations and phrasing capture the liveliness of a person's movement-his or her dynamic expressiveness.  Despite advances in the motion capture process, many important subtleties still get diminished or lost.  If applied to computer animation, current motion capture results lack the original dynamic life-quality; the person's movement signature is not preserved, and the animations look rather artificial and robotic.  So it is unlikely that John would look like himself in an animation done using current motion capture techniques.  The PI will collaborate with artists and scientists that are movement specialists, to study current motion capture shortcomings and to develop LMA filters that explicitly capture perceptually important features and amplify them as necessary to achieve more expressive animations.  To this end, the PI plans to exploit new factorization-based capture techniques, and new representations of dynamics that are estimated from example LMA data.  The PI will also develop new motion retargeting techniques to transfer and modify the measured dynamic LMA features to other character models. .  The PI will apply his techniques to medical analysis and rehabilitation, gesture recognition, and archiving and annotation of movement databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  This project will lead to a better understanding of human movement analysis, and to better computer tools that can be used for human movement in applications related to HCI, medicine, psychology, education, entertainment and the arts. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
