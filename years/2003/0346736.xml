<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Parasitoids, which are an important component of most terrestrial&lt;br/&gt;ecosystems, are parasitic animals (mostly wasps, flies, and nematodes)&lt;br/&gt;that kill their hosts as part of their normal life cycle. Plants, their&lt;br/&gt;insect herbivores, and the parasitoids that attack those herbivores&lt;br/&gt;represent more than half of all described organisms in the world.&lt;br/&gt;"Caterpillars and parasitoids in the Eastern Andes of Ecuador" consists of&lt;br/&gt;an intensive plant, caterpillar, and parasitoid inventory at the Yanayacu&lt;br/&gt;Biological Station (YBS) in the Ecuadorian Andes. The primary objectives&lt;br/&gt;are to: 1) Collect and catalog the diverse community of caterpillars and&lt;br/&gt;associated parasitoids at this site and to provide specimens for&lt;br/&gt;systematics (classification of organisms and their evolutionary&lt;br/&gt;relationships). 2) Disseminate this information with a searchable database&lt;br/&gt;accessible to scientists and the public throughout the world. 3) Collect&lt;br/&gt;baseline natural history information such as specialized associations&lt;br/&gt;between plants, herbivores, and parasitoids; development rates; and other&lt;br/&gt;life cycle information for both known and undescribed species. 4) Provide&lt;br/&gt;the foundation for an identification key to the caterpillars of the&lt;br/&gt;Ecuadorian Andes. Caterpillar collecting and rearing will take place in a&lt;br/&gt;cloud forest on the eastern slope of the Andes in Napo province, Ecuador,&lt;br/&gt;centered around the YBS. Collecting will be conducted by carefully&lt;br/&gt;inspecting selected plant species along transects and also by&lt;br/&gt;opportunistically collecting all caterpillars observed in the collecting&lt;br/&gt;area. Caterpillars and parasitoids will be reared to adults. Adult&lt;br/&gt;butterflies, moths, and parasitoids will be distributed to a network of&lt;br/&gt;collaborating specialists for identification and for descriptions of new&lt;br/&gt;species, revisions, and evolutionary studies.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed activity includes&lt;br/&gt;significant advances in insect classification by providing specimens to&lt;br/&gt;experts as well as providing a critical inventory that can be used in the&lt;br/&gt;conservation of biodiversity. Forests of the equatorial Andes are&lt;br/&gt;recognized as a global hotspot of biodiversity that is being destroyed at&lt;br/&gt;an alarming rate, but conservation efforts are improving. The current&lt;br/&gt;survey will make an important contribution towards documenting and&lt;br/&gt;describing the caterpillars and parasitoids of this threatened area, and&lt;br/&gt;will increase the local value of the Andean forests by providing&lt;br/&gt;scientific and economic incentives for their conservation. The ecology and&lt;br/&gt;systematics that are a part of this study will also be used to address a&lt;br/&gt;variety of basic and applied questions in ecology and evolutionary&lt;br/&gt;biology, ranging from the evolution of unique plant-insect interactions to&lt;br/&gt;the conservation and management of biodiversity. The broader impacts of&lt;br/&gt;this project include direct involvement of 4 local field assistants, 3&lt;br/&gt;Ecuadorian students, 3 Ecuadorian senior scientists, 1 postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;researcher, at least 12 collaborating insect specialists, and various&lt;br/&gt;graduate and undergraduate students. Therefore the project strengthens&lt;br/&gt;international scientific dialogue and relationships. The overall project&lt;br/&gt;will include enhancements in science education and research experience&lt;br/&gt;programs for minorities. Finally, the research will enhance training in&lt;br/&gt;systematics to help stem the decline in expertise that is currently having&lt;br/&gt;a negative impact on all disciplines in biology.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
