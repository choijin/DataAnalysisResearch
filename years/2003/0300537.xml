<AbstractNarration>This research is conducted in three phases. Phase 1 focuses on the development and demonstration of the three components of the proposed research (SPR sensor development, architecture optimization, optical computation) as separate entities. Phase 2 advances and revises these three components but also merges architecture optimization and optical computation developed during Phase 1 with modular but non-selective SPR probes, whose structure has been optimized for reliable detection in the targeted applications. Phase 3 adds multiple, highly selective SPR probes with optimized surface chemistry for demonstrating system operation in the representative applications of detecting myoglobin for bedside heart health monitoring and PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) for environmental monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project presents educational opportunities in a multidisciplinary collaborative environment for both graduate and undergraduate students in Engineering and Chemistry. The sensors designed in this project will be employed in undergraduate laboratory classes taught by Wilson in Electrical Engineering and by Booksh in Analytical and Environmental Chemistry. Both Wilson and Booksh have a documented track record of mentoring and supporting female and minority students. Both PIs expect to continue the trend with this project. Successful completion of this reject will open doors for future collaborations between Wilson and Booksh; the integrated data collection and processing architecture developed here can conceivable be applied to other sensor geometries with health or national defense implications.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
