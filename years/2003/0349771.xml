    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase II project will develop and demonstrate self-imaging laser technologies for eyesafe remote sensing applications. Laser based remote sensing applications require a variety of output formats, including amplitude modulated (AM) and frequency modulated (FM) continuous wave (CW) lasers; and pulsed lasers. There are currently no eye safe technologies available with the adaptive waveform capabilities to satisfy these requirements. At eye safe 1.5-micron wavelengths, bulk solid-state lasers are not capable of high average power operation; and conventional fiber laser systems are not capable of handling high peak powers due to optical damage and nonlinear effects. A patent-pending diffraction limited self-imaging waveguide laser technology has been developed that use an adaptive waveform that has the potential to satisfy the average and peak power requirements simultaneously. There are two objectives for the Phase II research- 1) to design a self-imaging laser system with adaptive waveform capability, and 2) to demonstrate an adaptive waveform 1.5-micron laser transmitter. It is anticipated that &gt;20 W of diffraction limited, eye safe average laser power will be achieved with adaptive waveform capability demonstrated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This eye safe self-imaging waveguide laser module is targeted as an enabling technology with broad reaching impact. The specific markets include remote sensing markets of wind and aerosol detection and 3- D imaging. This technology should have a significant impact because current sensors are complex and costly. Other applications include hazard alerting for windshear, gust front, and turbulence detection; wake vortex detection, tracking, and measurement; and detection and tracking of hazardous bioaerosols.</AbstractNarration>
