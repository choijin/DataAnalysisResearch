    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will create a software-based, real-time, single camera, direct-to-computer, two-dimensional motion analysis system for education using image-processing technology. Image processing has not previously been used in educational motion detection. Compared to the commonly used methods--real-time one-dimensional graphing and frame-by-frame analysis of stored video--this innovation has many advantages, such as the simultaneous real-time display of video and graphs, multidimensional operation, ability to operate over any distance scale, display of the shape and orientation of objects, and the automatic generation of stroboscope-like images. This innovation creates the opportunity to surpass in learning effectiveness and ease-of-use the technologies now used widely in high school and college physics for the study of motion. In addition it will potentially reach a much larger group--mathematics classrooms from middle school through college. The system will operate with ordinary classroom computers and ordinary digital video cameras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Used in conjunction with inquiry-based curricula, Alberti's' Windows' system will be primarily used in physics and mathematics education classes. Improving the teaching of physics and mathematics is basic to science literacy and is essential to creating a technologically capable workforce. Ultimately, the following potential markets can also be explored: CAD/CAM, physiological/medical testing, sports, industrial monitoring and control, videogames, and security.</AbstractNarration>
