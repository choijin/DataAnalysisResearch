<AbstractNarration>Wahlbin&lt;br/&gt;     Lars Wahlbin and Alfred Schatz first continue their study of&lt;br/&gt;asymptotically exact a posteriori error estimators for the&lt;br/&gt;pointwise error in approximating the gradient on each simplex by&lt;br/&gt;the finite element method.  The problems they consider involve&lt;br/&gt;solutions with singularities that pose new difficulties.  What&lt;br/&gt;makes these problems difficult is that one wants totally local&lt;br/&gt;information about errors when, in fact, the solution and its&lt;br/&gt;approximation are globally influenced in particular by the&lt;br/&gt;singularities.  The investigators also look into a priori error&lt;br/&gt;estimates for second order elliptic partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations with discontinuous coefficients on nonconvex polygonal&lt;br/&gt;domains, allowing meshes that are highly refined.  The estimates&lt;br/&gt;under consideration justify the use of refined grids in a variety&lt;br/&gt;of highly singular problems.  Because most refined grids are&lt;br/&gt;constructed using self-adaptive codes that may have different&lt;br/&gt;methods of choosing a grid, no a priori assumption is made about&lt;br/&gt;the distribution of the mesh.  The work described above is carried&lt;br/&gt;out under the assumption that meshes are shape-regular, but&lt;br/&gt;basically nothing else is assumed concerning the meshes.  If some&lt;br/&gt;further local structure is placed on the mesh (so-called one plus&lt;br/&gt;alpha regular meshes), then a limited amount of superconvergence&lt;br/&gt;may occur (as shown by Xu and Zhang in a particular situation).&lt;br/&gt;The investigators, together with Zhang, apply this idea in&lt;br/&gt;greater generality, namely to meshes that are perturbations of&lt;br/&gt;those symmetric with respect to a point.  The symmetry theory&lt;br/&gt;predicts superconvergent points in many practical situations and&lt;br/&gt;it is important to determine how this stands up under&lt;br/&gt;perturbations.  If even more structure is given to the mesh,&lt;br/&gt;namely, that it is translation invariant, difference quotients&lt;br/&gt;may be used for approximating derivatives.  The investigators&lt;br/&gt;construct new compact forms of such difference quotients.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the investigators consider finite element methods for&lt;br/&gt;visco-elastic problems.&lt;br/&gt;     The investigators look into basic properties of the finite&lt;br/&gt;element approximation method, widely used in engineering and&lt;br/&gt;science practice, in industry, in research laboratories as well&lt;br/&gt;as in academia.  The finite element method builds an approximation&lt;br/&gt;to the solution of a differential equation on a region by&lt;br/&gt;breaking the region into smaller pieces and approximating the&lt;br/&gt;solution on each separate piece, say as a combination of&lt;br/&gt;functions that is easy to compute.  Pasting together the separate&lt;br/&gt;approximations gives a global approximation to the solution.  The&lt;br/&gt;method has its roots in the airplane industry and started to be&lt;br/&gt;used in all branches of science and engineering in tne 1960's.&lt;br/&gt;Well over a hundred thousand articles have been written on this&lt;br/&gt;method.  The investigators' aim in pursuing the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;behavior of this method is two-fold: to get a deeper&lt;br/&gt;understanding for what the method does, as currently practiced,&lt;br/&gt;and to use this understanding to develop new and better methods.&lt;br/&gt;A particular aspect that the investigators consider is that of&lt;br/&gt;reliably gauging how well the computer method approximates the&lt;br/&gt;underlying engineering or scientific model, whose exact solution&lt;br/&gt;is of course unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
