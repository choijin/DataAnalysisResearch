<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT DMS - 0203979.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project deals with three areas of Riemannian geometry, namely,&lt;br/&gt;nonnegative sectional curvature, negative sectional curvature,&lt;br/&gt;and almost nonnegative Ricci curvature. Specifically, we continue&lt;br/&gt;the search of new examples of metrics of nonnegative sectional&lt;br/&gt;curvature and obstructions to their existence, especially in the&lt;br/&gt;simply-connected case, we plan to analyze the structure of open&lt;br/&gt;pinched negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent fundamental&lt;br/&gt;groups, and to study the difference between nonnegative and&lt;br/&gt;almost nonnegative Ricci curvatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main goals of modern geometry is to obtain global&lt;br/&gt;qualitative information about a space by measuring its local&lt;br/&gt;quantitative properties. Say, it has been known since the&lt;br/&gt;nineteenth century that a space that locally looks like an egg&lt;br/&gt;must globally look like an egg, not like a doughnut or a jungle gym.&lt;br/&gt;This project deals with similar matters for higher dimensional&lt;br/&gt;spaces, some of which occur naturally in physics and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
