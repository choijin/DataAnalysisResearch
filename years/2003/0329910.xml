<AbstractNarration>Networked Sensing, Decision, and Actuation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interconnection of sensors, actuators, and controllers &lt;br/&gt;enables local and remote supervision of physical environments.&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental difference between the traditional and the networked control &lt;br/&gt;problem is that the network introduces unreliable and time-dependent levels&lt;br/&gt;of service (delays, jitter, losses).&lt;br/&gt;In turn, network vagaries can jeopardize the stability, safety, and &lt;br/&gt;performance of the controlled units.&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of this research is to devise integrated&lt;br/&gt;control and communication algorithms to compensate for the&lt;br/&gt;vagaries of network service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such control and communication strategies are targeted toward the&lt;br/&gt;application-layer and their objective is to deal with&lt;br/&gt;packet losses, delays, jitter, and network unreliability.&lt;br/&gt;This objective necessitates an integrated approach that combines networking &lt;br/&gt;(e.g., network measurement, modeling, and simulation; reliability) with &lt;br/&gt;decisions based on sensor data (e.g., feedback control).&lt;br/&gt;Although strategies have to be adapted to the specific application areas,&lt;br/&gt;the research addresses a general methodology by drawing from the foundations&lt;br/&gt;of Systems Theory and of Networking.&lt;br/&gt;Control algorithms and communication protocols are evaluated according to a &lt;br/&gt;methodology that combines analytical characterization, co-simulation, and &lt;br/&gt;prototype construction and validation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research includes teaching, course &lt;br/&gt;and curriculum development, graduate advising, and undergraduate research &lt;br/&gt;experiences. &lt;br/&gt;An objective of this work is to expand the presence of groups that are &lt;br/&gt;under-represented in Engineering and Computer Science.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators have on-going relationships with industry.&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research are published and freely disseminated.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
