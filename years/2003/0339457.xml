<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of an all-optical hydrogen sensor system.  Safety remains a top priority since leakage of hydrogen in air during production, storage, transfer, or distribution creates an explosive atmosphere over a broad concentration range.  The hydrogen economy infrastructure is new and rapidly growing; public acceptance of hydrogen fuel will require the integration of reliable hydrogen safety sensors.  Feasibility of the sensing approach will be demonstrated by developing a sol-gel-titania-based sensor.  Tasks have been designed to characterize dynamic range, response time, reversibility, accuracy, resolution and lack of interference from humidity.  Four criteria have been established to define Phase I success.  They are : (1) sensitivity to 0.05% hydrogen; (2) return of the signal to the same baseline upon cycling between 0% and 10% hydrogen 20 tomes; (3) the recovery time staying within 10% of the response time; and (4) the sensor performance remaining unchanged in the presence of 100% relative humidity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of the hydrogen sensor developed in this project is as a safety device in the hydrogen fuel industry.  The hydrogen-related energy business is expected to exceed $15 billion by 2010.  This rapid growth includes fuel cells and liquid fuel tanks for rockets.  Hydrogen sensor sales are predicted to accelerate for automotive applications.  Other applications include power generation, aerospace, food production, and industrial process control where hydrogen is used as a feedstock.</AbstractNarration>
