    <AbstractNarration>0335539&lt;br/&gt;Knothe Tate&lt;br/&gt;Partial support is being provided for undergraduate and graduate student trainees from underrepresented groups to participate in the 5th Bone Flow Workshop, Cleveland Clinic, September 17-18, 2003. Minority high school students are to provide support services for the meeting (help with audiovisual systems; prepare abstract books; assist with registration; assist with lab tours). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the workshop lies in its focus on the fluid flowing through the complex milieu that is bone. The workshop is expected to have a broad impact in moving the field of inquiry from its dominance by theoretical and experimental studies of macroscopic tissues toward addressing the importance of general properties of fluid flow at the micro-nano level. The workshop is specifically centered around investigation of these small length scale aspects of bone fluid flow and how they relate to the previous macroscopic studies. The traditional Mechanical and Bioengineering departments represented at previous workshops has been broadened by including speakers from departments of Engineering Physics, Chemical Engineering, and Anatomy. This should expand the base of investigators interested in the problems of bone fluid flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meeting results are to be posted on the website http://www.ncmr.org/events/bone2003/, with abstracts of talks and posters and is to include a report with synopses of major discussion points and new insights.</AbstractNarration>
