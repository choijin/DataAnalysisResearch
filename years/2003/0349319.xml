<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development project is to establish a research and teaching program at the Department of Physics and Astronomy of the California State University, Long Beach, that will serve the urban, ethnically and culturally diverse student community of southern California. The goals of the projects will include investigation of the physics of dynamical and thermal properties of individual magnetic nanostructures, as well as the spin electronic properties of tunable magnetic nanowire-based atomic point contacts and nanogaps. Additional focus of the research efforts will be in utilizing recently developed integrated optical and magnetic nanostructures towards the development of novel ultra-sensitive nanowire-based mechanical resonators integrated with the metallic plasmon optical nano-reflectors. Finally, new sensors and methodologies for magnetic resonance imaging will be explored and developed that include novel inductive and mechanical detection principles. These projects provide an excellent opportunity for both undergraduate and graduate students at the university that primarily serves traditionally underrepresented groups to learn about applications of magnetism and optics to a variety of interdisciplinary fields in nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development project is to establish a research and teaching program at the Department of Physics and Astronomy of the California State University, Long Beach, that will serve the urban, ethnically and culturally diverse student community of southern California. The goals of the projects will include investigation of the physics of individual magnetic nanostructures (only several hundred atoms across in size), as well as the electronic properties of magnetic atomic point contacts (spin electronics). Additional focus of the research efforts will be in utilizing recently developed integrated optical and magnetic nanostructures towards the development of novel ultra-sensitive nanowire-based mechanical resonators for magnetic resonance, biological, and chemical sensing applications. Finally, new sensors and methodologies for magnetic resonance imaging will be explored and developed that include novel inductive and mechanical detection principles.
