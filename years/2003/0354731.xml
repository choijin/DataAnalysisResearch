<AbstractNarration>We plan to study arithmetic groups for their own sake and for their&lt;br/&gt;applications to other branches of mathematics and computer science.&lt;br/&gt;Two central themes are the subgroup growth of arithmetic lattices and the&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics of the simplicial complexes obtained by taking quotients of&lt;br/&gt;Bruhat-Tits buildings modulo arithmetic groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arithmetic groups are at the crossroads of several central areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics: Lie groups, number theory, geometry and combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt;Their study can be carried out using a wealth of different methods and&lt;br/&gt;shed light on different directions.  A previous work has led to the&lt;br/&gt;construction of Ramanujan graphs which turn out to have remarkable&lt;br/&gt;applications to computer science and combinatorics. One of the goals of&lt;br/&gt;this research will be to study higher dimensional analogues with the&lt;br/&gt;hope of getting deeper applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
