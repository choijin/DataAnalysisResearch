    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project proposes to model, fabricate and test 2-D photon crystals for far-field coherent emission. Very recently published research showed that thermal emissions from 1-D photon crystals (PC) had near-field coherent components. Interference between photons and surface structure effective turned the PC into an infrared antenna emitting radiation in narrow bands. Ion Optics will fabricate thermally heated PC emitters based upon patterned silicon (dielectric-air PC) covered with very thin patterned metal films. Computer models will first study potential structures. Optimal structures will then be fabricated and tested. Emission will be measured as a function of angle and wavelength, and we will look at diffraction effects to test coherence. The project will lead to production of inexpensive, highly efficient, narrow line-width, low dispersion infrared MOEMS sources well suited to spectroscopic applications. Phase I results will be used to model spectroscopic vapor detection to determine potential for improved sensitivity. Significant advances over available MEMS components would show feasibility for Phase II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such light sources would enable detection of vapor species at very low concentrations (parts per billion or parts per trillion) for applications to atmospheric research, environmental research, detection of chemical warfare agents, explosives, etc.&lt;br/&gt;Potential sales could exceed $20 million per year.</AbstractNarration>
