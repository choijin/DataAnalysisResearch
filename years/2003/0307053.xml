<AbstractNarration>Re:  Proposal Number 0307053&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title &lt;br/&gt;Travel Support for US Researchers for BMC7 Workshop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      The project aims at providing financial assistance for 12 leading&lt;br/&gt;American specialists in the mechanics and technology of brittle matrix&lt;br/&gt;composites for their participation at the next International BMC 7 Symposium in Poland, October 13-15, 2003.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      In BMC 1-3 Symposia the participation of specialists from USA was&lt;br/&gt;insufficient and did not correspond to the involvement and interest of&lt;br/&gt;American scientists in that field of research and technology.  In BMC 4, 5,and 6, partly thanks to support from NSF, more than ten professors and scientist from USA presented their papers and took part in discussions and social events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      The participation of a representative group of American specialists will considerably enhance the role of the Symposium BMC 7, and stimulate international cooperation.  It will also benefit the American research community in keeping abreast of European research and development in ceramic and cementitious composites, and their manufacturing and industrial applications.  We expect to hear some research reports coming from the European Community (EC) joint projects such as those supported under the BRITE and EUREKA programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      New knowledge derived from the participation of specialist from the US at BMC-7 will be integrated into graduate level courses taught by these participants at their respective institutions. In particular, the PI teaches a course of Fracture and Micromechanics of Fibrous Composites (at UM) which includes the latest development in this field.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
