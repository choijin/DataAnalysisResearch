<AbstractNarration>0332555&lt;br/&gt;Chen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to the Colorado State University to support the activity described below for 36 months.  The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF-03521).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners&lt;br/&gt;The partners include the Colorado State University (Lead Institution), Hewlett-Packard, Poudre School District, Fort Collins High School, and Front Range Community College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed program attempts to push computer and semiconductor engineering education into the high schools to increase positive awareness of the computer and semiconductor engineering industry and to provide the opportunity for people who are interested and who may otherwise select a totally different career. The program will provide a large, diverse, and highly trained workforce pool to meet the demand for professionals in these fields. The program seeks to provide a workforce from technicians to PhDs. No single institution can provide such a range of education and training seamlessly, making this integrated approach unique. The goals of the program are:&lt;br/&gt;1. Create a pre-engineering curriculum in computer and semiconductor science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;2. Create an integrated curriculum that is more responsive to the needs of industry by working closely with the partners during the curriculum development stage.&lt;br/&gt;3. Provide internship/co-op programs through local industry to give students real work experience as part of the education/training.&lt;br/&gt;4. Provide training for high school teachers and community college faculty to maintain long-term training that is relevant to industry.&lt;br/&gt;5. Provide summer camps to attract and train students at the high school level for careers in these two fields.&lt;br/&gt;6. Recruit adults in mid-career who wish to make career changes to enter these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Economic Impact&lt;br/&gt;The information technology area is pervasive in the U.S. economy. There are not enough workers to fill all of the job opportunities that exist today, and the shortage will grow in the future. The pipeline for educating and training workers is long and we must begin now to keep up with the demands to keep the U.S. economy at the forefront in this global economy.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the activity lies in the creation of the novel integrated education and training of the technologically literate workforce through collaboration of the university, community college and local secondary school districts with the regional computer-related companies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is excellent in terms of Broader Impacts. The project, because it is so well integrated with local industrial needs, could have a very positive impact on economic development in the region. The model for workforce education and training could be exported to other regions of the nation. Underrepresented groups will participate in the activities of the grant and will benefit from the outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
