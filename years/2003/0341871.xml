<AbstractNarration>This project will create comprehensive plans to reformulate, streamline, and develop a new computer engineering curriculum focused on embedded systems.  In consultation with industry, the team will assess the needs that form the basis of this curriculum development effort, and the process that will be used to provide form and substance to it.   Project goals include the development of a comprehensive roadmap that comprises course offerings, topical content, and technology and software acquisitions, and a time-bound plan for phasing in the new curriculum.  The automotive context of the proposed embedded systems focus insures broad applicability of the program developed.  The automobile provides a severe environment for electronics as well as a test bed for many of the latest applications of embedded technology.  Therefore, while the industry focus is specific, the implications of this work go far beyond a local context.  It is expected that an engineer with a specialized education in embedded computer engineering would be well suited to meet the emerging needs of an important branch of modern engineering practice.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
