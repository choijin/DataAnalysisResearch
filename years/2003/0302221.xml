<AbstractNarration>Principal Investigator: Dijen K Ray-Chaudhuri&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: DMS- 0302221&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Ohio State University &lt;br/&gt;Title: Advances in Graph and Matroid Structure Theory&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This conference is intended to foster the mathematical issues that are important to present day graph theory, along the lines pioneered by Prof. W. T. Tutte and continued by G. Neil Robertson and his coworkers.  As such, fundamental topics in graph theory like connectivity, surface and spatial embeddings, well-quasi-ordering, chromatic theory, infinite excluded minors, and directed graphs find common links through their structural features.  Moreover, within the conference framework the organizers intend to include close subjects such as matroid theory and  ties through polynomial-time graph algorithms to combinatorial optimization and computational complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large-scale practical computational problems such as job scheduling, transportation networks, and data encryption for the purpose of secured secret communication can often be formulated as problems in the branch of mathematics called graph theory.  Graph coloring problems are of particular practical interest.  The structure theory of graphs developed by Robertson and Seymour has solved important problems with practical applications in these areas.  This conference will bring together experts to foster interaction and advances in research of problems of graph theory and a related theory called matroid theory&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
