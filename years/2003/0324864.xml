<AbstractNarration>This project, a collaborative with 03-24977 Kostas Daniilidis at University of Pennsylvania and 03-25017 Joel Burdick at California Institute of Technology, addresses research issues key to an important application of robot teams and information technology (emergency response in hazardous environments for various tasks). The research sets 6 goals:&lt;br/&gt; Development of new algorithms that enable collaborative sensing.&lt;br/&gt; Development of distributed localization/mapping methods that leverage capabilities of the heterogeneous robots.&lt;br/&gt; In-depth study of communication issues with emphasis on transparent integration of ultra wideband communication methodologies.&lt;br/&gt; Development of methods for team coordination and dynamic distribution of tasks to robots.&lt;br/&gt; Creation of algorithms for the presentation of sensory information to users.&lt;br/&gt; Experimental validation of the scalability of the aforementioned algorithms and techniques.&lt;br/&gt;The PIs use the Scout and MegaScout robotic platforms designed at the University of Minnesota along with other testbeds at CalTech and U Penn to conduct the research. The project integrates the algorithms with first responder teams, emphasizing realistic scenarios; mentors students from underrepresented groups in order to retain them in CS/EE programs; conducts outreach activities through demonstrations at local schools and youth groups; conducts workshops that emphasize cross-disciplinary interaction; creates web resources; innovates classroom uses of multi-robot teams; and includes parts of the research in design projects for seniors. The project also includes international collaboration with groups at NTUA (Greece) and the University Louis Pasteur-Strasbourg I (France).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Emergency response is a significant component of modern society's ability to respond to a wide range of events. Examples of these events include  earthquakes, floods, collapsed bridges, accidents, bomb blasts, etc. Currently emergency  response often involves engaging and dispatching human resources to assess the situation and provide assistance. Human responders are often overloaded and the many false alarms could create a big burden on a system that already faces dwindling financial resources.  This project's outcomes try to promote algorithms and robos that will augment the human responders' capabilities.       We developed a marsupial robotic system based on the Loper platform (acting as the mothership) that could be quickly deployed to assess the damage. One of the challenges is how we can use multiple robots as optimal observers of events or the environment while we satisfy power constraints. In terms of immediacy and effectiveness, mobile robots acting as a sensor network (immediately deployed after a catastrophic event) provide an interesting solution.

The first ones can provide primarily information about the position of the robot while the latter are useful for determining the heading of the robot.

During this work, we have derived closed-form expressions for the robot's positioning accuracy independent of the heading precision. This was achieved by a new formulation of the SLAM problem referred to as the dual-map.  and (iii) When robot teams cooperate to perform SLAM, one of the requirements is to be able to merge maps constructed independently by different r...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
