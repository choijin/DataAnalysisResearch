<AbstractNarration> &lt;br/&gt;  Who gets what?. is a central question of political contestation in the United States and &lt;br/&gt;around the world.  Answers to this question can come in a variety of forms.  For example, the &lt;br/&gt;Civil Rights movement in the United States was about what rights would be given to African &lt;br/&gt;Americans, and the abortion debate concerns the values government will authoritatively enforce.  &lt;br/&gt;But at its heart, .Who gets what?. is a question of material well-being.  Essentially, the question &lt;br/&gt;is .Who gets the money?. &lt;br/&gt;  An empirical answer to this question is available in the distribution of income, or income &lt;br/&gt;inequality.  Income inequality, then, is a key outcome of any political-economic system, and a &lt;br/&gt;great deal of research in economics, sociology, and political science has focused on explaining &lt;br/&gt;this outcome.  Previous research has shown that changes in labor markets, the demographic &lt;br/&gt;composition of populations, and wage-setting institutions help to determine income inequality.  &lt;br/&gt;This project examines these factors, but goes beyond by focusing on how government acts to &lt;br/&gt;influence inequality in the United States. &lt;br/&gt;  Research in political science has suggested that the primary mechanism through which &lt;br/&gt;governments influence distributional outcomes is direct redistribution . taxing the wealthy to &lt;br/&gt;provide benefits for the middle and lower classes (Bradley et al. 2003; Hibbs and Dennis 1988; &lt;br/&gt;Page and Simmons 2000).  The first component of the analysis in this project builds on the &lt;br/&gt;current state of knowledge by using aggregate time series data to test the connection between the &lt;br/&gt;ideological tone of policy and government.s redistributive effect.  Previous studies have used &lt;br/&gt;partisan control of government as a proxy for policy.  In the context of a country like the United &lt;br/&gt;States, where party discipline is comparatively weak, partisan control is a noisy indicator of the &lt;br/&gt;ideological content of policy.  This project provides for more robust analysis by explicitly &lt;br/&gt;examining the policies considered and enacted by government.  The findings obtained thus far &lt;br/&gt;suggest that liberal shifts in policy cause increases in redistribution. &lt;br/&gt;The second component of this project considers a relatively unexplored mechanism &lt;br/&gt;through which government can influence distributional outcomes . manipulation of economic &lt;br/&gt;opportunity.  Almost every type of government activity, from environmental or corporate &lt;br/&gt;regulation to defense spending, enhances economic opportunities for some groups to the &lt;br/&gt;exclusion of others.  Inequality is influenced to the extent that the rich or poor are &lt;br/&gt;disproportionately advantaged by these activities.  This project assesses the distributional &lt;br/&gt;influence of government manipulation of economic opportunity by analyzing the connection &lt;br/&gt;between government policy and inequality before taxes and transfers.  Initial analysis suggests &lt;br/&gt;that policy influences inequality as much through manipulation of economic opportunity as &lt;br/&gt;through redistribution. &lt;br/&gt;  The final component of this project consists of interviewing policy elites and requires &lt;br/&gt;additional funding for its successful completion.  More specifically, funding of this project would &lt;br/&gt;provide the ability to reside in Washington, D.C. for approximately four months to conduct &lt;br/&gt;interviews of political appointees, high-level civil servants, and interest group leaders whose &lt;br/&gt;activities influence distributional policy making and implementation.  Given that the question &lt;br/&gt;.Who gets what?. is so politically central, distributional considerations are likely central to the &lt;br/&gt;thinking of policy elites, and many may have sophisticated conceptions of how government &lt;br/&gt;activity influences distributional outcomes.  This part of the project would aid in understanding &lt;br/&gt;the degree to which policy elites consider distributional outcomes when defining policy options &lt;br/&gt;and crafting national policy, as well as inform the empirical aspects of the project.</AbstractNarration>
