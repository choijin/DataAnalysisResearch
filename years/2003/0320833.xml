    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Wellesley College under the direction of Dr. Harris to acquire a bench-top MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer for interdisciplinary research in an undergraduate setting. A mass spectrometer is an instrument that can very accurately determine the mass of atoms and molecules and has for many years been a key instrument for research conducted primarily in Chemistry Departments. The development of recent techniques that allow for the ionization and volatilization (the matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) technique ) of large biomolecules (i.e. proteins) has spurred the development of a new generation of mass spectrometers that are becoming essential components for research in biology and biochemistry. It was therefore the goal of this proposal to acquire this state of the art instrumentation in an effort to allow undergraduate students who are interested in the chemistry of life to engage in collaborative interdisciplinary research efforts with faculty in both departments. The proposed acquisition of the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer will therefore have a significant impact on a broad base of faculty and undergraduate research students in the Chemistry and Biology Departments at Wellesley College, as well as specific courses in our curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary mission at Wellesley College is the undergraduate education of women and this commitment has taken on a special meaning in the sciences where women have traditionally been underrepresented. In the Biological Sciences and Chemistry Departments, the permanent full-time faculty of 24 members maintains high standards for both teaching and research. Many of the faculty have extramural funding, which supports productive research programs that also are focused on training undergraduate students. Therefore, the mass spectrometer will not only have an impact on research training, but will also enhance the research environment for a high proportion of our faculty. Several of the proposed projects will use the MALDI-TOF to identify unknown proteins derived from polyacrylamide gels utilizing peptide mass fingerprinting. The biologists plan to use prokaryotic (cyanobacterial) and eukaryotic (Arabidopsis and Saccharomyces) model systems to identify proteomic changes in response to oxidative and pH stress and unique protein-protein interactions. An organic chemist, will use mass spectrometry as a part of a research project to understand the forces involved in stabilizing the conformations of model b-sheets. Another faculty member in the chemistry department, will use mass spectrometry to acquire structural information relevant to the regulation of enzyme activity. There are also plans to integrate the mass spectrometer into undergraduate lab settings at both intermediate and advanced levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific merit of the projects that will be undertaken using the new mass spectrometer, and their focus on the teaching and research training of female undergraduates, speaks directly to the intellectual merit this undertaking The funding of this project represents a critical investment in our next generation of students.</AbstractNarration>
