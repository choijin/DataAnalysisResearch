<AbstractNarration>The Noyce Scholarship program at MSU will fund both 1-and 2-year scholarships for 39 talented college students who commit to becoming K-12 mathematics or science teachers in high-need districts. The scholarships may be used during a student's 4th or 5th year of an undergraduate teacher preparation program or toward one year of a post-BA program. The funds are being administered through the Division of Science and Mathematics Education.  This effort builds on MSU's all-university initiative called Teachers for a New Era (TNE) that involves creating standards for teacher preparation, course development and revision, and implementing new ways of teaching and assessing students.  A committee of faculty from the Colleges of Natural Science and Education is overseeing the recruitment, selection, and mentoring of the Noyce Scholars. An experienced evaluator is conducting the evaluation. Graduate students are assisting with mentoring and evaluation.  The Noyce Scholarship program is enabling students who graduate from MSU and benefiting from the TNE work to share their knowledge and skills with elementary and secondary schools in high-need areas throughout Michigan and beyond.  The scholarships and associated activities are expected to increase the number of teachers graduating with either a major or minor in mathematics or science from about 135 per year in 2000 - 2003 to about 155 per year in the years 2006 - 2008. The number of MSU graduates with mathematics or science majors taking positions in high need schools is also expected to increase proportionately during this period. The Noyce Scholarship program and other recruitment efforts initiated recently at MSU are expected to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in teaching. Further, the Noyce Scholarships are expected to add impetus to a fundraising program begun at MSU to establish a scholarship endowment for students choosing careers in teaching mathematics or science in Grades K -12.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
