<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research and education program in superstring phenomenology will focus on physics at the intersection of string theory, particle theory and cosmology. The PI together with students will focus on (1) constructing realistic particle physics models and early universe cosmology arising from string theory, (2) explore the low energy and cosmological consequences of string theory; and (3) conversely use low energy particle physics and cosmological measurements to test and constrain string theory. The PI will work with teachers in local rural high schools as a mentor of the Undergraduate Research Scholar program, and will also organize workshops to train high school teachers in frontier topics of physics&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
