<AbstractNarration>The Albert Nerken School of Engineering at The Cooper Union is planning a new undergraduate engineering curriculum that addresses the needs of a changed world.  The planning vision focuses on: interdisciplinary studies and programs that reflect the nature of discovery today; integrating genuine research with undergraduate education; maintaining academic rigor; and accommodating students' academic interests. Accordingly, project goals include: 1) establishing a new administrative structure that eliminates departmental divisions, establishes two engineering degrees for students on different professional tracks, creates interdisciplinary academic research hubs that facilitate project-based learning, and integrates the "soft" skills crucial to professional development; 2) outlining new curricula for the two-degree program that meets the needs of the engineering community, the nation, and the students; and, 3) evaluating the planning process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will entail gathering and analyzing information from external sources such as other colleges and industry representatives; working with internal constituents to create a flexible class schedule and promote efficient use of space; fostering collaboration among faculty and institutions; and monitoring and measuring the effectiveness of the planning process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact. This planning project will outline ways to encourage more undergraduate research activity; attract more students from underrepresented groups to engineering, including women; and provide opportunities to use and experiment with recent advances in teaching and learning.  Ultimately, when implemented, the new Cooper Union model and curricula will demonstrate to other undergraduate schools and engineering departments ways to provide curricular flexibility and interdisciplinary while maintaining rigorous standards, meeting ABET criteria, and encouraging undergraduate research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
