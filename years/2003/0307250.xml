<AbstractNarration>AST 0307250&lt;br/&gt;PI Evans&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding star formation is central to a deeper understanding of the formation of both galaxies and planetary systems. Star formation occurs in dense cores of molecular gas and dust that are probed by continuum emission from dust and molecular line emission at infrared to radio wavelengths. Theoreticians have developed several models for how stars form, including dynamical information. For tests of these models, they must be converted into predictions of observables: the distribution of emission over wavelength, angular extent of the core, and (for lines) material velocities. This project will complete the framework of the modeling apparatus that converts theory into observables, linking the physical details of the models to simulate actual observations and making comparisons to extensive observational data obtained with the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory, and other telescopes. The formation of isolated low-mass stars, of stars in clustered environments, and massive stars will be studied. For massive stars, the results will be used to provide a basis for understanding starburst galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The research will be done in close collaboration with undergraduate and graduate students, incorporation of results into teaching and outreach, and enhancing participation of underrepresented groups. At the present time, 3 graduate students and 2 undergraduate students are women. Graduate students present their work in scientific meetings, and many have published results in the last several years. Results from research are incorporated into classes taught by the PI, and the PI often talks about the research effort in public settings. The PI will enhance the pedagogical links on their star formation group web site.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
