<AbstractNarration>DMS-0306519&lt;br/&gt;Michael J. Hopkins, Lars Hesselhot, and Haynes R. Miller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Hesselholt, working with Ib Madsen and Thomas Geisser, has&lt;br/&gt;made deep advances in understanding the cyclotomic trace spaces&lt;br/&gt;associated to a ring.  These spaces were invented to describing the&lt;br/&gt;diffeomorphism groups of high dimensional manifolds, and Hesselholt's&lt;br/&gt;work is a significant step in that program. Central to Hesselholt's&lt;br/&gt;work is a connection he descovered between the cyclotomic trace spaces&lt;br/&gt;and the de Rham-Witt complex of p-adic arithmetic algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry. This has led to a generalization of the de Rham-Witt complex&lt;br/&gt;to a mixed characteristic situation, where it is related to the sheaf&lt;br/&gt;of p-adic vanishing cycles. This relationship further suggests the&lt;br/&gt;existence of a motivic theory behind the cyclotomic trace&lt;br/&gt;spaces. Under the support of this grant, Hesselholt will pursue this&lt;br/&gt;striking relationship between p-adic arithmetic algebraic geometry and&lt;br/&gt;the computations in topology relevant to understanding diffeomorphism&lt;br/&gt;groups.  Professor Hopkins, working with Matthew Ando and Charles Rezk&lt;br/&gt;has recently uncovered a new approach to congruences between modular&lt;br/&gt;forms using algebraic topology, which he plans to pursue with an eye&lt;br/&gt;on several open problems in the area.  In another collaborative&lt;br/&gt;effort, Professors Hopkins, Dan Freed and Constantin Teleman&lt;br/&gt;discovered a topological expression for the Verlinde algebra--an&lt;br/&gt;algebraic structure arising in mathematical physics and in the theory&lt;br/&gt;of representations of loop groups.  The three of them plan to explore&lt;br/&gt;this connection more deeply, with the long term ambition of&lt;br/&gt;discovering the topological sources of topological quantum field&lt;br/&gt;theories.  Hopkins will also continue his work with Isadore Singer on&lt;br/&gt;their theory of ``differential function spaces,'' which offers a&lt;br/&gt;refinement of algebraic topology especially suited for meeting the&lt;br/&gt;demands of mathematical physics.  Professor Miller will continue his&lt;br/&gt;work on Landweber exact and elliptic cohomology theories, his work&lt;br/&gt;with Bill Dwyer on topological Hochschild homology and the geometry of&lt;br/&gt;free loop spaces, and his study of the homotopy theory of algebraic&lt;br/&gt;structures arising in knot theory and the modern theory of Hopf&lt;br/&gt;algebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of algebraic topology arose in the late 19th century as&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians noticed deep similarities between very different&lt;br/&gt;looking areas of research.  By the beginning of the 20th century, the&lt;br/&gt;basic theory of algebraic topology was in place, and it was being used&lt;br/&gt;to explain, codify and reveal many qualitative aspects of geometry.&lt;br/&gt;During the next hundred years algebraic topology advanced at an&lt;br/&gt;amazing pace, and by now it seems as if every branch of contemporary&lt;br/&gt;mathematics draws on some form of algebraic topology when undertaking&lt;br/&gt;to articulate its qualitative aspects.  The algebraic topology group&lt;br/&gt;at MIT runs a large and diverse program emphasizing the many&lt;br/&gt;connections between algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, geometry,&lt;br/&gt;and mathematical physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
