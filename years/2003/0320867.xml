<AbstractNarration>In the department of Electrical Engineering at Tuskegee University, the PI and three students&lt;br/&gt;(two graduates and one undergraduate) are conducting research in the area of Smart Control&lt;br/&gt;Systems. The following two projects are underway: robust optimal control using a recurrent&lt;br/&gt;dynamic neural network, and compensation of global feedback linearization control of nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;systems using neural networks. However, these research activities are confined to theoretical&lt;br/&gt;investigations and applications to computer simulated system models using Matlab/Simulink&lt;br/&gt;software from the MathWorks Inc. No physical plants and corresponding real-time&lt;br/&gt;implementation software are currently available to test the smart control algorithms and refine&lt;br/&gt;them.&lt;br/&gt;The requested instrumentation to be acquired includes the ACE1103PX4CLP prototyping&lt;br/&gt;system from dSPACE Inc., which contains powerful hardware and comprehensive software tools&lt;br/&gt;for development of real-time control systems. In order to apply the dSPACE products to actual&lt;br/&gt;plants, we are in addition requesting the acquisition of the following electromechanical&lt;br/&gt;apparatuses from ECP, a leading manufacturer of mechanisms for research in control: the&lt;br/&gt;Rectilinear Mass/Spring/Damper (ECP Model 210), the Industrial Plant Emulator (ECP Model&lt;br/&gt;220), the Inverted Pendulum (ECP Model 505), the Magnetic Levitator (ECP Model 730), and&lt;br/&gt;the Control Moment Gyroscope (ECP Model 750).&lt;br/&gt;The acquired instrumentation will contribute to greatly advancing the above-listed research&lt;br/&gt;projects by providing the possibility of implementing the current Matlab/Simulink codes and&lt;br/&gt;models of the neural controllers on dSPACE hardware, and testing them in real-time as applied&lt;br/&gt;to actual electromechanical apparatuses, as well as checking the robustness of the neural&lt;br/&gt;controllers in the presence of noise and disturbances. The feedback obtained from the actual&lt;br/&gt;implementation of the various neural algorithms will contribute to significantly evaluating,&lt;br/&gt;refining, and improving the smart controllers design.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal resides in the fact that, if funded, the smart control&lt;br/&gt;research at Tuskegee University would be greatly enhanced, which in turn would affect the&lt;br/&gt;global research community in the area of artificial intelligence and control, since several journal&lt;br/&gt;and conference publications have resulted thus far from this research, and more would result&lt;br/&gt;with higher quality if the instrumentation is acquired.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the requested instrumentation include introduction of a new graduate&lt;br/&gt;course in Advanced Control Design at Tuskegee University, which is an HBCU committed to the&lt;br/&gt;high quality education of African-American students. Moreover, the acquired equipment will&lt;br/&gt;boost the research level and researchers motivation and learning experience and contribute to&lt;br/&gt;attracting new graduate students to Tuskegee University that are interested in the area of smart&lt;br/&gt;control systems. The development of this area that is expected to occur due to the requested&lt;br/&gt;instrumentation will have the additional impact of attracting research funding from industry and&lt;br/&gt;government agencies. Furthermore, the experience that students will have with dSPACE&lt;br/&gt;products will be very beneficial for their future career, since these products are used in major&lt;br/&gt;industries worldwide. Finally the acquired equipment will encourage the multidisciplinary trend&lt;br/&gt;in the College of Architecture, Engineering, and Physical Sciences at Tuskegee University by&lt;br/&gt;being made equally available to the faculty and students of the Aerospace, Chemical, Electrical,&lt;br/&gt;and Mechanical Engineering departments, which all offer courses in control systems.</AbstractNarration>
