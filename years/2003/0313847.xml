<AbstractNarration>0313847&lt;br/&gt;Perry&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to evaluate the use of tropical storm precipitation,&lt;br/&gt;especially that from  hurricanes, as a natural tracer of groundwater&lt;br/&gt;movement. Precipitation from tropical storms is known to have a special&lt;br/&gt;oxygen and deuterium isotope composition that distinguishes it from&lt;br/&gt;normal precipitation. Because tropical storms also produce many times as&lt;br/&gt;much rain as normal storms, they are capable of adding a large batch or&lt;br/&gt;slug of water to an aquifer during a single event. The objective of this&lt;br/&gt;study is to determine whether that slug of isotopically labeled water&lt;br/&gt;can be traced by stable isotope measurements as it moves through an&lt;br/&gt;aquifer. This research could establish a powerful new technique to study&lt;br/&gt;groundwater in tropical areas where hurricanes are frequent. &lt;br/&gt; It is difficult to plan and set up an experiment suitable for&lt;br/&gt;monitoring a hurricane, and it would be expensive to establish a large&lt;br/&gt;network of monitoring stations purely on the chance that a tropical&lt;br/&gt;storm might occur somewhere within that network. That is what adds an&lt;br/&gt;element of urgency to this proposal. Hurricane Isadore recently passed&lt;br/&gt;over the northern Yucatan Peninsula, an area where the PI has previously&lt;br/&gt;obtained background data on the isotopic composition of the local&lt;br/&gt;groundwater. Northern Yucatan is especially well suited for a trial of&lt;br/&gt;this monitoring technique: its karst aquifer is extremely permeable,&lt;br/&gt;insuring rapid groundwater movement; it has almost no soil that might&lt;br/&gt;impede rapid movement of the hurricane precipitation into the aquifer;&lt;br/&gt;and the aquifer is relatively uncomplicated. Thus, it will be relatively&lt;br/&gt;easy to monitor changes in the composition of water in this aquifer as&lt;br/&gt;the hurricane precipitation moves through. &lt;br/&gt; Samples of groundwater will be collected in three sampling trips&lt;br/&gt;over a period of one year. These will be obtained from municipal wells,&lt;br/&gt;covered karst sinkholes, and piezometers (where available). Students&lt;br/&gt;will be involved in collecting the samples and analyzing the data.&lt;br/&gt;Isotopic analyses will be performed in the stable isotope laboratory of&lt;br/&gt;the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. &lt;br/&gt; Intellectual merit of this project will be a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the behavior of groundwater, a precious resource, and&lt;br/&gt;the development of a new, non-polluting technique for charting its&lt;br/&gt;movement.&lt;br/&gt; The broader impacts of this activity will include: 1)&lt;br/&gt;development of information on groundwater movement that can lead to&lt;br/&gt;better management and protection of groundwater in the very sensitive&lt;br/&gt;Yucatan aquifer (essential for human health, agricultural productivity,&lt;br/&gt;industrial development, and tourism), 2) establishment of closer&lt;br/&gt;collaboration between Mexican scientists and scientists in the United&lt;br/&gt;States, accomplished by close collaboration in this research, and 3)&lt;br/&gt;education of students in the procedures used to collect meaningful&lt;br/&gt;samples of groundwater and to evaluate the analytical results of this&lt;br/&gt;study.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
