<AbstractNarration>PUBLIC ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;DEB 0345885&lt;br/&gt;Schneider&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sri Lanka is a small island nation off the southern tip of India.  Together with &lt;br/&gt;the Western Ghats region of southwestern India, Sri Lanka is recognized as one &lt;br/&gt;of the world's biodiversity hotspots - an area with enormous species diversity &lt;br/&gt;and endemism, but also a high degree of threat to natural habitats.  Sri Lanka, &lt;br/&gt;like much of the developing world, has experienced significant loss of it's once &lt;br/&gt;extensive rainforests.  In fact, only about 5% of the islands rainforest &lt;br/&gt;remains, typically in small isolated fragments.  Thus it was surprising that the &lt;br/&gt;remaining rainforest of Sri Lanka is home to a large number of previously &lt;br/&gt;unknown frog species.  Surveys by the Wildlife Heritage Trust of Sri Lanka over &lt;br/&gt;the past ten years revealed that there likely are over one hundred species of &lt;br/&gt;small terrestrial frogs endemic to the island.  These frogs do not require free &lt;br/&gt;standing water in which to rear tadpoles - instead, they have no tadpoles and &lt;br/&gt;the embryos develop completely within eggs laid on land and from which fully &lt;br/&gt;formed froglets emerge.  This mode of reproduction is known as &lt;br/&gt;direct-development and has evolved only about eight times in frogs making the &lt;br/&gt;Sri Lankan species even more unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this project is to fully document the frog species diversity in &lt;br/&gt;Sri Lanka as a first step in developing conservation measures to ensure that &lt;br/&gt;this unique radiation of frogs is not lost to future generations.  We are using &lt;br/&gt;a variety of methods to identify and describe the new species and to determine &lt;br/&gt;their evolutionary relationships, including: DNA sequences, call recordings, and &lt;br/&gt;analyses of morphology and ecology.  With funding from NSF we are now able to &lt;br/&gt;carry out a comprehensive survey of the island's frog fauna and analyze and &lt;br/&gt;describe in detail the many species that make up the remarkable radiation of &lt;br/&gt;direct-developing frogs in Sri Lanka.  In close collaboration with the Wildlife &lt;br/&gt;Heritage Trust of Sri Lanka, we are working to train a new cadre of Sri Lankan &lt;br/&gt;experts who will form the core of the nation's initiative to catalog and &lt;br/&gt;preserve its natural heritage.  This study not only contributes to basic &lt;br/&gt;understanding of amphibian diversity in one of the world's biodiversity &lt;br/&gt;hotspots, but also helps to build the infrastructure to ensure its preservation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
