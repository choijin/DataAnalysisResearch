    <AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New Researchers Conference is a meeting for new researchers in statistics and probability, where "new" is defined as doctoral students within one year of completion of the Ph.D. or post-doctoral statisticians and probabilists up to five years since the completion of their degrees. The primary purpose of this conference is to foster the professional development of new researchers by providing a much needed venue for interaction among new researchers by allowing these junior researchers to exchange ideas and initiate contacts amongst themselves as well as with the invited senior participants in the context of a smaller meeting, rather than the larger meetings more common in this field. All participants present their research in a short talk or poster session. The program also includes several talks by senior researchers and panel discussions with representatives from several statistics journals and representtatives from funding agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New Researchers Conference is a meeting for recent Ph. D. recipients in statistics and probability (or those within one year of completion). This conference aims to facilitate the development of new researchers to help them become productive scientific &lt;br/&gt;researchers and educators. The conference provides a controlled environment for junior researchers to interact by exchanging ideas and initiating contacts amongst themselves. All participants must present their research during the meeting. Also included in the program are several talks by senior speakers on topics of professional development and informational panels consisting of representatives from professional journals and funding agencies.</AbstractNarration>
