<AbstractNarration>Abstract for award of Walker DMS-0302024&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever information is transmitted across a channel, errors are bound&lt;br/&gt;to occur.  It is the goal of coding theory to find efficient ways to&lt;br/&gt;encode the information so that these errors can be corrected.&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic coding theory seeks to do this using techniques from areas&lt;br/&gt;such as linear algebra, group theory, and algebraic geometry.  This&lt;br/&gt;project involves four main problems within algebraic coding theory:&lt;br/&gt;the search for an efficient decoding algorithm for algebraic geometric&lt;br/&gt;codes over certain rings, the study of exponential sums over certain&lt;br/&gt;rings and their connections to coding theory, the study of codes from&lt;br/&gt;a structural standpoint, and the construction of quantum codes in&lt;br/&gt;characteristics greater than 2.  Much of this project involves work&lt;br/&gt;the PI will do with her graduate and postdoctoral students.  In&lt;br/&gt;addition, she will continue her history of being extremely active in&lt;br/&gt;mathematical activities outside her research.  These activities&lt;br/&gt;include organizing a week-long summer math camp for high school girls&lt;br/&gt;and a national research conference for undergraduate women&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians.  While previously supported by NSF, the PI was the&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate lecturer at the IAS/Park City Mathematics Institute&lt;br/&gt;Mentoring Program, and during the term of the current project, she&lt;br/&gt;will be the principal lecturer at a "Reconnect" workshop for faculty&lt;br/&gt;from primarily teaching-focused institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More precisely, the problems included in this project are described as&lt;br/&gt;follows.  In previous work, the PI introduced algebraic geometric&lt;br/&gt;codes over local Artinian rings and proved several foundational&lt;br/&gt;results about these codes.  Two portions of this project build on this&lt;br/&gt;prior work.  First, in joint work with R. Koetter, the PI intends to&lt;br/&gt;find an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes.  This algorithm&lt;br/&gt;will decode with respect to the squared Euclidean and homogeneous&lt;br/&gt;weight measures.  The design of the algorithm will depend both upon&lt;br/&gt;Sudan's list decoding algorithm and the Koetter-Vardy soft-decision&lt;br/&gt;version of Sudan's algorithm.  Second, the PI will build upon her past&lt;br/&gt;work with exponential sums along curves over rings and their&lt;br/&gt;relationship to codes.  While her previous work (joint with&lt;br/&gt;J.-F. Voloch) has focused on Weil exponential sums and their&lt;br/&gt;applications to homogeneous and squared Euclidean weights of algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometric codes over local Artinian rings, other types of sums have&lt;br/&gt;proven valuable in the study of codes over finite fields and the PI&lt;br/&gt;will now study the ring analogues of these other sums and their&lt;br/&gt;applications.  The third area of this project builds on the PI's prior&lt;br/&gt;work on a structural approach to coding theory.  She previously used&lt;br/&gt;this approach to revisit the classification of binary self-dual codes,&lt;br/&gt;and in addition to continuing this work, she will look at ternary&lt;br/&gt;self-dual codes as well as additive GF(4)-codes from this point of&lt;br/&gt;view.  The fourth and final main area of this project is that of&lt;br/&gt;quantum algebraic-geometric codes arising from algebraic curves.&lt;br/&gt;Together with J.-L. Kim and T. Marley, the PI intends to construct&lt;br/&gt;good algebraic geometric quantum codes in characteristics greater than&lt;br/&gt;2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
