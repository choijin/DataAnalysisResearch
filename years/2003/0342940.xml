<AbstractNarration>This CAREER award focuses on research and education integrating material characterization and systems analyses for Civil Systems Design. An innovative, polymeric fiber cement-based material, which exhibits pseudo strain hardening in tension, is studied for use in seismic-resistant structures. Energy dissipation in this engineered material is examined in its combination with traditional materials of concrete and post-tensioned steel.  This combination of materials is applied to an innovative bridge substructure system, providing energy dissipation and reduced residual deflections for seismic loading. Material characterization is conducted using advanced experimental techniques and nonlinear finite element simulation.  Systems analyses are performed to study the potential of using this advanced material in new seismic-resistant structures. &lt;br/&gt;Courses are developed to enhance knowledge and skills for material characterization and systems analysis. This coursework facilitates and motivates creativity in the invention and implementation of innovative materials for civil infrastructure needs. Students are exposed to advanced experimental and computer simulation tools.  Real-world projects in civil systems courses give exposure to complex decision processes and offer opportunities to implement creative solutions using innovative materials. &lt;br/&gt; To promote creativity and inspire imagination, the civil engineering community must be a diverse population.  One approach to attract diversity is to promote awareness of engineering through activities for pre-college students. Hands-on laboratory workshops on Civil Systems Design will be developed to demonstrate the excitement and social relevance of modern civil systems to pre-college students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
