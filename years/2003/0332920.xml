<AbstractNarration>This action funds core support for the Board on Life Sciences of the National Academy of Sciences.  The Board provides advice to government and the scientific community on the biological sciences and their impact on society. Its work encompasses all of the life sciences, from molecular genetics to ecology. With the help of hundreds of biologists and other experts, the Board serves as a focal point for examining a wide range of technical and policy issues, from maintaining progress in individual life science disciplines to fostering interactions among disciplines to promote synergistic advances, and from improving training and career retention in the biological sciences to assessing the societal implications of developments in biological science and technology.  Three current areas of emphasis for the Board are the health of the biological sciences and biology education, biotechnology and genetics, and biodiversity and ecology.  Core funding from NSF makes it possible for the Board on Life Sciences to pursue the development of ideas for new studies, particularly in the areas of ecology, environmental biology, and biodiversity conservation.</AbstractNarration>
