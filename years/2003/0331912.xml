<AbstractNarration>Proposal #: AST- 0331912&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Blue, Charles &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Associated Universities Inc/National Radio Astronomy Observatory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;National observatories, government agencies, universities and private institutions devote considerable time and resources to communicating the results of astronomy research to the public. These entities, however, do not often have the opportunity to interact, share resources, and discuss common problems.  As a result, the effectiveness of public outreach in astronomy suffers. Expertise is not often shared. New avenues of outreach and cooperative opportunities are missed.  The National Radio Astronomy Observatory, in cooperation with the National Research Council, is organizing a conference to attempt to solve some of these problems, and to ensure these institutions are poised to take advantage of new opportunities, enhance their current efforts, and develop new cooperative programs in astronomy outreach. This three-day meeting will feature panel discussions on communicating astronomy, featured speakers and experts addressing salient issues, and guided discussions among the participants. In addition, individual poster sessions will be offered to showcase various institutions' efforts and programs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this activity will be in two areas. First, it will provide a lasting outreach resource for the entire astronomical community. The conference will strive to create an ongoing method for sharing astronomy outreach materials, and to build sustained linkages by fostering cooperation among different sectors of the astronomical community.  A second broad impact will be improved understanding of astronomy, the scientific process, and the value of research among the general public.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
