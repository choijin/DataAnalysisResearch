    <AbstractNarration>Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;This study focuses on fundamental research on the management of corporate R&amp;D. There is a great deal of variance in the effectiveness of basic research (discovery of new ideas and relationships) and innovation (commercialization) . The variance is both between firms and within firms that have multiple R&amp;D labs. The research is designed to test organizational theories linking effectiveness of R&amp;D to coordination, communication, and cooperation to division of specialized knowledge labor. The more specialized the division of labor, the greater the information coordination needs. The knowledge sources are both within firm (primarily cross-functional) and external (disciplinary, patents, and public science). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will be the first, pilot stage of an eventual large scale field study of corporate R&amp;D laboratories. The broad objective is to model how firms balance and integrate the needs for internal information flows and tight coordination with access to external public knowledge and information. For product innovation it is important to have tight coordination in order to incorporate and integrate information and knowledge spread out across various functional areas such as manufacturing and marketing. Basic research requires sources of knowledge external to the firm that are substantially dependent on discipline knowledge and public science.&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broad impact, this research specifically targets the effectiveness of corporate R&amp;D, which is critical for technological advancement at multiple levels: national, industrial, and organizational. This line of research also should be informative for management of university technology transfer, such as spin-outs, and government R&amp;D, such as DARPA projects. The investigator is committed to continue incorporating valid research into educational materials and curricula.</AbstractNarration>
