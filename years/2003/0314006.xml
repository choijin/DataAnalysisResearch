    <AbstractNarration>With this grant from the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the Division of Biological Infrastructure in the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Jeanne Narum, Director of Project Kaleidoscope and of the Independent Colleges Office, will organize and conduct a series of six institutes over the next three years that are designed to enhance development of broad leadership skills of young faculty who will be leaders in the STEM disciplines in the 21st century. These 'Project Kaleidoscope Faculty for the 21st Century' (PKAL F21) institutes are workshops in which young faculty interact with mentors to develop both leadership skills and a tailored agenda for use of these skills in their home institution settings. Of particular importance is the potential impact of these institutes on the diverse institutions from which these faculty will be drawn. These institutes will focus on leadership on campus, leadership within professional disciplinary and multidisciplinary communities, leadership within the growing network of PKAL F21 young faculty, and leadership in the public arena. The long-term expectation is that this leadership in STEM disciplines will give rise to educational and cultural transformation at the institute participants' home institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PKAL F21 institutes were established in 1994 and since that time have impacted well over 100 young faculty members. Most recently supported under NSF grant DEB-9714869, these new institutes will have a broad reach to a more diverse cadre of young faculty in STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
