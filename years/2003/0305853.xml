<AbstractNarration>DMS-0305853&lt;br/&gt;Igor Kriz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic topology is an area which examines properties of &lt;br/&gt;shapes not affected by continuous deformation: in a traditional &lt;br/&gt;example, a coffee cup made out of modelling clay can be &lt;br/&gt;continuously, without gluing or tearing,deformed into the &lt;br/&gt;shape of a donut, but not a solid ball (because of the `hole' &lt;br/&gt;in the handle). Sophisticated methods using algebra, primarily&lt;br/&gt;groups, were developed to describe and explain such concepts.&lt;br/&gt;String theory is an area of theoretical physics which is &lt;br/&gt;currently the best candidate for solving the greatest puzzle&lt;br/&gt;of modern physics, namely unification of gravity with the other&lt;br/&gt;forces of nature. The fundamental idea of string theory is that &lt;br/&gt;very small particles may not be `dots', but $1$-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;objects (`strings'). The present project focuses on connections &lt;br/&gt;between algebraic topology and string theory. While physicists &lt;br/&gt;know about the fact that topology is connected to the phenomenology &lt;br/&gt;of strings, the present project explores connections of a new &lt;br/&gt;nature. Notably, algebraic topology is needed in making the &lt;br/&gt;concepts of string theory mathematically rigorous, which in turn &lt;br/&gt;is a necessary step toward possibly using such concepts for &lt;br/&gt;scientific prediction. On the other hand, string theory&lt;br/&gt;suggests exciting new methods for algebraic topology, which &lt;br/&gt;will also be explored in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will continue to work on using string theory to &lt;br/&gt;construct mathematical models for elliptic cohomology.  He will &lt;br/&gt;also consider extending these methods to finding generalized&lt;br/&gt;cohomology theories related to D-branes and M-theory. In the process,&lt;br/&gt;he will work on mathematical theories which will serve as&lt;br/&gt;axiomatic systems for fundamental and extended objects of string&lt;br/&gt;theory. Many aspects of this project are joint work with Po Hu.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
