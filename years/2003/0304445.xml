<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0304445&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  W. Stephen Wilson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major international conference on homotopy theory and algebraic&lt;br/&gt;topology will be held July 28 - August 1 in Kinosaki, Japan.  The&lt;br/&gt;conference will honor Professor Goro Nishida of Kyoto University&lt;br/&gt;on the occasion of his 60th birthday.  Professor Nishida has been&lt;br/&gt;the dominant force in algebraic topology in Japan for the last 10&lt;br/&gt;years.  With his name associated with the conference,&lt;br/&gt;participants will be attracted from all over the world.  It will&lt;br/&gt;be a major meeting place for mathematicians who do not normally&lt;br/&gt;manage to get together.  The conference will focus on the broad&lt;br/&gt;range of subjects which Professor Nishida has influenced which&lt;br/&gt;are still critical to today's research agenda in the field:&lt;br/&gt;localization, periodicity in homotopy theory, Morava K-theory,&lt;br/&gt;infinite loop spaces, homology and cohomology operations, modular&lt;br/&gt;forms, group cohomology and classifying spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for funding to supply transportation for&lt;br/&gt;researchers from the U.S.A. to attend the conference.  The&lt;br/&gt;conference itself is funded by Japan including the local support&lt;br/&gt;of our participants.  This conference will be the major&lt;br/&gt;international conference in the field for the year 2003.&lt;br/&gt;Distance and cost makes it difficult for Japanese and American&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians to mix on a scale like this with any frequency.&lt;br/&gt;This will be the biggest opportunity in over a decade (since&lt;br/&gt;Professor Toda's 60th birthday conference) for many non-Japanese&lt;br/&gt;to attend a conference in this field in Japan.  Such an&lt;br/&gt;opportunity may not come again for another decade.  This grant&lt;br/&gt;will allow several graduate students and recent Ph.D.s to attend.&lt;br/&gt;It will also fund the largest contingent of U.S. women to ever&lt;br/&gt;attend a conference in our field in Japan.  In addition, it will&lt;br/&gt;fund some researchers who have regular contact with Japan through&lt;br/&gt;previous visits and graduate students.  This contact will have a&lt;br/&gt;much broader impact on research than just the conference.&lt;br/&gt;Participants will establish research relationships which will&lt;br/&gt;last for many years and help stimulate more interaction.  We&lt;br/&gt;would also expect to recruit numerous Japanese graduate students&lt;br/&gt;to come to the U.S.A.  Bringing such students abroad is difficult&lt;br/&gt;to arrange, and the kind of personal interactions that occur at&lt;br/&gt;such conferences speed up the process enormously. The presence of&lt;br/&gt;a cadre of Japanese students with research experience in the USA&lt;br/&gt;is enormously important for scientific exchange in the long run.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
