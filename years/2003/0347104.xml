<AbstractNarration>Despite the recent advances in biology gained from the sequencing of the human genome a great challenge still lies ahead, namely understanding how genetic information is processed and utilized to yield a complex, multifunctional organism.  One of the most critical steps in the processing of genetic information is that of RNA splicing.  RNA is the intermediate molecule in the conversion of genetic sequence, or DNA, into functional cellular components, or proteins.  When in the form of RNA, genetic information may be pieced together, or spliced, in a variety of ways to give rise to multiple different proteins.  Dr. Lynch at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center is leading a group of high school, undergraduate and graduate students to determine how the splicing of RNA is regulated by a cell to allow distinct proteins to be produced in response to changing cellular environments.  Dr. Lynch and her students have identified specific RNA sequences that may serve as markers for genes that are susceptible to regulation of RNA splicing.  Through further identification of genes that contain such sequence markers and continued investigation as to the mechanism of regulation conferred by such sequences, Dr. Lynch hopes to uncover families of genes that are coordinately regulated within a cell in response to environmental stimuli.  These studies will also broaden the appreciation for how RNA splicing can be used to alter cellular function.  In addition, Dr. Lynch is actively involved in updating curriculum and designing new coursework for graduate students to reflect the importance of RNA splicing and other topics in RNA biology to the future of biological research.  In the classroom and in the laboratory, Dr. Lynch seeks to be a mentor and role model for students and provide them with the intellectual training required to participate in the forefront of the post-genomic era of biological sciences.</AbstractNarration>
