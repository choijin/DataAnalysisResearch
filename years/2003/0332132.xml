<AbstractNarration>This is a proposal to organize the Autonomic Computing Workshop (ACW 2003) which will be held in conjunction with the 12th IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing (HPDC-12), June 25th, 2003 at Seattle, Washington and with the 8th Global Grid Forum. More information about the workshop can be found at http://www.caip.rutgers.edu/ams2003/. The proliferation of Internet technologies, services and devices, have made the current networked system designs, and management tools incapable of designing reliable, secure networked systems and services. In fact, we have reached a level of complexity, heterogeneity, and dynamism that our information infrastructure is becoming unmanageable and insecure. Furthermore, current design techniques and software tools that control and manage the information infrastructure are incapable of handling its complexity, heterogeneity, uncertainty, and security requirements. On the other hand, biological systems have developed successful strategies and techniques to handle these issues. The main goal of the Autonomic Computing Workshop is establish a world-class forum to investigate the research issues and enabling technologies toward the convergence of biological technological and information systems (called Autonomic Computing). Autonomic computing research will enable the design of the next generation of networked systems and services that are capable of managing and controlling themselves, and can anticipate their workloads and automatically adjust the configurations of their resources to meet the new loads.  NSF sponsored the second through the fourth Active Middleware Services that were held in conjunction with the IEEE High Performance Distributed Computing Symposiums (HPDC-9 - HPDC-11). These three workshops were very successful, with invited and contributed research papers presented at each workshop. The proceedings of the Second AMS Workshop was published by Kluwer Academic Publishers in 2000 as a book entitled "ACTIVE MIDDLEWARE SERVICES" and edited by Salim Hariri, Craig A. Lee, and Cauligi S. Raghavendra. The Third and Fourth Annual AMS workshop proceedings were published by IEEE Computer Society.  The success of the AMS workshops has motivated the organization of the present workshop which is the fifth workshop in this series . The fifth AMS workshop will focus on the research issues and challenges facing the development of autonomic computing systems that have the capabilities of being self-defining, self-configuring, self-healing, self-optimizing, self-anticipating, being contextually aware of their environments, are and open.</AbstractNarration>
