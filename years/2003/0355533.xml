<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the development of new theory and models for tactical logistics &lt;br/&gt;planning problems under uncertain demand. The core decision problem focus of this &lt;br/&gt;research lies in optimally matching downstream requirements with upstream &lt;br/&gt;resource capabilities in production and logistics systems. The modeling approach &lt;br/&gt;implicitly accounts for an important structural feature of practical logistics systems, &lt;br/&gt;which requires identifying a unique upstream source facility (e.g., plant, warehouse) &lt;br/&gt;for serving each downstream stage (e.g., warehouse, retailer). This pervasive &lt;br/&gt;structure found in production and logistics systems both reduces downstream &lt;br/&gt;ordering and delivery receiving complexity, and decreases the need for upstream &lt;br/&gt;cross-facility coordination. As a result of these medium-term decisions, short-term &lt;br/&gt;operations planning and execution problems decompose into separate subproblems &lt;br/&gt;(one for each upstream facility), which reduces system-wide operations planning &lt;br/&gt;complexity. This research takes an integrated view of optimizing logistics network &lt;br/&gt;performance, where transportation decisions are considered jointly with other &lt;br/&gt;logistics network decisions that drive overall performance, such as production and &lt;br/&gt;inventory storage decisions, while explicitly accounting for demand uncertainty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide an integrated approach for solving tactical logistics planning &lt;br/&gt;problems effectively, thus providing opportunities for streamlining distribution system &lt;br/&gt;costs. In particular, new and effective algorithms will be developed that can solve &lt;br/&gt;medium- to large-size problems to near-optimality with limited computational effort, &lt;br/&gt;and also enjoy a formal performance guarantee. The associated algorithms will be &lt;br/&gt;developed in a general model setting, allowing for specialization to a broad range of &lt;br/&gt;specific problem contexts. In addition, through collaboration with an optimization &lt;br/&gt;software development firm, it will provide a solution methodology that will allow for &lt;br/&gt;the reuse of much of the software developed for one problem in the solution of other &lt;br/&gt;problems, thereby speeding up software development time. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
