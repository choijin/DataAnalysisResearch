    <AbstractNarration>Chromosome cohesion plays a central role in chromosome segregation during both mitosis and meiosis. The REC8/SCC1-like proteins are integral components of the mitotic and meiotic cohesion complexes and appear to be the regulatory point for the release of cohesion. Studies in a variety of organisms indicate that while sister chromatid cohesion is a highly conserved mechanism, important differences exist in cohesion at the centromeres verses chromosome arms, between mitosis and meiosis and across different species. Earlier studies identified four REC8/SCC1-like proteins in Arabidopsis (SYN1-4). One of these proteins, SYN1 is essential for meiosis while SYN2 and SYN4 may participate in mitosis. The fourth Arabidopsis cohesin protein, SYN3, appears to have a novel role in the plant nucleolus. This project involves a number of studies designed to better understand the Arabidopsis cohesin proteins. (1) Immunolocalization experiments and the analysis of mutant plants will be conducted to determine the function(s) of SYN2, SYN3 and SYN4. In particular the role of SYN3 in the nucleolus will be investigated. (2) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies to examine axial element formation in syn1 plants and immuno-TEM studies to examine the distribution of SYN1 on meiotic chromosomes will be conducted to further investigate the role of SYN1 in homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis . (3) Proteins that interact with SYN1 and/or influence its distribution on chromosomes will be identified through yeast two hybrid screens and mutant analysis and their role in chromosome cohesion investigated. Together these studies will provide insight into the specific roles of the Arabidopsis SCC1/REC8-like cohesin proteins in meiosis and mitosis and help fill a void in our understanding of plant cohesin proteins in general. Finally, they will yield new insights into the process of sister chromatid cohesion, different ways organisms control this important process and potentially new roles for the cohesin proteins.</AbstractNarration>
