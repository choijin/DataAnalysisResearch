<AbstractNarration>The proposed research explores the development of a novel, low cost composite material aimed at&lt;br/&gt;the strengthening and upgrading of reinforced and prestressed concrete members. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;composite material intends to maintain and improve on the performance and installation advantages of&lt;br/&gt;FRP systems, while significantly reducing their cost. This new composite material is composed of a&lt;br/&gt;knitted high-strength steel cord impregnated in a polymeric resin matrix and is called SRP, for steel&lt;br/&gt;reinforced polymer. The steel cord, a commodity product used in the radial tire manufacturing industry,&lt;br/&gt;has the strength and stiffness of carbon fiber at a fraction of its cost. To support the development of this&lt;br/&gt;novel, low cost composite material, the research program consists of the following two tasks; (1) Develop&lt;br/&gt;the material constitutive relations, and (2) Conduct experimental and analytical studies that can&lt;br/&gt;substantiate the feasibility of SRP for implementation into the strengthening of RC and PC&lt;br/&gt;structural members. At the conclusion of this research, the SRP composite could be ready for&lt;br/&gt;demonstration in the field. Some of the fundamental issues such as long-term durability would&lt;br/&gt;need further study, but field demonstration will still be warranted at this phase.&lt;br/&gt;This project will also be integrated within a strong education and technology transfer&lt;br/&gt;program, and will involve undergraduate and graduate students in every phase of the project. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, UMR is home to an NSF industry cooperation research center that deals with the&lt;br/&gt;retrofit and repair of bridges and buildings with composites, and potential manufacturers of the&lt;br/&gt;product and a leading concrete repair contractor will be directly involved in this research project&lt;br/&gt;so that all aspects of technology transfer are addressed in a systematic manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
