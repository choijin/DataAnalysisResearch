<AbstractNarration>Global Change and Nitrate Assimilation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere that are associated with&lt;br/&gt;global warming have risen by more than 30 percent during the past two&lt;br/&gt;centuries and are expected to double during the next. Some scientists&lt;br/&gt;believe these rising levels of carbon dioxide will benefit plants because&lt;br/&gt;carbon dioxide is one of the essential ingredients in photosynthesis, the&lt;br/&gt;process by which green plants use sunlight to manufacture the chemical&lt;br/&gt;energy they need. Indeed, many plants initially respond to a doubling of&lt;br/&gt;atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by assimilating 30 percent more carbon&lt;br/&gt;dioxide into carbohydrate. Further study, however, reveals that the&lt;br/&gt;accelerated rate of carbon dioxide assimilation is not sustained: within a&lt;br/&gt;few days or weeks of exposure to elevated carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide&lt;br/&gt;assimilation drops back to just 12 percent greater than normal, a phenomenon&lt;br/&gt;known a carbon dioxide acclimation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bloom and colleagues discovered that carbon dioxide acclimation derives from&lt;br/&gt;nitrogen deprivation because elevated carbon dioxide inhibits the&lt;br/&gt;assimilation of nitrate into amino acids in leaves and nitrate is a major&lt;br/&gt;form of nitrogen that plants obtain from the soil. Three mechanisms appear&lt;br/&gt;to be responsible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, plants place a higher priority on assimilating carbon dioxide than&lt;br/&gt;they do nitrogen, so when carbon dioxide levels rise, some of the high&lt;br/&gt;energy compounds needed to assimilate nitrate are already tied up in&lt;br/&gt;assimilating carbon dioxide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, to make use of nitrate, the plants initially convert nitrate into&lt;br/&gt;nitrite in the cytoplasm and move the nitrite into the chloroplast for&lt;br/&gt;conversion into ammonium and then amino acids. Bloom's research indicated&lt;br/&gt;that elevated levels of carbon dioxide blocked this vital transfer of&lt;br/&gt;nitrite into the chloroplasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Third, under current levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen, most plants lose&lt;br/&gt;about one-quarter of the carbohydrate that they could accumulate from a&lt;br/&gt;process known as photorespiration. This process was thought to be wasteful,&lt;br/&gt;unavoidable consequence of the method that most plants use to generate&lt;br/&gt;carbohydrate. Bloom's latest results show that these plants must&lt;br/&gt;photorespire in order to convert nitrate into amino acids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies suggest that plant and tree species in natural ecosystems that&lt;br/&gt;depend on nitrate conversion into amino acids in their leaves are likely to&lt;br/&gt;be at a competitive disadvantage to those species that are either able to&lt;br/&gt;convert nitrate into amino acids in their roots or use ammonium as their&lt;br/&gt;predominant nitrogen source. As a result the distribution of plants in the&lt;br/&gt;wild may change significantly as atmospheric carbon dioxide levels continue&lt;br/&gt;to rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nitrous oxide is another major greenhouse gas that contributes to global&lt;br/&gt;warming. Bloom and colleagues showed that wheat plants emit a significant&lt;br/&gt;amount of nitrous oxide as part of nitrate assimilation. The form of&lt;br/&gt;nitrogen that a plant uses, therefore, may influence its nitrous oxide&lt;br/&gt;emissions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will determine the interdependence among&lt;br/&gt;photorespiration, carbon dioxide assimilation, nitrous oxide production, and&lt;br/&gt;nitrate assimilation. It will employ Arabidopsis genotypes with altered&lt;br/&gt;capacities to assimilate nitrate and a series of Flaveria species that vary&lt;br/&gt;in their extent of photorespiration. Laboratory and field studies will also&lt;br/&gt;examine the relative importance of ammonium and nitrate as plant nitrogen&lt;br/&gt;sources. Lastly, at a national facility for monitoring the influence of&lt;br/&gt;elevated carbon dioxide on desert flora, experiments will assess in situ the&lt;br/&gt;extent to which carbon dioxide inhibits plant nitrate assimilation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
