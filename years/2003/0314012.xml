<AbstractNarration>EIA-0314012&lt;br/&gt;James Foster&lt;br/&gt;University of Idaho&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Conference Support for GECCO&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funds to support and encourage student participation in the Genetic and&lt;br/&gt;Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO), to be held 12-16 July 2003 in Chicago,&lt;br/&gt;Illinois. Our overall objectives are:&lt;br/&gt;1. Encourage and support student participation at GECCO 2003, targeting&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups and including both undergraduates and graduates&lt;br/&gt;2. Encourage undergraduates to pursue graduate research in genetic and evolutionary&lt;br/&gt;computation&lt;br/&gt;3. Encourage students to pursue academic or industrial careers that research or use genetic&lt;br/&gt;and evolutionary computation&lt;br/&gt;This funding opportunity will be advertised with all conference advertising. This will include&lt;br/&gt;physical mailings, email broadcasts, listsere&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: this proposal will enhance development and dissemination of research in&lt;br/&gt;evolutionary computation by helping students attend a major international meeting to present&lt;br/&gt;their work, attend tutorials and other events, and establish collaborations. Our primary target for&lt;br/&gt;student support is students from underrepresented groups that are presenting peer reviewed&lt;br/&gt;work-specifically, those who are already making a scientific contribution. Evolutionary&lt;br/&gt;computation is still considered an experimental and innovative approach, so this is responsive to&lt;br/&gt;the mission of NSF/EIA. It is also biologically inspired, and events at GECCO 2003, particularly&lt;br/&gt;workshop, tutorials, and one of the technical tracks, will specifically emphasize applications to&lt;br/&gt;bioinformatics problems, so this is responsive to the mission of NSF/DBI as well.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: this proposal funds student participation at a major international meeting, with&lt;br/&gt;an emphasis on underrepresented groups and undergraduates. We will disburse the funds from&lt;br/&gt;this grant to students in the form of registration fees, travel, and housing awards. All funds from&lt;br/&gt;this grant will go to students. Students will be selected for awards by the general chair, the PI of&lt;br/&gt;this proposal. I will give precedence to students who: are presenting a paper that will be&lt;br/&gt;published in the conference proceedings; are self-identified as being from underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;groups; are participating in workshops; are undergraduates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
