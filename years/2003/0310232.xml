<AbstractNarration>The PI will develop a web-based, interactive stereographic projection application, &lt;br/&gt;called TempoNet, which will permit end users to incorporate the time dimension into their structural and tectonic analyses of orientation data.  The design of TempoNet will be based on a prototype that has already been developed as a proof of concept. The prototype is currently used for teaching, but lacks the functionality of the proposed research tool.  TempoNet will be written using a Java-like programming language called Actionscript that is embedded in the Flash web development application from Macromedia.com. Data input will be possible via plain text documents, spreadsheets, HTML documents, and XML documents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will be easy for non-technical geoscientists to use TempoNet, either as a stand-alone&lt;br/&gt;application for both Windows and Macintosh, or with a version 5 or higher web browser&lt;br/&gt;running under Windows 95 / NT / Xp, Mac OS9 / OSX, or Unix (including Linux and Solaris).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Examples of potential research applications include:&lt;br/&gt;(i) Real-time monitoring of neotectonic and geophysical data stored locally, or at any&lt;br/&gt;worldwide web URL;&lt;br/&gt;(ii) Interactive, sequential restoration of paleotectonic data in areas of fault-related tilting and folding;&lt;br/&gt;(iii) Forward modeling of macro- and micro-fabric development during progressive&lt;br/&gt;deformation.&lt;br/&gt;TempoNet will enable an extremely wide range of geoscience teachers and researchers to access information that is available on the web and to view it in a convenient and meaningful format that is updated in real-time.  Practical applications of TempoNet will be tested by a group of undergraduate students using data currently available in-house, as well as web-based data sources. The students will participate in Boston University's Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (www.bu.edu/UROP), a program that encourages minority participation in research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
