<AbstractNarration>This project represents an integrated effort to document the terrestrial&lt;br/&gt;vertebrate biodiversity of the southern borderlands of China, one of the&lt;br/&gt;least well explored regions worldwide. Specialists working with birds,&lt;br/&gt;mammals, reptiles, and amphibians will staff the expeditions, accompanied by&lt;br/&gt;experts with various parasite groups (fleas, flies, ticks, lice, nematodes,&lt;br/&gt;cestodes, blood parasites, coccidia, etc.). The 5 expeditions will each&lt;br/&gt;focus on a different sector of the borderlands region, including the border&lt;br/&gt;areas with Laos, Vietnam, Burma, and northeastern India. Each specialist&lt;br/&gt;will use tools for inventory that are the 'state of the art' in his or her&lt;br/&gt;own field. The end result will be extensive series of specimens and other&lt;br/&gt;new biological material for detailed study, as well as numerous scientific&lt;br/&gt;publications documenting local vertebrate and parasite communities,&lt;br/&gt;taxonomic insights, and new species. Parasite specimens will be collected&lt;br/&gt;and stabilized, with a view towards long-term curation and eventual study.&lt;br/&gt;Project data will be served to the broader scientific community with maximum&lt;br/&gt;efficiency via Internet-based distributed database technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is near-unique in its broad-spectrum assessment of vertebrates&lt;br/&gt;and many groups of parasites. Such a view of vertebrates and the full (or at&lt;br/&gt;least a broad sample of the) diversity of their parasites is available from&lt;br/&gt;few places on Earth, making for a new view into the true biological richness&lt;br/&gt;of an area. In the case of the Chinese southern borderlands, not only will&lt;br/&gt;many of the parasites be unknown to science, but even some or many of the&lt;br/&gt;vertebrate hosts as well. Many new insights into the conservation of&lt;br/&gt;biological diversity will come from such detailed views of the nature of&lt;br/&gt;this diversity. This information will go beyond the quick-and-easy&lt;br/&gt;vertebrate-based conservation priorities that currently dominate&lt;br/&gt;conservation biology to provide a detailed view of the true dimensions of&lt;br/&gt;biological diversity in a complex and little-known region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
