<AbstractNarration>0352838&lt;br/&gt;Biernacki&lt;br/&gt;Description:  This award support travel for ten participants to the US-India Workshop: High Performance Cement Based Concrete Composites, Chennai, December 2004.  The workshop will address the urgency for developing new materials with improved properties to meet the needs of developing countries for expanding their infrastructure and those of advanced countries for maintaining the existing infrastructure.  A committee of academics, co-chaired by Professors Joseph Biernacki, Tennessee Technological University and N. Lakshmanan, Structural Engineering Research Centre (SERC) is organizing this workshop.  Participants will endeavor to improve fundamental understanding of the interactions between complex blends of cement and other cementitious materials, their interactions with chemical admixtures, and the long-term performance and durability of composite materials containing metal and organic fibers.  They will explore the state-of-the-art and establish research priorities that could accelerate the advancement of next generation high-performance composite concrete materials. &lt;br/&gt;Scope:  SERC is a national laboratory under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and has been the leading institution in pursuing advanced research and development activities in the field of structural engineering for nearly four decades.  Studies on structural concrete and concrete composites are a major thrust area for SERC.  The workshop will enhance collaborative activities including joint proposals for research and student and faculty exchange opportunities between the U.S. and India.  NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems are co-funding this activity.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
