<AbstractNarration>Abstract for: Punching Shear Upgrade of Reinforced Concrete Flat Plates- &lt;br/&gt;CMS proposal 0301395&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Oguzhan Bayrak, UT-Austin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existing reinforced concrete slab-column connections may require strengthening to prevent catastrophic punching shear failure and/or to improve the ductility of connections.  Change of the intended use of the structure  and  load  increases  due  to  changing  function,  modification  of  the  structural  system  due  to openings  cut  through  slabs,  partial  loss  of  the  concrete  contribution  to  shear  strength  due  to  cracking, spalling,  and  delamination  of  the  cover  concrete  due  to  corrosion  of  reinforcing  bars  and/or  concrete deterioration  due  to  alkali silica  reaction  and  delayed  ettringite  formation,  compliance  with  the  current building code, and compensation for design errors or construction deficiencies are some of the reasons that might necessitate strengthening of slab-column  connections to prevent punching shear failures.  In addition to the aforementioned reasons, the need to upgrade such slabs in earthquake-prone regions for strength and ductility is also clear.  Examples of punching shear failures have been observed following the 1964 Alaska earthquake, the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, and the 1994  Northridge  earthquake.    Finally,  in  the  wake  of  recent  terrorist  activities,  the  need  to  strengthen various reinforced concrete buildings is also obvious. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to experimentally and analytically investigate the behavior of reinforced  concrete  flat  plates  strengthened  with  fiber  reinforced  polymers  to  enhance  punching  shear strength.  The efficiency of various repair techniques in which fiber reinforced polymers are used in a new and  innovative  manner  will  be  investigated.    Design  guidelines  and  analytical  procedures  will  be developed based on the experimental findings of the research program.  It is well established that the use of stud rail systems in new construction helps increase the punching shear strength and the response to dynamic loads.  However, no established scheme for increasing punching shear strength has been reported in the literature.  Flexibility of fiber reinforced polymers during the application process makes them very suitable for the purpose of establishing .external stirrups through the holes drilled in reinforced concrete &lt;br/&gt;flat plates. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In order to investigate the feasibility of the proposed technique, pilot tests were conducted by one of the PIs. Reinforced concrete slabs tested during this study were scaled laboratory models of typical two-way flat-plate construction.  During the pilot tests it was observed that the failure surface shifted away from the loading plate in all specimens strengthened by the proposed technique, indicating the effectiveness of the method.  Examination of  the  load-deformation  responses  of  the  specimens  indicated  that  punching shear strength of a strengthened specimen increased as much as 50 %, relative to the control specimen, using one of the proposed repair schemes.  For the specimens tested, the punching shear strength could &lt;br/&gt;have been increased further if more transverse reinforcement had been used in an efficient configuration.  Preliminary analyses results suggest that size of the strengthened zone and exact location of vertical FRP strands influence strength, ductility and stress flow pattern in strengthened reinforced concrete flat plates.  In light of the results from the pilot test series and preliminary analyses, the PIs propose to conduct an extensive experimental and analytical program to investigate the efficiency as well as the limitations of the proposed upgrade technique.  Monotonic and reversed cyclic tests will be conducted on twenty-four full-scale test specimens to investigate punching shear behavior of strengthened flat plates.   Behavior of the test specimens will be investigated analytically to identify the most appropriate methods of analysis.  Nonlinear analysis  techniques  will  be  developed  to  capture  the  behavior  more  accurately,  should  the &lt;br/&gt;existing  analysis  techniques  and/or  tools  be  deemed  inadequate.    Analytical models will  likely  evolve over the course of the study as additional test data become available.  As models become more refined, they will be more useful for aiding in the design of future strengthened specimens. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
