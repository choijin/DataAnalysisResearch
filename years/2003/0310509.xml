<AbstractNarration>Engineering Technology (58)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrating computer numeric controlled (CNC) technologies in design education is a rapidly growing curricular field intended to complement the increased use of computer aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) in the architecture and construction industries. This project develops a comprehensive CAD/CAM laboratory in the College of Environmental Design to facilitate undergraduate laboratory based coursework centered on making links among CNC techniques and the design, development and construction of buildings. CAD/CAM effectively blends upstream and downstream processes that are typically compartmentalized, eliminating steps between building design and final production. Because this computerized process streamlines production, it is becoming a pervasive construction technology. This project gives students hands-on laboratory experience with CNC instrumentation, ensuring they keep abreast of current developments in the field, and stay competitive in a global marketplace. The project draws from curricula based on the use of the CAD/CAM lab at the Harvard Design School. Students learn how to use CNC instrumentation and are given experience working through design problems at prototyping and full-scale construction phases. The process allows for increased visualization and accelerated design development. Students gain firsthand knowledge of computer aided building techniques, and are given a unique and invaluable learning experience within the context of more traditional design studios.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
