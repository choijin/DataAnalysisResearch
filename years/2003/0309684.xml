<AbstractNarration> Eichinger&lt;br/&gt;0309684&lt;br/&gt;The working hypothesis of this research is that evaporation at the &lt;br/&gt;earth-atmosphere interface is always maximized, given radiative energy input &lt;br/&gt;in a particular environment. Under the hypothesis, evaporation is uniquely &lt;br/&gt;determined as a result of an optimization exercise in terms of surface &lt;br/&gt;temperature, surface soil moisture and sensible heat flux (a measure of &lt;br/&gt;turbulent transport) given an energy input.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ideas presented here will allow the independent verification of models, &lt;br/&gt;will lead to improved parameterization of surface hydrology and, more &lt;br/&gt;importantly, will provide a framework in which the sensitivity of land &lt;br/&gt;evaporation to changes in radiation, earth surface properties etc. could be &lt;br/&gt;evaluated independently of the traditional empirical models. The research &lt;br/&gt;strategy includes: 1. further theoretical and empirical study to include &lt;br/&gt;the dependence of long wave radiation on surface temperature; 2. show &lt;br/&gt;the lack of sensitivity of evaporation to atmospheric moisture; 3. carry &lt;br/&gt;out field work to test the concepts with more appropriate data sets over bare &lt;br/&gt;soils; 4. investigate the validity of existing evaporation models; 5. initiate the &lt;br/&gt;extension of the concepts to vegetated surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work represents a broad interdisciplinary collaboration between &lt;br/&gt;hydrologists and ecologists with theoretical and experimental expertise. The &lt;br/&gt;work supports unique experimental infrastructure at the University of Iowa. &lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students will have the opportunities to do theoretical and field &lt;br/&gt;work. Several graduate students will get their masters/doctoral degrees based &lt;br/&gt;on their work in this proposal. All students will be encouraged and financed &lt;br/&gt;to present findings in professional meetings. All work will be published in &lt;br/&gt;the refereed literature in a timely manner. This proposal is being submitted &lt;br/&gt;under the umbrella of the new MIT Earth System Initiative. This research and &lt;br/&gt;educational effort is intended to promote the understanding of the ``body &lt;br/&gt;earth'' in order to define the appropriate science to develop sound &lt;br/&gt;sustainability policies. The Principal Investigator is one of the leaders of &lt;br/&gt;this initiative, a member of its executive council, and teaches one of the &lt;br/&gt;require courses under the initiative's freshman core alternative program: &lt;br/&gt;Terrascope.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
