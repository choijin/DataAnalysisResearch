<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks to develop an ADVANCE Leadership Initiative for Minority Female Environmental Faculty (LIMFEF) that is aimed at enhancing the presence and stature of minority female faculty in American academic institutions. The initiative will focus on Black, Hispanic and Native American faculty in environmental departments and schools, and will pursue the following goals in addressing barriers faced by minority women in developing professional careers in academia. &lt;br/&gt;o Conduct a national study to determine the status of female minority environmental faculty, &lt;br/&gt;o Develop a national database with contact information of minority female environmental faculty, &lt;br/&gt;o Develop a clickable e-book of minority female environmental faculty featuring profiles of "pioneers" in the field and "rising stars,"&lt;br/&gt;o Convene a national conference of minority female environmental faculty to discuss the results of the study, network, develop mentoring relationships, and craft leadership strategies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the ADVANCE program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers. Through this program, NSF seeks to support new approaches to improving the climate for women in U.S. academic institutions and to facilitate women's advancement to the highest ranks of academic leadership, thereby broadening participation in the Nation's science and engineering enterprise.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
