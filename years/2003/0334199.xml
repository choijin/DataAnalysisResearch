<AbstractNarration>"Technology-Enhanced Learning in Science (TELS)" is designed to undertake large-scale, collaborative applied research based on technology-enhanced, standards-based curricula materials.  The Accelerator's research projects utilize software tools and simulations embedded in online curriculum-based activities that are designed to teach central topics in introductory science through student inquiry and collaboration. The curricula are being tested in numerous schools that serve diverse student populations using sophisticated online assessment strategies.  Graduate student research studies involve nationwide collaboration with experts in various aspects of their research, utilize a sophisticated technology infrastructure to gather data from large numbers of students anywhere, and incorporate advanced software technologies.  This effort will guide educators and policymakers in the implementation decisions being made daily about technology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The products include useful research results for educational professionals, valuable research experience for graduate students, free proven technology-based materials, and professional development grounded in theory and built on articulated design principles and a curriculum framework.  "The Education Accelerator" uses a collaborative style of research borrowed from the sciences that is essential to progress toward the full use of technology in education.  This approach could well provide a model for other research centers.  TELS provides graduate training for 20 PhD students and 100 Certificate students.  It also provides professional development for 1,000 pre-service students and 500 teachers engaged in Center workshops and on-line courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners include the University of California at Berkeley, the Concord Consortium, Arizona State University, Berkeley Public Schools, Boston University, Cambridge Public Schools, Mills College, Mount Diablo Public Schools, Norfolk State University, North Carolina Central University, Pennsylvania State University, the Technion Institute of Technology, Tempe Public Schools and Maynard Public Schools.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
