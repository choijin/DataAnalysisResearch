<AbstractNarration>Design for blast resistance has been so far considered primarily for military structures. Some &lt;br/&gt;of the design target levels include high-thrust, high-penetration, and high-yield missiles with or &lt;br/&gt;without nuclear capabilities. While designing to these levels leads to conservative and costly &lt;br/&gt;structures if applied to the protection of the public infrastructure, recent events around the world &lt;br/&gt;have  shown  the  vulnerability  of  civilian  infrastructures  to  blasts  of  low-yield  non-nuclear &lt;br/&gt;capabilities. These events have also confirmed the need to develop construction methods that can &lt;br/&gt;safely and economically be implemented in standard design practice.  It can also be shown that &lt;br/&gt;blast-resistant structures are designed with a very different philosophy  than seismic-resistant &lt;br/&gt;structures, and rightfully so, because of the different nature between blast and seismic loads. As &lt;br/&gt;such, new design philosophies are necessary that can overcome this contradiction in requirements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New methodologies are currently needed for the design of structures to simultaneously resist &lt;br/&gt;blast and seismic loads because of recent concerns in homeland security and the new zoning of &lt;br/&gt;the US seismic maps, which have increased seismic demands over a larger area of the US. Under &lt;br/&gt;this scenario there is a lack of professional education in the aforementioned research areas, and &lt;br/&gt;as such universities around the nation must develop courses that can  provide the necessary &lt;br/&gt;expertise in blast and seismic protection of structures, and meet future design  and engineering &lt;br/&gt;needs.  The  professional goals  of  the PI  are  to  develop  research  and educational  initiatives  that &lt;br/&gt;can provide the PI with the necessary tools to; (1) enhance his understanding for simultaneously &lt;br/&gt;designing structures to resist blast and seismic demands, (2) develop collaborative research and &lt;br/&gt;education programs with other engineering centers and private industry, such as the Maneuver &lt;br/&gt;Support Center located in Fort Leonard Wood (MANSCEN) and Douglas Taylor Devices, Inc., &lt;br/&gt;and as importantly (3) recruit graduate students that upon graduation can transition to national &lt;br/&gt;laboratories and engineering firms specializing in the area of homeland security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first CAREER proposal submission the PI has proposed a novel design concept for &lt;br/&gt;the  blast-  and  seismic-resistant  design  of  civil  infrastructures.  However, due  to  the  long-term &lt;br/&gt;costs and time commitments necessary to develop the overall design concept, the main goals of &lt;br/&gt;this Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) are three fold: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o To analytically evaluate the novel design concept at the component level before extensive &lt;br/&gt;experimental and analytical research are carried at the sub-system and global-system level. &lt;br/&gt;o To recruit one master graduate student to assist the PI during this exploratory phase. &lt;br/&gt;o To introduce the design  concept at conferences that deal with blast and seismic issues that &lt;br/&gt;can provide the PI with the necessary feedback on this research initiative. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
