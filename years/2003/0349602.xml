<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Program Phase II project is aimed at the refinement and commercialization of the authentication technology developed during Phase I that enables the deployment of digital Mobile Video Recordings (MVR) system. A very large fleet of patrol vehicles operated by the law enforcement community that record events involving contact with civilians collects MVR data daily. Due to staggering costs associated with operating current analog, non-indexing system, there is an overwhelming needs for a computerized digital MVR technology. However, its deployment is hindered by legal acceptance, because digital medium can be easily altered. Authentication plays a critical enabling role by providing an effective means to safeguard the integrity of MVR content. To capitalize upon this emerging trend of digital MVR, the company proposes as a commercialization strategy to market the innovative technology in a package in an authenticated acquisition system, consisting of a digital video camera and a software suite for on-the-fly video watermarking, off-line MPEG compression and watermark verification. This compact and low-cost acquisition system leverages on existing in-car laptop for processing and storage, and is specifically designed to meet stringent operational requirements set forth by next generation MVR system. It integrates seamlessly with existing IT infrastructure and computerized MVR management systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MVR has provided an effective way of protecting law enforcement agencies, their officers and the public they serve. The MVR authentication provides an enabling technology for the acceptance and deployment of cost-saving computerized MVR technology for the law enforcement community nationwide. It allows for safe elimination of the labor-intensive process associated with safeguarding the integrity of MVR content, because watermarking is done on the fly and there is no time window at which MVR data are ever unprotected. With the deployment of digital MVR system equipped with watermark authentication technology, the costs associated with operating the system will be greatly reduced allowing for the savings to be redeployed to other law enforcement endeavors. Within the next three years a comprehensive national digital facial database will be created to support Homeland Security. As an integral component of the in-car laptop, this technology will serve as the front line in capturing the data for submission to the national database.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
