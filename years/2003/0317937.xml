    <AbstractNarration>Wang&lt;br/&gt; Protein motors convert chemical energy to mechanical work&lt;br/&gt;while operating in an isothermal environment. The molecular&lt;br/&gt;mechanism responsible for the energy transduction is still not&lt;br/&gt;clear. The current experimental technologies permit measuring&lt;br/&gt;forces and motions of a single protein motor to the precision of&lt;br/&gt;piconewtons and nanometers. The main focus of this project is to&lt;br/&gt;uncover the energy transduction mechanism of protein motors from&lt;br/&gt;single molecule experimental data. First, the investigator&lt;br/&gt;develops robust and effective tools for extracting the motor&lt;br/&gt;force profile from the measured time series of motor position.&lt;br/&gt;The motor force profile shows the motor driving force as a&lt;br/&gt;function of motor position. It contains information about the&lt;br/&gt;motor mechanism. The investigator also explores what else besides&lt;br/&gt;the motor force profile can be extracted from the experimental&lt;br/&gt;data. The theoretical and numerical tools developed are useful&lt;br/&gt;for the studies of reaction diffusion processes in general. Then,&lt;br/&gt;the investigator applies the tools developed to study the force&lt;br/&gt;generation mechanism of kinesin and other protein motors.&lt;br/&gt;Throughout the model building, new experiments are suggested to&lt;br/&gt;experimental colleagues to resolve the unsettled issues.&lt;br/&gt; Protein motors play a central role in many cell functions.&lt;br/&gt;For example, myosin drives muscle contraction; kinesin drives&lt;br/&gt;intracellular vesicle transportation and moves chromosomes during&lt;br/&gt;mitosis. Understanding the operating principles of protein motors&lt;br/&gt;is crucial to comprehending how biological systems function. It&lt;br/&gt;is also important to bioengineering applications: controlling&lt;br/&gt;protein motors artificially, incorporating protein motors into&lt;br/&gt;artificial systems, and manufacturing nano-scale artificial&lt;br/&gt;motors. This project seeks to reveal the operating principles of&lt;br/&gt;protein motors from experimental results. In laboratories, the&lt;br/&gt;time course of a single protein motor can be recorded. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator eas develop theoretical tools to recover the motor&lt;br/&gt;force profile from the recorded time courses. Then the force&lt;br/&gt;generation mechanism is investigated.</AbstractNarration>
