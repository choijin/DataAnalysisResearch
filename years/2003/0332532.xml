    <AbstractNarration>0332532&lt;br/&gt;Wasilenko&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to the Eastern Virginia Medical School to support the activity described below for 36 months. The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF-03521).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners&lt;br/&gt;The partners include the Eastern Virginia Medical School (Lead Institution), Hampton University, Bode Technology Group, Hampton Roads Research Partnership, InCell, Incogen, Inc., NuOncology Labs, Inc., Opportunity, Inc., The Virginia Biotechnology Association, and The Center for Innovative Technologies,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project meets the need nationwide for a workforce in biotechnology with expertise in genomics, proteomics, microarrays, and bioinformatics. The overall goal of the effort is to foster innovation in biotechnology through creation of a workforce highly trained in state-of-the-art technologies that support research and development in the biotechnology sector. The program combines didactic and hands-on biotechnology training designed to qualify graduates for employment in a wide variety of fields including biotechnology/pharmaceuticals and forensics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Economic Impact&lt;br/&gt;The new jobs and workers to fill those jobs will make a major impact on the economy of the region in Eastern Virginia. The effort will be self-sustaining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the activity lies in teaching students in the latest state-of-the-art in biotechnology to prepare them for a career in this field that is rapidly advancing to keep pace with the enormous amount of research and development in this field. This effort is based on the complete integration of research and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the activity include development of the human capital that will foster the growing needs of the biotechnology sector. The program provides the infrastructure to integrate research and education to ensure that the workforce is up to date with the latest knowledge, experimental techniques and tools in this rapidly evolving field. Involvement with SBIR companies provides new jobs for the workforce. The program will serve as a model for other regions seeking to promote innovation in biotechnology. Underrepresented groups are involved in the research and workforce development programs.</AbstractNarration>
