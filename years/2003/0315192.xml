<AbstractNarration>Ho #0078853&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our research addresses how people and organizations learn from experience&lt;br/&gt;in strategic situations like bargaining, coordinating joint actions&lt;br/&gt;(teamwork), choosing prices and features for new products, bidding in&lt;br/&gt;auctions, etc.  In previous research we discovered a mathematical formula&lt;br/&gt;which explains how people appear to learn from experience, but the&lt;br/&gt;numerical details of the formula (its "parameters) seem to vary from&lt;br/&gt;situation to situation, as if people are learning in different ways. We&lt;br/&gt;therefore propose to explore why these parameters seem to vary. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, most mathematical theories of strategic learning assume that&lt;br/&gt;people only look back at past experiences. We also propose to extend these&lt;br/&gt;theories to allow for people who realize that other people are learning&lt;br/&gt;from experience, and are able to therefore outguess what others will do&lt;br/&gt;based on what happened in the past. If players are "sophisticated", in&lt;br/&gt;this sense, it pays for them to take actions that are not perfect in the&lt;br/&gt;near-term, to "teach" other players who are learning to take actions which&lt;br/&gt;will benefit the "teachers" in the long-term. This teaching can be&lt;br/&gt;beneficial for the teacher but bad for society (e.g., when firms scare&lt;br/&gt;away innovative competitors by threatening illegal retaliation), or&lt;br/&gt;beneficial for everyone (e.g., when firms reassure others that they can be&lt;br/&gt;trusted). Our research develops a precise mathematical theory of how&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated players behave and when it pays for them to teach.  We use&lt;br/&gt;the theory to explain observations from experiments and predicts whether&lt;br/&gt;teaching will occur in new situations. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
