<AbstractNarration>Dynamical systems approaches have been quite useful in describing and explaining human behavior. This project studies two such theories--the catastrophe theory of attitudes, which predicts that the degree and type of individual attitude change will differ depending on issue involvement, and dynamic social impact theory, which describes how individual social influence will lead to group level self-organization of opinion. Each theory has been empirically supported and is useful in describing either individual or group attitudes. However, the catastrophe theory of attitudes does not address how individual change affects group outcomes, and dynamic social impact theory does not predict how various types of attitudes (e.g., those differing in involvement level) will change or what effects different types of change (e.g., linear vs. nonlinear) will have for the group. The researchers will conduct a pilot study, using computer simulations and experiments to see if an integration of these two theories that predicts attitude change at the individual and group level is possible.  Laboratory experiments and computer simulations will be used to assess communication in electronic groups for issues at varying levels of involvement (primarily operationalized as personal importance. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt; These studies and the resulting theoretical integration will help us to better understand, predict, and possibly even manage changes in public opinion at various levels of analysis. Overall, the studies will provide valuable information for those interested in interpersonal phenomena, ranging from attitudes to small groups to culture. The studies will also provide research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, at the University of Northern Iowa and the University of Wyoming. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
