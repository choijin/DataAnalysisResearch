<AbstractNarration>This CAREER development plan seeks to achieve fundamental understanding of novel nanostructure and morphology in supramolecular columnar liquid crystals (LCs) with immiscible polymer side chains, and to manipulate spontaneous curvature in a microphase-separated single LC column on nanometer length scales. Rational material design and precise engineering of the spontaneous self-assembly of the supramolecular columnar LCs have become increasingly important in the development of a new generation of nanomaterials for nanotechnology. In order to achieve these goals, specific objectives are proposed. (1) Design and synthesize novel non-mesogenic molecules with an amide core and multiple immiscible polymer side chains at each end. (2) Understand the columnar LC phases determined by the interrelationship and interdependence between hierarchical intermolecular interactions, such as liquid crystal formation and microphase separation, on different length scales. (3) Achieve novel helical coil morphology in single LC nanofiber using the principle of spontaneous curvature. The spontaneous curvature will be systematically investigated based upon the effects from molecular weight and selective&lt;br/&gt;solvent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific merits of this proposal are several. First, attaching immiscible polymer side chains&lt;br/&gt;onto supramolecular columnar liquid crystals generates a new type of LC material. The new LC&lt;br/&gt;polymers will bridge the gap in our understanding of structure-property relationship between small molecules and polymers. Second, the unique physical property of intra-columnar microphase separation will induce novel helical coil morphology in self-assembled columnar LCs, which may mimic the coiling instability in bio-related lipid tubules. Third, the proposed helical morphology may have potential technological applications such as environment-responsive nanoactuators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve broader impact, an integrated research and education plan is proposed to combine&lt;br/&gt;outreach to local high school teachers and students with the development of novel polymer&lt;br/&gt;nanotechnology component in a graduate course on Polymer Structure and Morphology. First, such an effort is going to improve the local community's awareness of technologically important polymer nanomaterials, while creating substantive ties to high school teachers and underrepresented young students who otherwise would have no exposure to polymer concepts and applications. The planned outreach effort will feature two major components: education and research. In the education part, the PI will collaborate with local high school science teachers to develop a new curriculum for underrepresented students to learn basic science and engineering concepts related to everyday polymeric materials. Regular visits to the local high school are planned with well-designed polymer experiments and projects to stimulate student interest in science and engineering. In the research program, the PI will initiate a summer internship for high school teachers and students to team with polymer research faculty to develop hands-on laboratory experiments in polymer morphology research for the use in high school classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;The polymer nanostructure and morphology course will help bridge the existing gap between different levels of research and education in polymer nanotechnology. The research results will be widely disseminated through publications in scientific journals, presentations at national meetings, and collaborations with industries.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
