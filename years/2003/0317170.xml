<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research involves the bottom-up fabrication of mechanically interlocked polymers starting with a preorganization step, where monomers are brought together by noncovalent forces, followed by a "fixing" step that links the monomers covalently or covalently and mechanically, to form the polymers.  The construction of both the supramolecular and mechanically interlocked polymers depends on the hydrogen bonding and other interactions that occur between a secondary dialkylammonium ion center and a crown ether with at least [24] crown-8 constitution to bring the recognition units together in an interpenetrating manner. Both photochemistry and dynamic covalent chemistry will be used to assist in the formation of the interlocked polymers.  The use of reversible bond formation in the polymerization step will allow for the production of the most thermodynamically stable polymer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. J. Fraser Stoddart of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California-Los Angeles.   Dr. Stoddart will focus his work on using noncovalent synthesis to create supramolecular polymers and employ supramolecular assistance to covalent synthesis to construct mechanically interlocked polymers.  In a broader sense, understanding the formation of these polymers will lead to the development of new and unique polymeric materials and will give insight into the fabrication of nanoscale materials containing dynamic covalent and mechanical bonds.  The project also provides an excellent venue for the interdisciplinary training of undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
