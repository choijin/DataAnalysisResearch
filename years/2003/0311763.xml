<AbstractNarration>The PI proposes a development of effective and accurate algorithms for &lt;br/&gt;simulation of electromagnetic and acoustic wave scattering processes. &lt;br/&gt;The project includes the development of efficient, error-controllable &lt;br/&gt;schemes based on asymptotic expansions and on direct discretizations. &lt;br/&gt;While the computational emphasis will be on efficiency, &lt;br/&gt;error-controllability will demand careful mathematical analysis; both &lt;br/&gt;requirements will call for a number of intellectual innovations. Among the &lt;br/&gt;methods based on asymptotic expansions, the PI proposes to: (i) further &lt;br/&gt;advance his work on high-order geometric perturbation methods. Here, &lt;br/&gt;effort will concentrate on the design of alternative schemes with improved &lt;br/&gt;stability properties; and (ii) the search for an innovative (rigorous) &lt;br/&gt;high-frequency (integral-equation) solver for scattering by surfaces and &lt;br/&gt;bounded bodies that exhibits the advantages of asymptotic high-frequency &lt;br/&gt;treatments (i.e. a frequency-independent number of degrees of freedom) &lt;br/&gt;while allowing for error control at any fixed, finite frequency. A &lt;br/&gt;combination of the developments in (i) and (ii) will also be sought in the &lt;br/&gt;design of a "multi-scale" algorithm. The program on direct methods, on the &lt;br/&gt;other hand, shall be concerned with the development of algorithms for the &lt;br/&gt;treatment of penetrable bodies. For this, it is proposed to develop (iii) &lt;br/&gt;accelerated high-order methods for (volumetric) integral equations; &lt;br/&gt;novelties in the proposed approach include the design of specialized &lt;br/&gt;high-order quadrature rules for volume potentials, and their incorporation &lt;br/&gt;into a general strategy for their fast evaluation, based on (planar arrays &lt;br/&gt;of) "equivalent sources". Finally, the proposal presents a project on (iv) &lt;br/&gt;certain specific aspects of (Runge-Kutta) discontinuous Galerkin finite &lt;br/&gt;element approaches, including the implementation of exact radiation &lt;br/&gt;conditions, the design of optimal inter-element fluxes and &lt;br/&gt;time-integration strategies, and the derivation of a-posteriori error &lt;br/&gt;estimates for adaptive error control. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electromagnetic and acoustic devices are ubiquitous in present day &lt;br/&gt;technology. Indeed, electromagnetism and acoustics have found and continue &lt;br/&gt;to find applications in a wide array of areas, encompassing both civilian &lt;br/&gt;and military purposes. Among the former, applications of current interest &lt;br/&gt;include those related to communications (e.g. transmission through optical &lt;br/&gt;fiber lines), to biomedical devices and health (e.g. ultrasound, &lt;br/&gt;tomography, power-line safety, etc), to circuit or magnetic storage design &lt;br/&gt;(electromagnetic compatibility, hard disc operation), to geophysical &lt;br/&gt;prospecting, and to non-destructive evaluation (e.g. crack detection), to &lt;br/&gt;name but just a few.  Applications in defense, on the other hand, include &lt;br/&gt;the design of military hardware with decreased signatures ("virtual &lt;br/&gt;prototyping");  automatic target recognition (e.g. bunkers, mines and &lt;br/&gt;buried ordnance, etc); propagation effects on communications and radar &lt;br/&gt;systems (e.g. over complex terrains, through the atmosphere, etc); &lt;br/&gt;tactical antenna design; etc.  Although the principles of acoustic and &lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic wave propagation are well understood, their application to &lt;br/&gt;practical configurations of current interest, such as those that arise in &lt;br/&gt;connection with the examples above, is significantly complicated and far &lt;br/&gt;beyond manual calculation in all but the simplest aspects. These &lt;br/&gt;complications typically arise from geometrical and/or compositional &lt;br/&gt;complexity in the underlying structures, from the intricacies of the &lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic fields, or from both. The significant advances in computer &lt;br/&gt;modeling of acoustic and electromagnetic wave interactions that have taken &lt;br/&gt;place over the last two decades, on the other hand, have made it possible &lt;br/&gt;to shift the classical "trial and error" design paradigm for devices that &lt;br/&gt;work on such interactions to one that heavily relies on computer &lt;br/&gt;simulation. Still, the sheer complexity of some applications of current &lt;br/&gt;interest and the ever-increasing industrial demand for faster and more &lt;br/&gt;reliable software, present significant challenges to state-of-the-art &lt;br/&gt;numerical solvers. This proposal is focused on the design and testing of &lt;br/&gt;improved algorithms that, based on sophisticated mathematical techniques &lt;br/&gt;and developments, will result in implementations that will substantially &lt;br/&gt;expand on the capabilities of presently available simulators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
