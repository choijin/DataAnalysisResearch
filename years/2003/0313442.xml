    <AbstractNarration>This grant will support the attendance of graduate students and young principal investigators at the 18th North American Meeting of the Catalysis Society to be held June 1-7, 2003 in Cancun, Mexico. The meetings of the Catalysis Society are held biannually and are the premier events for catalysis researchers in North America and throughout the world. Symposium topics include recent advances in environmental catalysis and green chemistry, hydrotreating and heavy crude upgrading, catalysis by nanoparticles and nanostructures, metal and oxides, acid-base catalysis, homogeneous catalysis and single site polymerization, fuel cells, catalysis in organic synthesis, combinatorial catalysis, catalysts deactivation and reaction engineering, computational catalysis, biocatalysis, advances in catalyst preparation and characterization, and industrial catalysis. The objective of this proposal is to defray meeting attendance costs, especially for graduate students and young investigators. With co-funding from other sources, support for about 60 participants will be provided. Special emphasis will be placed on including a diverse group of young researchers in the awards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will involve exchanges of scientific information by nearly 800-1000 investigators and 80-100 graduate students. Students will benefit tremendously from the experience, and this grant will enable a diverse group of students to attend, including women and minorities from varied geographical locations in the United States. The poster presentations and informal interactions permit students and young investigators to gain a much broader perspective of catalysis research and the importance of their own contributions.</AbstractNarration>
