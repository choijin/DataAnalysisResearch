<AbstractNarration>The American Association of Engineering Society (AAES) proposes to convene anaction-focused summit on diversity in engineering to be held on April 2-3, 2003.  The event will be hosted be the NAE in Washington, DC, with lead financial support from the GE Fund and Intel Corporation.  Engineering societies, whether or not they are members of AAES, are invited to send the appropriate volunteer and staff person who are leading the organization's diversity programs to participate in the summit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some engineering societies have a long history of involvement in efforts to increase the participants of women and minorities in engineering, while others have begun to address these issues more recently.  The April meeting is designed to help engineering societies increase the impact of existing programs and identify new ways to strengthen the engineering profession through increased diversity.  Participants will be asked to develop specific action plan for their organizations as well as collaborative activities.  Prior to the April meeting, AAES will collect information from the invited organizations on their current diversity policies, programs, and activities.  A second meeting in the summer of 2003 will finalize plans for follow-up activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides $15,000 to AAES to support travel for 19 engineering society volunteer leaders to participate in the diversity summit.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
