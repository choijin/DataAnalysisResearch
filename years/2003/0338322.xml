<AbstractNarration>Title: GK-12 Program in Mathematics &lt;br/&gt;Fellows: 10-15&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Washington &lt;br/&gt;NSF discipline: Math&lt;br/&gt;PI: Loyce Adams &lt;br/&gt;District Partners: Northshore &amp; Seattle&lt;br/&gt;Co-PIs: Lillian McDermott, Virginia Warfield &lt;br/&gt;Non-profit Partner: University Child Development School (UCDS)&lt;br/&gt;Audience: Northshore: 5-9 (Suburban-Rural) Seattle: K-5 (Urban)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project continues and expands the GK-12 Program in Mathematics at the University of Washington by leveraging several existing K-12 outreach programs to help increase the subject-matter understanding of pre-college mathematics teachers and their students while increasing the Fellows' understanding of teaching and learning. Ten to fifteen graduate students are placed in local elementary and junior high school math classrooms. Fellows receive initial preparation in instructional methods of inquiry-based mathematics by McDermott (co-PI) and the Physics Education Group followed by Developing Mathematical Ideas sessions to analyze student thinking directed by Warfield, Co-PI of the Expanding a Community of Mathematics Learners, a local systemic change project. Fellows work with classroom teachers in a weeklong summer math workshop taught by our UCDS partners and returning GK-12 Fellows.  They observe the inquiry-method in actual UCDS math classrooms, debrief bi-weekly as a cohort, and receive follow-up mentoring by the faculty. The Track-2 award investigates whether the current GK-12 model is replicable and sustainable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Washington's approach to GK-12 is novel in many ways. They have a dedicated team that includes practicing teachers who provide a teacher-to-teacher mentorship that complements the fellow-to-teacher relationship. This feature also allows for more fellow mentoring in the areas of classroom management and pedagogy. They also provide the fellow an opportunity to see how children develop their mathematical thinking from the elementary to the middle school years by placing them with both elementary and junior high teachers in a learning community.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact and Example of Outcomes from Prior Projects:  Well-prepared fellows that are placed in public school classrooms will be more inclined to understand the issues in math achievement and know how to become productively involved in K-12 after leaving the University. For example, one of their graduating fellows this year has accepted a tenure-track job at a University where he plans to set up a similar outreach program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is partially supported by the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
