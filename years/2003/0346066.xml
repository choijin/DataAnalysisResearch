    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports work by Professor Veronika A. Szalai at the University of Maryland Baltimore County to test the hypothesis that DNA condensation affects the rates and yields of one-electron guanine oxidation. To determine whether reaction rates are affected by DNA packing, the one-electron oxidation of guanine by ruthenium(III) polypyridyl complexes will be monitored using a model system in which DNA has been artificially condensed in reverse micelles. Comparison of the rates and yields of guanine radical formation in the reverse micelle model system to those determined in dilute solution will reveal how the oxidative chemistry occurring in dilute solution compares to that sustained by condensed DNA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oxidative damage to DNA is a process important in production of cancerous cells and aging. This project provides cross-disciplinary training in physical, inorganic, and biochemistry to students involved in fundamental research on this process and discoveries from this research will be incorporated into courses taught by the principal investigator. This project will couple with ongoing efforts at UMBC to increase minority participation in science through the Meyerhoff Undergraduate and Graduate Fellowship Programs, NIH-Minority Access to Research Careers Program, Women in Science and Engineering, and an NSF-ADVANCE grant.</AbstractNarration>
