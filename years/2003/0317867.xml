    <AbstractNarration>Decision making in public policy as well as commercial settings is often&lt;br/&gt;complicated by disagreement among experts regarding estimates,&lt;br/&gt;forecasts, and even the nature of the problem under discussion.&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, it is often necessary to make a decision in the face of such&lt;br/&gt;disagreements; collecting the required "hard evidence" may simply be&lt;br/&gt;infeasible within a reasonable period of time. Thus, it is important to&lt;br/&gt;find ways to use the valuable knowledge that experts possess. Expert&lt;br/&gt;knowledge often is best characterized as "opinions" that can be&lt;br/&gt;expressed as probability judgments, the expert's assessment of the&lt;br/&gt;chance that something is true. Typical public-policy settings where&lt;br/&gt;expert probability judgments are used include energy (especially nuclear&lt;br/&gt;power and engineering), military, intelligence and security, environment&lt;br/&gt;and health policy, and economic forecasting. In commercial settings,&lt;br/&gt;expert judgments play large roles in overall strategic decision making&lt;br/&gt;and situations such as oil and gas exploration and pharmaceutical&lt;br/&gt;research and development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No simple answer exists for improving experts' probability judgments.&lt;br/&gt;Psychological research has documented many ways in which such judgments&lt;br/&gt;are biased. Because different psychological processes may be at work in&lt;br/&gt;different situations, methods to counteract the corresponding biases&lt;br/&gt;must be adapted to the specific situation. The proposed research offers&lt;br/&gt;three practical methods for improving experts' probabilities. All three&lt;br/&gt;methods are grounded in psychological theory and are designed to be&lt;br/&gt;applicable to a variety of probability-assessment situations. Each&lt;br/&gt;method will be subjected to rigorous evaluation to demonstrate its&lt;br/&gt;effectiveness. The three methods further provide models for how a&lt;br/&gt;scientist can use psychological results and theory for developing&lt;br/&gt;additional adjustment methods for improving expert probabilities.</AbstractNarration>
