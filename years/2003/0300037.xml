<AbstractNarration>Recent advances in engineering design have generated a variety of large-scale systems that offer tremendous economic benefits. Many of these systems are composed of multiple individual units, which directly interact with their neighbors. Examples include micro electro-mechanical sensor and actuator arrays, electric power grid, and closely coupled aircraft formation flight. Several limiting factors in designing effective distributed control algorithms for large-scale dynamically-interconnected systems include: (a) the complexity associated with high state dimensions and large numbers of inputs and outputs; (b) the interaction between subsystems through both dynamic coupling and communication; (c) heterogeneity and modeling uncertainty at subsystem level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The strong connection among communication, control and computation has become increasingly important, as the systems grow in complexity and more powerful tools are made available in computing and communications. This project seeks to exploit these connections and develop distributed control techniques for large-scale, dynamically interconnected systems by synthesizing ideas from control theory and optimization techniques. Specifically, game theory will provide a general approach to exploit dynamic interaction between subsystems, and advance control design in the distributed game framework. The distributed control strategy will provide interconnected systems with simplified control implementation and improved system reliability. Moreover, significant performance improvement will be achieved by applying on-line optimizations to such complex systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other engineering systems on which the proposed research will have a significant impact include distributed operation of object transportation and manipulation using sensor and actuator arrays, telecommunication network flow, and power distribution over large-scale electric network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of innovative educational approach will enhance North Carolina State University educational program by providing undergraduates and graduate students valuable research experience and hands-on practical skills. The developed toolbox on large-scale system analysis, distributed control design, and simulation will serve as a vehicle to disseminate the research outcome to control community, and facilitate technology transfer to industrial practitioners.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
