<AbstractNarration>Wireless sensor networks promise a revolution in information technology, by providing a high-resolution interface between the physical and virtual worlds. This research project aims to create a mathematical foundation for analyzing and designing data gathering protocols in these systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops mathematical models of sensor network applications, environmental conditions, and protocol parameters, in order to quantify and bound the performance of protocols with respect to key metrics such as energy efficiency and response latency. It complements other ongoing efforts in the research community to design and evaluate these protocols via simulations and experimental studies. The mathematical models of protocols developed in this project will provide wireless sensor network designers with practical guidelines and insights on selecting and optimizing protocols for different applications, and making them adaptive. Fundamental performance bounds will reveal whether there is room for improvement, and in some cases even suggest new efficient protocol designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is being carried out in close collaboration with wireless sensor network systems and applications researchers in academia and industry, to ensure that the analysis is informed by and has a significant impact on the design of real-world systems. Such wireless sensor networks are envisioned to be used in domains ranging widely from environmental, industrial and structural monitoring to security applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is tightly coupled with an educational program that includes integration of the research activities into the undergraduate graduate networks curriculum at the University of Southern California, as well as outreach to public high school students in Los Angeles.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
