<AbstractNarration>This project is designed to position students competitively for multiple career paths, including information technology and engineering.  IMMEX problem solving engages students in scientific inquiry where students frame problems from a descriptive scenario, distinguish relevant from irrelevant information, plan a search strategy, gather information, and reach a decision that demonstrates understanding.  These simulations integrate standards-based curricular content and technological issues commonly encountered in careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  The "IMMEX-Fayette Consortium" is a comprehensive project for students and teachers providing students in grades 7-12 a solid foundation in science and mathematics.  This is a community-integrated model in which teams of teachers, students, business partners and higher education faculty construct interactive, problem-solving simulations.  Summer technology institutes for teachers and students are followed by integration of technology and IMMEX problem solving during the school year.  Business partners conduct presentations to provide students with real-world applications of science and mathematics.  To foster continued involvement in STEM-related careers, a student fellowship program is an integral part of the program in grades 12-14.  Students interested in technology careers and who demonstrate proficiency in problem solving get to explore their interests further through internships with business partners during their senior years and first two years of college.</AbstractNarration>
