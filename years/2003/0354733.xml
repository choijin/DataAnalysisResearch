<AbstractNarration>Motivated by the increasing challenge of developing commercially successful and environmentally conscious products, US industry is taking simulation-based design to new levels that are far beyond the power of today's computers. As a result, the critical need to comprehensively explore the set of options in design space is severely compromised. The resulting consequences are: less economically competitive and less environmentally conscious products.  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project proposes to explore a radical new idea that may literally collapse (by at least an order-of-magnitude) the computational explosion that characterizes the modeling of complex systems. In particular, this project will explore the puzzling notion that it is possible to obtain more accuracy and radically more design space exploration capability by actually radically reducing the computation effort. The risk involves adequately demonstrating the feasibility of the approach, providing evidence that it can lead to an improvement in establishing optimal parameters in design space with a reduction in computational resources.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will result in a counterintuitive paradigm shift that will make it possible to identify highly competitive products and systems that are well beyond today's state of the art. An intensive dissemination plan will allow the research findings to reach the broader research and industry communities. The ultimate result of this effort is consumer products of vastly higher economic, environmental, and engineering performance.</AbstractNarration>
