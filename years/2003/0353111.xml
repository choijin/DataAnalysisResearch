<AbstractNarration>This project studies  gravitational wave source modeling and data analysis relevant primarily to systems of compact stellar objects. The main goal is to provide the theoretical basis necessary for (i) the understanding and interpretation of current and future gravitational wave observations and (ii) the development of efficient gravitational wave data analysis methods that will facilitate the derivation of physical constraints on the properties of the astrophysical sources. More specifically the proposed work focuses on the: (i) construction of theoretical models for both specific observed systems and whole populations of compact objects, (ii) development of statistical tools for the interpretation of observations and the derivation of constraints on the theoretical models, and (iii) exploration of innovative data analysis methods for the most efficient use of future gravitational wave data with focus on physical parameter estimation; the latter is crucial for the development of gravitational wave interpretation and phenomenology. Some of the basic underlying physical principles of this research will be used in the development of public outreach activities which will benefit from and build upon the long-standing connection between Northwestern U. and the Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum. The plan includes the development of content for computer-based, interactive museum exhibits with the goal to disseminate the research results to the public and enhance their interest in compact stellar systems and gravitationalwave physics. The project will involve both graduate and undergraduate students (especially those from underrepresented groups).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activity focuses on a number of questions the answers to which are important for the interpretation of current and future gravitational wave observations with LIGO and other ground-based detectors. The next few years are very important for the development of gravitational wave physics and interpretation and this research focuses on ways of maximizing the gain from future detections, but also will use observed upper limits to constrain current theories of compact object formation.</AbstractNarration>
