<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Washington College under the direction of Dr. Martin Connaughton to provide behavioral tracking equipment and experimental facilities/environmental control systems to support student research and research training in fish acoustic behavior.  Communication is the fundamental mechanism underlying inter-organisms behaviors.  However, in animal communication there is a paucity of data identifying which components of a signal are important in determining the response behavior of the recipient.  In particular, information is lacking on the functional relationship between acoustic signals and behavior in fishes.  This is important as many species of fish rely on acoustic signals for courtship and mating.  The goal of this work is to determine which acoustic signal components elicit or modify startle and courtship behaviors in a species of sound producing fish.  This grant will compliment this research by providing the behavioral monitoring hardware and software, experimental facilities and environmental control systems required for the study.  Fundamental similarities in auditory processing suggest the possibility of similar encoding of behaviorally relevant information in fishes and higher vertebrates.  As such, an understanding of signal coding garnered from the simple communication system in this study could be applied to signal evolution in more complex forms of acoustic communication in higher vertebrates.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance of this proposal includes enhancing the scientific environment at Washington College, a small liberal arts college dedicated to providing its students with research and research training opportunities.  Provision of the state-of-the-art behavioral tracking system and environmental support instrumentation proposed in this grant would expose student researchers to advanced, computer-based techniques for studying behavior and communication.  This instrumentation will also be used to introduce students in marine biology and ichthyology courses to cutting-edge research methods and experimental design through hands-on laboratory exercises.  A collaboration with a local USDA aquatic pathology lab will be forged with this instrumentation, broadening the opportunities for student training on and off campus.  The scientific importance of the proposed work lies in advancing the understanding of which signal components elicit or modify startle and courtship behaviors in this species.  Findings from this study are potentially applicable to studies of acoustic communication in higher vertebrates.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
