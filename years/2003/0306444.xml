    <AbstractNarration>This collaborative effort addresses two closure problems arising&lt;br/&gt;in fluid systems: the description of turbulent energy transfer&lt;br/&gt;through a large number of wave modes, and the determination of the&lt;br/&gt;amount of mixing at internal breaking waves in a stratified&lt;br/&gt;environment. The methodology proposed includes the asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;reduction of complex partial differential equations to simpler&lt;br/&gt;systems, the numerical simulation of dynamic equations, the&lt;br/&gt;critical analysis of physical principles, and the comparison of&lt;br/&gt;theory and computations with physical laboratory experiments. We&lt;br/&gt;anticipate that the work will yield both physical insights and&lt;br/&gt;interesting new mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turbulent energy transfer, dissipation and mixing are key&lt;br/&gt;processes in fluid dynamical problems ranging from the wind&lt;br/&gt;generation of water waves to climate dynamics. In the ocean, for&lt;br/&gt;example, wind driven ocean waves leads to ocean mixing, ultimately&lt;br/&gt;determining the sea--surface temperature, which, in turn, affects&lt;br/&gt;atmospheric winds, temperature and humidity. Turbulent wave action&lt;br/&gt;is responsible for the transfer of energy between the very large&lt;br/&gt;scales of storms and the small scales of wind ripples at which&lt;br/&gt;dissipation takes place. In an atmospheric example, mixing by&lt;br/&gt;upward propagating breaking waves plays a significant role in the&lt;br/&gt;dynamical coupling between the lower and the upper layers of the&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere. The research proposed here will contribute to the&lt;br/&gt;understanding of fundamental physical mechanisms behind these&lt;br/&gt;important phenomena, and hence improve our capability to predict&lt;br/&gt;and quantify climate changes. The proposal will also have a strong&lt;br/&gt;educational impact, through the training of graduate students, the&lt;br/&gt;development of a research seminar for undergraduate students, the&lt;br/&gt;teaching of challenging undergraduate classes, and by having&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students participate in summer projects focused on&lt;br/&gt;the research.</AbstractNarration>
