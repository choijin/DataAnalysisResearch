<AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)  The primary goal of this project is to enhance the Forensic Chemistry curriculum at Buffalo State College by including  activities that are developing student  knowledge of crime scene processing, evidence handling, and scientific analysis of evidentiary material using state-of-the-art methodologies and equipment. To achieve this objective, the laboratory and field  experiences presented at the 2002 NSF Summer Workshop in Forensic Sciences (Williams College project) are being adapted and implemented as a  project-based laboratory experience in CHE 414, Forensic Chemistry Laboratory. To fully realize the stated goal, two vital pieces of equipment, a GC-MS and an FTIR (with microscope), are being integrated into the course. These instruments are arguably two of the most important pieces of equipment found in today's crime laboratories. The anticipated student outcomes of the project include: (1) graduates who are better prepared for their careers as forensic scientists and chemists, (2) enhanced student understanding of the fundamental theories, applications, and operation of GC-MS and FTIR instrumentation, and (3) increased student interest in ongoing faculty-student research projects. Locally, the availability of the instruments is improving the infrastructure for education and research in Chemistry and  related fields. The project also is raising awareness of Forensic Chemistry among faculty at Buffalo State, and regionally among prospective students and science educators. National dissemination of the results will aid educators who wish to employ Forensic experiments in science laboratories. Finally, the project prepares students to serve as well-trained Forensic Scientists in crime laboratories.</AbstractNarration>
