<AbstractNarration>This CAREER project addresses fundamental materials science issues to advance understanding of spin polarized electron transport through materials and material interfaces at an atomic level. Semiconductor devices which utilize the spin of the electron will have potential to achieve higher speeds, with lower power consumption than conventional devices. The objectives of this research are to understand the role of temperature, materials, and material interface properties on both spin-flip and spin-dependent scattering. The ultimate goal is to develop a knowledge base that enables the development of high efficiency spin injection and detection methods for semiconduc-tor based spintronic devices. The approach utilizes two scanning tunneling microscopy based techniques for quantification and tagging of defect type to assess scattering mechanisms with atomic resolution. In situ molecular beam epitaxy will be utilized for material synthesis and inter-face preparation. &lt;br/&gt;%%%  &lt;br/&gt;The project addresses fundamental research issues in electronic materials science having technological relevance. This research will be conducted in tandem with a strong educational component that develops an integrated lecture laboratory course, which utilizes a wireless audi-ence response system to immediately ascertain student comprehension. The response system will allow every student to participate and communicate with the instructor in a private manner. In addition, the research project will provide opportunities for students to work with state-of-the-art scientific equipment in a hands-on manner for both graduate and undergraduate studies as well as augmenting the University at Albany's outreach programs with local K-12 schools.&lt;br/&gt;***   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
