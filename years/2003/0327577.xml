<AbstractNarration>The primary objectives of this investigation include &lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary studies of tectonically driven spatio-temporal &lt;br/&gt;signals resulting from complex geophysical processes.  These &lt;br/&gt;processes include convergent plate  boundaries, earthquake &lt;br/&gt;deformation cycle, mantle convection, intra-plate deformations and &lt;br/&gt;Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA).  At present, these processes &lt;br/&gt;generate small but measurable signals in the form of surface &lt;br/&gt;deformations, which at present can only be detected over land by &lt;br/&gt;either point measurements using GPS, or on small spatial scales (&lt;100 &lt;br/&gt;km) using InSAR.  These "slow deformation" signals have spatial &lt;br/&gt;scales longer than hundreds of km to continental and planetary &lt;br/&gt;scales, and temporal scales of a year to decades, and millennia.  The &lt;br/&gt;Earth's gravity field and its spatio-temporal variations, providing &lt;br/&gt;insight on the integrated mass redistributions within the Earth's &lt;br/&gt;systems, represent a unique fundamental measurable quantity to &lt;br/&gt;directly study mechanisms which drive these complex processes with &lt;br/&gt;many degrees of freedom.  For the first time ever, dedicated &lt;br/&gt;satellite gravity missions like CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE are anticipated &lt;br/&gt;to measure these small, broad-scale tectonically driven signals in &lt;br/&gt;the form of integrated mass change and vertical deformations. &lt;br/&gt;However, the contemporary mathematical functions to represent the &lt;br/&gt;geopotential are conventionally spherical harmonics which do not &lt;br/&gt;allow spatial localization.  3-D wavelets have notable advantages &lt;br/&gt;over spherical harmonics, e.g. for multi-resolution representation &lt;br/&gt;and localization, however, would have to satisfy the so-called &lt;br/&gt;"boundary-value problem". The overarching scientific goal is to &lt;br/&gt;develop multi-resolution based 3-D wavelet tools to enhance the &lt;br/&gt;tectonically driven spatio-temporal gravity signals for improved &lt;br/&gt;analyses and to make progress towards addressing the major open &lt;br/&gt;scientific questions of understanding the driving mechanisms of these &lt;br/&gt;"slow deformation" over land, ocean and ice-covered surfaces.  The &lt;br/&gt;investigators propose to develop mathematical tools based on two &lt;br/&gt;wavelet approaches: (1) the rotational invariant spherical wavelet &lt;br/&gt;function, and (2) the non-separable compactly supported &lt;br/&gt;tensor-product wavelets to represent the spatio-temporal gravity &lt;br/&gt;field signals and perform geophysical "inversions" to enhance the &lt;br/&gt;signals.  The "inversion" of these gravity signals represents &lt;br/&gt;stringent mathematical and numerical challenges, especially in light &lt;br/&gt;of the need for multi-resolution representation to enhance localized &lt;br/&gt;signals and to consider extending wavelets to include the time &lt;br/&gt;dimension.  The broader impacts and anticipated results include the &lt;br/&gt;development of 3-D wavelet tools capable of solving the boundary &lt;br/&gt;value problem and inversion of gravity signals using satellite data &lt;br/&gt;and to demonstrate and apply the technique in the Nazca and South &lt;br/&gt;American plate region.  The developed mathematical tools are intended &lt;br/&gt;to be among the first steps to "popularize" the use of 3-D wavelets &lt;br/&gt;for teaching and research, and are applicable to numerous &lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary scientific studies and engineering problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
