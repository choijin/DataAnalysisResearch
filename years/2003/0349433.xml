<AbstractNarration>PI: John van de Lindt, Michigan Tech &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) proposal is requesting funding to support the &lt;br/&gt;development  of  collaborative  linkages  with  the  E-Defense  large  shake  table  facility  being &lt;br/&gt;constructed in Japan. The SGER grant also will support the development of a full proposal to NSF &lt;br/&gt;through the NEESR (Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation / Research Phase) program. &lt;br/&gt;The dual objectives of this larger proposal will be (1) to partially tie the large shake table facility in &lt;br/&gt;Japan into the NEES grid, and (2) address the seismic performance of woodframe structures in the &lt;br/&gt;overall NEES framework. Wood structures are the most common structures in the United States, &lt;br/&gt;comprising more than 80% of the building inventory. They further represent the largest segment of &lt;br/&gt;the  inventory  at  regions  of  the  highest  seismic  risk.  Wood  will  remain  a  widely  used  building &lt;br/&gt;material  for  low-rise  structures,  in  both  dimension  lumber  form  and  new  wood-based materials. &lt;br/&gt;The  performance  of  woodframe  structures  in  the  Northridge  earthquake  further  underscored  the &lt;br/&gt;need for improved methods for (a) assessing the vulnerability of the existing building stock, and (b) &lt;br/&gt;design of new structures to better withstand earthquakes with acceptably small amounts of damage &lt;br/&gt;to both structural and nonstructural elements.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The  funds requested for this  SGER  grant  will  primarily  be  used to (1) travel  to Japan  to  further &lt;br/&gt;develop  collaborative  testing  plans,  (2)  travel  to  2-3  NEES  facility  sites  (and  possibly  the &lt;br/&gt;University of British Columbia, Canada) to identify suitable assembly testing facilities, (3) travel to &lt;br/&gt;Washington, DC to meet with the cognizant NSF personnel. A small amount of support costs also &lt;br/&gt;will be requested. If possible, and if deemed to be appropriate, the PI.s will schedule their visit to &lt;br/&gt;Japan  to  coincide  with  the  .2003  Pan-Pacific  Symposium  for  Earthquake  Engineering &lt;br/&gt;Collaboration.  being  held by  Japan.s National  Research  Institute  for  Earth  Science and Disaster &lt;br/&gt;Prevention (NIED) Sept. 30 - Oct. 3.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;It  is  anticipated  that  2-3  additional  researchers from  the  US  as well  as  collaborating  researchers &lt;br/&gt;from New Zealand  (Bruce Deam,  University  of  Canterbury),  Canada  (Frank Lam,  University  of &lt;br/&gt;British Columbia), Italy (Ario Ceccotti, University of Florence), will join this project and be part of &lt;br/&gt;the  larger  proposal  to  NSF.  The  lead  investigators  from  Japan  will  be  Dr.  Chikahiro  Minowa &lt;br/&gt;(NIED) and Professor Isao Sakamoto (University of Tokyo).  Although the project will involve five &lt;br/&gt;countries the NEESR proposal will be written so that the US-Japan collaboration is self-contained. &lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that the collaborating researchers will apply for funding from their countries. Thus, &lt;br/&gt;the  success  of  the  US-Japanese  collaboration  will  not  be  dependent  on  their  ability  to  secure &lt;br/&gt;funding to support their activities. The international collaborative effort will be led by the PI.s of &lt;br/&gt;this proposal (van de Lindt and Rosowsky).  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The  intellectual  merit  of  the  proposed  SGER  project  is  in  the  development  of  a  collaborative &lt;br/&gt;research  program  between  NEES  and  E-Defense  in  Japan.  The  broad  objective  of  this &lt;br/&gt;collaboration, which will be fully developed in the anticipated NEESR proposal at the end of this &lt;br/&gt;year, is the development of system-level performance information necessary to more fully develop &lt;br/&gt;performance-based  seismic  design  procedures  for  woodframe  structures.  The  proposed  SGER &lt;br/&gt;project will have a  broader impact  on  both  the  scientific  community  and  society  at  large. The &lt;br/&gt;earthquake engineering community will benefit from having the E-Defense shake table tied into the &lt;br/&gt;NEES  grid.  This  linkage  will  provide  six-DOF  system  level  knowledge  for  researchers,  thus &lt;br/&gt;allowing  critical  understanding  of  the  relationship  between  assembly damage  and  damage  at  the &lt;br/&gt;system  level.  The  broader  impact  for  society will  be  the  development  of  more  effective  seismic &lt;br/&gt;design codes and a building inventory that is less susceptible to earthquake damage under moderate &lt;br/&gt;events.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
