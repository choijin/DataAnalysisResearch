<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this study is to determine the culture-based influences on risk mental models to identify the structure and components of what has been coined the "culture-based risk mental model" or CRMM.  Differences in injuries and fatalities from accidents in workplace settings are not solely determined by social power or choice of occupations within a society.  Since 1988, culture has been found to be a strong influence on the risk of injuries and fatalities, and on individuals' perceptions of risk and seems to interact with social power and choice to determine risk perception, risk tolerance, and compliance behaviors.   But, the manner and mechanisms by which culture influences risk are not understood, except in the context of social power, where certain groups are more likely to be exposed to hazardous jobs.  The unanswered questions are:  What other factors related to culture influence individual tolerance for hazardous work or high risk contexts?  What types of cultural critical incidents occur in the workplace that may contribute to risk disparities? And, what tools and techniques can be used to assess, analyze, and control the underlying factors related to cultural differences in risk contexts?  One important mechanism underlying risk perception is the risk mental model and this project is designed to understand the decision-making and thought patterns associated with culture-based risk mental models.  These patterns relate to cultural and social-cognitive socialization processes.  These components will be conceptually modeled and quantified so that we can develop methods to describe and predict outcomes related to risk based on differences in culture.  The ultimate goal is to eliminate risk disparities by developing explanatory models that can be used to design and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to enhance safety for all groups, regardless of culture.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
