    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga under the direction of Dr. Margaret Kovach for the acquisition of a fluorescent imaging system that will be used as an important research and teaching tool for the Departments of Biological and Environmental Sciences and Chemistry. The Departments of Biological and Environmental Sciences and Chemistry have a strong tenet for involving undergraduate students in research and, since the inception of the masters program, graduate students as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested instrumentation is necessary for performing molecular analysis and detection and can be used for a wide range of applications including genotyping, differential display, mutation detection, and forensics. The system will also be compatible with a wide variety of gel, membrane, microplate (ELISA) and microarray-based technologies used for analyzing DNA, RNA and protein samples. The research projects in genomics and proteomics, toxicology and biochemistry that will be supported by access to this instrumentation are associated with the laboratories and research interests of the five P.I.s . For example, the fluorescence imaging system will support studies of gene regulation through comparative analyses of gene expression profiles, the comparative study of microbial populations, the study of toxicological effects at the level of DNA and protein, and mutation detection and analysis by chemically induced mutagenesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of this imaging system will allow students and professors from both departments to increase the number and variety of experimental procedures available to conduct research. In addition, shared access to the fluorescent imaging system will enhance interdisciplinary courses, curricula and research between the departments. More than any other single item of equipment, the fluorescence imaging system will allow UTC to develop and sustain vigorous research and teaching programs that employ genomic and proteomic approaches to benefit current research programs in molecular biology, microbiology, toxicology and biochemistry.</AbstractNarration>
