<AbstractNarration>This proposal is to establish a summer school aimed at quantifying &lt;br/&gt;uncertainty in earth modes obtained from seismic imaging. The &lt;br/&gt;resolution in imaging techniques in global seismology has increased &lt;br/&gt;dramatically in recent years due to the explosive growth in the &lt;br/&gt;amount of digital data and computational facilities.  However, the &lt;br/&gt;accuracy of the spectacular images of 3D Earth structure that are &lt;br/&gt;being produced is usually poorly known.  The deployment of the &lt;br/&gt;USArray component of Earthscope will dramatically increase the &lt;br/&gt;coverage of the continental US with digital seismic stations, &lt;br/&gt;resulting in unprecedented quantities of data.  The full potential of &lt;br/&gt;this data set can only be realized when the uncertainty in the &lt;br/&gt;constructed earth models can be quantified adequately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This school focuses on the quantification of uncertainty in seismic&lt;br/&gt;imaging in the geosciences.  Since this problem requires the input from&lt;br/&gt;seismologists and mathematicians, the school is aimed at equal&lt;br/&gt;participation from both groups. The material that will be covered&lt;br/&gt;includes tutorial material as well as recent research. The presented&lt;br/&gt;material will be presented in the form tutorial lectures, lectures on&lt;br/&gt;recent research, computer exercises and problem sets, group meetings&lt;br/&gt;with a a mentor, poster presentations, and field trips. The school&lt;br/&gt;will be held at the campus of the Colorado School of Mines in the&lt;br/&gt;summer of 2004. The duration of the school is two weeks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The topic of the school addresses an issue&lt;br/&gt;that is of paramount importance in the geosciences. The connection&lt;br/&gt;between the constructed 3D Earth models and decision making can be&lt;br/&gt;called poorly-developed at best. Addressing these questions requires a&lt;br/&gt;joint effort of mathematicians and geoscientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The quantification of uncertainty in 3D models in the&lt;br/&gt;earth sciences is of relevance for the exploration and production of&lt;br/&gt;hydrocarbons, a better understanding of geo-dynamics with implication&lt;br/&gt;for natural hazards, as well as to non-seismological aspects of the&lt;br/&gt;geosciences that include ground water management, the detection and&lt;br/&gt;spreading of pollutants, the detection of un-exploded ordnance, and&lt;br/&gt;monitoring nuclear treaties. The quantification of uncertainty in&lt;br/&gt;seismology is essential for the analysis and interpretation of the&lt;br/&gt;US-Array data that will be collected as part of Earthscope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
