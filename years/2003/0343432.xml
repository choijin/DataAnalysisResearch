    <AbstractNarration>This is a FASEB conference entitled "Thrombospondins and other&lt;br/&gt;Modulatory Adhesion Molecules in Tissue Organization and Homeostasis", to be held at&lt;br/&gt;Callaway Gardens, Pine Mountain, Georgia, June 5-10, 2004. Modulatory adhesion molecules are components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that are specifically produced by cells during organogenesis or in adult tissues. These proteins regulate cell behavior, cell interactions, and ECM assembly. However, understanding their cellular and molecular mechanisms of action poses special challenges because of their diversity and tissue-specific functions. The conference will have intellectual merit: 1) in bringing together reseachers studying distinct functions of modulatory adhesion molecules, with different methodologies, in order to stimulate new interdisciplinary approaches and to develop a full mechanistic understanding of their properties; 2), in communicating recent advances in understanding the structural and functional processes by which modulatory adhesion molecules regulate cell motility, cell-signaling and cell interactions in development and in adult tissues; their roles in complex circuitries of ECM assembly and ECM turnover by extracellular proteolysis, with special reference to cardiovascular and connective tissues. The meeting will include formal talks, discussions and poster sessions and provide excellent opportunities for informal interactions. Attendees will include principal investigators, postdoctoral researchers and graduate students. 31% of the invited speakers and 33% of the session chairs are women; 55% of the speakers are new to the meeting. In highlighting the functions of modulatory adhesion molecules in different biological systems and providing a rare opportunity for an up-to-date and integrated perspective on the breadth and depth of reseach in this rapidly-growing area, this conference will have broad impact on research activities and thinking in the fields of ECM biology, cell interactions and tissue assembly and will stimulate communication, collaboration and synergy, and new directions for future research.</AbstractNarration>
