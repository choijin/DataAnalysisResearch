<AbstractNarration>Current trends in communication and information technologies, government deregulation, and&lt;br/&gt;interest in environmental concerns and data sharing have led to globalization of the engineering&lt;br/&gt;profession. Employers are increasingly stressing the need for a global perspective in engineering&lt;br/&gt;curricula. In recent years, engineering accreditation requirements have been revised to&lt;br/&gt;emphasize, among other things, an ability to understand societal and global issues of importance&lt;br/&gt;to engineers. In response, the engineering academic community is reconfiguring its curricula.&lt;br/&gt;One commonly used tool is to offer engineering students an opportunity to study abroad and&lt;br/&gt;work on projects in multinational companies in collaboration with students in foreign countries.&lt;br/&gt;The feasibility and benefits of this approach have been well documented. The participation of&lt;br/&gt;students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in international programs is&lt;br/&gt;generally very limited, especially in the engineering disciplines. This proposal is aimed at&lt;br/&gt;promoting and facilitating study abroad programs for engineering students at HBCUs. Barriers&lt;br/&gt;to student engagement in international programs include travel and other associated costs, fear of&lt;br/&gt;losing time and loss of academic credits, effort involved in learning a new language, and general&lt;br/&gt;ignorance of international programs at the curriculum advisor level. The proposed project will&lt;br/&gt;attempt to minimize the effect of these barriers. The project will involve collaborative work&lt;br/&gt;among major HBCUs that have ABET-accredited engineering programs and selected institutions&lt;br/&gt;in France, Germany and Spain through the support of the Global Education for European&lt;br/&gt;Engineers and Entrepreneurs (GE4) organization, corporate partners and research laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;By effectively using the intervening summer periods, the program will be structured to fit within&lt;br/&gt;current curriculum requirements without significantly increasing the time-to-degree.&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project are to enable HBCUs in the US and universities in Europe to promote&lt;br/&gt;international exchange of engineering students, to enhance the foreign language skills and the&lt;br/&gt;ability of students to understand different social and technical cultures, and to learn how to work&lt;br/&gt;in multi-national engineering teams. The evaluation of the curricula, development of special&lt;br/&gt;foreign language and cultural immersion courses and promotion of the program to potential&lt;br/&gt;students are the main activities proposed.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposal is centered on a better understanding of the educational&lt;br/&gt;systems in Europe in an effort to align curriculum requirements for engineering students to allow&lt;br/&gt;them to spend a semester or more abroad without delaying graduation. The team assembled to&lt;br/&gt;work on the project consists of faculty and administrators in colleges of engineering at several&lt;br/&gt;HBCUs and European universities, representatives from GE4, and directors of study abroad&lt;br/&gt;programs at the campuses. If successful, the project will lay the foundation for significant&lt;br/&gt;increases in the number of underrepresented engineers who experience international study and&lt;br/&gt;work as part of their education. The broader impact of the project is rooted in the fact that the&lt;br/&gt;student participants in the exchange program belong to underrepresented minorities that have&lt;br/&gt;traditionally not participated in international programs. The proposed course development to&lt;br/&gt;enhance traditional foreign language courses to include cultural issues especially targeted to&lt;br/&gt;engineering students will be of value to students in other universities also. The course material&lt;br/&gt;will be made available to other universities on request.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
