<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The foci of this research are threefold.  First, substructures of "phenylogous cubic graphite" will be synthesized to afford crystalline materials that are thermally stable porous solids.  Second, hydrogen-bonding and salt-bridge-forming functional groups will be incorporated into polyphenyl aromatic molecules to serve as precursors to porous, three-dimensional network solids.  Third, configurationally stable, chiral twisted polyphenyl aromatics will be synthesized.  Crystals of the pure enantiomers of these molecules will contain chiral cavities, a property very rare in existing porous materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Robert A. Pascal of the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University.   Dr. Pascal will focus his work on developing methodology for the synthesis and characterization of large polyphenyl aromatic compounds.  These molecules have well-defined conformations, large cavities and great stability.  It is projected that some of them will form highly stable, ordered, porous solids-essentially "hydrophobic zeolites."  In terms of broader impacts, the project has potential for catalysis, separation technologies, and perhaps medical diagnostics.  The project also provides an excellent setting for the training of graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
