<AbstractNarration>We consider theoretical and numerical studies of two inverse problems:&lt;br/&gt;(a) Low frequency electromagnetic inversion, where we seek unknown&lt;br/&gt;coefficients (electrical conductivity/permittivity) in elliptic&lt;br/&gt;systems of equations, inside a bounded domain, given the Neumann to&lt;br/&gt;Dirichlet map at the boundary. We explore the use of variational&lt;br/&gt;principles in the solution of such problems.  In particular, we wish&lt;br/&gt;to develop new, variational reconstruction algorithms and to study&lt;br/&gt;resolution limits (distinguishability). In numerical inversion, having&lt;br/&gt;a proper discretization is paramount.  We propose a finite difference&lt;br/&gt;discretization of the problem, on optimal grids.  We have demonstrated&lt;br/&gt;that optimal grids give stable and efficient inversion algorithms, in&lt;br/&gt;one dimensional (Sturm-Liouville) problems.  We wish to study further&lt;br/&gt;the optimal grids and to extend them to higher dimensions.  &lt;br/&gt;(b) Inverse scattering in random media, where we wish to image the&lt;br/&gt;reflectivity of targets buried in clutter, which we model as a random&lt;br/&gt;medium. We are interested in remote sensing regimes, with significant&lt;br/&gt;multipathing (multiscattering) of the waves, by the inhomogeneities in&lt;br/&gt;clutter.  The proposed work starts with a close look at wave &lt;br/&gt;propagation in random media and it strives to develop statistically&lt;br/&gt;stable imaging algorithms, which give reliable images, independent of&lt;br/&gt;one's lack of knowledge of the details of the clutter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We consider theoretical and numerical studies of two inverse problems:&lt;br/&gt;(a) The first problem considers the recovery of properties such as the&lt;br/&gt;electrical conductivity and permittivity of a body, given measurements&lt;br/&gt;of electric currents and voltages, or the electric and magnetic fields, &lt;br/&gt;at the surface of the body. Because different materials display different &lt;br/&gt;electrical properties, these problems are important whenever we wish to &lt;br/&gt;infer the internal structure of a body, by gathering data at its periphery.  &lt;br/&gt;Examples of applications are: (1) In medicine: for detection of pulmonary &lt;br/&gt;emboli, monitoring of heart function and blood flow, detection of breast &lt;br/&gt;tumors, etc. (2) In environmental sciences: for detection of leaks in &lt;br/&gt;underground tanks, monitoring of underground flows, etc. (3) Nondestructive &lt;br/&gt;testing of materials: detection of corrosion, cracks and voids in metals,&lt;br/&gt;etc. Our research focuses on using state of the art variational techniques &lt;br/&gt;and optimal grids (parametrizations), to obtain efficient and reliable &lt;br/&gt;recoveries of the unknown electrical properties inside the body.  &lt;br/&gt;(b) The second problem considers the detection and imaging of targets&lt;br/&gt;in clutter, via active arrays of antennas (transducers) which send&lt;br/&gt;probing signals in the medium and record the scattered echoes. Imaging&lt;br/&gt;in clutter is not well understood, so far, but it has important&lt;br/&gt;applications in ultrasound imaging, land or shallow water mine&lt;br/&gt;detection, ground or foliage penetrating radar, etc.  Our approach to&lt;br/&gt;imaging in clutter is based on knowledge of wave propagation in random&lt;br/&gt;media and it considers the development of statistically stable imaging&lt;br/&gt;algorithms, which give reliable results, independent of one's&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty of the clutter.</AbstractNarration>
