<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Fabry-Perot consists of two parallel mirrors used to define modes in lasers, tunable filters, spectrum analyzers, and some modulators. The mirrors are usually dielectric quarter wave stacks that reflect in a distributed way, throughout their thickness. The objective of this project is to demonstrate that the effective penetration length into the quarter wave stack mirror (also called a distributed Bragg reflector) can become large and negative, zero, or large and positive, depending on careful control of the refractive indices. This concept will then be applied to: a) producing single mode semiconductor lasers and b) investigating high speed spatial light modulators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: this project stems from a new analytic solution to the effective penetration length in these distributed mirrors and the discovery of both a pole and a zero in the solution. The existence of these regimes has been checked by computer and implies a number of important applications in optical devices and systems. Defining and demonstrating these applications is the exciting challenge. For example, this will be the first time that control of a Fabry-Perot mode spacing is achieved by controlling the refractive index in its mirrors. Furthermore, a negative penetration length implies superluminal reflection, which is an important intellectual challenge to explain and find applications for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve this regime with high reflectivity requires the distributed reflector be deposited on metal (or a metal film) or to use a large number of layer-pairs. In either case, careful control of the refractive indices of the films is required. This is the technical challenge that will be undertaken in the laboratory. It will be helped by a thin film measurement technique introduced by author in 1983 and will use a thin film deposition technology that was developed at Dartmouth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: Controlling the effective penetration length of a distributed mirror offers a wide range of applications. These include: inexpensive single mode semiconductor lasers, mode-locked semiconductor lasers with more power per pulse, simpler fabrication of fiber Fabry-Perot tunable filters, a practical variable optical attenuator, better Fabry-Perot optical sensors, simpler fabrication of VCSEL's, and resonant photo-detectors. Finally, nonlinear and electrically driven waveguide modulators and spatial light modulators become practical. The concept pioneered here can also be used to achieve in-plane right angle bends in waveguides, which usually requires nanostructure photonic bandgap materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will also have a positive impact on training engineering personnel, since the P. I. is a woman and the Ph. D. graduate student proposed to initiate the research is also a woman. Dartmouth as a college is involved in state-of-the-art research and provides a model for teaching-research institutions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
