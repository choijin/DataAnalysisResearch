<AbstractNarration>The emerging fields of nanoscience and engineering - the ability to work at the molecular level, atom by atom, to create large structures with fundamentally new molecular organization - are leading to unprecedented understanding and control over the fundamental building blocks of all physical things. To address the issue of international cooperation and monitoring, it is prudent for US scientists to arrange frequent visits to foreign countries as well as to develop collaborative research programs with foreign institutions. This proposal is aimed at organizing a visit by a US delegation of eight to participate and organize "Nano Workshop for US Scientists at the International Conference on NANOMATERIALS AND NANOTECHNOLOGIES  - NN2003, Crete, Greece, Aug 30-Sep 6 - 2003".  It is envisioned that this conference will provide an opportunity to discuss important research activities in nanoscience through state-of-the-art review lectures, contributed papers, panel discussions, and workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is also expected to create a sufficient interest among the researchers of USA and rest of the world to develop and further expands the cooperative research activities.  Finally, in order for the field of nanostructure science and technology to truly reach fruition, it is an absolute necessity to create a new breed of researchers who can work across traditional disciplines and think "outside the box." Educating this new breed of researchers, who will either work across disciplines or know how to work with others in the interfaces between disciplines, is vital to the future of nanostructure science and technology. This event will comprise a diverse community, including internationally renowned experts, young researchers, graduate students and minorities. The US delegation involves diverse demographics including female and minority researchers in the field. The gathering of invited international experts to address this area of high technology will bring a broad impact to R&amp;D in the US, European, Asian and other countries, with consequent benefits to the regional and global economy. Proceedings of the workshop and conference will be edited for a broader dissemination. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
