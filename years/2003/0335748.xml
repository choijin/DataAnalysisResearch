<AbstractNarration>This Noyce Stipend Program supports recently initiated efforts to address the critical shortage of qualified&lt;br/&gt;science and mathematics teachers in the Chicago Public Schools, particularly in urban areas of high need.&lt;br/&gt;It builds on a successful partnership between CPS and the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) that&lt;br/&gt;offers standards-based program opportunities for career-change candidates with strong science, technology,&lt;br/&gt;engineering and mathematics (STEM) backgrounds interested in becoming a certified teacher. This Noyce&lt;br/&gt;Project specifically features two such program opportunities: 1) the Middle Grades Science (MGS) and&lt;br/&gt;Middle Grades Mathematics (MGM) Program, and 2) the Master of Science in Teaching Secondary School&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics (MST) Program. Teacher candidates in the MGS/MGM Program earn an elementary school&lt;br/&gt;certificate (K- 9) with a middle grades (5 - 8) endorsement in science or mathematics. It is an alternative&lt;br/&gt;route program, with separate science and mathematics cohorts, offered through the College of Education.&lt;br/&gt;The MST is a conventional secondary teacher preparation program (6-12) offered through the Department&lt;br/&gt;of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science. The beneficiaries of a Noyce Stipend Award are&lt;br/&gt;career-change candidates with strong academic abilities and STEM qualifications and demonstrated&lt;br/&gt;financial need, within the broader social commitment to preparing a diverse workforce of science and&lt;br/&gt;mathematics teachers prepared to address the needs of urban youth (Ladson-Billings, 1995). There are three specific objectives: 1) to enhance the recruitment of STEM candidates to the MGS/MGM and MST programs; 2) to support the retention of MGS/MGM candidates, given the documented need for heightened support for those entering through alternative certification routes across the first three years (CSMPT, 2001; Huling, Resta, &amp; Rainwater, 2001); and 3) to redirect the MST student pipeline at UIC to teacher employment in CPS in high-need areas. These goals are being attained by awarding stipends to the appropriate students. The program includes two types of stipend awards: one to aid the recruitment of new candidates, and the other to assist with the retention of recently admitted candidates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
