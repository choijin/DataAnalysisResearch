    <AbstractNarration>This project will study how genes control the shapes of &lt;br/&gt;living things. It will identify specific genes that affect the &lt;br/&gt;shapes of fly wings, and will assess their relative effects and &lt;br/&gt;possible modes of action. Fly wings offer a fast, cost-effective &lt;br/&gt;way to investigate the basic principles of genetic shape &lt;br/&gt;control, because they can be easily projected and magnified, &lt;br/&gt;and their shapes can be rapidly measured with a computer. &lt;br/&gt;This makes it possible to analyze thousands of measurements &lt;br/&gt;of individual differences, which are required to study the small &lt;br/&gt;effects of many genes. Previous work in mice and flies &lt;br/&gt;indicates that many minor genes are involved in shape control. &lt;br/&gt;In this study the new technique of microarray analysis will be &lt;br/&gt;combined with massively replicated measurements to find and &lt;br/&gt;identify these genes. &lt;br/&gt; In many cases we know how genes guide cells to &lt;br/&gt;differentiate into the separate parts of organisms, but not much &lt;br/&gt;is known about how growth is subsequently regulated to &lt;br/&gt;determine the final shapes of parts. Understanding differential &lt;br/&gt;growth regulation in normal cells should advance our &lt;br/&gt;knowledge in areas of medical interest, with possible &lt;br/&gt;applications to abnormal growth, birth defects, and the origins &lt;br/&gt;of cancer. Frequently, basic research in fruit fly genetics has &lt;br/&gt;led to major advances in human genetics.</AbstractNarration>
