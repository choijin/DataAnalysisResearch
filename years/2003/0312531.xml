    <AbstractNarration>Mueller&lt;br/&gt;Whalley&lt;br/&gt;Healy &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Embedded systems with temporal constraints rely on timely scheduling&lt;br/&gt;and a priori knowledge of worst-case execution times. Static timing&lt;br/&gt;analysis derives safe bounds of WCETs but its applicability has been&lt;br/&gt;limited to hard real-time systems and small code snippets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses these limitations of timing analysis for&lt;br/&gt;embedded systems. It contributes a novel approach to program analysis&lt;br/&gt;through parametric techniques of static timing analysis and provides&lt;br/&gt;innovative methods for exploiting them. The proposed techniques&lt;br/&gt;express worst-case execution time as a formula with the following&lt;br/&gt;benefits. First, static timing analysis becomes applicable to a wide&lt;br/&gt;class of embedded systems with variable loop bounds. Second, the&lt;br/&gt;benefits of parametric timing analysis provide new opportunities for&lt;br/&gt;dynamic and flexible scheduling decisions. Third, timing abstractions&lt;br/&gt;through the parametric approach enable the analysis of much larger&lt;br/&gt;programs than in the past. Finally, the techniques of static timing&lt;br/&gt;analysis, currently constrained to hard real-time system, become&lt;br/&gt;applicable to a much wider range of embedded systems with soft timing&lt;br/&gt;constraints. The broader impact is to increasingly expose students to&lt;br/&gt;embedded systems and to provide essential temporal assurances, which&lt;br/&gt;are a prerequisite for applying the results of hard and soft real-time&lt;br/&gt;scheduling for reliable embedded systems of national and economic importance.</AbstractNarration>
