<AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;Design of Robust,Networked Control Systems via Convex Optimization&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit of the proposed activity&lt;br/&gt;We are on the threshold of eing able to place sensors everywhere.This has een precipitated in part y the&lt;br/&gt;continued rapid advances in sensor technology,which will allow us to place sensors ranging from the nano-&lt;br/&gt;scale to the macro-scale on almost any physical device,at an economically viable cost.This alone,however,&lt;br/&gt;would e limited in scope without the ability to process the potentially vast amounts of information generated&lt;br/&gt;y these devices,and the ability to network them to ensure that the relevant information is made available&lt;br/&gt;to the appropriate entities.Fortunately,computing and communication technology has een keeping pace&lt;br/&gt;with sensor technology,and all the ingredients are there for major reakthroughs in the near future in how&lt;br/&gt;we interface to,and control our environment.This will certainly e hastened y the Sensors and Sensor&lt;br/&gt;Networks program,which will promote the creation of new sensor concepts and new methods for facilitating&lt;br/&gt;the transfer of information.&lt;br/&gt;There are some serious challenges,however,that must e overcome efore these future sensor networks&lt;br/&gt;can e successfully deployed.One of the major challenges is the ability to make the appropriate decisions&lt;br/&gt;based on distributed information,across a distributed network.To put this challenge in context,it is well&lt;br/&gt;known that two comparably simple dynamical systems can exhibit complex ehavior when interconnected.&lt;br/&gt;This observation,and the associated challenges,have een the driving force ehind much of the research in&lt;br/&gt;feedback theory and feedback control.In particular,ensuring that feedback systems ehave reliably,in the&lt;br/&gt;presence of uncertainty,has een the main focus of feedback control theory,and continues to gain importance&lt;br/&gt;in dynamical systems theory.This theory,however,has largely een focused on systems with degrees of&lt;br/&gt;freedom (or system states),inputs,and outputs that can e counted in the tens to the hundreds.What is&lt;br/&gt;required for the successful deployment of the em edded sensor networks of the future are design and analysis&lt;br/&gt;tools that can handle systems that are distributed,with potentially millions of states,inputs,and outputs.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work is aimed at developing new tools for designing and controlling systems that are&lt;br/&gt;distributed across a network,with distributed decision making units,with large num ers of components.&lt;br/&gt;The emphasis will e to develop tools for systems governed y di .erential and di .erence equations,oth&lt;br/&gt;linear and nonlinear,with large num er of components,and interconnected through networks of limited&lt;br/&gt;connectivity.The principle theoretical tools employed will consist of convex relaxations and semide .nite&lt;br/&gt;programming.The proposed work is focused,and will not e an all-encompassing e .ort.Rather,it is aimed&lt;br/&gt;at solving some fundamental problems in designing and controlling systems across networks,and will thus&lt;br/&gt;e an integral component of the overall e .ort in the Sensors and Sensor Networks program.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the proposed activity&lt;br/&gt;The PI has a strong proven track record in this area.Examples include:1)advises approximately thirty&lt;br/&gt;students every year,from computer science,electrical engineering,and mechanical engineering,in the design&lt;br/&gt;and construction of complex electro-mechanical and software systems as part of the Systems Engineering&lt;br/&gt;program at Cornell (of which he is a co-founder);these systems are used y M.S.and Ph.D.students for&lt;br/&gt;their research.2)Has given public lectures and demonstrations at the Smithsonian in Washington,the Tech&lt;br/&gt;Museum of Innovation in San Jose,NASA SIGMA series (a public forum for science and technology),National&lt;br/&gt;Engineering Week activities at NSF (attended y local area high-school students).3)Gives approximately&lt;br/&gt;.ve to ten demonstrations involving the control of autonomous systems every year at Cornell to local-area&lt;br/&gt;elementary school children and under-represented minorities.4)Has een an invited speaker at two NSF&lt;br/&gt;sponsored workshops,attended y high-school teachers and students,aimed at promoting and disseminating&lt;br/&gt;control related research.5)Has appeared twice on Scienti .c American Frontiers,a television science program&lt;br/&gt;on public television hosted y Alan Alda.6)Was the executive producer of a CD-ROM sent to hundreds&lt;br/&gt;of prospective engineering students outlining Systems Engineering e .orts at Cornell University.The PI&lt;br/&gt;will incorporate the proposed research into these activities aimed at educating the public on systems and&lt;br/&gt;feedback,and more roadly,on science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
