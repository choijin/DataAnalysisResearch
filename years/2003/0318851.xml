    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will show proof of principle for &lt;br/&gt;an innovative optical technique using backscattered laser light to perform particle sizing &lt;br/&gt;measurements. Limitations of existing systems include the need to measure transmitted &lt;br/&gt;instead of reflected light, the inability to make accurate measurements in dense particles &lt;br/&gt;fields, and the inability to characterize particle shape. Phase I research will lead to the &lt;br/&gt;realization of a unique diagnostic system capable of fast, non-invasive measurements in &lt;br/&gt;media of high turbidity; use of backscattered, not transmitted, light; solid-state fiber optic &lt;br/&gt;construction; cost effective gain-guided laser diodes for light sources; and assembly &lt;br/&gt;from commercial-off-the-shelf components. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particle sizing techniques are critical for process characterization and control in diverse &lt;br/&gt;areas of manufacturing and research. The worldwide market for particle sizing &lt;br/&gt;instruments has been estimated at $300 million. Industries using particle sizing include &lt;br/&gt;agrochemical, cement, ceramics, cosmetics, personal care, soil testing, wastewater &lt;br/&gt;processing, paints, inks and other surface coatings. The proposed system will introduce &lt;br/&gt;a patentable new technology to the field of particle sizing by the novel extension of a &lt;br/&gt;proven commercial technique.</AbstractNarration>
