<AbstractNarration>Through the collaborative efforts of the College of Science and Technology, the Department &lt;br/&gt;of Natural Sciences, the Office of Programs for Academic Support and Enrichment, and the Office of Dean of Student Services,  Texas A&amp;M International University (TAMIU) is establishing a Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarship (CSEMS) Program: South Texas Border Mathematics and Pre-Engineering Graduates (STBMPEG).  The STBMPEG program is providing scholarships to twenty-nine low-income, undergraduates majoring in computer science, engineering, or mathematics.  Due to their under representation in CSEMS fields, priority for such scholarships will be given to low-income ethnic minorities, women, and persons with disabilities.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Primary objectives of the CSEMS-STBMPEG Program are to (1) increase the number of professional development research activities, as well as internship opportunities, for participants; (2) provide services to support timely completion of degree requirements; (3) increase the number of low-income undergraduate ethnic minorities, women, and persons with disabilities who enter graduate school in CSEMS fields; (4) expand and further develop the capacity within existing alumni and private industry relationships/networks to provide career seminars and relevant job preparation experiences; and, (5) address the broader societal issue of  low participation in CSEMS by the targeted populations through mentoring and role modeling activities for lower-division and pre-college students.  To receive the scholarships, participating students must remain enrolled full time in a CSEMS major, maintain a GPA of at least 2.80, and participate in enrichment activities designed to facilitate their involvement with faculty and peers through mentoring and collaborative learning.  Students are required to attend a program orientation, participate in at least one career seminar per academic year, meet with their CSEMS-STBMPEG Advisor minimally once each quarter, participate in research with a faculty mentor or in a CSEMS-related industry internship or on- campus employment activity, and serve as a mentor or role model for a lower-division undergraduate or pre-college student with demonstrated interest in CSEMS.  The support provided to project's participants include a peer mentor during their initial program year, tutorial and peer study-group support, plus assistance in preparing for graduate school.  With the financial assistance and enrichment activities provided through the CSEMS-STBMPEG Program, it is anticipated that most students will graduate within two to four years of entry into the program and will either enter a graduate program with a CSEMS major or secure a position in a related field.   Broader Impact:  Long-term, continuing benefits of program activities include establishment of new research and internship opportunities to be available for future CSEMS majors, increased networking and mentoring activities for future cooperative interactions among participating individuals at various stages of their CSEMS careers, development of student linkages within the university community itself as well as with local industry and agencies, pre-college encouragement to seek careers in CSEMS-related fields by underrepresented ethnic groups, low-income women and persons with disabilities, and expanded knowledge of research processes acquired by CSEMS Scholars working in conjunction with their faculty mentors.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
