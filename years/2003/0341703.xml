<AbstractNarration>----------------------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scalable Dependability in Componentized Software via Self-Stabilization&lt;br/&gt;PI: Anish Arora, Professor, CIS, The Ohio State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses the problem of unanticipated software faults, &lt;br/&gt;which inevitably occur in large-scale software systems, including &lt;br/&gt;those used by the United States space program for missions such as &lt;br/&gt;the International Space Station, by developing tools and frameworks&lt;br/&gt;for self-stabilization, i.e., for restoring system behavior if it &lt;br/&gt;deviates from its intended one by detecting and correcting state predicates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extant techniques for designing/composing stabilizing systems do not&lt;br/&gt;scale well. The proposed research addresses complexity as follows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A component is typically simpler than the system as a whole. Hence&lt;br/&gt;stabilization will be added per component and then they will be composed &lt;br/&gt;into a stabilizing system, taking into account issues of dependency and &lt;br/&gt;interference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A component's specification is usually simpler than the component itself.&lt;br/&gt;hence stabilization will be added per component with respect to only the &lt;br/&gt;component specification, &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will demonstrate that the software tools and frameworks &lt;br/&gt;resulting from these ideas measurably and predictably improve dependability &lt;br/&gt;in a NASA system. The techniques and tools will provide for the first time &lt;br/&gt;the ability to make large systems tolerant to unanticipated faults. Besides &lt;br/&gt;space craft, they can also be used with critical systems such as aircraft control,&lt;br/&gt;medical instruments, the telephone network, etc.</AbstractNarration>
