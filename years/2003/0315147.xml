<AbstractNarration>PI:  Shiyu Zhou&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  9985310&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  U of Pennsylvania&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Randomized computation has become one of the major research fields&lt;br/&gt;in Computer Science since its emergence in the late 1970's.&lt;br/&gt;In spite of its seemingly enhanced power, as far as we know,&lt;br/&gt;randomness may not provide any computational advantage &lt;br/&gt;(by more than a polynomial factor) over determinism.&lt;br/&gt;The first objective of this project is to investigate the issue of&lt;br/&gt;reducing randomness in computation via explicit combinatorial constructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Derandomization in space-bounded computation is the major subject to&lt;br/&gt;study here, with the focus on pseudorandom generator constructions.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the constructions of pseudorandom generators for constant-width&lt;br/&gt;read-once branching programs, and of discrepancy sets for combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;rectangles are to be examined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Derandomizing the well-known randomized log-space algorithm for &lt;br/&gt;undirected graph connectivity problem will be investigated further.&lt;br/&gt;In the meantime, a variant of the connectivity problem&lt;br/&gt;in the model of directed graphs with tree structures will also be examined,&lt;br/&gt;hoping this can provide a better understanding of the relationship between &lt;br/&gt;non-deterministic and deterministic computations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An advanced topic course (graduate or undergraduate) on explicit&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial constructions and their applications will be designed.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the course is to enable the students to attain a solid&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the mathematical foundation of explicit&lt;br/&gt;constructions as well as their applications to algorithm design&lt;br/&gt;and computational complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mobile computing over wireless channels has emerged as a rapidly growing&lt;br/&gt;technology and gained a large amount of attention in recent years.&lt;br/&gt;The highly asymmetric nature of the communication environment&lt;br/&gt;in this context gives rise to many new challenges concerning the&lt;br/&gt;issues of information dissemination and retrieval. Indexed data&lt;br/&gt;scheduling is to design data broadcast schemes that&lt;br/&gt;minimize both the average waiting time and energy consumption&lt;br/&gt;of the clients in retrieving information on air.&lt;br/&gt;Another objective of this project is to investigate &lt;br/&gt;the possibility of applying the ideas from indexed data scheduling&lt;br/&gt;to the design of communication protocols for multimedia applications&lt;br/&gt;in wireless mobile communication networks.</AbstractNarration>
