<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;ATM 0332269&lt;br/&gt;Extratropical Stratosphere and Tropical Troposphere Interaction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A series of numerical experiments with a troposphere-stratosphere model will be&lt;br/&gt;undertaken to better understand the dynamical interactions between the extratropical stratosphere and tropical troposphere during winter, especially during sudden stratospheric warmings. Long simulations will be performed to obtain reliable results.  These dynamical connections are important in understanding known modes of climate variability, and in assessing the possible connections between stratospheric ozone depletion and tropospheric climate. Both the effect of sudden stratospheric warmings on tropical climate and the effect of tropical changes such as ENSO warm events on stratospheric climate will be addressed. The roles of radiation and convection in these processes will be addressed by comparing (GCM) general circulation model results with results from a model with simplified physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;These experiments will help interpret observed trends in tropical and  stratospheric climate, and may be important for assessing the relative contributions of natural and human induced causes for these trends. The work will be conducted by a post-doctoral researcher from Japan, and will contribute to his training and to collaborations between Japanese and American researchers. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
