    <AbstractNarration>Principal Investigator: Chongying Dong&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: DMS- 0320780&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California Santa Cruz &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fields Institute is running a workshop on Infinite Dimensional Lie Theory and Its Applications, July 17-25, 2003. The workshop has been approved by the Scientific Advisory Panel for funding of $25000 Canadian by the Fields Institute. The funding from the NSF will support young American mathematicians who wish to participate. The workshop is a follow up of one-term program on ``Infinite Dimensional Lie Theory and Its Applications'' taken place at the Field Institute in the fall of 2000. The goal of the proposed conference is to present some of the most important advances in Lie theory since the 2000 program. This will allow the vibrant North-American Lie community to build on the momentum gained through the last program. There will be an instructional component during the first three days (Thursday, July 17 through Saturday, July 19) featuring three series of lectures. These will be given by prominent people covering topics of current interest. The conference is scheduled from Monday, July 21 to Friday, July 25. It will feature invited lectures by seniors lectures. In addition, all of the junior participants in the Fields 2000 Lie Theory program will be invited to give 30 minutes presentations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infinite dimensional Lie algebras appear as symmetries of a wide class of systems and objects. The theory of infinite dimensional Lie algebras such as Kac-Moody Lie algebras and vertex algebras have developed rapidly during the last two decades. This development has various applications to many branches in mathematics and physics such as integrable system, topology, geometry, number theory, conformal field theory and string theory. An integral and important part of the proposed conference is to provide opportunities for young mathematicians to collaborate with leading experts in Lie theory,&lt;br/&gt;to learn the most important development in the field, and to show off their accomplishments in front of the international leaders in the area.</AbstractNarration>
