<AbstractNarration>Recognizing the needs for a synergistic integration of mechanical engineering with electronics&lt;br/&gt;and intelligent computer communication and control in the design and manufacture of products&lt;br/&gt;and processes, a new International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM) was&lt;br/&gt;jointly approved by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and the American&lt;br/&gt;Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in 1997. Since its first inception in 1997 in Tokyo, the&lt;br/&gt;IEEE/ASME AIM Conference has been held biennial, rotating the host country among Japan&lt;br/&gt;(AIM'97), the United States (AIM'99), Europe (AIM'01), and, in the future, other Asian Pacific-Rim&lt;br/&gt;nations as well. The conference has been co-sponsored by the IEEE Industrial Electronics&lt;br/&gt;Society (IES), the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS), and the ASME Dynamic&lt;br/&gt;Systems and Control Division (DSCD).&lt;br/&gt;The great practical significance of the conference theme has made past three AIM conferences a&lt;br/&gt;success and the conference has been expanded significantly  from predominantly Asians&lt;br/&gt;participants in AIM'97 in Tokyo to a good representation of US scientists and engineers in&lt;br/&gt;AIM'99 in Atlanta, and the European participants in AIM'01 in Como, Italy. This year, the&lt;br/&gt;conference will be held in Kobe, Japan, in July 20-24, 2003. The conference will provide a&lt;br/&gt;unique venue where researchers, engineers and industrial exhibitors from the globe who are&lt;br/&gt;interested in advancing the state-of-the-art of mechatronics gather and discuss effective ways to&lt;br/&gt;advance mechatronics as an emerging engineering technology and a new discipline in the 21st&lt;br/&gt;century. In order to achieve the conference goal of bring together researchers from the globe in&lt;br/&gt;the fields of mechanical engineering (ME) and electrical engineering and computer science&lt;br/&gt;(EECS), partial funding is requested from the National Science Foundation to assist US&lt;br/&gt;researchers to contribute and present papers in the AIM'03. It is expected that such a partial&lt;br/&gt;support will not only encourage the active participation of US researchers in the conference to&lt;br/&gt;promote global collaborations, but also advance the US mechatronics education and research in a&lt;br/&gt;long run due to the following unique features of the conference: (i) the host country, Japan, has&lt;br/&gt;been excelling in Mechatronics, (ii) the conference will draw worldwide participation from 26&lt;br/&gt;countries based on the accepted papers, (iii) an innovative format of interactive sessions will be&lt;br/&gt;developed the first time in demonstrating various real mechatronics systems, and (iv)unique&lt;br/&gt;industrial visits have been arranged by the Japanese organizers for conference participants in&lt;br/&gt;showing the practical applications of the discipline.</AbstractNarration>
