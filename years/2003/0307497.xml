<AbstractNarration>AST 0307497&lt;br/&gt;PI Richter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concentrates on spectroscopic observations of pre-main-sequence and main-sequence stars in an attempt to characterize disks at radii comparable to the orbits of terrestrial and gas giant planets in our own solar system. By observing multiple transitions of molecular hydrogen and other simple, gaseous molecules at high spectral resolution, the research team will place constraints on properties such as the temperature, the level of mixing between gas and dust, and the chemical state of protoplanetary disks. Most of the observations will be carried out using the Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph, a high-resolution, mid-infrared spectrograph capable of sensitive, very high spectral resolution observations in the 4 to 25 micrometer wavelength regions. Using this instrument, selected sources will also be searched for water vapor, carbon monoxide, methane, and ammonia transitions. Comparing emission lines at very different excitation energies will help provide insight into the disk properties at varying radii.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Because this research investigates the origins of planetary systems and the evolution of pre-biotic molecules within proto-planetary disks, any spectroscopic detection of forming planets and information regarding water and simple organic species near such planets are of interest to the general public. The investigator will continue to serve as the point of contact for this instrument with the astronomical community, maintain and improve the software he developed, conduct observations at the telescope, and assist in the reduction and analysis of data. This research will include graduate and undergraduate students in the project. The goal is to encourage the development of future instrumentalists by involving students in a relatively small research group that designs, builds, maintains, and uses forefront astronomical instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
