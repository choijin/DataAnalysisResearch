<AbstractNarration>We describe three problems in this proposal, all in the general &lt;br/&gt;area of knot theory and 3-manifolds.  A Heegaard splitting of a &lt;br/&gt;3-manifold is a decomposition of the 3-manifold into simple pieces, &lt;br/&gt;called handlebodies.   This decomposition is an effective way to &lt;br/&gt;study many of the interesting open questions about 3-manifolds, but &lt;br/&gt;there are some startling gaps in our basic information about Heegaard &lt;br/&gt;splittings.   We know that given two Heegaard splittings of the same &lt;br/&gt;3-manifold, one can move from one to the other by a series of moves. &lt;br/&gt;The first problem in this proposal asks how "far apart" two different &lt;br/&gt;Heegaard splittings of a 3-manifold can be under these moves.    The &lt;br/&gt;second problem is to explore a particular aspect of the Poincare &lt;br/&gt;Conjecture prompted by Dunwoody's recent attempt and suggested by &lt;br/&gt;earlier work of Freedman and Yau.   We will look carefully at whether &lt;br/&gt;a plan analogous to what Dunwoody proposed can be made to work on a &lt;br/&gt;real 3-ball, beginning with an even simpler version of the question &lt;br/&gt;on a triangulated 2-sphere.     The final problem is a generalization &lt;br/&gt;of recent work of the proposer on immersed curves in the plane to &lt;br/&gt;immersed 2-spheres in 3-space.  We will look at the set of &lt;br/&gt;singularities  (including, for example, curves of self-intersection &lt;br/&gt;and points of zero curvature) and try to derive relationship between &lt;br/&gt;numbers and types of singularities, similar to the kinds of results &lt;br/&gt;known for immersed curves in the plane or in projective 2-space.   We &lt;br/&gt;also describe how these and other related problems have been used by &lt;br/&gt;the proposer to stimulate interest in the field and in mathematics in &lt;br/&gt;general at levels ranging from high school students,  including &lt;br/&gt;undergraduates and graduate students, through postdocs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low-dimensional topology is the study of properties of spaces in &lt;br/&gt;dimensions two, three, and four.  It is a field that used to lie &lt;br/&gt;squarely in the realm of "pure" mathematics, and research in the &lt;br/&gt;field was pursued largely for its intricacy and beauty.  As we &lt;br/&gt;continue to understand the universe, from the shape of space itself &lt;br/&gt;to the knotting of strands of DNA, the deep connections between this &lt;br/&gt;abstract area and the real world are increasingly apparent. This &lt;br/&gt;proposal aims to explore some of the fundamental questions in &lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional spaces and knot theory, including understanding the &lt;br/&gt;relationships between different decompositions of 3-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;spaces and quantifying the complexity of 2-dimensional spheres &lt;br/&gt;immersed in a standard 3-dimensional universe.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
