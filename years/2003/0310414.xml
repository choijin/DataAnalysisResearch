<AbstractNarration>There are two difficult and seemingly contradictory imperatives facing the research networking community today.  The first is the need to enhance local network security in the face of increased nationwide cyberprotection requirements, and the second is the need to support deployment of advanced networked services for campus researchers using distributed computing environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the workshop is to propose a process to begin to resolve these orthogonal requirements into a coordinated architecture that will drive network research and campus deployments.  Workshop deliverables include:&lt;br/&gt;1) creation and publication of a Requirements Document specifying the technical issues involved in improving network security while preserving multiple layers of advanced network services&lt;br/&gt;2) development of an Inventory of Current Practices for advance, high performance network environments identifying effective existing approaches used by leading campuses to integrate scientific networking with campout network security, and&lt;br/&gt;3) creation of a standing expert Advisory Board to regularly discuss new issues and tools in high performance security, with broad promotion of those discussions and updates to the Inventory and Requirements documents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through these activities, federal funding agencies will be informed of key areas for investments to ensure security at line speed, and large academic research institutions will be able to improve network security while preserving an environment that enables their advanced scientific and education missions.  In addition, workshop outcomes are likely to be useful as the larger cybersecurity research strategic plan and funding initiatives are developed.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
