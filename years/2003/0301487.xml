<AbstractNarration>Abstract Reinhold &lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with methods to fragment ions is fundamental&lt;br/&gt;for elucidating molecular structures in biology. Combining mass measurements&lt;br/&gt;with fragmentation patterns is necessary as the bare ion mass (to arbitrary&lt;br/&gt;precision) often fails to identify the ion's molecular structure. The&lt;br/&gt;development of ion trapping mass spectrometers (based on Paul or Penning&lt;br/&gt;traps) allows multiple sequences of ion isolation and fragmentation (MSn).&lt;br/&gt;These instruments allow the disassembly of complex ions into components,&lt;br/&gt;generating a nested hierarchy of fragmentation patterns. The ensemble of&lt;br/&gt;fragmentation patterns substantially extends what can be determined by mass&lt;br/&gt;spectrometry. Ideally, combining ion disassembly with knowledge of fragment&lt;br/&gt;dissociation patterns could allow structural understanding for almost all&lt;br/&gt;complex biomolecules, e.g., peptides, oligosaccharides, lipids, and&lt;br/&gt;glycoconjugates. As important as these advances have been, it is also clear&lt;br/&gt;that present MS instruments fall short of the developing needs in biology.&lt;br/&gt;The explosion of genome data has accelerated a shift in biology from&lt;br/&gt;focusing on individual molecules and interactions into a focus where complex&lt;br/&gt;networks of interactions at the cell and organism level are studied.&lt;br/&gt;Addressing these demands will require MSn analyses of mixtures of complex&lt;br/&gt;molecules and a major limitation of present instruments is the loss of&lt;br/&gt;sensitivity in such MSn analyses. Ions are lost by deliberate ejection&lt;br/&gt;during the isolation of a specific component and by incidental and unwanted&lt;br/&gt;losses through dynamical instability during the instrumental execution of&lt;br/&gt;MSn steps. The objective of the research is to develop a new technology for&lt;br/&gt;MSn analyses that will eliminate or substantially reduce these losses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer simulations of ion motion in radio frequency ion traps of a novel&lt;br/&gt;geometry have suggested that it is possible to couple these devices and use&lt;br/&gt;the array of coupled traps as a new type of MSn instrument. A prototype mass&lt;br/&gt;spectrometer consisting of a coupled series of ion traps mated to an&lt;br/&gt;orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometer will be built. The mass&lt;br/&gt;selective transfer of ions between trapping regions and characterizing ion&lt;br/&gt;dissociation within the traps are the immediate experimental objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental analysis of the prototype combined with computational&lt;br/&gt;simulations will be used to direct future development of this class of mass&lt;br/&gt;spectrometers as analytical instruments. Correlating the observations with&lt;br/&gt;numerical models of the device will also aid the general technology of&lt;br/&gt;simulating (hence designing) gas phase ion manipulation instruments.&lt;br/&gt;Substantially higher performance MSn mass spectrometry will be an important&lt;br/&gt;component in the technologies that address the analytical challenge of&lt;br/&gt;genome-era biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
