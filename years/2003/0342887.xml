<AbstractNarration>The investigator proposes to study the nonlinear dynamics and control&lt;br/&gt;of a class of canonical fluid systems: flow over a backward facing&lt;br/&gt;step, flow separation from two sharp convex corners of a bluff body,&lt;br/&gt;and high frequency flutter of one or multiple airfoils.  Here,&lt;br/&gt;"Control" should not be interpreted in the traditional sense.  Recent&lt;br/&gt;"control" efforts have focused on triggering instabilities in the&lt;br/&gt;fluid shear layers; by creating certain vortex dynamic interactions,&lt;br/&gt;system performance often improves dramatically. The proposed research&lt;br/&gt;seeks to gain an understanding of the nonlinear dynamic processes and&lt;br/&gt;the bifurcation structure of the systems, so that it may be possible&lt;br/&gt;to synthesize such triggering controllers systematically, rather than&lt;br/&gt;relying on ad hoc trial and error.  The approach consists of&lt;br/&gt;constructing low order vortex models that capture essential features&lt;br/&gt;of the systems, and then performing normal form and bifurcation&lt;br/&gt;analyses.  It is believed that lessons learned from the three&lt;br/&gt;canonical problems to be studied here will be applicable to a broad&lt;br/&gt;class of fluid flow problems whose performance is sensitive to&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear vortex dynamics within shear layers.  The project will&lt;br/&gt;support close collaboration between the PI and United Technologies&lt;br/&gt;Research Center, whose engineers/scientists are searching for&lt;br/&gt;practical ways of incorporating triggering controllers into several&lt;br/&gt;products.  Furthermore, the proposed project will form a focal point&lt;br/&gt;around which to generate several undergraduate research projects. The&lt;br/&gt;PI has observed that such experiences, in which undergraduates make&lt;br/&gt;meaningful contributions, often buoy their motivation and desire for&lt;br/&gt;pursuing advanced degrees.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
