<AbstractNarration>This project establishes a Chemical Laboratory Technician (CLT) Program leading to an Associate of Arts degree at Mt. San Antonio College (Mt SAC). To accomplish this goal the program is developing four new courses, is purchasing an Atomic Absorption Spectrometer and a Gas Chromatograph, and is conducting instructional summer workshops. The proposed new course work was recommended by the project's Advisory Council Members and selected local industry representatives as necessary for Chemical Laboratory Technicians. The requested instrumentation is being used to support student education and laboratory activities. To promote the program, summer workshops are offered to potential new students and local high school faculty. These workshops are advertised to local high schools and an active student recruitment program is being pursued.  Graduates from this CLT program will be sufficiently trained to pursue careers in a variety of scientific industries. For those persons wishing to continue their education, an articulation agreement exists with California Polytechnic University at Pomona and provides a seamless transition for Mt SAC students to pursue a baccalaureate degree. Articulation agreements with other local California State Universities and the University of California at Riverside are under discussion.  Mt SAC is a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) with an enrollment of over 40,000 students.  Mt SAC's size and student population allows the unique opportunity to provide a science education to people of color, assist in improving local living standards and increase the numbers of underrepresented Hispanics in scientific careers.</AbstractNarration>
