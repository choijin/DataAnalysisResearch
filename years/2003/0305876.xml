<AbstractNarration>The main objective of the workshop is to create an environment for AMPATH participants, potential participants and those with a regional, hemispheric or international interest in the project to exchange ideas, form new and solidify existing collaborations and articulate specific Network Infrastructure needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will continue the work of identifying the universities and research centers in the AMPATH service area who require, or would take advantage of, high-performance connectivity to research institutions in the U.S. and worldwide if it were available.  Proposed speakers at the conference include researchers that participate in projects between collaborators in the U.S., Canada, the AMPATH service area, Europe and Asia/Pacific.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on last year's success with the "Workshop to Identify Areas of Scientific Collaboration between the US and the AMPATH Service Area (2002)," the First AMPATH International Conference, this "Fostering Collaborations and Next Generation Infrastructure" will further delve into the benefits of utilizing the AMPATH advanced networking infrastructure for scientific research and education.  The main objective of the conference is to create an environment for AMPATH participants, potential participants and those with a regional, hemispheric or international interest in the project to exchange ideas, form new and solidify existing collaborations.  The conference will continue the work of identifying the universities and research centers in the AMPATH service area who require, or would take advantage of  high-performance connectivity to research institutions in the US and worldwide if it were available.  Proposed speakers at the conference include researchers that participate in projects between collaborators in the U.S., Canada, the AMPATH service area, Europe and Asia/Pacific.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AMPATH is a project of Florida International University in collaboration with Global Crossing, in support of scientific research applications that either involve collaboration between U.S. and multi-national researchers or wholly run U.S. projects in the AMPATH service area.  Research and Education networks to the UCAID Abilene network and the Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean and the rest of the world to further advance U.S. science and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will produce a report summarizing the discussions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
