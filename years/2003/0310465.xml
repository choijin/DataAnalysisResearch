<AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21) In this special project the Center for Mathematics and Quantitative Education at Dartmouth (MQED) is facilitating the dissemination and adaptation of materials and resources that support efforts to improve quantitative literacy. Working with the National Numeracy Network (NNN) - an effort funded by the Woodrow Wilson Foundation - MQED is tracking and evaluating the usage of online modules that are being developed by faculty at member institutions in the numeracy network. The student audience for these materials ranges from secondary school to first and second year college level. Modules are adaptations of materials developed through collaborations with Hollins University and Edmonds Community College that are part of the Mathematical Sciences Across the Curriculum consortium formed as a result of a previous grant DUE-9552462. Project personnel are also working through the Mathematics Association of America and NNN to disseminate successful approaches through workshops.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
