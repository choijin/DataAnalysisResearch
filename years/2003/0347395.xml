<AbstractNarration>Due to the difficulties in precisely computing some of the key&lt;br/&gt;quantities, such as the channel capacities and the detection error&lt;br/&gt;probabilities, most of the current analytical work in wireless&lt;br/&gt;communications has been limited to asymptotic analysis in a number of&lt;br/&gt;mutually separated regimes. As a result, the engineering conclusions&lt;br/&gt;based on these studies are sometimes incompatible, making it hard to&lt;br/&gt;apply the analytical results in the designs of practical systems. The&lt;br/&gt;goal of this research is to develop novel approaches to address the&lt;br/&gt;interactions among several key system parameters, to understand the&lt;br/&gt;joint impacts of them, and to synthesize the different theoretical&lt;br/&gt;results into one unified picture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project studies the emerging new technologies in&lt;br/&gt;multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channels and ultra-wideband&lt;br/&gt;channels. Most current research on these systems has been focused on&lt;br/&gt;different limiting cases, including high/low signal power, wide/narrow&lt;br/&gt;bandwidth, and fast/slow time-variation of the channel.  Such&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic analysis greatly simplifies the problems. However, since&lt;br/&gt;usually one parameter is isolated and taken to its limit, the relation&lt;br/&gt;among different parameters is sometimes distorted, resulting in&lt;br/&gt;inconsistent conclusions. This project aims to solve such problems by&lt;br/&gt;developing new approaches to asymptotic analysis that address the&lt;br/&gt;interactions among several key system parameters, including channel&lt;br/&gt;time-variation, power and energy efficiency, bandwidth scaling,&lt;br/&gt;reliability and delay requirements, and peak-to-average ratio&lt;br/&gt;constraints. A key component of the new approach is to take multiple&lt;br/&gt;parameters to their limits together, but keep a carefully chosen&lt;br/&gt;relation among them. Such an approach, while maintaining the&lt;br/&gt;simplicity of the asymptotic analysis, helps to describe a continuum&lt;br/&gt;that bridges the gap between the current results for different extreme&lt;br/&gt;cases.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
