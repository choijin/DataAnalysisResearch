<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the feasibility of designing&lt;br/&gt;and building virtual classroom software tools for cheminformatics training in both academic and&lt;br/&gt;business settings. Mesa Analytics &amp; Computing, LLC has developed a commercial, integrated&lt;br/&gt;suite of the leading edge cheminformatics software tools in the cheminformatics areas mentioned&lt;br/&gt;above. However, these tools, containing new and original research by Mesa, are for use in large&lt;br/&gt;scale research and industrial applications, where the users already have experience in&lt;br/&gt;cheminformatics software. The research goals of this project are to show that virtual classroom&lt;br/&gt;software tools will be effective, comprehensive, and low cost products for training in both&lt;br/&gt;academic and industry settings. This project will assess the portability and scalability of&lt;br/&gt;software tools for interactive distance learning in chemical information topics, such as finding&lt;br/&gt;structural commonalities in diverse compound sets, generation and use of structural compound&lt;br/&gt;descriptors, similarity searching and clustering, and compound diversity analysis for compound&lt;br/&gt;acquisition. The project will produce a report outlining the design of the training software tools,&lt;br/&gt;including the graphical user interface and virtual classroom integration, from the underlying&lt;br/&gt;research and commercial tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At present there are no specific software tools for chemical information training in the U.S.,&lt;br/&gt;though there are several nascent chemometrics and chemical information university departments&lt;br/&gt;and curricula. A number of commercial software products used in the pharmaceutical and&lt;br/&gt;biotechnology industry are either too expensive or of limited utility for training in either&lt;br/&gt;academic or business settings. Converting Mesa's tools into training tools for concept learning&lt;br/&gt;will serve the dual purpose in providing cheminformatics training tools for both academia and&lt;br/&gt;industry. By employing distance learning through a web delivery system, the training software&lt;br/&gt;will provide an effective, low cost solution for academic institutions, whether they are offering a&lt;br/&gt;single course to rural students in a remote setting, or an entire program in cheminformatics and a&lt;br/&gt;major urban university. In addition, such training tools will be very useful in industry settings&lt;br/&gt;with local area networks, where in a multidiscipline setting individuals need to receive training&lt;br/&gt;on the concepts employed by industrial chemoinformatics software--an integral part of the drug&lt;br/&gt;discovery process for pharmaceutical and biotech industries.&lt;br/&gt;Key words: cheminformatics, chemometrics, clustering, compound diversity analysis for&lt;br/&gt;compound acquisition, distance learning, similarity searching, structural commonalities in&lt;br/&gt;diverse compound sets, structural compound descriptors, virtual classroom.&lt;br/&gt;Subtopic: B.
