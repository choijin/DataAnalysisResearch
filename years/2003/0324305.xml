<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;FEMA's USAR Task Force Deployments: Implications for The Management of&lt;br/&gt;Emergency Response&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Urban Search and Rescue taskforces (USAR) sponsored by FEMA are a&lt;br/&gt;key component of the federal emergency response system. This study&lt;br/&gt;examines the a. extent to which these taskforces are impacted by known&lt;br/&gt;problems at search and rescue (SAR) operations, as well as the solutions&lt;br/&gt;they have developed to these problems, and b. their interaction with law&lt;br/&gt;enforcement agencies, in what has become a critical factor in the&lt;br/&gt;conduct of present day SAR operations. Specifically, the research&lt;br/&gt;analyzes the relationships among FEMA USAR taskforces and support&lt;br/&gt;personnel, DoD support personnel, local agencies and state emergency&lt;br/&gt;management offices, other state and regional agencies present during&lt;br/&gt;major deployments, law enforcement agencies (FBI, local and state&lt;br/&gt;police), and volunteers. It also looks at the operation of the emergency&lt;br/&gt;medical system (EMS) during USAR deployments, particularly the securing&lt;br/&gt;and routing of injured persons and their transportation to medical&lt;br/&gt;facilities.  The study identifies areas of cooperation and conflict&lt;br/&gt;among these social actors, and changes in SAR operations and their&lt;br/&gt;impact on organizational culture, information, training, and purpose. &lt;br/&gt;It also develops an inclusive description of the types of collective&lt;br/&gt;actors that are present during USAR deployments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focus groups from ten USAR taskforces and approximately 100 in-depth&lt;br/&gt;interviews with representatives from other agencies and groups that&lt;br/&gt;participated in nine USAR national deployment sites are done to develop&lt;br/&gt;a useful blueprint for local, state, and federal agencies and private&lt;br/&gt;organizations to follow during participation in SAR operations. The&lt;br/&gt;intent is to improve the effectiveness of disaster responses and&lt;br/&gt;contribute to the social science understanding of the emergent&lt;br/&gt;multi-organizational SAR system as a form of organized, adaptive crisis&lt;br/&gt;response activity.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
