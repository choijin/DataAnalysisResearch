    <AbstractNarration>Systems which learn from data are by now widely used in many areas, and such systems will doubtless be&lt;br/&gt;even more ubiquitous in the future. As learning-based systems proliferate and are applied to larger and larger domains, the need for provably effective and efficient learning algorithms grows correspondingly more acute.&lt;br/&gt;The object of the proposed research is to design and analyze such algorithms. More specifically, building&lt;br/&gt;on the PI's previous work in this area, the two main research goals of this career development proposal are:&lt;br/&gt;1. To develop algorithms which can efficiently learn rich and important classes of Boolean functions&lt;br/&gt;in well-studied models of computational learning. Major focuses of this work will be (a)&lt;br/&gt;learning Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) formulas, which are a standard form of knowledge representation;&lt;br/&gt;(b) learning various classes of Boolean circuits, which can be substantially more expressive&lt;br/&gt;than DNF formulas; and (c) learning in the presence of irrelevant information, i.e. learning functions&lt;br/&gt;which depend only on a small unknown subset of domain attributes.&lt;br/&gt;We note that previous work in this area has uncovered many interesting and useful connections between&lt;br/&gt;these learning problems and complexity-theoretic structural questions about Boolean functions.&lt;br/&gt;An important aspect of this research (and indeed a key component of our methodology) is to continue&lt;br/&gt;to explore and exploit these connections between learning and complexity.&lt;br/&gt;2. To develop and analyze other well-motivated models for computational learning, and to develop&lt;br/&gt;efficient learning algorithms for Boolean function classes in these models. Anticipated research&lt;br/&gt;directions here include (a) giving efficient average-case learning algorithms for important concept&lt;br/&gt;classes for which no efficient worst-case algorithms are known; (b) developing a theory of learning&lt;br/&gt;from nonmalicious random examples; and (c) studying the role of quantum computation in learning&lt;br/&gt;theory. Each of these directions has the potential to yield positive learning results which go beyond&lt;br/&gt;what can be achieved in current standard learning models.&lt;br/&gt;This research plan is closely integrated with a plan to achieve broader impact through education which&lt;br/&gt;involves students at all levels. Highlights of the education plan include: (a) developing new computational&lt;br/&gt;learning theory courses and other theory courses at Columbia University for target audiences ranging from&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates to advanced graduate students; (b) introducing undergraduates to the excitement of research&lt;br/&gt;by actively engaging them in research, both in undergraduate courses and in extracurricular projects; (c)&lt;br/&gt;advising and guiding graduate students in their development as researchers and educators; and (d) building&lt;br/&gt;a strong theory group at Columbia by maintaining regular theory group meetings and organizing events such&lt;br/&gt;as Theory Day.</AbstractNarration>
