<AbstractNarration>ITR-Computationally-Enhanced Construction Kits:  Integrating Tangible and Computational Media for Construction and Design &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Construction kits-such as geometric design sets, erector sets, architectural blocks, anatomical models, chemical modeling kits-are toys designed for the building or assembly of physical models. Such kits have historically played a powerful educational role in children's lives. This project is developing a wide variety of computationally enhanced construction kits, focusing on scientific, mathematical, and engineering domains (such as solid geometry, molecular chemistry, architectural design, and anatomy). Through the use of embedded computation, pieces within a construction kit may communicate with each other, with desktop machines, and with their users; and overall, by integrating construction kits with computation, the educational power and expressiveness of these kits can be greatly increased.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work addresses a range of foundational questions, prominently including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[a] How to improve the technical design of such kits;&lt;br/&gt;[b] How to expand the scientific content of these kits; and&lt;br/&gt;[c] How to characterize the cognitive and educational benefits (if any) of such kits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addressing these questions, the PIs are using a strategy of comparative design: that is, they are systematically exploring a variety of design alternatives, characterizing the strengths and weaknesses of each, and attempting to "map out" the overall design space for construction kits.  The goals and subject matter of this project are capable of profound and widespread impact in the promotion of American science and mathematics education. Construction kits often have a central affective role in developing students' interests in science and mathematics. The advent of affordable materials for embedded computation in combination with both powerful software applications and the World Wide Web enables these kits to have a vastly more democratized and educationally potent role. New social structures can develop around physical constructional media; and these new structures could prove especially powerful in attracting traditionally underserved populations into scientific and technological careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
