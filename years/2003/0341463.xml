<AbstractNarration>Engineering NEC (59)  In response to the national need for increased mathematics and problem solving skills among engineering students, a team of faculty members from engineering and mathematics are creating pedagogical techniques and curriculum to develop problem solving skills that targets freshman who are ready to take calculus. The project is testing these techniques in one section of our first year Foundations of Engineering course (GES 131). A goal is to promote mastery and transfer of knowledge and skills in future coursework. The emphasis of the course is to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Challenge students and provide them with a high level of proficiency to solve "hard" problems, in which the method and concepts for solution are not immediately known.&lt;br/&gt;2. Develop student's conceptual understanding of the problem solving process by learning how to describe the methods that they used to solve the problem. &lt;br/&gt;3. Develop self-efficacy as students learn how to solve these "hard" problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The course engages the students in collaborative learning exercises, which provides a primary method for students to learn and practice explanation and self-explanation techniques. Additional instructional activities include cumulative review of mathematics concepts, hands on exercises, instruction in metacognition, presentations to external visitors, and students creating their own hard problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student learning within this section is being compared to student performance in other sections using traditional methods.  Assessment techniques include pre and post course testing of problem solving ability, pre and post course self efficacy questionnaires, reflective papers, focus groups, observation, and specific examination questions in subsequent math and physics courses.  The success of this proof of concept study is expected to lead to a full development effort that would develop a textbook and an extensive list of hard problems for others to use and adapt.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
