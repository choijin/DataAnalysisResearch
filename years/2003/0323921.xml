<AbstractNarration>The goal of this four-year project is to build upon and strengthen the highly successful Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics Scholars Program (CSEMS) at Texas Woman's University (TWU). The overwhelming success of the existing program demonstrates the intellectual merit of the proposed project. The TWU CSEMS Program is designed to better support low-income, academically talented women and minorities that wish to pursue computer science, engineering or mathematics. This project continues support through scholarships, expanded student-support programs, as well as industry and academic partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The clientele of TWU includes substantial numbers of those traditionally underrepresented in these areas, which lends itself to the broader impact of this project. Approximately 91% of TWU students are female, while racial and ethnic minorities account for approximately 32% of all students and over 37% of undergraduate students. The typical TWU student is age 31, maintains a family, attends school, and works. For many, the availability of financial support through scholarships in addition to academic and social support through faculty and peer mentors means the difference between graduation and dropping-out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs, along with representatives of the Science and Math Center for Women, Information Services, and the Financial Aid Office, will select 30 scholars. Applicants must demonstrate academic excellence and financial need, receive a letter of recommendation, and write a brief essay. Selected students will receive $3125 per academic year from the National Science Foundation. The most academically talented females will receive up to $2500 in additional funds from Texas Instruments, Inc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CSEMS students participate in a wide variety of departmental, university, and professional activities. In addition each receives faculty, industry, and peer mentors. In order to increase the pool of applicants, recruitment efforts are being expanded through increased cooperation with area community college faculty and staff, faculty and staff of universities serving as partners to the 3+2 Dual Degree Engineering Program and the TWU admissions office. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program evaluation is based on retention and graduation rates, growth in the number of departmental undergraduate and graduate students, and the participation rate of students in professional development opportunities. In addition, CSEMS participants will be tracked for job placement and advanced degree achievement.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
