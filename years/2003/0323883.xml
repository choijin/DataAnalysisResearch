<AbstractNarration>Contra Costa College is providing scholarships to low-income, academically talented students who show interest and promise in majoring in computer science, engineering, and mathematics. The objective is to award 72 two-year scholarships to students who enroll full-time into a computer science, engineering, or mathematics curriculum. Contra Costa College provides a student-support infrastructure through its Center for Science Excellence (CSE) that facilitates their successful graduation with an associate-level degree and transfer to a four-year college or university. The student-support infrastructure of the college coordinates formal study, work experience in science and technology, and various science- and technology-based activities through a social support system. It provides academic support in the form of mentoring, academic workshops, tutoring, internship opportunities, leadership development, scientific seminars, and field trips. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scholarship awards are being distributed to the recipients during the first and second years of enrollment at the College. Scholarship recipients enroll as full-time students, are expected to maintain a minimum 3.0 grade point average, and follow an educational plan prescribing a sequence of courses that enable them to graduate and transfer to a baccalaureate-granting institution. National Science Foundation scholarship money provides a unique opportunity for low-income students to gain access to a support system that would not normally be possible because of their need to concentrate their time on jobs rather than study. Experience shows that gaining access to a coordinated support system of mentoring, internships, and enrichment activities along with high academic expectations is an important contribution to success for the students. Without stipend or scholarship money, a large population of students is locked out of the mathematics/science pipeline. Scholarship money for low-income community college students is a beacon of hope for students who might not otherwise gain access to programs in computer sciences, engineering, or mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
