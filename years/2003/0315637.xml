<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the design and development of a Molecular Adhesion Measurement  Apparatus (MAMA) capable of detecting adhesion between adjacent polymeric films, as well as  the adhesion between polymeric films and other substrates. Fundamental principles governing rheo-photoacoustics will be examined in the context of the measurements of the adhesion. Since physico-chemical changes at the interface between two polymer surfaces have a significant effect on adhesion and molecular level processes associated with it, it is fair to utilize this approach which ultimately will lead to the advancement of our knowledge of adhesion. Furthermore, the development of a unique instrumentation capable of measuring molecular forces responsible for adhesion will open new avenues for studies of interfacial forces at nano-levels. An interdisciplinary group of polymer/material scientists at USM who are extensively involved in nationally important research programs request this instrument development. This apparatus will have significant impact on numerous existing and future research programs not only at USM, but nation and worldwide, as well as on the education of future generations of scientists.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instrumentation has application to experimental research efforts and student training in the areas of nano-composites, micro-domains, environmentally complaint composites, thin films and coatings, biomaterials, and biological studies. The instrument will enhance resolution along with improved instrumentation control capabilities, thereby increasing data throughput. Although the long-term benefits of the proposed instrument development are in the areas noted above, there are inherent tasks in education and training of the future cadre of scientists and researchers that necessitate the development of this instrument. Not only USM researchers and students benefit, but also over fifty major corporations that conduct sponsored research at USM have access to this instrumentation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
