<AbstractNarration>This project is developing curricular materials for a two-course sequence that introduces students at the post-calculus level to statistical concepts, methods, and theory. These courses are providing a more balanced introduction to the discipline of statistics than the standard sequence in probability and mathematical statistics. The materials incorporate features of successful statistics education projects, including development of students' conceptual understandings, student explorations through hands-on activities, analysis of genuine data, and integration of computer tools both to enhance students' learning and to analyze data efficiently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The student audience targeted by this project is particularly important because it has been overlooked by previous curricular reform projects focused on the introductory course for students with majors outside of mathematics. The proposed two-course sequence introduces mathematics and science majors to content and pedagogy, which prepare them well for careers in statistics or teaching. Because large numbers of mathematics majors become teachers at the secondary school level, these students must learn fundamental principles of data analysis to be able to teach according to NCTM standards.  This course is particularly appropriate as it teaches students in a discovery-oriented manner in which they should teach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to developing, testing and revising these materials, the project includes a significant program of dissemination and evaluation. The primary outcomes are two fully self-contained textbook/ workbooks, which integrate investigative activities with more traditional exposition. Other expected outcomes include a suite of Java applets designed to aid students' conceptual visualization and extensive support materials such as instructor's guides and sample examinations. A final anticipated outcome is a week-long faculty development workshop.</AbstractNarration>
