<AbstractNarration>The development of the single celled hairs (called trichomes) on the surface of the leaves of the model plant Arabidopsis is being used to address basic biological questions. While the nature of this research is basic, it also may have future practical applications. This is because the trichomes provide a barrier that helps protect many plants from insects, drought, or excess sunlight. Thus, information obtained from the study of Arabidopsis trichomes may lead to strategies to improve crop plants. Furthermore, many of the cellular processes that control trichome cell fate and differentiation are found in all eukaryotic cells. Thus, the analysis of trichomes may lead to a better understanding of cellular differentiation of all eukaryotic cells; both plant and animal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research also will provide a framework for enhancing the teaching of fundamental basic biological concepts to students. The trichomes are easy to study in a classroom setting and materials generated from this grant will be made available to 6-12 grade and undergraduate classrooms. These materials will aid in understanding the basic concepts of heredity as well as more advanced concepts concerning protein-protein interaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The actual focus of this research will be on an Arabidopsis mutant that exhibits unusual trichomes. The gene mutation responsible for the abnormal trichome development has been identified and found to be in a gene (called GL3) that is likely required for regulating the expression of many genes during trichome development. Furthermore, the protein encoded by the GL3 gene is known to interact with other proteins. This grant will fund the analysis of this mutant gene addressing such questions as: How does the GL3 mutation affect the ability of the resulting altered GL3 protein to interact with other proteins? Why does the mutation cause the trichomes to develop abnormally? Can mutations in other genes suppress the mutation in GL3? The answers to these questions will increase our knowledge of many basic cellular processes such as cell division, cell expansion, cell differentiation, and gene regulation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
