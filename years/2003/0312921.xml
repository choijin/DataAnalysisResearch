<AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This project deals with decision making,optimization,learning,and adaptation in uncertain&lt;br/&gt;and dynamic environments.The main objectives are:&lt;br/&gt;(a)To develop e .cient learning methods (either simulation-based or on-line)for construct-&lt;br/&gt;ing near-optimal policies for dynamic decision making in uncertain environments.&lt;br/&gt;(b)To develop new methods and to enhance the understanding of certain existing methods&lt;br/&gt;for addressing large scale dynamic decision-making problems.&lt;br/&gt;(c)To develop computational methods and learning algorithms that pertain to risk-sensitive&lt;br/&gt;performance criteria,as well as fundamental limitations in the form of computational&lt;br/&gt;complexity results.&lt;br/&gt;(d)To establish the fundamental limitations of learning in multi-armed bandit problems&lt;br/&gt;and Markov decision processes (MDPs),in the form of lower bounds on the amount of&lt;br/&gt;learning that is required,and simultaneously derive optimal algorithms whose require-&lt;br/&gt;ments match the lower bounds.&lt;br/&gt;(e)To develop new formulations,models,and algorithms for multi-agent learning and&lt;br/&gt;adaptation in dynamic environments.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research involves problems that are both practically relevant and intellec-&lt;br/&gt;tually deep.&lt;br/&gt;On the application side,the range of relevant contexts is vast.It includes logistics&lt;br/&gt;(e.g.,supply chain management,inventory control,.eet assignment),manufacturing systems&lt;br/&gt;(e.g.,sequencing and scheduling),communications (e.g.,frequency allocation and hando .&lt;br/&gt;management in wireless systems,routing and congestion control),.nance,robotics,and&lt;br/&gt;economic systems (e.g.,auctions and real-time markets).&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit arises because some of the problems present signi .cant mathe-&lt;br/&gt;matical challenges,that require new approaches as well as new problem formulations.This&lt;br/&gt;project will lead to advances in the scienti .c knowledge-base and the state of the art in&lt;br/&gt;the .eld of decision making.In addition,this research combines methods from operations&lt;br/&gt;research and control theory (dynamic programming),applied probability (stochastic approx-&lt;br/&gt;imation and large deviations),arti .cial intelligence (learning),and economics (game theory).&lt;br/&gt;As such,a broader impact of this work will be the advancement of the cross-fertilization of&lt;br/&gt;these disciplines.In more concrete terms,this cross-fertilization will occur not only through&lt;br/&gt;publications,but also through presentations at audiences from disparate communities (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;at machine learning as well as control theory conferences),and also through the development&lt;br/&gt;of new courses.Finally,at the human resource and training level,the most direct impact&lt;br/&gt;will occur through the mentoring of doctoral students,who will be expected to populate&lt;br/&gt;leading academic institutions.&lt;br/&gt;1</AbstractNarration>
