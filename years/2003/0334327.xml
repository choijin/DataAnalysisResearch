<AbstractNarration>The International Symposium on the Relations between Homgeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysis is a key forum for scientists throughout the world to explore the fundamental connections between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalytic science and engineering.  Northwestern University will host the symposium on July 20-25, 2003, which is the first time for a US location in over a decade.  The conference will feature plenary speakers, expert panelists from industry, government, and academia, and paper/poster presentations.  New topics for the conference include bio-and supra-molecular catalysis, catalysis as a route to new materials, the intersections between nanoscience and catalysis, green chemistry, and emerging physicochemical or theoretical techniques.  Three specific sessions will address new emphases involving international collaboration in "Nanotechnology and Catalysis", "Catalytic Issues in Green Chemistry", and "Graduate Research and Education in Catalysis."  Over 200 attendees are expected from academia, industry, and government laboratories.  Graduate and postdoctoral students will receive assistance from NSF funding to attend the symposium.  This will significantly increase the educational experience of these outstanding young researchers, especially since attendance at the US location is feasible.  The strong international aspects of the symposium will advance the student's appreciation of worldwide research in catalysis.  Students will have an excellent opportunity to learn about the newest research developments in their areas, dialog with other academic, industrial, governmental researchers, and advance their participation in professional societies.</AbstractNarration>
