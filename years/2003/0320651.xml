<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Black Hills State University (BHSU) under the direction of Dr. Shane K. Sarver to establish an Ecological Genomics Laboratory. This laboratory will offer cross-disciplinary research opportunities to faculty and students at BHSU in the emerging field of genomics. Two of the most recent advances, real-time PCR and DNA microarray techniques are breaking down the traditional boundaries separating the sub-disciplines in biology (i.e. physiology, ecology, genetics etc.) and compelling an integrated approach in biological research.  Real-time PCR is a powerful new technique with a variety of applications, ranging from genotyping and quantitative analysis of gene expression, to protein detection and quantification.  Microarray technology integrates the relationship between the gene and the phenotype and allows the researcher to examine groups of genes simultaneously in multiple contexts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Real time PCR combined with microarray techniques provide unparalleled opportunities to integrate genomics into other areas of biological research. Real time PCR will be used to genotype bison PrP genotypes and to screen for heterplasmic walleye. Microarrays will be used to examine expression of plant defense genes in Arabis under different ecological conditions.  A gel electrophoresis system will allow differentiation of alleles when internal probes for real-time PCR are not available, or are impractical; and a spectrophotometer that would allow quick and easy determination of nucleic acid concentration, purity and integrity in a sample.  The new Ecological Genomics Laboratory will be used to support a new undergraduate course titled Ecological Genomics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Hills State University is mainly an undergraduate institution in an EPSCoR state.  Nearly 75% of the biology majors at BHSU are from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences.  This percentage mainly includes women, but also several non-white ethnic groups of which Native Americans are the greatest proportion.  There are six Indian Reservations in the state of South Dakota. Over the past four years the Department of Science at BHSU has equipped a molecular genetics laboratory that supports research in the areas of conservation genetics, molecular systematics, molecular ecology and basic genetic research primarily using genotyping and gene sequencing (NSF proposal #9977226).  This facility was recently designated as the Western South Dakota DNA Core Facility (WSDDCF), serving not only university research needs, but also other public and private organizations, such as South Dakota Game Fish &amp; Parks and regional private ranchers.  This facility has also served as a training center for undergraduate students in genetics, cell biology, microbiology, and for those students conducting independent research projects in various areas of molecular genetics.  Three new biology faculty members (a molecular geneticist, a molecular ecologist and a functional evolutionary ecologist) have been hired in the last three years whose research benefits from the capabilities of the WSDDCF. The WSDDCF and the new Ecological Genomics Laboratory will complement one another and provide opportunities for cross-disciplinary research and collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
