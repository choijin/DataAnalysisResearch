<AbstractNarration>Proposal DMS-0354948&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Nonlinear partial differential equations&lt;br/&gt;PI: Qing Han, University of Notre Dame&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator plans to continue his work in partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations. A common theme of this project, and also of the research of the PI&lt;br/&gt;over the past several years, is the important role of the nodal sets of&lt;br/&gt;solutions to differential equations, or in general the level sets of the&lt;br/&gt;functions involved. The problems discussed in the project involve differential&lt;br/&gt;equations of various types, elliptic, hyperbolic and of mixed type. Some&lt;br/&gt;problems have close connections with other fields in mathematics, including&lt;br/&gt;several complex variables and algebraic geometry. One class of problems that&lt;br/&gt;the PI would continue to work on includes the geometric structure of level sets&lt;br/&gt;of solutions, in particular the nodal sets, the singular sets and the branch&lt;br/&gt;sets. An important part of the study is the investigation of the asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;behavior of solutions near these sets or the asymptotic behavior of these sets&lt;br/&gt;themselves. Another class of problems that the PI would continue to work on&lt;br/&gt;involves the effect of level sets of known functions in the equations on the&lt;br/&gt;properties of solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems involving singular sets originate from the material science and the&lt;br/&gt;control theory. Singular sets, as the name suggests, are those sets where&lt;br/&gt;singularities occur. Precise definitions vary according to problems where they&lt;br/&gt;arise. In reality it is impossible to eliminate the singular sets, the&lt;br/&gt;so-called `bad sets'. One of the central tasks is to identify the conditions&lt;br/&gt;under which the singular sets can be controlled and the conditions under which&lt;br/&gt;the singular sets are small. The proposed problems concerning singular sets in&lt;br/&gt;the project are in their simplest forms. They are related to the Erickson's&lt;br/&gt;model for liquid crystals and the Ginzburg-Landau equation in the&lt;br/&gt;superconductivity. The PI believes that the discussion of these mathematical&lt;br/&gt;problems would improve the methods to control the singular sets in various&lt;br/&gt;applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
