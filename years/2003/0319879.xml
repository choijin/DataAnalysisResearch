    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop custom signal processing algorithms and embedded software for arrays of tiny neural probes that are currently being manufactured for simultaneously recording the activity of multiple neurons. Most of the effort expended to date on neural probes has focused on the formidable challenges of manufacturing the hardware elements of the probes. One crucial element for making neural communications via probes technically and commercially viable has received little attention. Advanced signal processing technologies needed to condition, recover and transmit the signals from neurons, and to deliver transmitted neural stimulus to muscle tissue has received little attention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop algorithms and embedded software that will render neural probes more reliable and practical. Neural probes so equipped can reliably capture, condition, filter, transmit and receive neural signals, and restore the needed high degree of repeatability and consistency to their operation. This, in turn, will accelerate the deployment of the probes, greatly enhancing the value of the substantial investment in neural probes to date.</AbstractNarration>
