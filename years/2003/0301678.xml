<AbstractNarration>In recent years, much research effort has gone into the development of different passive and active damping layer configurations.  Some hybrid configurations have shown the promise of producing greater damping levels than is possible with purely active or purely passive damping layers.  However, prior studies, (including optimization studies) have assumed a certain topology of the various constituents.  The proposed research will use the homogenization method to optimize the topology of laminated active and passive damping treatments, producing the optimal configuration of the various damping components.  Five cases will be examined, with the problem complexity increasing with each successive case:&lt;br/&gt;1) A plain viscoelastic damping treatment;&lt;br/&gt;2) A viscoelastic and stiff elastic treatment, such as a constrained damping layer;&lt;br/&gt;3) A plain piezoelectric treatment;&lt;br/&gt;4) A piezoelectric and viscoelastic treatment, such as an active constrained damping layer;&lt;br/&gt;5) A piezoelectric, viscoelastic, and stiff elastic treatment, such as an active damping composite.&lt;br/&gt; Structures will be optimized to maximize the damping properties (measured by the system loss factor and/or peak displacement in the base elastic structure) over the first mode.  Several different control strategies will also be examined for Cases 3, 4, and 5, and the impact of the control strategy on the resulting topology and the optimum objective will be examined.  Finally, the computational results will be confirmed experimentally.&lt;br/&gt; This research will involve both graduate and undergraduate students.  It is expected that certain aspects of the material will be integrated into existing graduate and undergraduate courses, giving a wide range of students some familiarity with the topic.  Concern will be taken to recruit students from underrepresented groups, and to involve Master's level students in presenting research results in regional and international conferences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
