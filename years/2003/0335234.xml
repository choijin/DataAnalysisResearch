<AbstractNarration>A critical issue for t e development of future network and distributed system technologies is the availabil-&lt;br/&gt;ity of testbed infrastructure for conducting research.Availability as three components.First,it requires&lt;br/&gt;that testbeds provide a set of diverse and modern networking resources in realistic scenarios:environments&lt;br/&gt;that include PCs,(potentially mobile)wireless and sensor nodes,commercial-quality switches and routers,&lt;br/&gt;and modern network interconnects.Second,availability requires software to e .ectively manage the use of&lt;br/&gt;these resources:this requires providing "hardware level" access to experimenters,through a uni .ed and re-&lt;br/&gt;motely accessible user interface,in a manner that also ensures security both inside and outside experimental&lt;br/&gt;environments.Third,availability requires infrastructure for experiment manipulation,monitoring,measure-&lt;br/&gt;ment,and validation:e.g.,the ability to inject network tra .c and faults,the ability to obtain precise data&lt;br/&gt;from experiments,and the assurance that the testbed is an accurate model of the real world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work described in this proposal is to build on the University of Utah 's Netbed to address the three&lt;br/&gt;aspects of availability described above.The 165,000 line Netbed software system is e .ectively an operating&lt;br/&gt;system for experiments in distributed systems and networking.The bulk of its code is independent of&lt;br/&gt;the network 's actual mec anisms,so it presents a common interface to experimenters across a variety of&lt;br/&gt;mec anisms,including real networks,emulated networks in a cluster,and simulated networks.Netbed 's&lt;br/&gt;support for ybrid experimentation allows .exible combinations of real code,abstracted tra .c generation,&lt;br/&gt;synthetic network environments,and real networks.Emulab Netbed 's primary resource,is an extremely&lt;br/&gt;successful 170-node,time-and space-shared automated cluster testbed that as been in 24/7 production use&lt;br/&gt;for several years.Netbed is currently being used by 440 researchers,from 50 institutions,for over 80 projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will provide deliverables in four areas.First,the existing Emulab cluster and its&lt;br/&gt;interconnect will be enlarged and modernized.Emulab will grow to provide continuing service to the public,&lt;br/&gt;including user support.The complementary Utah and Wisconsin facilities (WAIL)will be linked,allowing&lt;br/&gt;resource allocation and co-scheduling across them.This will provide a seamless transition from simulation,&lt;br/&gt;through emulation on PC-based routers,to large-scale testing on real routers.Second,Netbed will be&lt;br/&gt;extended to control,as transparently to users as possible,many additional kinds of network devices and&lt;br/&gt;deployments.Netbed will provide four di .erent platforms of wireless,sensor,and mobile devices,ranging&lt;br/&gt;from a .xed array of wireless nodes (a "tabletop" environment)to an actual set of mobile devices deployed&lt;br/&gt;on a campus scale.The Netbed facilities will also be generalized with the addition of "hard" devices -&lt;br/&gt;IP routers,layer 1 switches,optical devices,Intel IXPs,and nodes deployed in the wide-area - as well&lt;br/&gt;as new "soft" devices suc as virtual nodes and links to enable experiments at 1 - 2 orders of magnitude&lt;br/&gt;greater scale.Third,the Netbed system,speci .cally the Emulab cluster,will be "hardened"  so that,when&lt;br/&gt;deployed,it can safely quarantine malicious code while still being remotely accessible to researchers.The&lt;br/&gt;enhanced Emulab will be able to serve as a testbed for most network security researc and evaluation,suc&lt;br/&gt;as worm containment,IP traceback,intrusion detection,and counter measures for denial-of-service (DoS),&lt;br/&gt;and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)attacks.Support for researc in these areas will require Emulab to&lt;br/&gt;support osts running Microsoft Windows.Fourth,new software will provide a comprehensive system for&lt;br/&gt;realistic network tra .c generation,network tra .c measurements,and a measurement arc ive.A wide area&lt;br/&gt;network monitoring system and measurement archive will provide important data to Netbed researchers and&lt;br/&gt;the community at large.It will also serve as the primary source of data from whic we can validate our&lt;br/&gt;modeling and test e .orts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed work lies in the creation of new technologies for networking and&lt;br/&gt;distributed system experimentation.This work will develop new techniques for integrating widely varied&lt;br/&gt;resources,both actual and simulated,both hardware and software,within a single and uni .ed experimental&lt;br/&gt;framework.This work will be realized in an expanded Emulab cluster,whic will continue to be available to&lt;br/&gt;researchers,and it will also be realized in Netbed 's software that can be used by other institutions that wish&lt;br/&gt;to run their own testbeds - separately,or in cooperation with Netbed.This ties directly to the broader&lt;br/&gt;impacts of the proposed work.The creation and delivery of an expanded Emulab,as well as the software&lt;br/&gt;capable of managing similar testbeds,will result in new testbeds and new testbed capabilities being made&lt;br/&gt;available to researchers worldwide.This will directly advance the development of future systems,as well as&lt;br/&gt;the teac ing and training of students and computing professionals.</AbstractNarration>
