    <AbstractNarration>Surfaces of many engineering structures are designed as doubly curved shapes to fulfill functional requirements such as hydrodynamic, aesthetic, or structural. Experiments have shown that it is feasible to laser form 3D shapes such as doubly curved shapes, but forming accuracy issues need to be better understood via enhanced process prediction capability. Similarly, the process synthesis schemes developed for laser forming (LF) of simple shapes need further advancement for 3D LF process. This project is aimed at significantly advancing the state of knowledge LF technology, from idealized to more practical shapes, and from analysis to synthesis. The modeling and synthesis efforts will be accompanied by an experimental program including pre- and post-forming microstructure and mechanical property characterizations. Other high temperature deformation processes will be able to leverage upon the improved understanding and synthesis capabilities to be developed in the project. Practically, the success of the project will open-up new opportunities for manufacturing of high performance but conventionally hard-to-form materials, leading to innovative applications, thus opening new design options. The development of reliable process synthesis schemes will enable the process make its way to industrial applications, as a rapid prototyping tool for high production volume and a flexible manufacturing tool for low production volume sheet metal working. The results will have a significant impact on the economy and industry competitiveness since sheet metal working is so pervasive. Results from this project will be integrated into a graduate level course. Efforts will be made to involve undergraduate students, and to identify and recruit qualified students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>
