<AbstractNarration>University of California Los Angeles, Center for Embedded Networked Sensing (CENS), proposes to design a model undergraduate research experience maximizing those features and components of other undergraduate research programs that are most effective in promoting women's longer-term commitment to science and engineering.  The design will be based on a survey of many examples of research experiences for undergraduates (REU's) implemented to date, and, based on published research and evaluation results of REU's.  The project will exhibit a model of "REU best practices."  CENS has chosen the disciplines of engineering, computer science, and the physical sciences to focus efforts because of the low representation of women in these three doctoral fields.  Students will be recruited from Mills College and Harvey Mudd College, in partnership with the UCLA Center for Excellence in Engineering and Diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is widely accepted that REU's are a significant positive experience for students, but the reasons why are not well known.  The project will test its model by conducting a program for female students at CENS, and evaluate the results.  The expected outcomes for students include: increased hands-on skill set and research experience; improved teamwork, problem-solving, presentation, and content skills as identified by project; improved self-confidence and increased positive attitudes towards respective disciplines; increased number applying for and participating in undergraduate research experiences; increased retention through graduation in respective disciplines; and increased interest and participation in pursuing graduate study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use a systems approach as a framework for the three main components of programs currently being implemented at institutions across the country:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Environment: A research environment that offers women undergraduates experiences in leading research with direct societal implications (e.g., environmental, safety, educational). The connection between the research environment and the societal implications generates a medium through which successful recruitment can occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Experience: A research experience structured so as to promote successful and productive outcomes for students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Engagement: A vital support structure to ensure academic and social integration for each student. The model program proposed in this project will allow for a more comprehensive understanding regarding which engagement strategies are most effective for women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  The work will provide faculty members and administrators of undergraduate research programs in engineering, physical sciences and computer science with tools for developing successful undergraduate research programs for their students, with particular effectiveness for female students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
