<AbstractNarration>0332583&lt;br/&gt;Ballato&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to Clemson University to support the activity described below for 36 months.  The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF-03521).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners&lt;br/&gt;The partners include Clemson University (Lead Institution), University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Western Carolina University, Greenville Technical College, TriCounty Technical College, Alcoa-Fujikura, Bell South, Cisco Systems, Kigre, Pirelli Communications Cables and Systems North America, Tetramer Technologies, Carolina Crescent Coalition, Greenville Chamber of Commerce, Optical Society of America, Upstate Alliance, Upstate Council on Economic Development, and Ottawa Photonics Cluster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop and grow the photonics industry in South Carolina by: (1) developing an expert workforce, (2) improving transfer of academic innovation to industry, and (3) providing enhanced entrepreneurial resources to support the industry. The project is designed to promote transfer of new technology from university to the photonics industry, to develop a workforce to meet the needs of the emerging industry, to promote inclusion of underrepresented populations in the high tech industry, and to have a sustained impact on the local economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Economic Impact&lt;br/&gt;The economic fortunes of South Carolina have been tied to agriculture and textiles for many years. Automation in agriculture and globalization of the textiles industry have depressed employment opportunities and suppressed economic growth for the citizens of the state. The award fosters development of a skilled workforce in photonics and provides transfer of new knowledge based on research at the universities to companies to create jobs for the workforce. The subsequent economic well being will be a major outcome of the activities of the award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the activity lies in its focus on establishing an extended regional partnership including researchers, educators, industrial partners, economic development groups, and entrepreneurs that can help South Carolina create the innovation infrastructure needed to realize economic benefits from the photonics research already being performed at Clemson University and the other partner institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the activity include increasing the content of science, engineering, and business in the education of students at all levels from K-12, 2-year, 4-year, and post-graduate schools in the region, as well as raising the wages in the region by creating higher paying high tech jobs in the emerging photonics sector. Underrepresented groups will participate in all levels of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
