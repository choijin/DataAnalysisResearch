<AbstractNarration>This project will support attendance of young researchers in the ASM Conference on Integrating Metabolism and Genomics (IMAGE) to be held in Montreal, Canada from April 30 - May 3, 2004. In recent years significant new tools for studies of bacterial metabolism have been developed. Included among these are the complete sequencing of many microbial genomes, the ability to comprehensively monitor gene expression at the transcript and polypeptide level and measure outputs of such expression including the flux of metabolites through the biochemical networks and wide varieties of phenotypes. This systems-level biology holds great promise. Technological advances have changed how the molecular biologist approaches metabolic problems in profound ways and have led to an influx of scientists and engineers neither constrained nor necessarily conversant with the classical views. Thus this proposed conference serves an important purpose, to ensure that diverse researchers interested in understanding bacterial metabolism have a forum for initiating and fostering interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Once the province of biochemists the field of microbial metabolism is now occupied by a diverse set of theoreticians, informaticians, mathematicians and engineers as well as by the more traditional genetics, molecular biology and biochemistry communities. The purpose of this conference is to foster an ongoing dialog between these communities at multiple levels ranging from the established investigator to students that are midway through obtaining their advanced degrees. Considering the emerging nature of the field, the conference will have a substantial educational impact on the training of young researchers.</AbstractNarration>
