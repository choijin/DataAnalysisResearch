<AbstractNarration>This is a study of the hydrothermal systems at the Ridge 2000 East Pacific Rise Integrated Studies site at 9 degrees north.  During the past decade pronounced temporal variability in the hydrothermal fluids have been observed, and the chemical data have been interpreted to suggest that the changes in fluid composition reflect changes in the depth of hydrothermal circulation.  Three hypotheses will be addressed in the current project.  Changes in the depth of phase separation reflect changes in depth to the heat source.  Magma has migrated upward and will soon erupt and/or result in another diking event.  Changes in fluid compositions, reflecting changes in the pressure-temperature conditions of reaction and phase separation, are the causes of changes in the biological communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Dissolved fraction major ion chemical compositions for the 9&deg;N fluids have been analyzed, and, subsequently, end member fluid compositions for the major ions have been calculated. A comparison of pre- and post- eruptive fluid compositions demonstrate that the vapors (fluids with chlorine contents less than that of seawater) were common after both the 1991/1992 and the 2005/2006 eruptions.  Similarly, the temperature traces for the fluids showed the biggest diversions following the eruptions before returning to a state of equilibrium. Distinctive chemical signatures from closely juxtaposed vents (and on occasion even closely spaced orifices within the same vent) are a manifestation of a highly complex plumbing system.  The relatively small variations in chemistry of discrete samples collected over a long time series demonstrate some vents preserve distinctive chemical signatures over substantial periods of time (~ 10 years).   Time-series data, coupled with models defining the pressures and temperatures of fluid-rock equilibration, provide insight into fluid circulation depth and proximity to the heat source and changes over time in these key parameters.
