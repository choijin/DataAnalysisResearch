<AbstractNarration>9984378&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) research and education project involves the formation and operation of GeoWorks, an organizational framework within which research and teaching in geotechnical engineering formally brings together students from civil engineering with other disciplines (mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, materials science, and engineering physics) to pursue innovation and invention in geotechnology, particularly geo-construction.  The mission of GeoWorks is to develop intelligence-based processes and products in geo-construction by fusing state-of-the-art advances from other disciplines with a soils knowledge base that is itself being advanced to accommodate intelligence-based methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One initial focus of GeoWorks is the pursuit of intelligent vibratory soil compaction, where the adoption of state-of-the-art feedback control, microsensors, and microprocessors, coupled with a developed knowledge base of the soil compaction process, provides a means whereby soil can be compacted in an autonomous and optimal fashion.  The research focuses on detailed characterization of the vibratory soil compaction process, application of microsensors to monitor compaction, and development of feedback architecture to control soil compaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GeoWorks studio, with its focus on the pursuit of innovation in geo-construction, is intended to be offered as a regular part of the College of Engineering curriculum.  Participants of the GeoWorks studio include: undergraduate and beginning graduate students from civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering, as well as materials science and engineering physics; Ph.D. student mentors from civil, mechanical, electrical, and materials science; and graduate students from geotechnical engineering.  Through teamwork, inquiry-based discovery, and mentoring, multidisciplinary student groups develop problem statements and propose innovative solutions.  Student groups advance the proposed innovation to the prototype stage, communicating progress and final reports, as well as writing proposals for continued development and commercialization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GeoWorks framework builds synergy in research and teaching through true integration; students develop innovative technologies and advance the geotechnical knowledge base while immersed in active, inquiry-based discovery and design.  To promote diversity, GeoWorks seeks participation by minorities and women, with the goal of increasing the percentage of minorities and women in engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
