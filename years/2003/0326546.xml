<AbstractNarration>Despite decades of research in extensible operating system&lt;br/&gt;technology, extensions such as device drivers remain&lt;br/&gt;a significant cause of system failures. In Windows XP, for example,&lt;br/&gt;drivers account for 85% of recently reported failures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the researchers are developing a reliability subsystem&lt;br/&gt;for commodity operating systems.  Their approach is&lt;br/&gt;to improve OS reliability by isolating the OS from driver&lt;br/&gt;failures.  Rather than guaranteeing&lt;br/&gt;complete fault tolerance through a new (and incompatible) OS or&lt;br/&gt;driver architecture, their goal is to prevent the  vast majority of&lt;br/&gt;driver-caused crashes with little or no change to existing&lt;br/&gt;driver and system code.  To achieve this, they isolate drivers within&lt;br/&gt;lightweight protection domains inside the kernel address space.&lt;br/&gt;Drivers run largely unchanged in kernel mode, but are prevented&lt;br/&gt;from corrupting the kernel by both software and hardware means.  The &lt;br/&gt;system&lt;br/&gt;also tracks a driver's use of kernel resources to hasten automatic&lt;br/&gt;clean-up during recovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To prove the viability of their approach, they are implementing a system&lt;br/&gt;called "Nooks" in the Linux operating system and are using it&lt;br/&gt;to fault-isolate several device&lt;br/&gt;drivers.  Their initial results show that Nooks offers a substantial &lt;br/&gt;increase&lt;br/&gt;in the reliability of operating systems, catching and quickly&lt;br/&gt;recovering from 99% of the faults that would otherwise crash the system.&lt;br/&gt;While Nooks was designed for drivers, their techniques generalize to&lt;br/&gt;other kernel extensions as well.  The researchers are demonstrating&lt;br/&gt;this by isolating a kernel-mode file system and an&lt;br/&gt;in-kernel Internet service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, because Nooks supports existing C-language extensions, runs on &lt;br/&gt;a&lt;br/&gt;commodity operating system and commodity hardware, and enables&lt;br/&gt;automated recovery, it represents a substantial step beyond the&lt;br/&gt;specialized architectures and type-safe languages required by previous&lt;br/&gt;efforts directed at safe extensibility.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
