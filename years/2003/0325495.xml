    <AbstractNarration>The fundamental premise of the research is that P2P networking will revolutionize the Internet and computing over the next ten years. P2P networking has numerous important uses beyond file sharing. P2P networking will transform the Internet from a shared bandwidth infrastructure into a combined bandwidth/storage/computing infrastructure, creating a massive, global virtual computer system, which will be shared by users around the world. Commensurate with industrial deployments and computer science systems research in P2P, this research project launches a major parallel activity in P2P networking theory. It addresses two basic research challenges: &lt;br/&gt; P2P systems are enormously complex and create a networking environment that is significantly different from the traditional client/server model. &lt;br/&gt; It is difficult to evaluate new design proposals through online experimentation and simulation. Thus the need for a major activity in P2P networking theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project brings together three institutions to create a center in P2P theory. &lt;br/&gt;The research combines expertise in computer networking, the Internet, and distributed systems along with modeling, stochastic networks, optimization and distributed algorithms. Often, these "regions" of expertise look at problems in their own way, and there is limited interaction between these regions. This proposal will not only produce more profound results in the P2P area because of the combination of perspectives, but should provide an opportunity for these "regions" to learn more about one another's methods and approaches, facilitating future collaborations in other endeavors. The research project is organized along three major axes: availability, efficiency, and usability. It includes major activities in security and incentives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will hold monthly one-day workshops during the academic years. A significant participation from both academic and industrial researchers is expected, as well as a significant industrial involvement in much of the research. A set of performance and simulation software will be developed and made available through the Center's site. Much of the knowledge gained through the proposed research will be disseminated to students worldwide through publications in text books and journal articles.</AbstractNarration>
