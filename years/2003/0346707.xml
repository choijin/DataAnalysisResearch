    <AbstractNarration>This collaborative project focuses on detection and control of spin transport in nanoscale magnetic heterostructures, which have recently been at the heart of two distinct areas, spintronics and quantum-information processing. The main goal of the project is to develop advanced techniques for the detection of spin transfer by the resulting nanomechanical torque. Conversely, spin current and spin population can be created by the application of external torque. This experimental effort will build upon the recent progress in ultra-sensitive force detection methods in nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS) and advanced techniques for fabrication of multi-layered, suspended hybrid nanostructures with magnetic and non-magnetic materials. Complementary experiments will be carried out in the nanoscale research laboratory at Boston University and the high-field, low-temperature measurement facilities in Centre de Recherches sur les Tres Basses Temperatures (CRTBT) at the Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientific (CNRS), Grenoble, France. Both faculty and graduate students will participate in long-term exchanges between these institutions. The students will gain valuable exposure from the international collaboration on these joint experiments. This NSF project is co-funded by the Division of Materials Research and International Office (Western Europe) as a Cooperative Activity in Materials Research between the NSF and the European Community. The project will be carried out in collaboration with CNRS, Grenoble, France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative research project between Boston University and the Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientific (CNRS), Grenoble, France. This project focuses on a novel approach of detecting and controlling electron spin by nanomechanical torque. Manipulation of electron spin by torque avoids the ubiquitous problem in spintronics, namely the extraction of spin information from a charge current. This project will have joint experiments in both Boston University and CNRS to take advantage of the complementary expertise and facilities. Structure fabrication and measurements will be carried out in the nanoscale research laboratory at Boston University, and characterization measurements will be done at the high-field, low-temperature measurement facilities in Centre de Recherches sur les Tres Basses Temperatures (CRTBT) at the CNRS, Grenoble, France. Both faculty and graduate students will participate in long-term exchanges between these institutions. The students will gain valuable exposure from the close collaboration with the international researchers.
