    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes a new technique for rapid Karyotyping based on a "ChromArray" device, which would allow the collection of a large number of chromosome spreads in a precise array. By collecting the inherent spectrum of chromosomes, the addition of dye is not necessary. Each physical coordinate within the karyotype would contain a third axis (spectra), adding further criteria for automated karyotpying of large number of chromosome spreads simultaneously. This project will investigate a technique of karyotyping that permits rapid identification of chromosomal alterations, thereby identifying chromosomal abnormalities of a large array of chromosome samples simultaneously. Therefore a large number of cells from the human body (of which there are 200 cell types) can be studied, to screen for genetic disorders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project is in the area of human healthcare. The use of chromarray technology and near field optical microscopy would impact a variety of clinical disease assays when completely implemented.</AbstractNarration>
