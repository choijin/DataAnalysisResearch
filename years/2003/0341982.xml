<AbstractNarration>Recently Meshless Methods, and the closely related Generalized&lt;br/&gt;Finite Element Methods, for the numerical solution of partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations came into the forefront of interest,&lt;br/&gt;especially in the engineering community. For example, in the last&lt;br/&gt;two years several engineering books on the subject&lt;br/&gt;appeared, an international conference was organized, and many&lt;br/&gt;engineering papers were published. These methods generalize the&lt;br/&gt;classical Finite Element Method in that they are neither based on a &lt;br/&gt;mesh nor on classical polynomial approximation. The theoretical underpinning&lt;br/&gt;and general state of the art for these methods is similar to that&lt;br/&gt;of the Finite Element Method in the 1960s, when already&lt;br/&gt;engineering computations based on heuristic principles were done,&lt;br/&gt;but the theory had not been developed. This research  will address&lt;br/&gt;the theoretical and implementational basis of these methods in&lt;br/&gt;conjunction with applications. The most important feature of Meshless &lt;br/&gt;Methods is their flexibility and potential. It is a challenge to &lt;br/&gt;employ this flexibility to achieve their potential: the solution of&lt;br/&gt;today's complex problems, with the consideration of the rapidly&lt;br/&gt;decreasing ratio of cost of computer arithmetical operations to&lt;br/&gt;the human effort. These issues will be investigated in this research &lt;br/&gt;project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposal lies in the mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;computational science aspects of Meshless Methods. The broader&lt;br/&gt;mathematical impact includes the understanding of these methods&lt;br/&gt;and their potential, which will be directly reflected in the&lt;br/&gt;performance of the methods on complex problems of solid and&lt;br/&gt;fluid mechanics, for example, multiscale problems. It is likely&lt;br/&gt;that the development of the mathematical foundation of Meshless&lt;br/&gt;Methods will have similar or larger impact than the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;development of the 1970s and 1980s had on the Finite Element Method.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this  proposal is in its simultaneous&lt;br/&gt;consideration of mathematical theory, modeling of engineering and&lt;br/&gt;scientific problems, computational issues, and engineering&lt;br/&gt;computational experience.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
