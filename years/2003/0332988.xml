<AbstractNarration>0332988&lt;br/&gt;Saltz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for thirteen US computer scientists to participate in a US-organized workshop at the International Conference on Computational Science, being held in Melbourne, Australia in June 2003.  The thirteen scientists are representatives of thirteen U.S. information technology research (ITR) groups funded by NSF.  The unifying theme of these researchers' work and for the workshop is the new computational paradigm, Dynamic Data Driven Application Systems (DDDAS).  Computational science offers application-driven solutions for problems in a wide range of disciplines including but not limited to atmospheric sciences, geosciences, biology; these challenges are increasingly being tackled through the collaborative efforts of international multidisciplinary research teams.  The funded participants will focus on the role of distributed and grid based computing systems in the modeling of complex systems and in the development of sophisticated algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will showcase ongoing research of the US ITR research groups and it is also firmly planned in advance to serve as a catalyst for the development of new long-term collaborations between US researchers in this field and their counterparts in Australia, New Zealand and East Asia. The proposal described highly relevant research by over a dozen leading-edge researchers and groups in Australia and New Zealand that are either current or past collaborators or the focus of planned visits to establish collaborative research plans. These new international research partnerships will be designed to provide opportunities for US graduate students, post-docs and junior faculty to interact directly with the foreign collaborators. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
