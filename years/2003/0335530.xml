<AbstractNarration>PI: Rajagopalan Balaji; University of Colorado&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The assessment and prediction of structural system reliability in the face of hurricanes are &lt;br/&gt;of great interest to our nation. Several public and private planning and disaster management agencies  need  such  information  for  developmental  planning  and  disaster  mitigation  strategies. Also, insurance agencies are interested in the structural reliability estimates to evaluate and set premium levels. Models for structural risk and reliability exist in the private sector but they are not public domain, and often they  are  adhoc in nature. Furthermore, these models evaluate structural reliability in isolation of realistic likelihood estimates of hurricane frequencies, magnitudes and their associated characteristics (such as winds, precipitation and floods). Thus, there is a real need for the development of an integrative framework that has a realistic hurricane track simulation model coupled with a structural risk/reliability model, to generate static (long term) and dynamic (time varying) structural risks and also the capability to classify structures as per their reliability.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objectives of the study  &lt;br/&gt;With the need for a comprehensive and integrated framework as the motivation, the aim of the proposed study is to demonstrate the feasibility of the integrative framework. To this end the objectives are: &lt;br/&gt;1. Use the historical hurricane track data to compute probabilities of occurrences of .events at any desired location (events are defined by threshold exceedence of wind speed and precipitation, as wind speed are the key loading factors on structures). Also estimate these probabilities conditioned on climate indications [e.g., El-Nino Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation etc.]. &lt;br/&gt;2.  To  develop  structural  load  probabilities  on  different  class  of  structures  (e.g.,  timber, masonary, concrete etc.) based on .event. probabilities developed from above. &lt;br/&gt;3. To develop structural reliability  estimates (both stationary and time varying)  conditioned upon the load probabilities. These outcomes will help us in implementing this framework with hurricane track simulation &lt;br/&gt;models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit  &lt;br/&gt;This proposal attempts to develop cross-disciplinary framework for structural risk/reliability  assessment  in  the  face  of  hurricanes.  The  approach  is  unique  in  that  it  brings together the knowledge of (a) Atlantic hurricane variability (both in terms of the number of hurricanes and the tracks); (b) Estimating probabilities of associated components (precipitation, winds, flooding  etc.) using nonparametric functional estimation techniques, (c) probabilistic structural load estimation, and (d) Bayesian techniques for structural risk/reliability assessment to develop long term and time varying risk estimates. This unique and integrative approach to a practical problem is the main intellectual merit of this proposal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts  &lt;br/&gt;The  outcomes  from  this  study  will  significantly  help  in  developing  applying  this framework in conjunction with a stochastic hurricane track simulation model, for the entire US coast and  for different structural  groups. This will also supplement the HAZUS initiative by FEMA for  enhancing the nation.s risk assessment capabilities under natural hazards. These outcomes will be extremely helpful for their contributions to the knowledge base and intellectual growth in the area of civil infrastructure assessment as well as the reduction of risks induced by hurricanes.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
