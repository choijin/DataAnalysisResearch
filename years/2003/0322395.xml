<AbstractNarration>The motivation for studying walking robots arises from diverse sociological and commercial&lt;br/&gt;interests, ranging from the desire to replace humans in hazardous occupations, to the restoration of&lt;br/&gt;motion in the disabled, the possibility of using legged locomotion in terrain that is unsuitable for&lt;br/&gt;wheeled locomotion, and the psychological appeal of machines that operate in anthropomorphic or&lt;br/&gt;animal-like ways. Feedback control is an integral part of achieving bipedal locomotion.&lt;br/&gt;Control system design for biped robots poses numerous challenges due to the many degrees of&lt;br/&gt;freedom in the mechanisms, the intermittent and unilateral nature of the contact conditions with&lt;br/&gt;the environment, and underactuation. The most technologically advanced biped robots today are&lt;br/&gt;walking on the basis of a heuristic control principle that imposes a flat-footed walking motion in&lt;br/&gt;order to avoid dealing with the underactuation that comes with foot rotation (i.e., toe roll and&lt;br/&gt;heel strike). Professor Grizzle's research will develop the analytical foundations of walking with an&lt;br/&gt;anthropomorphic gait. By not relying on heuristics, significantly improved feedback controllers will&lt;br/&gt;be designed that allow the natural rotation of the foot during the stance phase of walking, while&lt;br/&gt;still guaranteeing stability of the walking motion. Beyond a certain speed, walking is no longer&lt;br/&gt;efficient (or even possible). The extremely challenging problem of controlling a running motion&lt;br/&gt;of a bipedal robot will be investigated, both theoretically and experimentally. These results will&lt;br/&gt;greatly enhance the ability to design machines that can perform human-like tasks. Another portion&lt;br/&gt;of the research will look at controlling a robot with a passive knee (active damping but otherwise&lt;br/&gt;unactuated), analogous to walking with a modern prosthetic.&lt;br/&gt;Professor Grizzle is actively engaged in undergraduate and graduate student education. NSF&lt;br/&gt;support of this research proposal is enhancing the research and education infrastructure at the&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan through the construction of a biped robot prototype. The robot affords&lt;br/&gt;experimental facilities and numerous projects for students. This research grant provides for the&lt;br/&gt;training of one PhD student, and a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) supplement to&lt;br/&gt;this grant will provide a meaningful research experience for two undergraduate students. Special&lt;br/&gt;attention is being paid to recruiting at least one of these students from an underrepresented group.&lt;br/&gt;Professor Grizzle is also more broadly sharing the excitement of a research career in engineering&lt;br/&gt;by making presentations on bipedal walking robots to undergraduate student groups, and high&lt;br/&gt;school students. On the basis of his research findings in biped robot locomotion control, Professor&lt;br/&gt;Grizzle is forging research relationships with colleagues in neurology and rehabilitation. His goal&lt;br/&gt;is to transfer the deeper understanding of bipedal posture and locomotion that is resulting from&lt;br/&gt;the study of robots, to the development of improved rehabilitation therapies for a class of patients&lt;br/&gt;who have suffered strokes or spinal cord injuries.&lt;br/&gt;The research findings of this grant are maintained on Professor Grizzle's web site; see above for&lt;br/&gt;the URL.</AbstractNarration>
