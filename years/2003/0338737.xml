<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) monitoring is an important tool in the&lt;br/&gt;assignment of frequency bands and in the reduction of harmful interference between users. In the&lt;br/&gt;past, a major source of man-made interference was from automobile ignition. Now a major&lt;br/&gt;source of man-made interference is from electronic devices, digital answering machines,&lt;br/&gt;computers etc. Communication devices like cellular phones, and wireless computer networks are&lt;br/&gt;relative new comers and are making efficient use of the spectrum using Code Division Multiple&lt;br/&gt;Access (CDMA) with power control to maximize capacity with the minimum transmitter power.&lt;br/&gt;These devices generate a spread spectrum which cannot be easily distinguished from Gaussian&lt;br/&gt;noise without knowledge of the code to de-spread the signal. Another source of noise-like signals&lt;br/&gt;comes from the new digital television transmitters. In order to avoid harmful interference and&lt;br/&gt;minimize the elevation of the noise level in the environment, it is important to monitor the level&lt;br/&gt;of this noise. The natural environmental noise for frequencies between 500 MHz and 20 GHz&lt;br/&gt;consists mainly of about 300 K from the ground, 3K from the cosmic background, and about 5 to&lt;br/&gt;30 K from the atmosphere. In the radio astronomy bands and other itreceive onlyle bands, it is&lt;br/&gt;important to prevent any increase in the noise temperature while measurement of the noise&lt;br/&gt;temperature in other bands can be useful information needed to optimize the efficient use of the&lt;br/&gt;spectrum for various applications including radio astronomy and wireless communications.&lt;br/&gt;MIT Haystack Observatory proposes to develop a monitor to measure the interference levels in&lt;br/&gt;the frequency range 30 to 1500 MHz, calibrated to provide the output metric in units of degrees&lt;br/&gt;Kelvin, and with sufficient sensitivity to be able to quantify, to a level of a few degrees Kelvin,&lt;br/&gt;the unwanted noise in the protected receive-only bands like those for radio astronomy, remote&lt;br/&gt;sensing, and deep space bands. This supports the joint initiative between the NSF and the FCC.&lt;br/&gt;In phase 1, the proposers plan to study receiver and calibration designs needed to provide the sensitivity&lt;br/&gt;and accuracy without significant internal inter-modulation, spurious responses and spurious&lt;br/&gt;signals. In this phase they will also set specifications for the design based upon preliminary&lt;br/&gt;measurements, using currently available equipment, of the RFI environment at the MIT Haystack&lt;br/&gt;Observatory, in Westford, MA. In phase 2 we propose to prototype the interference temperature&lt;br/&gt;monitor and test the design at Haystack. In phase 3 we propose to conduct tests of the system at a&lt;br/&gt;few locations in the Massachusetts and Southern New Hampshire area. In the future, depending&lt;br/&gt;on the results, such a monitoring system could be replicated elsewhere to gather a data set to&lt;br/&gt;characterize the RFI environment at other locations.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Through this project, the proposers aim to enhance the awareness of the properties of&lt;br/&gt;radio wave technology and its various applications such as radio astronomy and wireless&lt;br/&gt;communications, as well as the radio frequency interference environment. Thus, a simple RFI&lt;br/&gt;monitoring system will be developed for use in pre-college educational settings to acquaint&lt;br/&gt;students and teachers with the measurement techniques of radio wave signals and the&lt;br/&gt;environment around their schools and towns. Such data could be inter-compared using the&lt;br/&gt;Internet, and Haystack Observatory will develop web-based educational materials to introduce the&lt;br/&gt;study of radio waves and their various applications. In particular, the proposers will arrange for the&lt;br/&gt;deployment of simple radio receivers and antennas, available commercially, to local area schools&lt;br/&gt;around the Observatory to engage students in RFI measurements. A collaboration with students&lt;br/&gt;and teachers in Australia, as part of the Australian SEARFE project will be promoted to enhance&lt;br/&gt;international networking on this topic. A project with local area teachers as part of NSF's&lt;br/&gt;program 'Research Experiences for Teachers (RET)' at Haystack Observatory is starting in&lt;br/&gt;summer 2003 to initiate this activity.</AbstractNarration>
