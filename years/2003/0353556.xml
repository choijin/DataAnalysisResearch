<AbstractNarration>GOALI: Carnegie Mellon - Morgan Stanley Mathematical Finance Post-Doctoral &lt;br/&gt;Fellow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators will participate with a post-doctoral fellow &lt;br/&gt;on the development of models for corporate bond default.  There are two &lt;br/&gt;general classes of such models.  In one of these, the models of &lt;br/&gt;"structural form," default occurs when the value of a firm hits a lower &lt;br/&gt;barrier.  These are intuitively appealing, but in their pure form they &lt;br/&gt;suffer from the fact that default is never a surprise.  The second class &lt;br/&gt;of models, those of "reduced form," postulate an exogenous event which &lt;br/&gt;triggers default.  These have an intensity of arrival of the default &lt;br/&gt;event, and the difficulty with these models is constructing this intensity &lt;br/&gt;process so that the model conforms to market data.  This work &lt;br/&gt;will investigate the behavior of models in which the intensity process is &lt;br/&gt;driven by two factors, one evolving on a fast time scale and the other on &lt;br/&gt;a slow time scale.  Such models are amenable to asymptotic analysis as the &lt;br/&gt;fast time scale approaches infinity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent years have shown that default on financial obligations is a genuine &lt;br/&gt;possibility, and as a result, many financial instruments which offer some &lt;br/&gt;form of protection against default have arisen.  These instruments &lt;br/&gt;are a type of derivative security.  Pricing these instruments &lt;br/&gt;and managing the risk associated with them has become a critical &lt;br/&gt;issue for the banks that issue and trade them.  A number of mathematical &lt;br/&gt;models have been developed for this purpose, and each of them has certain &lt;br/&gt;drawbacks.  Under this grant, the principal investigators and a post-doctoral &lt;br/&gt;fellow will develop a new class of models based on a novel approach &lt;br/&gt;that has proved useful in modeling other types of derivative securities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
