    <AbstractNarration>This grant supports the acquisition of an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) surface spectroscopy system (SSS) for research and education in nano-scale materials at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The SSS will be coupled to an existing UHV atomic force microscope (AFM) system to create a unique and powerful instrument for major new research in several areas and for extensive training and education of students. Research collaborations include government laboratories and industry. The key complementary components of the SSS are: (1) high sensitivity infrared spectroscopy to identify the chemistry and structure of surfaces, films, and adsorbates; (2) Auger electron spectroscopy for surface chemical characterization; (3) low energy electron diffraction for surface structure determination; and (4) a variable temperature sample specimen stage to prepare samples with controlled surface chemistry, and to perform experiments over a range of temperatures. This equipment will support several research efforts including: (1) the relationship between surface structure and tribological performance of micromachine surfaces; (2) interfacial structure and sliding of nano-scale components in ceramic nanocomposites; (3) the coupling of structural, vibrational, and frictional properties of materials by using isotopic engineering; (4) conducting polymer surfaces and interfaces; (5) surface structures of molecular templates for nanomanipulation experiments; (6) adsorbate effects on friction for hard ceramic coatings; (7) studies of nanocrystalline diamond films for micromachine and biosensor applications; (8) studies of negative stiffness inclusions for nano-scale composites with extreme mechanical properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instrumentation will have broad impact by creating new opportunities to integrate research, education, and training at UW-Madison. Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in the use of cutting-edge vacuum/surface science technology. To highlight the importance of scientific instrumentation to the public, hands-on and web-based modules that demonstrate the function and use of the new instrumentation will be developed and widely distributed through collaboration with an established education program.</AbstractNarration>
