<AbstractNarration>   The study of vortex physics in magnetic superconductors, and particularly in high temperature superconductors, is important for a number of reasons.  Technologically, it is critical to the development of high current superconducting wires, as well as to other possible devices, including high-speed switches and magnetic field detectors (SQUIDs). Scientifically it may lead to a better understanding of superconductivity itself and to a better understanding of other novel phenomena, such as phase transformations in disordered systems.  The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is to investigate, at the atomic scale, the novel interactions in magnetic superconductors.  Using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), these interactions will be probed by seeing how local electronic structure is perturbed by the introduction of magnetic vortices.  In addition to these studies, the project will lay the groundwork for future research, both by developing tools for use at MIT and elsewhere, and, more importantly, by training graduate, undergraduate and high school students (and teachers through outreach programs), providing them the experience of designing, building and performing experiments to help solve some of the greatest mysteries facing condensed matter physicists today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   High temperature superconductors, materials that allow the flow of electricity without the wasteful generation of heat, have been heavily studied over the past 15 years, but are still not understood.  Recently, it appears that novel magnetic interactions are responsible for these fantastic properties.  The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is to investigate, at the atomic scale, the relationship between magnetism and superconductivity in these and other related materials.  In addition to gaining a better understanding of the science of these materials, this study is also critical to future technologies, such as the development of high current superconducting wires (e.g. for power stations) and high-speed switches (e.g. for cell phone stations).  In addition to these studies, the project will lay the groundwork for future research, both by developing tools for use at MIT and elsewhere, and, more importantly, by training graduate, undergraduate and high school students (and teachers through outreach programs), providing them the experience of designing, building and performing experiments to help solve some of the greatest mysteries facing condensed matter physicists today.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
