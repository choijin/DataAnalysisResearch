<AbstractNarration>This proposal has many facets, most of which have to do with various theories of gauged supergravity. The PI proposes to study supersymmetric versions of the five dimensional Randall-Sundrum world brane scenario that has interesting features and may bring in some new ideas about the stability of brane configurations. The theories of gauged supergravities in five and six dimensions have not been explored in the past. It has become clear over the last few years that attempts of embedding world branes into supersymmetric theories are incomplete since not all versions of five and six dimensional gauged supergravities have been constructed. The PI proposes to study 5d supergravities with tensor multiplets and to consider the consequences for supersymmetric Randall-Sundrum brane world scenarios. Another aspect of the proposal is related to developments with gauged supergravities in various dimensions, including nine The PI proposes a new version of 9d gauged supergravity where it has been found that domain walls exist. This theory will be explored in the context of brane worlds as well as for cosmology.  The PI proposes to study Noncommutative Supersymmetric Gauge and Gravity theories in background anti symmetric fields.  The thrust will be to develop a consistent complex supergravity theory. &lt;br/&gt;The PI also proposes to study teleparallel superspace formulations of supergravity where there is the possibility of breakdown of local Lorentz symmetry. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
