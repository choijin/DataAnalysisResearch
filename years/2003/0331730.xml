<AbstractNarration>AST-0331730&lt;br/&gt;Chaffee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) is a NASA program to study two selected regions of the sky in great detail from three orbiting telescopes (the Hubble Space telescope, the Chandra X-ray observatory, and the Space Infra-Red Telescope Facility).  NSF is funding two member institutions of the University of California and the Keck Observatory of the California Association for Research in Astronomy, to provide complementary data for the northern field of the GOODS project.  Because ground-based telescopes still have larger collecting mirrors than space-based facilities, the data they can collect is complementary to the satellite data and crucial to understanding the objects being observed.  This study uses both the private Keck II 10-meter telescope and the public Gemini North (Frederick C.Gillett) 8-meter telescope.  The data will be analyzed rapidly and made freely available to any interested researcher, significantly enhancing the usefulness of the GOODS study.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
