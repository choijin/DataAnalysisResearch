<AbstractNarration>The Minerals, Metals, and Materials Society (TMS) and the Iron and Steel Society (ISS) jointly sponsor this planned symposium and the MS&amp;T 2003 conference. Objectives of this symposium include: (a) disseminate the most recent advances in understanding austenite formation and decomposition; (b) disseminate practical applications of these advances; (c) educate symposium attendees, professionals, young researchers and students; (d) publish a peer reviewed proceedings volume that will be donated world wide to many libraries of educational institutions granting degrees in the fields of metallurgical engineering or materials science and engineering. The dissemination of this proceedings to educational institutions is of particular importance because it has been a long time since the last major technical symposium focused on austenite decomposition, and a great many advances have occurred since then.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned symposium includes experts from various countries (Japan, Europe, Asia) with 44 accepted papers. The resulting peer-reviewed proceedings are an important event by which descriptions of these advances can be collected and disseminated to current and future specialists, educators, young researchers and students in the field. The NSF funds support publication of the symposium proceedings as bound volume along with a CD-ROM. Distributing it worldwide as an information or reference source to universities will enable an understanding of austenite applications and formation by educators, young researchers, and students.</AbstractNarration>
