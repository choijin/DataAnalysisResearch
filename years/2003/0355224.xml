    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keyah Math: a Place-Based, Culturally-Responsive, Technology-Intensive Quantitative Modules in Introductory Undergraduate Geoscience&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three-year Keyah Math project will produce a series of versatile, place-based, culturally-responsive, and technology-intensive modules in mathematical geoscience to enhance introductory undergraduate geoscience courses for Native American and other minority students. Quantitative activities such as these are absent from nearly all introductory geoscience textbooks and virtually nonexistent. Modules will draw data-rich examples from Native American lands in the Southwest, and incorporate empirical Native knowledge and terminology about the Earth and issues of interest to Native people. The central importance of these components is reflected in the name Keyah, the Dine (Navajo) term for homelands and environment. Versatile Keyah Math modules will allow an instructor to introduce place-based mathematical geoscience into courses regardless of textbook, and will introduce students to quantitative methods in geoscience at an early stage in their education. Their local and cultural relevance will stimulate the interest of Native American students while strengthening their quantitative skills, thus better preparing them for more advanced studies in geoscience. Mathematical applications will be organized into twelve modules based on common topics presented in introductory courses, and organized according to Dine educational philosophy. Guided inquiry-based, data-rich mathematical applications will be incorporated into cross-platform software designed to do calculations. The modules will be tested by geology instructors at selected regional and Tribal colleges, and disseminated via the World-Wide Web and on compact discs.</AbstractNarration>
