<AbstractNarration>Building on the foundations of the existing NMI-EDIT work, this proposal intends to set new directions in a number of specific thematic areas within Security, Directories, Virtual Organization (VO) Management, and Middleware End-to-End Diagnostics, while continuing its efforts in Outreach and Evaluation services. Specifically, the proposed work will:&lt;br/&gt;   respond to unmet needs by expanding core enterprise architecture to include important new tools in       enterprise and federated security and in authorization&lt;br/&gt;   complete basic directory service developments, with particular focus on support of inter-realm directory    operations&lt;br/&gt;   establish a framework and associated tools to support critical needs for middleware diagnostics &lt;br/&gt;   provide evaluation and outreach to ensure continuing successful impact of NMI funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accomplishment of these objectives will have broad impact by:&lt;br/&gt;strengthening the ability of campus core middleware infrastructure to support research, education, and      administration, and the breadth of campus deployments&lt;br/&gt;facilitating multidisciplinary, multi-institutional collaboration in many scientific areas through shared      data, digital libraries, web-based services, computing, code, facilities, and applications&lt;br/&gt;continuing to leverage user-managed security and privacy in a growing number of applications and provide    the scalable and sustainable architecture that success in middleware requires&lt;br/&gt;promoting and supporting the development of open standards and open source approaches, and encouraging      collaboration with government and international partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's outcomes also are likely to have additional benefits, including seamless and timely integration of research materials into academic courseware; engagement and retention of the best and brightest IT architects from leading campuses and discovery of gems of expertise in unlikely institutions; creation of a community of practitioners, who are developing and refining best practices that have, in turn, accelerated deployments and convergence; and influence on the corporate sector, shaping a federated marketplace that serves higher education requirements for privacy and security.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
