<AbstractNarration>Proposal No: 303789&lt;br/&gt;Title: NER: NanoCAD - Computer-Aided Design Algorithms and Tools for&lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnologies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has been a huge surge of research activity in recent years in the area&lt;br/&gt;of nanoelectronic device design and fabrication.  Such ``nanodevices'' &lt;br/&gt;include solid-state quantum-effect devices and molecular devices.  &lt;br/&gt;In terms of work at the logic and architecture levels, quantum cellular &lt;br/&gt;automata (QCA) based on quantum dot cells, and resonant tunelling diode &lt;br/&gt;(RTD) based implementations seem ahead of others, and chips based on &lt;br/&gt;these devices are likely to be feasible within this decade.  While working &lt;br/&gt;devices and logic gates, and even some small circuits, have been &lt;br/&gt;demonstrated for various nanotechnologies, no logic synthesis methodology &lt;br/&gt;has evolved yet for automatically synthesizing large logic circuits in these &lt;br/&gt;technologies.  The aim of this proposal is to develop automatic logic &lt;br/&gt;synthesis algorithms and implement them as software tools to bridge this &lt;br/&gt;gap.  In this exploratory phase of research, we will target QCA and RTD &lt;br/&gt;based logic circuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, we will develop a general multi-level logic synthesis&lt;br/&gt;algorithm and software tool using threshold gates and majority gates&lt;br/&gt;as primitive gates.  We will derive bit-level pipelined versions &lt;br/&gt;of different arithmetic units to exploit the concept of nanopipelining. &lt;br/&gt;We will also derive physical synthesis rules for QCA to ensure its correct&lt;br/&gt;functionality.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The software tools developed in this research will be made available on the&lt;br/&gt;world-wide web for wide dissemination.  The material will be included in &lt;br/&gt;a new graduate-level course on Computer-Aided Design for Emerging &lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnologies.  Undergraduates will also be involved in this research.  &lt;br/&gt;Princeton encourages applications from women and minority students through &lt;br/&gt;special fellowships.  Such students will be specially welcome to join this &lt;br/&gt;research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
