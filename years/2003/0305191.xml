<AbstractNarration>ProposalDMS-0305910&lt;br/&gt;PI: Elisabeth Werner (Case Western)&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: CONVEXIT AND APPLICATIONS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The PI's research is in classical convexity theory and convex geometric analysis.&lt;br/&gt;A primary  goal is to get a better understanding of the structure of convex bodies.&lt;br/&gt;To do so she uses techniques from different areas of mathematics: analysis,&lt;br/&gt;differential geometry, convexity theory, probability theory.&lt;br/&gt;She investigates isoperimetric inequalities and affine isoperimetric inequalities.&lt;br/&gt;These provide  powerful tools in characterizing and classifying  convex sets.&lt;br/&gt;Through her investigation of the affine surface area -originally a concept of affine&lt;br/&gt;differential geometry and occurring in the affine isoperimetric inequality- she was&lt;br/&gt;lately led to an extensive  study of questions of approximation of convex bodies by&lt;br/&gt;polytopes.The affine surface area appears naturally in this context as it is related&lt;br/&gt;to the boundary structure of a convex body. The PI has investigated and still is&lt;br/&gt;investigating different aspects of approximation of convex bodies by polytopes. In &lt;br/&gt;one paper, for instance, she -together with her collaborator- proved the surprising &lt;br/&gt;result that random approximation by polytopes (choosing the vertices of the&lt;br/&gt;approximating polytope  randomly on the boundary of the body) is as good as best&lt;br/&gt;approximation. Besides convexity tools, probabilistic tools,like concentration of&lt;br/&gt;measure, have proved  to be very efficient in convexity. The PI continues her &lt;br/&gt;investigation of such probabilistic results for advancing her research in structural&lt;br/&gt;results in convexity and its applications to local Banach space theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Past experience has led the PI to believe that purely theoretical concepts are also&lt;br/&gt;useful in applications. She has experienced that the methods and results from these &lt;br/&gt;areas find applications in other fields of mathematics and in applied areas:&lt;br/&gt;Geometric tomography, a tool having its origins  in classical convexity theory,&lt;br/&gt;gives a method to recover convex shapes from its sections or projections. This is&lt;br/&gt;used in computer vision and image analysis, in biology and medicine where convex&lt;br/&gt;shapes(organs) occur naturally. Geometric algorithms find applications in computer &lt;br/&gt;science.Tools from classical convexity theory and geometric analysis have proved &lt;br/&gt;useful inquantum information theory. Convexity theory has  mutually beneficial&lt;br/&gt;interactions with probability theory, Banach space theory,operator theory, the new&lt;br/&gt;quickly developing theory of random matrices,some directions of discrete &lt;br/&gt;mathematicsincluding problems in complexity theory, problems of statistical physics,&lt;br/&gt;PDEs,including non-linear PDEs arising from problems in convex analysis. The PI&lt;br/&gt;finds it very stimulating to interact with researchers not only from other areas of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics but also from applied areas. She has already worked with  mathematical&lt;br/&gt;physicists and continues to do so. In particular, she has recently started to work&lt;br/&gt;on problems in quantum information theory where methods from convexity theory are &lt;br/&gt;very effective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
