<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MEAN CURVATURE FLOW IN HIGHER CODIMENSIONS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mean curvature flow is the gradient flow of the volume&lt;br/&gt;functional of submanifolds. The analytic nature is a&lt;br/&gt; parabolic system of nonlinear partial differential equations whose stationary &lt;br/&gt;phase corresponds to minimal&lt;br/&gt; submanifolds. Minimal hypersurfaces and mean curvature flows of&lt;br/&gt;hypersurfaces have been studied extensively for decades but many&lt;br/&gt;applications in mathematical physics and topology call for&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the higher codimensional case. This project&lt;br/&gt;proposes to embark on a systematic investigation&lt;br/&gt; of minimal submanifolds and mean curvature flows in higher codimensions. Three &lt;br/&gt;immediate goals are to understand the&lt;br/&gt; minimal surface system in higher codimension, the Lagrangian mean curvature &lt;br/&gt;flow in Calabi-Yau manifolds and&lt;br/&gt; the deformation of maps between Riemannian manifolds by the mean curvature &lt;br/&gt;flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minimal surfaces  are like soap films, they are surfaces of least&lt;br/&gt;area. The mean curvature flow is an evolution process which movesT&lt;br/&gt;a surface in space  in such a way that its area is decreased most&lt;br/&gt;rapidly. This  is a very natural yet highly nonlinear process and&lt;br/&gt;it models physics phenomena such as the motion of an interface in&lt;br/&gt;forming&lt;br/&gt; metallic alloys. Understanding the behavior of this evolution is important for &lt;br/&gt;simplifying and smoothing complicated surfaces in the&lt;br/&gt; most efficient way. This process, as a geometric evolution equation, tends to &lt;br/&gt;deform a geometric object to its optimal shape. A goal of&lt;br/&gt; this project is to apply this process to study certain special surfaces in &lt;br/&gt;Calabi-Yau manifolds, the spaces of string theory. It is believed&lt;br/&gt;that  underlying structures of Calabi-Yau manifolds are encoded in&lt;br/&gt;these special surfaces, called special Lagrangians. The success of&lt;br/&gt;this proposal will have important impact on image processing,&lt;br/&gt;material science, mathematics physics and&lt;br/&gt; other nonlinear problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
