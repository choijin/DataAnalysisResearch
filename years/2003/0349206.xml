    <AbstractNarration>Professor Schaus will develop the chiral Bronsted acid catalyzed asymmetric Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction as a tool for chemical synthesis. Building from this reaction chemistry, Professor Schaus will develop general synthetic routes for the synthesis of clerodane diterpenes, rapidly accessing the highly functionalized core structures through sequential Morita-Baylis-Hillman and Lewis acid promoted ring closure reactions. By developing the Chemistry Mentor Connection, Professor Schaus is fostering mentoring relationships between graduate student researchers and area high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the teaching and research efforts of Professor Scott Schaus, of the Department of Chemistry at Boston University. Professor Schaus is developing novel methods for the efficient construction of complex organic structures, providing important tools for the preparation of molecules displaying desirable chemical or biological properties. In order to provide students with the opportunity to explore chemcial research at an earlier age, Professor Schaus has developed a Chemistry Mentor Connection program, pairing area high school students with graduate student mentors.</AbstractNarration>
