<AbstractNarration>The central theme of the proposed research plan is to demonstrate the ability of random-blocky copolymers (RBCs), heteropolymers with statistically controlled monomer sequence distributions, to undergo self-assembly in the bulk and perform recognition of chemical patterns on surfaces.  We plan to establish that controlling the statistical nature of the monomer sequencing is sufficient in endowing the RBC with unique assembling and recognition characteristics; these may allow the RBCs to perform functions similar to those of more complex biomolecules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The RBCs will be synthesized by adjusting the radius of gyration of a homopolymer in solution, followed by chemical modification ("coloring") of those monomers that are sterically accessible to the "coloring" moiety.  Depending on the degree of collapse (poor solvent) or expansion (good solvent) of the homopolyer, the monomer sequence distribution in the RBC will range from blocky (poor solvent) to random (good solvent).  We propose synthetic schemes leading to RBCs based on poly (styrene-co-4-bromostyrene) and poly(dimethyl aminoethyl methacrylate-co-alkyl).  We show that poly(styrene-co-4bromostyrene) RBCs can be further chemically tailored by attaching other chemical functionalties.  A set of analytical probes, including NMR, elemental analysis, and Kerr effect measurements, will be applied to establish the chemical composition and monomer sequence distribution in the RBCs.  The analytical methods will be complemented with modeling studies using Monte Carlo simulations, which will reveal molecular-level insight about the nature of the "coloring" procedure.  We also propose a new method for preparing RBCs on the surfaces of small silica spheres.  A comprehensive set of experiments is proposed that aim at understanding the assembly of RBCs in solution and the adsorption of RBCs at solution/solid and melt/solid interfaces.  The main focus of the latter methods is to investigate the interplay between the copolymer sequence distributioin, the polymer/solid interactions, and chemical heterogeneities of the substrate.  High spatial resolution depth profiling techniques, including neutron and X-ray reflectivity, spectroscopic ellipsometry, and ion beam techniques, will be applied in conjunction with selective deuterium labeling to probe the volume fraction profiles and the in-plane distributioin of the RBCs at solid/liquid and solid/melt interfaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                Intecllectual merit of the proposed activity:  The major outcome of this work will be the demonstration that RBCs, in spite of their statistical nature, are capable of performing functions similiar to those of macromolecules with precisely controlled monomer sequence distributions.  We will demonstrate that simple chemical coloring methods can be employed in order to produce RBCs with a wide range of chemistries and functionalites.  The combination of the synthesis, experiment, and modeling will offer very powerful tools for studying the solution assembly and interfacial activity of RBCs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Broader impact resulting from the proposed activity:  The RBCs may be considered the simplest mimics of "protein precursors".  Studying their solution self-assembly and interfacial properties is expected to reveal important insight into the behavior of very complex biomolecules.  The technological promise of the proposed project includes, but extends well beyond, the health of biomaterial-based applications.  Understanding the interfacial performance of such macromolecules provides unprecedented means of designing novel materials and stuctures that can find widespread, use in a variety of soft-condensed matter applications, including nano-reactors, "seeds" for organizing non-polymeric nano-inclusions.  We also outline our efforts in training graduate students, outline outreach activities in an elementary school in Mount Airy, NC, and popose to attract local K-12 students to take part in our interdisciplinary research endeavor.</AbstractNarration>
