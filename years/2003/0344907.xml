<AbstractNarration>One of the great genetic surprises of the last decade is that many genes when disrupted, reveal no phenotypic change. This is usually interpreted as functional redundancy among genes. Alternatively, many phenotypes are largely invisible until the individual is stressed or otherwise challenged by factors absent from the lab environment. For example, the deleterious effects of inbreeding in mice are barely detectable using lab assays (10% effect), but when analyzed under competitive ecological conditions, males show a 500% effect. Hox genes are transcription factors that direct development of the mammalian body plan, including adult traits such as mammary glands, behavior, nervous and immune systems. Targeted mutagenesis has been applied to all 39 members of the mouse Hox gene family and while most disruption mutants show developmental defects, it was surprising to discover that some have no detectable phenotypic change. The ecological competition inherent in the social behavior of seminatural house mouse populations will be used to determine the performance (fitness) consequences of three cryptic-phenotype Hox mutants. Any fitness differences detected allow characterization of the physiological and molecular basis of the genetic defect to proceed. The long-term goal of this research program is to continue developing these sensitive ecological methods for characterizing health and performance defects (phenotypes) in mice. These methods are important not only for characterizing gene function and complex phenotypes, but also for evaluating the safety of potential health risks such as environmental toxins, vaccines, therapeutic agents, among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
