<AbstractNarration>Understanding how microorganisms and their hosts interact at different biological levels (e.g. genetic, cellular, ecological and population) is of fundamental importance. We will address this question using a widespread and important group of intracellular bacteria called Wolbachia. Wolbachia occurs in up to 70% of insect species and its spread represents one of the great pandemics of life on this planet. They have broad effects on their hosts, ranging from sperm-egg incompatibility to feminization, male-killing and induction of parthenogenesis. We will conduct a set of integrated studies to investigate Wolbachia-host interactions.  A team with expertise in genomics, genetics, molecular biology, population biology, ecology and systematics have been assembled to achieve this goal.  Our studies will determine the genomic diversity of Wolbachia, genetic changes associated with host shifts, extent of gene transfer from Wolbachia to hosts, and the patterns of movement of Wolbachia globally and within insect communities.  These biodiversity investigations will be combined with studies of the mechanisms by which Wolbachia induce reproductive alterations in their hosts, and the genetic, molecular and population basis of host modifications of Wolbachia. Finally, we will investigate the long-term consequences of infection, including the potential role of Wolbachia in host speciation. &lt;br/&gt; Broader implications of this project include enhancing understanding of the mechanisms by which parasites manipulate fundamental cellular processes in their hosts, interactions of bacterial and host genomes, and the role Wolbachia may have played in the spectacular diversification of insects. Furthermore, Wolbachia could be an effective means for biological control of insect pests and vectors of disease.  Our program, by addressing key questions on the effects of Wolbachia on insect genomes, species and communities, will give trainees from high school to postdoctoral levels exposure to both the methods and perspective of an interdisciplinary approach to science. These trainees, therefore, will be well equipped to explore important biological questions from an integrative perspective. Because Wolbachia have such dramatic effects, they have attracted considerable public interest.  Research resulting from this project therefore will be effective as a means of broadly promoting science education.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
