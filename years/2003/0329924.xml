<AbstractNarration>This Sensor proposal focuses on transparent fused-silica microspheres, which support&lt;br/&gt;whispering-gallery modes (WGMs)- light trapped by total internal reflection and orbiting just&lt;br/&gt;beneath the surface. These modes, excited by optical tunneling from an adjacent tapered fiber,&lt;br/&gt;have an evanescent component outside the surface and a very sharp frequency resonance (high&lt;br/&gt;Q). The mode amplitude and resonant frequency can be very sensitive to changes in the&lt;br/&gt;microresonator's environment, and thus enable sensing of, for example: strain, acceleration,&lt;br/&gt;thermal effects, trace gases, chemicals, and modifications of the surface.&lt;br/&gt;This project will: further develop and advance previously-demonstrated methods of&lt;br/&gt;WGM evanescent-wave sensing of trace gases in the atmosphere and chemicals in solution;&lt;br/&gt;extend earlier applications of WGM microsensors, in measuring thermal and absorptive&lt;br/&gt;properties, to the characterization of transparent thin films; pursue novel techniques that enable&lt;br/&gt;the multiplication of sensitivity enhancements, by combining effects such as modal interference&lt;br/&gt;with WGM microsensing; and apply to WGM microresonators methods of surface preparation&lt;br/&gt;that have proved useful in fiber sensors for gases, chemicals, and biological agents. In&lt;br/&gt;accomplishing these objectives, all aspects of the project will benefit from: improving control&lt;br/&gt;and coupling techniques, utilizing various redundant measurements to characterize WGMs,&lt;br/&gt;studying the effects of changing system configurations, and expanding the numerical modeling&lt;br/&gt;of the microsensors. Specific parts of the project will involve: implementing wavelength-modulation&lt;br/&gt;spectroscopy with the WGM locked to resonance with a frequency-scanning laser,&lt;br/&gt;and ruggedizing the sensor by attaching the coupler(s); measuring the thermal accommodation&lt;br/&gt;coefficient and optical absorption coefficient of a thin film coating the microresonator; using&lt;br/&gt;cavity ringdown of the scattered light, and applying controlled multimode-taper coupling to the&lt;br/&gt;WGMs of the microresonator, to amplify its absorption-detection sensitivity; and combining&lt;br/&gt;surface-enhanced Raman scattering with WGMs by coating the microresonator with a thin film&lt;br/&gt;containing gold nanoparticles, as well as using the techniques of surface coating with xerogels or&lt;br/&gt;antibodies for biosensing.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Even a supposedly well-understood system can exhibit novel&lt;br/&gt;behavior under extreme conditions, or when interacting with another system. The exquisitely&lt;br/&gt;high Q of a WGM provides extreme conditions here, and interactions between WGMs and&lt;br/&gt;surface or coupling effects give a multiplication of sensitivity-enhancement factors.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The graduate students involved will be learning fundamental physics&lt;br/&gt;as well as becoming grounded in real-world applications; they will also be directly involved in&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of results through conference presentations and peer-reviewed journal&lt;br/&gt;publications. This work will benefit the University's multidisciplinary Photonics degree&lt;br/&gt;programs and its interdepartmental Center for Sensors and Sensor Technologies. The sensing&lt;br/&gt;techniques to be developed here have many potential benefits to society, as has already been&lt;br/&gt;recognized by the Oklahoma Center for the Advancement of Science and Technology, NASA's&lt;br/&gt;Marshall Space Flight Center, and Nomadics, Inc., through their support of and collaboration on&lt;br/&gt;related work.</AbstractNarration>
