<AbstractNarration>This study uses the case of Northern Ireland to examine the effect of the Internet on efforts&lt;br/&gt;to build a democratic polity in a deeply divided society with an historical problem of democratic&lt;br/&gt;representation. The Internet both exacerbates problems of community detachment and opens&lt;br/&gt;news opportunities for communication. Northern Ireland provides an excellent site for this&lt;br/&gt;exploration of information technology and democracy because the region combines a long history&lt;br/&gt;of Western parliamentary politics, a rich free press tradition, and a developed economy with&lt;br/&gt;long-term political divisions characterized by violence and segmented communities. This research&lt;br/&gt;will move forward the relatively undeveloped literature on the Internet and democracy by&lt;br/&gt;charting out the patterns of the heterogeneous effects of the Internet on political and religious&lt;br/&gt;dialogue and conflict. In moving between the fields of science and technology studies,&lt;br/&gt;particularly its participation and design focus, and media studies, especially regarding the impact&lt;br/&gt;of media, the project will examine in detail the relationship between technology and democracy in&lt;br/&gt;a multi-ethnic society. As a result, this study will examine the potential impact of the Internet&lt;br/&gt;from the creation and design of web sites through user experiences in comparison to other&lt;br/&gt;communications technologies. The project uses interviews and archival research to explore how the construction and use of web sites reveal interpretations of a multi-ethnic democracy, and how the Internet compares with other media in representing political views of a multi-ethnic democracy. The larger concern of the project in focusing on the fragility of democracy in a multi-ethnic society is the potential of&lt;br/&gt;technology to reduce divisions that give rise to violence. This project will contribute to an&lt;br/&gt;analysis of democracy, technological development, and multi-ethnic societies.</AbstractNarration>
