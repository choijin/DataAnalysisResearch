<AbstractNarration>2004 will see the Trinity University Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;Program enter its seventh year of funding from the National Science Foundation. The Program will offer 12&lt;br/&gt;students the opportunity to pursue an 8 week long broad based program of Mathematical research topics&lt;br/&gt;under the direction of a highly experienced group of faculty mentors. Available projects for the 2004 program include Abstract Algebra, Combinatorics, Discrete Dynamical Systems, and Mathematical Programming (with an emphasis in Computational Biology). The program emphasizes 7 major goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- To provide the student participants with an understanding of, an appreciation for, and an experience&lt;br/&gt;in the nature of mathematical research and the life of a mathematical researcher, to a degree that&lt;br/&gt;encourages them to pursue the study of the mathematical sciences on the graduate level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-To offer these experiences with a special eye toward students who do not typically have these opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;Of particular interest are students who are either female or a member of an under-represented&lt;br/&gt;group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-To develop in each participant superior skills in mathematical writing and oral mathematical presentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-To produce quality mathematical work appropriate for publication on our web site or in undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;research journals and, when possible, in higher level research journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- To extend the research experience beyond the 8 weeks at Trinity by motivating the students to present&lt;br/&gt;their REU research at either their home institution or at a regional/national meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- To gain experience in the use of computers and their interaction in mathematical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- To immerse the participants in the culture of mathematics and instill in each member a lifetime value&lt;br/&gt;of the importance of collegiality and group interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our 2004 program will include some significant changes over our past programs, including an extension&lt;br/&gt;of the program from 7 to 8 weeks, a revised First Week Schedule, an added emphasis throughout the&lt;br/&gt;Program with respect to mathematical writing skills and oral mathematical presentation, a comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;weekly Colloquium featuring speakers of national prominence in undergraduate mathematics, and support&lt;br/&gt;for students who wish to present their REU research at a regional or national meeting.</AbstractNarration>
