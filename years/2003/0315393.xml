<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;This research is focused on understanding the immune response of a crustacean, the marine shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei to virus infections.  Crustacea are essential components of the marine environment and marine shrimp are of commercial significance, especially since these animals are widely aquacultured.  These animals are highly susceptible to numerous viruses, including the Taura Syndrome Virus and White Spot Syndrome Virus, and these have devastating impacts on aquaculture and possible unknown consequences for the health of the marine environment.  This research addresses the hypothesis that 2 shrimp molecules (STAT and IkK, which are families of immune function proteins) are components of the molecular machinery by which shrimp recognize and respond to viral infection. There are two Specific Aims. 1) To reduce, by RNA interference methods, the expression of STAT and IkK, and establish the effect of this reduced expression on shrimp resistance to viral infection. 2) To identify the genes regulated by STAT and IkK  that are important in viral immunity.  "Functional genomics" approaches will be employed, using DNA microarrays to measure the levels of expression of approximately 3,000 shrimp genes simultaneously.  Bioinformatic analyses of the resulting data will identify genes participating in the host response to viral infection, and the role of STAT and IkK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will increase our understanding of marine invertebrate immunity, and assist in the management of marine ecosystems and aquaculture resources. The broader impacts of this work include: 1) the dissemination of information on marine organisms and the marine environment to professionals and the public, through coordination with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources and 2) the education and training of graduate students who will work on the project.  In addition, through participation in summer research exposure programs, undergraduate students will have the opportunity to work on this project and to gain experience in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
