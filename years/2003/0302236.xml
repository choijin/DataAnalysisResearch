<AbstractNarration>The Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS) promotes, administers, and provides support services for the conference series known as the NSF/CBMS Regional Research Conferences in Mathematics.  Each year approximately six conferences will be held. These conferences are intended to stimulate interest and activity in mathematical research. Each five day conference features a distinguished  lecturer who delivers ten lectures on a topic of important current research in one sharply focused area of the mathematical sciences. Support for about 30 participants is provided and the conference organizer invites both established researchers and interested newcomers, including postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, to attend. The lecturer subsequently prepares an expository monograph based upon the lectures and this is published as a part of a regional conference series.  Depending upon the conference topic, the monograph is published by the American Mathematical Society, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, or jointly by the American Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.  These conferences have been an ongoing cooperative project administered by CBMS and supported by NSF for the last 34 years. A complete listing of all past conferences and their resulting monographs is given on the CBMS website www.cbmsweb.org.</AbstractNarration>
