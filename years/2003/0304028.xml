<AbstractNarration>This research effort will explore a completely new approach for creating architectures comprised of uniquely shaped, multiple nanoscale units by combining two recently developed methods for nanofabrication.  We will employ glancing angle deposition (GLAD) to create nanotemplates for subsequent multidirectional assembly of highly oriented nanotubes (MAHON), bent into predefined shapes and placed in unique configurations, which is unachievable by conventional techniques currently available. This hybrid approach will provide a potentially revolutionary strategy to assemble and integrate one-dimensional nanoscale units into micro- and larger length-scale architectures for applications in nanoelectronics, sensors, and micro/nano-electromechanical systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MAHON is based on a substrate-selective growth technique that creates vertically oriented carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on chemically preselected surfaces. In this project we will use GLAD architectures comprised of nanopillars and nanoorifices with controllable shapes and periodicities to guide CNT growth by MAHON to control the shape and placement of nanotube bundles, and ultimately individual nanotubes. We will create three test architectures to explore the wide potential of the hybrid GLAD-MAHON technique. Specifically, we will  (a) force CNTs to grow zig-zag shaped nanospring arrays with expected extraordinary mechanical properties useful for nanoactuators and molecular sieving. &lt;br/&gt;(b) create arrays of aligned individual nanotubes on a Si-chip through nanoscale orifices. Such architectures will revolutionize field emitter technology.&lt;br/&gt;(c) Create interconnected three-dimensional structures comprised of silicon-based materials and CNTs for nanoscale transistors and scaffolds for assembling biomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;Engineering such organized architectures will pave the way for future smart devices, sensors, and microprocessors.  The inherently interdisciplinary nature of the tasks in this project will provide a fertile ground for training graduate and undergraduate students in new manufacturing methods in nanotechnology.  In particular, the students will be exposed to nanostructure growth, nanofabrication, and characterization equipping them with a unique background and toolset for them to evolve into innovative scientists and engineers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
