<AbstractNarration>This program targets the growing gap between the advancement of CMOS technology and the introduction of analog-to-digital converters in new technologies. Using deep sub-micron digital CMOS processes, engineers can put hundreds of millions of transistors on an integrated circuit. This makes System-on-a-Chip (SOC) integration a real possibility, promising new applications such as ubiquitous broadband wireless communications, and pervasive computing. The science of digital design has delivered the concepts and the tools to build huge digital systems. However, the problem is that all SOCs require some analog functions and in particular analog-to-digital conversion circuits (ADCs). The challenge is to implement analog-to-digital conversion on the same die and in the same CMOS technology as the digital processing. This research involves the development of new to analog-to-digital conversion techniques that take advantage of the capabilities of the deep sub-micron CMOS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objectives are to identify and to utilize the strengths of sub-micron digital CMOS.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators study methods, architectures and concepts that take advantage of the shrinking size and increasing speed of MOS devices, the increasing capability of interconnect, and the growing digital processing capability. Fast, simple circuits, aided by redundancy, parallelism, and digital processing are explored. The limitations of these new approaches are analyzed. In contrast, the current paradigm seeks to extend the life of old design techniques though specialized process options and clever design.  A simpler approach to mixed-signal design makes it easier for new engineers and researchers to become productive. The impact of this work is enhanced through the introduction of new undergraduate and graduate courses in mixed-signal and analog design, though outreach to under-represented groups, and through continuing education.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
