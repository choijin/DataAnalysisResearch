<AbstractNarration>The "Center for the Study of Mathematics Curriculum (CSMC)" will advance the research base and leadership capacity supporting K-12 mathematics curriculum design, analysis, implementation and evaluation.  It will serve the K-12 educational community by focusing scholarly inquiry and professional development around the issues of mathematics curriculum, examining and characterizing their role and influence on both teaching and student learning.  The Center partners are:  Michigan State University; University of Missouri; Western Michigan University; Battle Creek Public Schools; Columbia Public Schools; Kalamazoo Public Schools; Novi Public Schools; the University of Chicago School Mathematics Project Group; and Horizon Research, Inc.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center will test strategies and produce new knowledge about the impact of curriculum materials on student and teacher leaning.  The Center will examine the potential of curriculum materials as tools for teacher learning.  The work of the center will contribute to teacher knowledge through the professional development activities while at the same time creating opportunities for research on these issues.  The diversity that exists in the school partners will also provide opportunities to gain better understandings of ways instructional materials can be designed to improve learning among underserved groups.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Center for the Study of Mathematics Curriculum  Major Products/Accomplishments (2004-2015)  A summary of the major products/accomplishments of the Center is organized around the three major goals of the Center.  Goal 1.  Develop leadership capacity related to K-12 mathematics curriculum design, analysis, implementation, and evaluation.  Since 2004 the Center for the Study of Mathematics Curriculum (CSMC) has recruited 52 doctoral students (47 have completed their doctorate and 5 are in the dissertation phase).
