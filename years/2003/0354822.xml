<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests the support of one research associate and one student to work with senior participants on topics in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) relevant to ongoing experiments that are carried out at the Brookhaven, Jefferson and Fermi National Laboratories and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, as well as at international laboratories present and planned. These experiments, involve colliding nuclei and/or nucleons (protons and neutrons). They test basic properties of matter, through the investigation of how the elementary particles, quarks and gluons, which moved freely at the earliest stages of the expanding universe, became bound ('confined') to make up neutrons and protons (nucleons). Nucleons in turn constitute the nuclei of all atoms. Also, by polarizing (aligning the spin of) nucleons that are collided, experiments shed light on their internal structure in novel ways. QCD is generally accepted as the controlling theory for the formation of nucleons and nuclei, but the mechanisms by which it acts to confine quarks and produce new particles in collisions are not fully understood, and is one of the most important challenges in theoretical physics. The proposed research will help to synthesize and extend existing theoretical methods from elementary particle and nuclear physics in this area during a period in which experiments are being performed and analyzed. Progress resulting from this project may also have impact on several related theoretical areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide an ideal opportunity for broadening contact between the nuclear and high energy communities, and between theory and experiment. It is characterized by integrated research and training, and will provide career-enhancing opportunities for the junior participants. The professional environment of this work will emphasize intra- and inter-field communication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
