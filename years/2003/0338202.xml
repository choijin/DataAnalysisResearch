<AbstractNarration>Title of Project:  Track 2, GK-12:  Project Fulcrum Phase 2&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL)&lt;br/&gt;PIs/co-PIs:  Diandra Leslie-Pelecky , Gayle Buck, Barbara Jacobson, Roger Kirby, Suzanne Kirby&lt;br/&gt;Number of Fellows/year:  Graduate: 9 yr 1, 8 yr 2&amp;3, 5 yr 4 &amp;5; Undergraduate: 4&lt;br/&gt;School District Partner:  Lincoln Public Schools (LPS)&lt;br/&gt;Target Audience:  Middle and Upper Elementary Level (grades 4-8)&lt;br/&gt;Setting:  Urban&lt;br/&gt;NSF supported disciplines: biometry, chemistry, computer science, geosciences, mathematics/statistics, materials science, and physics.&lt;br/&gt;      &lt;br/&gt;Narrative Description: Each Project Fulcrum (PF) Graduate Fellow partners with a Lead teacher who facilitates the Fellow becoming a school-wide resource.  Fellow activities include modeling the scientific method, developing materials to increase inquiry experiences for students, building links between the university, teachers and schools, facilitating role-model activities and serving as content resources.  Undergraduates work with Graduate Fellows to develop after-school math and science activities for at-risk students.  A summer preparation program uses case study and team-building exercises to establish and strengthen partnerships.  Continuing support consists of weekly group meetings of teachers and Fellows and monthly All-Hands meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:  A realistic model for how research universities can support the participation of STEM faculty in K-12 education is developed.  Project Fulcrum activities are institutionalized as part of a comprehensive infrastructure for science and math education.  Strategies for institutionalization include adapting Project Fulcrum outcomes and materials to other education projects through the Center for Math, Science and Computer Education, STEM departments supporting Fellows through graduate teaching assistantships, continuing support and expansion of a web-based resource database, UNL institutionalization of professional development seminars for graduate students, and the development and institutionalization of in-service workshops for LPS teachers.  Evaluation uses a web database to collect data from participants, including journals, observations, pre- and post-surveys and activity logs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Phase II builds upon Phase I improvements in the learning attitudes and efficacies of English Language Learners, low socio-economic status students and underrepresented minorities, and extends efforts to behavior- and learning- disabled students.  Strategies proven effective in classes with multiple at-risk groups are disseminated through workshops and publications.  The effects of Fellows on student stereotypes of scientists are evaluated with an emphasis on students from underrepresented groups.   District-wide in-service workshops, informed by these results, are developed to address student attitudes toward science and math, and how to provide students with a diverse range of role models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of Track I: Fellows unanimously indicate that they intend to continue involvement with K-12 education.  There is greatly increased demand from teachers to work with Fellows.  The relationship between the University and Lincoln Public Schools has been considerably strengthened and new collaborations to enhance teacher professional development activities are beginning.  Teachers appreciate being part of a professional community focusing on math and science teaching.  A cadre of scientists, including students, but also a significant number of STEM faculty, has become part of a volunteer core working with the Fellows.  This project is partially supported by funds from the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
