<AbstractNarration>0340999&lt;br/&gt;Ferrari&lt;br/&gt;The symposium Biomedical Nanotechnology in Advanced Therapy and Diagnosis, October 21-22, 2003 in Yokohama, Japan, is one of a series of meetings being conducted by US and Japanese scientists to facilitate the transition of nanotechnology research results from the discovery stage to the realization of practical devices or processes. The first such meeting, the US-Japan Workshop on Tools and Metrology in Nanotechnology, occurred at Cornell University, January 21-22, 2003 (award 0309262).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of this symposium lies in the rapidly developing area of biomedical nanotechnology and the significant potential this emerging field has in mitigating pain, suffering and death caused by many diseases and conditions such as cancer and heart disease, and the vital role that multidisciplinary collaborations play in this emerging domain. Biomedical nanotechnology must incorporate the knowledge and experience from a variety of disciplines, including but not limited to mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, physics, material science, molecular biology, chemistry, chemical engineering, genomics, proteomics, computer science and clinical medical specialties such as radiology, anesthesiology, surgery, cardiology and oncology. Additionally, it is crucial that various nations develop and strengthen networks among their experts and researchers in all areas relating to nanotechnology in order to exchange knowledge about cutting-edge results that can advance the field as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics to be addressed during the symposium are: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology for Medical Therapeutics  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology for Medical Diagnostics &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology for Fundamental Life and Medical Science &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the symposium are to be published in a medical publication from a medical perspective with an understandable explanation of the engineering details. A report is to be published for the field of nanotechnology based on the results of the meeting in the journal Biomedical Microdevices. Also, a multimedia CD-ROM is to be made containing highlights and presentations of the entire symposium.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
