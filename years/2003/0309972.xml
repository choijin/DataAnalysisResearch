<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Low temperature (less than 500 degrees Centegrade) synthetic strategies will be developed to direct the preparation of new solid-state materials.  By exploiting ion exchange and intercalation methods, metal-anion layers  (transition-metal halide, oxide, chalcogenide, etc.) will be assembled within receptive host compounds.  Emphasis will be placed on multistep reaction processing where the sequential application of exchange/intercalation methods will lead to new intricately  layered products.    A  complementary  focus  area  will  be  the  preparation  of  new host materials receptive to low temperature topotactic manipulation -- new layered oxide hosts based on  perovskite  and  Sillen  structure  types  will  be  sought. The  detailed  characterization  of  new compounds will be a particularly important aspect of this project. Topotactically  prepared materials, as well as new hosts, are expected to demonstrate significant structural, magnetic, and &lt;br/&gt;electronic properties, especially in the case of mixed-valence compounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have both a broad scientific and educational impact. In terms of the scientific impact, this will be seen in the long term with the development of an extended series of low temperature reaction strategies.  A comprehensive library of reactions can be envisioned that would allow for the directed, rational synthesis of new nonmolecular target compounds with specific structural, electronic and magnetic features.  Such extensive capabilities would mirror those currently available to synthetic organic chemists.   &lt;br/&gt; With respect to the educational impact, efforts here will focus on the training of students and presentations to the local community.  Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in all aspects of the research component of this program.  This experience will provide them with valuable training in the synthesis and characterization of new materials as well as the presentation and publication of scientific data.  A further aspect of this component is the involvement of international students where undergraduate and/or graduate students from France will work in this research group in the  laboratory; this  effort  will  serve  to  promote  solid-state chemistry at the international  level. Finally, to communicate topics on solid state and  materials  chemistry to nonscientists in the local community, New Orleans public schools (K-12) will be visited to give lectures and demonstrations on concepts pertinent to solid state and materials chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
