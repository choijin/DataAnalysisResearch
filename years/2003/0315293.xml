<AbstractNarration>This dissertation research support project asks whether isolating a public function within a specialized policy arena affects the strategies and incentives of political actors and influences policy outcomes.  Looking at the proliferation of special districts in American local governance, the Ph.D. student argues that arena specification and multiplication produce a layering of decision-making institutions, and that developers and other interested stakeholders enjoy a procedural advantage in this kind of layered system.  Groups with a concentrated stake in policy outcomes will use electoral and lobbying strategies to capture specialized venues.  They then have an incentive to venue shop and shift multidimensional disputes into the arenas that will deliver more favorable decisions.  Groups interested in more diffuse public benefits will follow an investment strategy that focuses their resources on general purpose venues where monitoring and &lt;br/&gt;information costs are lower and they can participate in multiple issues.  As more policy issues are resolved in special district venues, concentrated benefits will win out over diffuse public aims.  The capture of special districts by interested stakeholders should affect distributional patterns in service provision and long-term patterns of metropolitan development.   &lt;br/&gt;The dissertation focuses specifically on water districts in testing hypotheses about the policy consequences of local government structure.  It addresses three empirical research questions: First, do water districts make different policy choices, with benefits for different interests, than cities and counties that provide water service?  Second, to what extent have land use disputes shifted into water district venues, and do the character of controversy and the policy outcomes differ from those in general purpose &lt;br/&gt;government venues?  Third, what are the consequences of water district governance for the growth and development of metropolitan areas over time?  The student applies multiple methods in answering these questions.  Using datasets from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the American Water Works Association, the student undertakes statistical analyses of the revenue and expenditure policies &lt;br/&gt;of water utilities to test whether special districts systematically favor different user groups and prioritize different objectives than municipal water suppliers.  The student also will conduct interview-based case studies in four metropolitan areas to examine the effects of institutional arrangements governing water on the character and content of policy making in disputes over intergovernmental cooperation and approval of new evelopment.  Finally, spatial time-series statistical techniques will be used to examine the rates and patterns of development in the same metropolitan areas. &lt;br/&gt;The dissertation's empirical results have broader benefits to society by demonstrating the linkage between water provision and land use and explaining the adoption of &lt;br/&gt;conservation and growth control measures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
