<AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests three yeas of support to continue a research program involving one senior&lt;br/&gt;investigator, one postdoctoral fellow and several students. The research will address hadrons&lt;br/&gt;and hadronic processes in terms of the con.ned quarks and gluons of Quantum Chromodynamics&lt;br/&gt;(QCD)b y joining recent advances in understanding the propagators and vertices involving&lt;br/&gt;gluon, ghost and quark .elds with advances in covariant modeling of mesons, form factors and&lt;br/&gt;interactions.&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator has expertise in continuum nonperturbative QCD modeling of&lt;br/&gt;hadrons and the subsequent description of hadronic processes based on the Dyson-Schwinger&lt;br/&gt;equations of the theory. Previous work has concentrated upon the solution of the Dyson-&lt;br/&gt;Schwinger equation for the dressed quark propagator followed by the solution of the bound&lt;br/&gt;state Bethe-Salpeter equation for mesons. The e.ective interaction that has emerged preserves&lt;br/&gt;the perturbative short distance behavior of QCD while the perturbative domain is described&lt;br/&gt;with two parameters. It generates the empirical amount of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking&lt;br/&gt;and the closely related phenomena of absolute quark con.nement is implemented. The evident&lt;br/&gt;success of this approach for the ground state pseudoscalar and vector mesons of light quarks,&lt;br/&gt;and for baryons, needs to be reconciled with recent advances by others that have increased our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the gauge boson sector of QCD.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, we seek to replace the two parameters of the above-mentioned e.ective interaction&lt;br/&gt;by results of independent studies of the more fundamental gauge boson sector of QCD. There&lt;br/&gt;are available model solutions of the gauge sector Dyson-Schwinger equations for at least the gluon&lt;br/&gt;and ghost dressed propagators that we wish to connect to. Also there is available independent&lt;br/&gt;quality data from lattice simulations of QCD for these quantities and for the important gluonquark&lt;br/&gt;vertex. Thus the time is ripe for development of continuum models of hadronic processes&lt;br/&gt;constrained by QCD data. These issues relate to the origin of quark con.nement and dynamical&lt;br/&gt;chiral symmetry breaking. Information on how to move beyond the ladder approximation is at&lt;br/&gt;hand and will be used. The consequences will be subjected to an evaluation in terms of hadronic&lt;br/&gt;observables. This information is needed to both advance our understanding of hadron physics&lt;br/&gt;and learn about the physically relevant nonperturbative dynamics of the gauge sector of QCD.&lt;br/&gt;Our combined approach will be an advance in continuum Poincare invariant investigations of the&lt;br/&gt;dominant quark-gluon mechanisms underlying hadron physics.&lt;br/&gt;Several activities within this project have broader impact. The research undertaken with&lt;br/&gt;this grant helps to advance both nuclear and particle physics. The quark-gluon basis of hadronic&lt;br/&gt;properties and processes is a focus area of nuclear physics and theoretical progress contributes&lt;br/&gt;to the return on the investment in the experimental facilities at JLab and RHIC. This work also&lt;br/&gt;contributes to the integration of research and education through the training of graduate students&lt;br/&gt;and postdoctoral scholars, and through the involvement of graduate students and postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;scholars in undergraduate teaching. Also students get the opportunity to participate in professional&lt;br/&gt;meetings. The international collaborations with scientists at the University of Tuebingen,&lt;br/&gt;Germany, needed to carry out parts of this project contribute to the nation's infrastructure for&lt;br/&gt;research and education.</AbstractNarration>
