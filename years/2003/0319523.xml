<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Hope College under the direction of Dr. Graham Peaslee for&lt;br/&gt;a particle accelerator and attached microprobe facility to enhance the research efforts of&lt;br/&gt;faculty and undergraduate students. This new instrumentation will be used in a variety of&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary research projects conducted in the areas of environmental chemistry,&lt;br/&gt;biochemistry and biophysics, condensed matter physics and materials science,&lt;br/&gt;electrochemistry, paleontology and geochemistry. While the disciplines affected by this&lt;br/&gt;state-of-the-art instrumentation vary, the intellectual merits of these research projects are&lt;br/&gt;consistent in that they each advance a field of basic scientific research, and they each&lt;br/&gt;involve significant opportunities for undergraduate training in doing so. Additionally,&lt;br/&gt;most of the research projects proposed will strengthen interdisciplinary connections&lt;br/&gt;between two or more research groups.&lt;br/&gt;Ion beam analysis techniques that will be available with this instrumentation include&lt;br/&gt;microPIXE, STIM and RBS, which allow characterization and quantitative measurement&lt;br/&gt;of elements on the surface of materials. Specific examples of the work to be pursued with&lt;br/&gt;this instrumentation include direct measurement of anthropogenic metals in the lake&lt;br/&gt;sediment and quantitative assessment of metals in protein gel assays. Other projects will&lt;br/&gt;simply use the analytical tools provided by this instrumentation to further the&lt;br/&gt;understanding of materials developed on campus or to solve problems that cannot be&lt;br/&gt;answered by other methods. Examples of this include characterization of amorphous&lt;br/&gt;nitrite films for optical and electronic devices and phthalocyanine films for use in&lt;br/&gt;electrochemical sensors, or studying the chemical surroundings of dinosaur bones&lt;br/&gt;between the time of their death and their discovery as fossils.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to these valuable research contributions that become possible with this&lt;br/&gt;instrumentation, the broader impact of this proposal includes the training of&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students in some of the state-of-the-art analytical methods employed in&lt;br/&gt;physics, chemistry, biology, geology and environmental science. What is novel about this&lt;br/&gt;particular instrumentation is that it will form a common tool that multidisciplinary teams&lt;br/&gt;of undergraduates (and their research mentors) will use together to solve complex&lt;br/&gt;research problems. In addition, it is anticipated that companies will be able to obtain&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated materials analysis from this facility occasionally, which will help local&lt;br/&gt;industries stay competitive.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
