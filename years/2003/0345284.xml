<AbstractNarration>This proposal was submitted to request support to provide Technical Assistance (TA) for urban districts that comprised the remaining portfolio.  Recognizing the importance of reform at all levels of a district, the Education Development Center (EDC), will focus on efforts that directly impact classroom instruction. The aim is to sustain accomplishments and advance the knowledge based at the level where it is most vulnerable.  Thus, for a period of two years, (beginning January 2004 through January 2006), EDC will provide activities and events aimed at improving teaching and learning for all students in science and mathematics.  TA will be provided through the use of face-to-face training structures, online approaches, and localized consultation that enhances the impact by combining approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TA will focus on the following three areas:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Supporting and sustaining the teacher leader model in science and mathematics, K-12;&lt;br/&gt;2. Sustaining students' engagement in high school science and mathematics while advancing their enrollment in rigorous courses; and&lt;br/&gt;3. Ensuring science is on the "front burner" in classrooms, schools, and districts, K-12. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on research findings, EDC plans to provide specific activities and organize conferences aimed at improving teacher quality and building leadership for change.  Several strategies will be used to help districts bring about that change.  First, teacher leaders will be targeted to help sustain and advance their work in classrooms throughout the SI districts. Second, EDC will focus its efforts on help the USPs' continuing struggle to bring about change at the high school level.  Third, an effort will be made to include science more centrally in local district reform efforts.  Finally, EDC will attempt to gain a better understanding of how to organize and implement TA such that the lessons-learned might contribute to future large-scale reform efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The utility of the multi-tiered design will increase the number of people who will have access to lessons-learned and better ensure widespread use of best practices.  The products, resources, and advances in knowledge in science and mathematics will help the SI and well as other districts meet other national and state requirements such as No Child Left Behind.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
