<AbstractNarration>0119483&lt;br/&gt;Kotov&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in nanotechnology and bioengineering have opened the exciting prospect for promoting direct interaction of electronics, optics and biological systems. The primary obstacle to realizing this goal in the fields of neuroscience and medical devices such as prostheses is the inadequate understanding of the molecular processes involved in coupling between living neurons and nanomaterials, and how to optimize the coupling between man made materials and living systems.  In this project, the intent is to investigate the dynamics and mechanisms of the live/lifeless matter interaction in a model system consisting of a thin film composed of nanoparticles and cultured nerve cells. The multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional "Linked Collaborative Proposals " bring together several research groups with broad expertise and research interest to conduct experimental and theoretical studies aimed at characterizing the interaction that occur at the interface of nanomaterials and neurons and optimizing the interface for effective photon-activation of neurons following photonic probing of the interface of nanomaterials that are attached to the cells. The partners at Oklahoma State University lead by Dr. Kotov will carry out the materials science aspect of this project, while the investigation at the University of Texas Medical Branch lead by Dr. Motamedi will concentrate on the bioengineering and electrophysiological components of this work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the objectives of the proje ct are the following. (1) Preparation of biocompatible nanoparticle multilayers that can be attached to nerve cells. (2) Registration and characterization of the photoinduced nerve cell membrane currents and potentials following optical excitation of the interface as function of NP and biological structures. (3) Optimization of NP-cell coupling for different interface structure. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
