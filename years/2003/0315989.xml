<AbstractNarration>With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division, Professors Gideon Fraenkel at Ohio State University proposes to focus on carbanionic substances as revealed by the structure and behavior of selected categories of organolithium compounds. The objective is to correlate structures with the dynamics and mechanisms of their fast equilibrium reorganizations and their chemical behaviors. Structure will be investigated with X-ray crystallography and new NMR experiments while dynamic information will be obtained using proton, 13C, 6Li, 7Li and 15N NMR line shape analyses. DFT calculations will be used to analyze the results and help predict new interesting systems for possible future study. Model compounds have been designed to reveal specific aspects of structure and dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division supports Professor Gideon Fraenkel at Ohio State University who will utilize many areas of chemistry including organic and organometallic synthesis, dynamic NMR, DFT calculations and X-ray crystallography to examine critical problems. Professor Fraenkel's have provided enhanced opportunities in the job market for women and members of other unrepresented groups who have participated in the research. Former students have entered both traditional and non-traditional fields. Dr. Fraenkel was PI of the REU site here 1997-2000 and he administered the department's undergraduate research program for six years. The REU program was particularly successful in recruiting talented students from traditionally black colleges. Professor Fraenkel's research is leading to a fundamental understanding of organolithium compounds and their use in reactions. Many groups from all over the country have consulted with the group on their synthetic problems involving organolithium compounds. For example, research results and consultations have benefited institutions such as Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co, researchers at Cornell University, and Merck Co.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
