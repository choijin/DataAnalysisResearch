<AbstractNarration>DMS-0305818&lt;br/&gt;Ronald Fintushel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the central problems of low-dimensional topology is the &lt;br/&gt;classification of smooth simply connected 4-manifolds. New &lt;br/&gt;constructions have confused the issue of&lt;br/&gt;classification, but also have invigorated the theory and reinforced &lt;br/&gt;its richness and diversity.  Still further examples are needed to &lt;br/&gt;identify a suitable classification scheme, and the proposer intends &lt;br/&gt;to work on such constructions. The ultimate goal of the proposer is &lt;br/&gt;to develop enough techniques for new constructions of smooth and &lt;br/&gt;symplectic 4-manifolds that a general picture for classification will &lt;br/&gt;begin to emerge.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this proposal will address the relationship &lt;br/&gt;between mathematics and theoretical physics, opportunities for &lt;br/&gt;graduate and undergraduate students in topology, and career &lt;br/&gt;development of postdoctoral fellows. The proposer will study &lt;br/&gt;geography problems for symplectic manifolds which have been shown to &lt;br/&gt;impact physics via the notion of 'superconformal simple type'. &lt;br/&gt;Another basic goal of this proposal is the development of problems &lt;br/&gt;which are accessible to graduate and advanced undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;This proposal presents problems which will be suitable thesis &lt;br/&gt;problems for the proposer's future students. It also discusses &lt;br/&gt;computational problems which the proposer plans to give to advanced &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students. The proposer will also support graduate and &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students during summers and encourage their &lt;br/&gt;participation in conferences. Problems posed in this proposal will &lt;br/&gt;also be useful for postdoctoral fellows at Michigan State.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of 4-dimensional manifolds is important for both &lt;br/&gt;mathematical and physical reasons. In mathematics, topology of 4 &lt;br/&gt;dimensions lies at a crossroad, where one can try to apply &lt;br/&gt;well-developed techniques of low-dimensional (3 and fewer dimensions) &lt;br/&gt;topology, and also one might hope to utilize powerful techniques of &lt;br/&gt;high dimensional topology, such as surgery theory. In many ways, the &lt;br/&gt;most interesting techniques come from neither of these approaches, &lt;br/&gt;but rather from analogies with complex surface theory and input from &lt;br/&gt;high energy physics, where for obvious reasons 4-dimensional theory &lt;br/&gt;is central. This proposal, takes this latter view.&lt;br/&gt;Its key techniques revolve around the Seiberg-Witten equations &lt;br/&gt;arising in quantum field theory.&lt;br/&gt;--</AbstractNarration>
