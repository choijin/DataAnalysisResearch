<AbstractNarration>In this study, researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Virginia Institute of Marine Science, University of California - Santa Cruz, University of California - Santa Barbara, University of Tasmania, and NIWA-Australia will work collaboratively to answer a difficult question in marine biogeochemistry: What controls the efficiency of particle transport between the surface and deep ocean? More specifically, what is the fate of sinking particles leaving the upper ocean and what factors influence remineralization length scales for different sinking particle classes?   Knowing the efficiency of particle transport is important for an accurate assessment of the ocean carbon sink.   Globally, the magnitude and efficiency of the biological pump will in part modulate levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team intends to test two basic hypotheses about remineralization control, namely:  (1) particle source characteristics are the dominant control on the efficiency of particle transport; and/or that (2) mid-water processing, either by zooplankton or bacteria, controls transport efficiency.  To do so, they will conduct process studies at sea focused on particle flux and composition changes in the upper 500-1000m of the ocean.   The basic approach is to examine changes in particle composition and flux with depth within a given source region using a combination of approaches, many of which are new to the field.  These include neutrally buoyant sediment traps, particle pumps, settling columns and respiration chambers, along with the development of new biological and geochemical tools for an integrated biogeochemical assessment of the biological pump.   Two sites will be studied extensively on three-week process study cruises:  the Hawaii Ocean Time-series site (HOT) and a new moored time-series site in the subarctic NW Pacific (Japanese site K2; 47oN 160oE).  There are strong contrasts between these sites in rates of production, export, particle composition and expected remineralization length scales.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evidence for variability in the flux vs. depth relationship of sinking particles is not in dispute, but the controls on particle transport efficiency through the twilight zone remain poorly understood.  A lack of reliable flux and particle characterization data within the twilight zone has hampered our ability to make progress in this area, and no single approach is likely to resolve these issues.  The proposed study will apply quantitative modeling to determine the net effects of the individual particle processes on the effective transport of carbon and other elements and to place the shipboard observations in the context of spatial and temporal variations in these processes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the obvious contributions to the study of the oceanic and planetary carbon cycles, there are broader outcomes and impacts forthcoming from this project.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be included in all aspects of the research, and the involvement of non-US PIs will encourage exchange of students and post-docs between labs in different countries.  In addition, the component groups will continue to maintain science web sites designed for both public and scientific exchange where the broader and specific goals and outcomes of this work can be communicated.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project is supported cooperatively by the NSF Chemical Oceanography and Biological Oceanography Programs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
