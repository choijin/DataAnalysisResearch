<AbstractNarration>DMS-0305128&lt;br/&gt;Rebecca Goldin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic geometry occurs at a crossroad of combinatorics, &lt;br/&gt;representation theory, physics, geometry and topology. One of the most &lt;br/&gt;important examples of a Hamiltonian T-space is the coadjoint orbit of a &lt;br/&gt;compact Lie group. Coadjoint orbits arise in physics, as they are the &lt;br/&gt;set of all matrices with specified spectra. They also occur in &lt;br/&gt;representation theory, as all irreducible representations of a complex &lt;br/&gt;reductive Lie group occur as holomorphic sections of a line bundle over &lt;br/&gt;a coadjoint orbit. They occur in algebraic geometry as projective &lt;br/&gt;varieties. The intersection theory of naturally arising subvarieties, &lt;br/&gt;called Schubert varieties, appears in questions of linear algebra, &lt;br/&gt;valuation rings, and representation theory. Schubert calculus is &lt;br/&gt;important as it is the linear case for (and hence the first step &lt;br/&gt;towards) understanding complex algebraic intersections more generally. &lt;br/&gt;Algebraically, Schubert calculus analyses the multiplicative structure &lt;br/&gt;of the cohomology of flag varieties. The main open question is to find a &lt;br/&gt;totally positive formula for the (equivariant) structure constants. In &lt;br/&gt;joint work with A. Knutson, Goldin has discovered new techniques that &lt;br/&gt;give hope for a positive formula in certain cases. Goldin is also &lt;br/&gt;interested in topological invariants that distinguish reduced spaces for &lt;br/&gt;any compact Hamiltonian T-space, such as certain ideals found in its &lt;br/&gt;equivariant cohomology ring or generalized equivariant Euler classes. &lt;br/&gt;Goldin is additionally developing techniques to calculate integrals on &lt;br/&gt;certain symplectic reduced spaces using small amounts of information &lt;br/&gt;about how the torus acts on the original symplectic manifold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding Schubert calculus is a small step towards the larger &lt;br/&gt;question of how to study intersections of algebraic varieties. Such &lt;br/&gt;intersections arise outside of mathematics, as scientists ask questions &lt;br/&gt;that involve the concurrence of several physical constraints, and want &lt;br/&gt;to understand what possible solutions there may be. Symplectic geometry &lt;br/&gt;is a natural setting to describe physical systems. The space of the &lt;br/&gt;position and the momentum of a particle, for example, is called "phase &lt;br/&gt;space" and has a natural symplectic structure on it. In many cases, &lt;br/&gt;there is a lot of symmetry; physical observations of the Hydrogen atom, &lt;br/&gt;for example, are unaffected by the position of the observer a fixed &lt;br/&gt;distance away from the particle. The study of "reduced spaces" is a way &lt;br/&gt;of studying the physics while simplifying the space by ignoring (in &lt;br/&gt;fact, dividing out) these symmetries. Much of Goldin's work involves &lt;br/&gt;techniques to do computations on these simplified systems, which may &lt;br/&gt;shed light on questions that physicists and chemists are posing about &lt;br/&gt;molecules and particles. Goldin is also writing a book (joint with G. &lt;br/&gt;Goldin) on myths in mathematics education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
