<AbstractNarration>Proposal ID: AST-0353849&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Clemson University&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Barnes, Peter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site will be initiated at Clemson University, under the direction of Peter Barnes.  The site will host 8-10 undergraduate students for ten weeks during the summer.  The objectives are 1. to involve undergraduate students in research projects, 2. to teach students to work on team oriented projects, 3. to conduct workshops on oral and written communications, 4. to encourage students to pursue careers in science and 5. to reach out to students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  The projects to be assigned to the visiting undergraduates are integral parts of the research efforts in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Clemson University.  The principal areas of study include Atmospheric and Space Physics, Astronomy and Astrophysics, Biophysics, and Condensed Matter Physics.  The REU projects will encompass both theoretical and experimental research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recruiting efforts will be conducted on a nationwide basis, with special emphasis placed upon recruiting students from Historically Black Universities and Colleges in the state of South Carolina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
