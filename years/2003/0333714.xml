<AbstractNarration>This project is continuing the development and expansion of the content of the Electronic Encyclopedia of Earthquakes (EEE).  EEE is a portal for earthquake information, freely available to all users, which has been developed under a prior NSDL award (DUE-0121703) by a team of more than 35 earthquake scientists and engineers.  EEE is a  collaboration among three major organizations in earthquake science and engineering: the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC), the Consortium of Universities for Research in Earthquake Engineering (CUREE), and the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS).  It maintains a wide variety of earthquake-related information, including curricula resources for studying earth science, engineering, physics, and mathematics. The goals of the EEE project are to leverage curiosity about earthquakes into increased scientific literacy and, ultimately, to reduce earthquake risk and loss by improving personal and societal decision-making through increased awareness of earthquake hazards and the means for mitigation and preparedness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the existing collection, an evaluation of the educational benefits and usability of the materials for K-12 and college educators is being conducted.  The activities currently being undertaken reflect the need to continue adding entries to the EEE, while at the same time assessing the educational impact of the collection and the resources it references.  New capabilities for usability are also being developed and usability tools such as Walden's Path and AskE3 are being assessed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significant co-funding of this project is being provided by the Division of Earth Sciences in the NSF Directorate for Geosciences in recognition of the importance that this collection of digital resources on earthquakes has for K-16 students and educators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
