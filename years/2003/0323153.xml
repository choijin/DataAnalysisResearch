<AbstractNarration>This project is focused on decentralized control of networked systems, including&lt;br/&gt;both problems of control of communication networks, and also control of spatially dis-&lt;br/&gt;tributed systems with specifications on their mutual interconnection.&lt;br/&gt;A key common feature to the problems under consideration is the mandatory decen-&lt;br/&gt;tralization in the control algorithms. Despite the well-known difficulties in imposing such&lt;br/&gt;information constraints to control systems design, we are motivated by recent successes in&lt;br/&gt;special problems, which indicate that perhaps the time has come for a more fruitful interac-&lt;br/&gt;tion between control and networking. In particular, in some of our recent work on Internet&lt;br/&gt;congestion control, we have been able to devise decentralized algorithms that have prov-&lt;br/&gt;able properties over arbitrary network topologies, overcoming some limitations of currently&lt;br/&gt;deployed TCP protocols. This work, which we plan to continue in this project, is already&lt;br/&gt;leading to prototype implementations which are being tested in high-speed networks.&lt;br/&gt;One of our main goals in this project is to expand this area of research to a number&lt;br/&gt;of other network resource allocation problems that involve decentralized feedback, such&lt;br/&gt;as multicast flow control and routing control in the Internet, and an even broader set of&lt;br/&gt;questions for wireless networks: power control, bandwidth allocation and their interaction&lt;br/&gt;with flow control.&lt;br/&gt;A second thrust of this project concerns a different kind of relationship between control&lt;br/&gt;and networks: namely, the decentralized control of a network of spatially distributed, mutu-&lt;br/&gt;ally interacting dynamical systems. We also build here on our previous work on distributed&lt;br/&gt;arrays, which identified a procedure that renders tractable decentralized control synthesis,&lt;br/&gt;at the expense of some conservatism. Our plan here is to extend these methods to control-&lt;br/&gt;ling networks of systems in more general topologies, such as vehicle formation problems,&lt;br/&gt;and also to combine this approach with model predictive control (MPC) running at each&lt;br/&gt;unit.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project are of two kinds: one, judging from our recent&lt;br/&gt;successes in Internet congestion control and the ongoing experimental collaborations, there&lt;br/&gt;is a distinct possibility that this kind of alternative algorithms could be deployed, or at&lt;br/&gt;least influence the development of next-generation protocols; the impact of this would be&lt;br/&gt;substantial. Secondly, the interdisciplinary quality of the work described here can have&lt;br/&gt;great educational impact, not only for the students involved but also through more unified&lt;br/&gt;curricular offerings in control and networks. Indeed, the significant common ground between&lt;br/&gt;these and other related disciplines (optimization, game theory) makes this a very fertile&lt;br/&gt;area, and also one that reinvigorates the presence of Controls in Electrical Engineering&lt;br/&gt;departments such as our own.&lt;br/&gt;1</AbstractNarration>
