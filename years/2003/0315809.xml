<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funds for the purchase of an Optical Image Furnace (OIF) designed for highly controlled single crystal growth. Research in novel transition metal oxides, piezoelectric materials, thin-film growth, and optical materials will be immediately impacted by this acquisition. The furnace will be used to synthesize single crystals of novel materials at the forefront of science thereby allowing a determination of fundamental behavior of new materials. This acquisition permits the evaluation of anisotropies, a search for new thin-film substrates, and improvement of the performance of materials used in resonant optical, spectral hole burning, and piezoelectric applications. The Principal Investigator (PI) has extensive experience using an OIF and the existing infrastructure at MSU compliments this acquisition as well. The PI collaborates extensively, and the single crystals grown at MSU will be made available to other scientists. A number of new uses for the OIF are discussed. It is expected that anticipated close interaction with Scientific Materials Corporation, a local company, will lead to new advances in single crystal growth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed activity are significant. The OIF offers the following educational advantages: (1) the PI will train a number of senior scientists in use of the device; (2) it will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate research projects enabling students to grow their own single crystals; and (3) it will be used for class laboratory projects in undergraduate and graduate condensed matter physics allowing students to grow, characterize, and orient single crystals in classes normally devoid of laboratory work. The furnace will be utilized for single crystal growth projects in the summer REU program, which targets Native Americans. It will enhance the current infrastructure at MSU, plant the seeds for strong partnerships with local companies, and provide a new user facility in the Northwestern USA, expanding the technological infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
