<AbstractNarration>Terrestrial- in situ- cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) methods for surface exposure dating and other&lt;br/&gt;earth-science applications were first demonstrated in 1986. During the subsequent 17 years these methods have developed into versatile and indispensable tools in many fields of modern Earth Sciences, including paleoclimatology, geomorphology, tectonics, hydrology, and volcanology. The TCN that have been demonstrated to be widely applicable are 3H, 10Be, 14C, 21Ne, 26Al, and 36Cl. This rapid development has been facilitated by methodological progress, including improvements in sampling strategies, sample preparation procedures and analyses of cosmogenic nuclides (by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) and noble gas mass spectrometry). In order to remain at the cutting edge of the earth sciences the accuracy of TCN methods must be significantly improved. However, it is the consensus of practitioners in the field that further developments are instead moving toward an impasse. This limitation is imposed, not by methodological considerations, but rather by incomplete understanding of the fundamental physical processes, and by lack of rigorous intercomparability between different investigators and methods. The global distribution of cosmogenic nuclide production depends on a number of interrelated factors, and these&lt;br/&gt;factors must be simultaneously controlled in order to arrive at the equations and parameters that accurately define production rates at all points, and over geological time. This task is far beyond the capability of any individual investigator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to achieve this next, necessary, step the CRONUS-Earth Project is proposed. The project&lt;br/&gt;has the following goals: (i) to establish a rigorous basis for intercomparison between measurement of different nuclides and by different investigators, (ii) to provide a firm linkage between cosmic-ray physics and the systematics of the TCN produced by the cosmic rays, and (iii) to produce generally-accepted formulations and parameters for calculation of TCN production. The ultimate goal is to advance the precision and accuracy of all TCN methods from its current range of ~10% to 20% toward a 5% level. This project is envisioned as an international, collaborative effort. CRONUS-Earth consists of six major components: (i) A methodological intercomparison, including sample preparation as well as analytical measurement. (ii) Spatial/temporal distribution of cosmic-ray fluxes, through "mining" existing neutron monitor datasets, modeling of neutron monitor responses, and measurement of saturated in situ 14C altitude/latitude profiles. (iii) Emplacement of artificial targets for 3He, 21Ne, 10Be, 32P and 36Cl production, to link contemporary cosmic-ray fluxes to production rates and scaling factors. (iv) Measurement of production cross-sections using laboratory neutron beams. (v) A numerical modeling effort to integrate the observations and to calculate the effects of past geomagnetic and paleoclimatic changes on cosmogenic&lt;br/&gt;nuclide production. (vi) Geological calibration of nuclide production rates, based on independently-dated surfaces worldwide. These will be classified by quality into primary calibration sites and secondary, or "verification", sites that will be used to test the overall production-rate model. These six components comprise a synergistic and coordinated approach to a problem that is clearly beyond the scope of individuals and small research teams. We propose a consortium approach to managing the project, involving multiple investigators, annual meetings to monitor progress, compile data, and exchange with the community, rapid electronic distribution of results, and integration of the final products through a project office charged with disseminating the results to the community. A linked CRONUS-Europe proposal has been submitted to the EU and will be closely coordinated with CRONUS-Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CRONUS-Earth Project will address the NSF intellectual merit review criterion through&lt;br/&gt;establishing an improved, quantitative, physically-based, understanding of TCN production and&lt;br/&gt;accumulation that can be applied to solve a wide variety of problems in the earth sciences. The Project will address the broader impacts criterion by providing formulations, parameters, and computer codes that will constitute an intellectual infrastructure enabling more consistent, accurate, and widespread application of TCN methods in the earth sciences. Furthermore, the Project will provide a basis for a more formal and organized future approach to promoting consistency in application of TCN methods, such as committees to provide recommended values for parameters. Finally, it will include a component to directly involve undergraduates, and especially minority students, in research in aspects of earth science related to CRONUS.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Reliable standards are fundamental to all experimental science.  International AMS (Accelerator Mass Spectrometry) standards for cosmic-ray-produced nuclides (e.g., 10Be, 26Al, 36Cl, and 41Ca) were prepared and internationally distributed so that AMS laboratories worldwide would be able to normalize all their measurements to one standard.  The new standard revealed that discrepancies in earlier experimental results had occurred due to the previous lack of well-calibrated in-house standards.  Cosmic-ray-produced nuclides are used to study the histories and processes of planetary surfaces, including Earth and other extraterrestrial objects.  Such nuclides are mainly produced by the interaction between surface materials and cosmic-ray secondary neutrons, with the production by protons from solar cosmic rays being important in some instances.  Simulations of the flux of secondary neutrons and their energy spectra are relatively well developed, employing mathematically complex models that use Monte Carlo particle transport codes.  However, the lack of high-energy neutron cross-section data prevents accurate calculations of nuclide production rates; essential if one wants to use cosmic-ray-produced nuclides to obtain reliable geological data.  The major aim of this project was the determination of the neutron excitation functions for all of the cosmic-ray-produced reactions of cosmochemical and geological interest.  We found the measured neutron excitation functions for the production of 10Be from O, and for the production of 36Cl from K and Ca are very different to those of previously used proton excitation functions.  It is clear that neutron cross-section measurements are important for accurate production rate calculations.  Furthermore, these cross-sections and model calculations will be used to estimate neutron-induced radioactivity at accelerator facilities, and for designing accelerator health-safety shielding.  To better understand production rates for terrestrial applications we also obtained measurements of cosmic-ray-produced nuclides in well-documented and dated rocks, collected from several locations on the Earth.  After compiling this data, we will have the comprehensive and accurate measurements of production rates to date.
