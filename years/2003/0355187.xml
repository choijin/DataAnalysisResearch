<AbstractNarration>DMS 0355187&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B Solomyak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of Washington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MEASURES, DIMENSION, AND ERGODIC THEORY&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This project is in the area of interaction between geometric&lt;br/&gt;measure theory, fractal geometry, and ergodic theory.&lt;br/&gt;Iterated function systems, popularly known as the ``Chaos Game,''&lt;br/&gt;provide a convenient framework for the study of fractal phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;Invariant measures for such systems include&lt;br/&gt;infinite sums of products of idependent, identically-distributed random variables, which arise in many probablistic and dynamical models, and stationary measures for random matrix products.  One of the central problems is to determine when such a measure is absolutely continuous. A closely related line of research is concerned with topological properties of attractors, in particular, self-similar and self-affine sets. Especially challenging are the systems that are&lt;br/&gt;not uniformly contracting and those which have a substantial&lt;br/&gt;``overlap.'' On the ergodic theory side, the project deals with&lt;br/&gt;substitution and tiling dynamical systems without discrete spectrum,&lt;br/&gt;as well as with algebraic coding of toral automorphisms. The&lt;br/&gt;so-called non-Pisot case is of particular interest to us, where&lt;br/&gt;it is proposed to use some variants of the beta-transformation defined on self-affine sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To play the ``Chaos Game'' on the plane, one should specify a family of&lt;br/&gt;planar tranformations (called an iterated function system)&lt;br/&gt;and iteratively apply one of them at random, with prescribed&lt;br/&gt;probabilities. Under certain technical conditions (called&lt;br/&gt;``contracting-on-average'') the emerging picture will almost surely&lt;br/&gt;``converge'' to a set called the attractor of the iterated function&lt;br/&gt;system. This is a popular method to draw fractals on the computer screen, but it is more than a game: iterated functions are widely used in signal processing, image compression, and simulation algorithms,&lt;br/&gt;as well as in mathematical dynamical systems theory.&lt;br/&gt;The picture that we see on a computer screen is actually a greytone image, which is an approximation of a measure,&lt;br/&gt;or probability distribution. An important problem is to decide when this distribution has a density.  A related line of research&lt;br/&gt;is to classify the ``zoo'' of fractal objects which arise in the course&lt;br/&gt;of the Chaos Game. The second part of the project is concerned with&lt;br/&gt;another class of objects which can be obtained by iteration:&lt;br/&gt;infinite substitutive sequences and self-similar tilings. Now the&lt;br/&gt;iteration procedure involves replacing each symbol&lt;br/&gt;by a block of symbols, or each tile by a patch of tiles.&lt;br/&gt;The limiting object is then used to create a fascinating&lt;br/&gt;dynamical system which we study. Apart from their intrinsic beauty,&lt;br/&gt;such systems have found applications in physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
