<AbstractNarration>0328333&lt;br/&gt;Soslowsky&lt;br/&gt;The Summer Bioengineering Conference is a multidisciplinary biennial biomedical engineering event sponsored by the Bioengineering Division of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). This year's Conference is co-sponsored by other well recognized societies related to Bioengineering, including the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES), the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), the U.S. National Committee on Biomechanics (USNCB), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (IEEE EMBS), and Biomat.net. The multidisciplinary nature of bioengineering is well represented by participation of these sponsoring societies. A hallmark of this meeting has been the interaction and true integration of rigorous engineering principles and rigorous biologic concepts. The meeting is to occur at Sonesta Beach Resort, Key Biscayne, FL June 25-29, 2003. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support is provided for 3 plenary speakers who will  make presentations about fields just outside of mainstream bioengineering, such as; genomics; biomechanics of cell motility; environmental stresses on cell behavior; systems analysis and biotechnology to understand disease; gene regulatory networks. The intellectual merit of the expert plenary speaker concept is high as advanced scientific concepts are to be introduced to bioengineering researchers. Similarly, a broader impact should occur from the presentations by providing important cross-fertilization of ideas, concepts, tools, and approaches to problem solving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All conference presentations will be documented in two page extended abstracts and compiled in a CD format, distributed free to all paid registrants. Copies of this CD will also be provided to all co-sponsoring societies. The contents of this CD will be posted on the conference web site at&lt;br/&gt;http://www.asme.org/divisions/bed/events/summer03.html.</AbstractNarration>
