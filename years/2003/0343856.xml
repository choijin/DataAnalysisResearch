    <AbstractNarration>IBN-0343856&lt;br/&gt;Adan Colon-Carmona &lt;br/&gt;University of Massachusetts, Boston&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phytoremediation Program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The proposed project explores the underlying molecular mechanisms for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-induced responses in plants, as well as their potential biodegradation pathways. PAHs are organic pollutants that cause human health problems such as cancer. PAHs are contaminants resulting from oil-based manufacturing. Some plant species, including crop plants such as sunflower, soybean, pea and carrot, can grow on moderate levels of crude oil-contaminated soil. Yet, very little is known at the molecular level about the mechanisms of PAH uptake and degradation, or even cell signaling pathways regulating PAH stress responses. A better understanding of PAH stress physiology will lead to the generation of phytoremediation strategies in pollution clean-up and biomonitoring. The aims of this proposal are the following: 1) to characterized the physiological responses to PAHs in Arabidopsis thaliana, 2) to identify the signaling pathways that mediate the various PAH-induced plant responses, 3) to screen genetically mutagenized populations for plants that are defective in PAH-induced growth responses, and 4) to identify, through bacterial screens, plant cDNAs that can be used in PAH degradation. The long term goal of these studies are to utilize the information regarding PAH-induced responses in Arabidopsis to engineer trees or crop plants with extensive root systems for their use in biodegradation and biomonitoring of PAH contamination.</AbstractNarration>
