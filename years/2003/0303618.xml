<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0303618&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Thomas W. Scanlon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research supported by this award is to be performed by&lt;br/&gt;Matthias Aschenbrenner, under the sponsorship of Thomas&lt;br/&gt;W. Scanlon.  These projects in model theory and its applications&lt;br/&gt;to algebra and geometry are concerned with asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;differential algebra, o-minimal geometry, and bounds and&lt;br/&gt;algorithms in algebra.  The project on asymptotic differential&lt;br/&gt;algebra will pursue model-theoretic and algebraic properties of&lt;br/&gt;Hardy fields and transseries, and the relationship between them.&lt;br/&gt;A Hardy field is an ordered differential field of germs of&lt;br/&gt;real-valued, once-differentiable functions defined on&lt;br/&gt;neighborhoods of positive infinity in the real line; they are&lt;br/&gt;important in the asymptotic theory of differential equations and&lt;br/&gt;appear naturally in connection with o-minimal expansions of the&lt;br/&gt;real field.  An example of a field of transseries is the field of&lt;br/&gt;logarithmic-exponential series over the real numbers, which has&lt;br/&gt;been explored by analysts as well as model-theorists.  Among the&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic issues in algebra that will be investigated are&lt;br/&gt;algorithms with performance bounds for polynomial rings over the&lt;br/&gt;integers and for rings of power series; problems for which good&lt;br/&gt;algorithms are sought include tests for ideal membership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea of the branch of logic called model theory is, roughly, that&lt;br/&gt;if we know all of the simply-stated truths about an object then either&lt;br/&gt;we should know how to recognize that object uniquely, or anything else&lt;br/&gt;sharing the same collection of first-order properties should be&lt;br/&gt;revealing like the original and might sometimes be easier to study.&lt;br/&gt;To be more precise, model theory studies mathematical structures by&lt;br/&gt;considering the first-order sentences true in those structures, and&lt;br/&gt;the family of alternate structures that also satisfy all of those&lt;br/&gt;first-order sentences.  (Sentences in logic are built out of a small&lt;br/&gt;repertoire of elements and constructions.  "First-order" refers to the&lt;br/&gt;number of quantifiers in a sentence, a measure of complexity.)&lt;br/&gt;A model for the algorithms and bounds sought in some of these projects&lt;br/&gt;is long division: if you are given two whole numbers to divide by hand&lt;br/&gt;then you can estimate the number of steps required by long division&lt;br/&gt;by comparing the number of digits in the decimal expansions&lt;br/&gt;of the dividend and divisor.</AbstractNarration>
