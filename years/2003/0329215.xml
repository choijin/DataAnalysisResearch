<AbstractNarration>The major goals of this collaborative project are two-fold: (1) To &lt;br/&gt;obtain high resolution images of inner core anisotropy, through a &lt;br/&gt;proposed PASSCAL experiment; (2) To develop a geodynamic model for &lt;br/&gt;the origin of the observed seismic anisotropy.  The investigators &lt;br/&gt;plan to deploy two linear arrays of 15 new stations in the interior &lt;br/&gt;of Alaska, coded as Alaska Receiving Cross-Transects for the Inner &lt;br/&gt;Core (ARCTIC). New data from earthquakes in South Sandwich Islands to &lt;br/&gt;the arrays will provide critically needed lateral and depth samples &lt;br/&gt;of the inner core for determining the inner core rotation and for &lt;br/&gt;resolving the structure of the inner core transition zone and the &lt;br/&gt;depth-dependence of inner core anisotropy and attenuation. the team &lt;br/&gt;plans to develop a geodynamic model for the formation of anisotropy, &lt;br/&gt;using the new and existing data as a constraint. The major objective &lt;br/&gt;of the modeling is to identify and investigate physical processes, &lt;br/&gt;including effects of plastic deformation, inner-core growth and &lt;br/&gt;recrystallization, and anisotropy in the thermal conductivity, that &lt;br/&gt;can account for the observed depth and lateral variations in &lt;br/&gt;anisotropy. The developed model will serve as a physical context for &lt;br/&gt;interpreting the seismic observations. Predictions of the model will &lt;br/&gt;be used to calculate synthetic waveforms, which are subsequently &lt;br/&gt;compared with the observations to refine the model. The new data &lt;br/&gt;collected will also be used to elucidate crustal and upper mantle &lt;br/&gt;structure of the Alaska interior.  The north-south line from &lt;br/&gt;Fairbanks to Prudhoe Bay will cross the Brooks Range in northern &lt;br/&gt;Alaska, and The east-west line between Fairbanks and Nome will cover &lt;br/&gt;parts of western Alaska in a known, but nearly unstudied, region of &lt;br/&gt;extensional tectonics.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
