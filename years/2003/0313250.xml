<AbstractNarration>ITR:  Information Flow in a Heterogeneous Distributed System:  Biomimetic Approaches to Embedded Coordinated Control&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal number: NSF-0313250&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Kristi A. Morgansen&lt;br/&gt;CoPI:  Julia K. Parrish&lt;br/&gt;CoPI: Daniel Grunbaum&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work in this project focuses on the development of systems-level biomimetic control-theoretic models and motion control algorithms.  Specifically these tools will be used to address embedded, emergent coordinated behavior of multiple underwater robots using biological systems (fish schools) as models.  We will address the limits of how information transmission in coordinated groups can be effected through local sensing when the dynamics of the individual elements are not homogeneous but are allowed to be nonuniform and additionally are intentionally modified to act as control parameters.  The methods to be used in this work fundamentally integrate techniques and tools from both biology and engineering, and the results have the potential for high impact in a broad range of applications.  The particular applications that will be addressed in this project are emergent behaviors in mixed species schools of fish and coordinated control of autonomous underwater vehicles propelled in the carangiform style of locomotion.  The long-term goals of this research are (1) an understanding of how collectives can gather and process information depending on inputs (sensory systems) and rules of individual interaction, and (2) design of collective systems to accomplish a wide range of tasks not currently feasible with autonomous vehicle systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interdisciplinary approach between engineering and biology used in this work provides a broad range of opportunities not only for advances in basic science but also for the purpose of education within and between the two disciplines.  The initial stages of the program described here have already proven to be of interest to graduate and undergraduate students from a range of engineering disciplines.  As the work progresses, stronger ties between biology and engineering will be developed through material introduced in introductory engineering and science courses, dissemination of research results, and similar means to positively influence general public perception and awareness of the impact of engineering and biology on societal concerns. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
