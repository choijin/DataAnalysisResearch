<AbstractNarration>  A smooth real-valued function f on a complex manifold X&lt;br/&gt;is said to be strongly q-convex if its Levi form L(f)&lt;br/&gt;has at most q-1 nonpositive eigenvalues at each point.&lt;br/&gt;The manifold X is called strongly q-convex if X admits&lt;br/&gt;an exhaustion function which is strongly q-convex on the&lt;br/&gt;complement of some compact subset K (X is q-complete&lt;br/&gt;if one may take K to be empty). There are also well-known&lt;br/&gt;notions of q-convexity for complex spaces. If g is a Hermitian&lt;br/&gt;metric on X, then f is of class SP(g,q) if the trace of&lt;br/&gt;the restriction of L(f) to any complex vector subspace of&lt;br/&gt;dimension q in the tangent space at any point in X&lt;br/&gt;is positive. Such functions are strongly q-convex. The principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator and  Mohan Ramachandran have applied such functions to&lt;br/&gt;obtain results concerning the Levi problem and the structure of&lt;br/&gt;complete Kaehler manifolds. They have also developed and applied&lt;br/&gt;analogous classes on complex spaces. The principal investigator&lt;br/&gt;plans to apply such functions to extend some results for Kaehler&lt;br/&gt;manifolds to singular Kaehler spaces and to study q-convexity&lt;br/&gt;properties of coverings; in particular, covering spaces of&lt;br/&gt;(quasi)projective varieties. Some or all of the proposed work&lt;br/&gt;will probably involve collaboration with Michael Fraboni, Cezar&lt;br/&gt;Joita, or Mohan Ramachandran.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Complex spaces (in particular, Stein spaces and projective&lt;br/&gt;varieties), are the fundamental objects of study in several&lt;br/&gt;complex variables and algebraic geometry.  The notion of&lt;br/&gt;q-convexity is one of the many useful generalizations&lt;br/&gt;of geometric convexity (for example, a region in the plane is&lt;br/&gt;geometrically convex if any line segment connecting two points&lt;br/&gt;in the region lies entirely within the region). The convexity&lt;br/&gt;properties of a complex space (for example, a covering space&lt;br/&gt;of a projective variety) are intimately connected with&lt;br/&gt;the space's holomorphic function theory and geometry.&lt;br/&gt;Holomorphic functions on complex spaces (for example, on regions&lt;br/&gt;in the complex number plane) are the natural analogues of&lt;br/&gt;differentiable functions on the real number line from differential&lt;br/&gt;calculus.  Thus the study of convexity properties is&lt;br/&gt;an essential element in the study of complex spaces.&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, notions of convexity (like those of symmetry) appear in&lt;br/&gt;almost every field of mathematics, science, and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;Hence the study of convexity properties of complex spaces&lt;br/&gt;provides further evidence of the importance of convexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
