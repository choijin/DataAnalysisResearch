Koppers, Scripps Institute, (EAR-0311889)&lt;br/&gt;R. Mark Leckie, University of Massachusetts, (EAR-0314113)&lt;br/&gt;James G. Ogg, Purdue University, (EAR-0313524)&lt;br/&gt;Bruce Wardlaw, U.S. Geological Survey, (EAR-0314415)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern Earth system history research depends increasingly upon the analysis of multidisciplinary, voluminous, time-calibrated data. The process of determining the availability or even the existence of Earth history data remains a time-consuming and error-prone enterprise because there are no centralized depositories or Web-enabled means for locating and retrieving data. The goal of CHRONOS is to unify current and future stratigraphic databases into a powerful system for producing a dynamic global time scale for Earth history and for understanding the complex relationships of past geologic, climatic and evolutionary trends. Web-services and an extensive on-line suite of toolboxes will allow global researchers and the general public to access, analyze and visualize chronostratigraphic information. Another goal is a vastly improved high-resolution geological time scale. A logical series of tasks is planned in order to accomplish these goals, with the ultimate goal being for all geoscientists to be able to apply the CHRONOS system of integrated databases for deciphering the complex interactions of the Earth system through all of geologic time. In addition to its primary goals of enabling networking of international databases and facilitating creative research, the CHRONOS outreach programs will promote education of Earth's fascinating history.</AbstractNarration>
