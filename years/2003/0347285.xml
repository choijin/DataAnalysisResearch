<AbstractNarration>CAREER: Distributed Coordination Strategies for Mobile Autonomous Agents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is aimed at developing tools for analysis and design of distributed algorithms for co-ordination&lt;br/&gt;of groups of mobile autonomous agents. Such coordination algorithms have appeared in&lt;br/&gt;various disciplines in different contexts, ranging from biological sciences (aggregation and social&lt;br/&gt;cohesion in animal species) to systems and control theory and collective robotics (cooperative con-trol&lt;br/&gt;of multi-vehicle systems), and from statistical physics (non-equilibrium phenomena in many&lt;br/&gt;degree-of-freedom dynamical systems) to computer graphics (artificial life, simulated flocking).&lt;br/&gt;We plan to develop a unified theory which provides a provably correct analysis and synthesis of&lt;br/&gt;distributed coordination and collective synchronization among a network of mobile agents with a&lt;br/&gt;changing topology. Several key problems are formulated and road-maps for obtaining efficient and&lt;br/&gt;scalable solutions to the problems are discussed. The proposed research plan utilizes tools from&lt;br/&gt;algebraic and spectral theory of graphs, control theory and theory of dynamical systems.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Distributed coordination problems such as collective synchronization and&lt;br/&gt;flocking are ubiquitous in complex biological, engineering, and physical systems. Such prob-lems&lt;br/&gt;arise in control theory, physics, biology, social sciences, power system networks and in time&lt;br/&gt;synchronization in sensor networks. The common feature of all of the above problems is that a set&lt;br/&gt;of (possibly mobile) agents are interconnected using simple nearest neighbor rules in a network&lt;br/&gt;with a topology that is time varying. We plan to develop a unified framework which allows us&lt;br/&gt;to study these problems and synthesize coordinated and cooperative systems of multiple agents.&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, this study will provide a justification for the so called emergence of collective behavior&lt;br/&gt;from simple local interactions, a phenomenon which has been observed across complex engineer-ing&lt;br/&gt;and natural systems.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed research will impact the study of complex engineering systems,&lt;br/&gt;ranging from operation and joint coordination of unmanned air, ground, and underwater vehicles&lt;br/&gt;as well as coordination of a network of unmanned robots to perform search and rescue operations.&lt;br/&gt;The research will also impact other emerging applications in homeland security, defense, trans-portation,&lt;br/&gt;wireless communication, and electric power networks, which require networks of agents&lt;br/&gt;to be capable of multi-user communication, collaborative information processing, and distributed&lt;br/&gt;computation, actuation, and control. The research plan is also accompanied by an active educa-tion&lt;br/&gt;plan consisting of undergraduate and graduate level course development, which will provide a&lt;br/&gt;framework for studying problems involving dynamic systems over networks. The plan is designed&lt;br/&gt;to involve undergraduate students in research and provide them with a well-defined plan of study&lt;br/&gt;to help motivate them to pursue an advanced degree. It would also bring research across several&lt;br/&gt;areas of science and systems theory together in a single unifying framework.</AbstractNarration>
