    <AbstractNarration>This planning project pulls together the educational and workforce development efforts of two-year colleges in Alabama to address the education of technical workers in the automobile manufacturing industry. Target audiences are industry and the faculty and students of the partner colleges and K-12. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major goals of the planning grant and accompanying objectives are: &lt;br/&gt;To design an infrastructure that will effectively coordinate the partnering institutions of the Consortium; &lt;br/&gt;To link Consortium institutions with industry partners to promote understanding and cooperation to meet both academic and industry standards; &lt;br/&gt;To develop alliances and establish the necessary communication flow between industry and education that will lead to the establishment of an ATE Regional Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The project enhances Alabama's efforts in workforce training and economic development by exploring the development of an automotive manufacturing technology curriculum, to include both certificate and degree programs. In a planned Regional Center, faculty, through their interaction with industry, would become more knowledgeable and technically skilled. Students would have opportunities for hands-on experience with industry and, therefore, improve their intellectual capacity, while also comprehending the intricacies of the automotive industry and its manufacturing processes. These consequences would occur as the result of a stronger technology core and improved SMET education being offered in the State's two-year colleges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The Consortium is developing and implementing activities that broadly impact the individual colleges, students and faculty, and the community as a whole. In a planned regional center, the level of automotive technical education would be raised to a level higher than that of the ordinary repair/mechanic programs. For students, the programs in the Center would motivate them to higher levels of achievement, making them more highly skilled, more highly paid, which in turn would provide a better standard and quality of life. The Center would also provide greater incentives for a larger number of minorities. The Center's programs would provide for improved teaching according to the latest industry standards and equipment, as well as personal contacts with industry representatives.</AbstractNarration>
