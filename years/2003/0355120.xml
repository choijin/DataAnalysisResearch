<AbstractNarration>Proposal DMS-0303326&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Kristopher Tapp (Bryn Mawr College)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Positive and nonnegative curvature on bundles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent research, the PI developed tools for studying the following two &lt;br/&gt;general problems in Riemannian geometry:  (1) For which vector bundles does &lt;br/&gt;the total space admit a complete Riemannian metric with nonnegative sectional &lt;br/&gt;curvature?  (2) For which sphere bundles does the total space admit a &lt;br/&gt;Riemannian metric with positive curvature?  The PI plans to use these tools &lt;br/&gt;to find new examples, obstructions, and rigidity theorems.  In particular, &lt;br/&gt;the PI plans to construct metrics of nonnegative curvature on holomorphic &lt;br/&gt;vector bundles over complex projective space, and determine whether Einstein-&lt;br/&gt;Hermitian connections can appear as the connections in the normal bundles of &lt;br/&gt;their souls.  Also, the PI intends to study nonnegatively curved metrics on &lt;br/&gt;trivial vector bundles over spheres.  This problem is related to the Hopf &lt;br/&gt;conjecture, or more specifically to the question: how large is the family of &lt;br/&gt;nonnegatively curved metrics on the product of two spheres?  The PI will work &lt;br/&gt;with undergraduate students studying the metrics on such products obtained by &lt;br/&gt;re-scaling the product metric by a compact Lie group which acts by &lt;br/&gt;isometries.  Finally, the PI proposes to find obstructions to metrics of &lt;br/&gt;nonnegative curvature on vector bundles over spheres with prescribed soul &lt;br/&gt;metrics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The question of which manifolds can have nonnegative curvature is central to &lt;br/&gt;Riemannian geometry.  Nonnegative curvature is a visually natural restriction &lt;br/&gt;on the way in which an object curves about in space.  All known examples come &lt;br/&gt;from compact Lie groups with bi-invariant metrics, which are indispensable &lt;br/&gt;tools in diverse fields of mathematics, physics, cosmology, and other &lt;br/&gt;disciplines in which simplification is achieved through symmetry.  The search &lt;br/&gt;for new examples of manifolds with nonnegative (or positive) curvature has a &lt;br/&gt;long history, yet very few constructions are known.  Since his tools &lt;br/&gt;represent a construction which is substantially different form known methods, &lt;br/&gt;the PI believes they deserve further study.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
