    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a new UV sparker remediation process that is low cost, has no envelope to clean, and offers the potential to eliminate the need for chemical additives. Most UV commercial water remediation processes utilize mercury lamps, which have safety concerns associated with mercury and are significant cost components, due both to their cost and to the need for periodic cleaning of the lamp envelope. Also, chemical additives such as peroxide are a significant cost and have safety concerns. The proposed sparker UV remediation system employs pulsed high power electric discharge in water that produces UV light and OH radicals in the water, which combine to provide enhanced remediation of organic contaminants. The research objective is to demonstrate the commercial viability of UV sparker water remediation through the optimization of a sparker with high UV efficiency and remediation testing of key organic contaminants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project will be in the treatment of municipal water streams and plant waste effluents to remove organic contaminants</AbstractNarration>
