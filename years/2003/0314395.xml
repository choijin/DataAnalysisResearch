<AbstractNarration>Reports on the state of freshwater reserves warn that severe local shortages&lt;br/&gt;are imminent, and predict that violent conflicts will emerge in water-scarce&lt;br/&gt;regions around the world. Water scarcity has been shown to cause civil&lt;br/&gt;conflict, particularly when accompanied by high population density, poverty,&lt;br/&gt;and income inequality. Urban migrant communities, where ethnic, religious,&lt;br/&gt;and class differences can exacerbate tensions, and community-wide patterns&lt;br/&gt;of adaptation to environmental scarcities are not well-formed, may be&lt;br/&gt;particularly vulnerable to water conflicts. To better understand how&lt;br/&gt;conflicts develop in water-scarce regions, a PhD student of cultural&lt;br/&gt;anthropology will sample 60 households in Villa Israel, a barrio of&lt;br/&gt;Cochabamba, Bolivia, where conflict over water is an established part of&lt;br/&gt;life. Every winter, seasonal water shortages threaten the lives of the&lt;br/&gt;people of Villa Israel, forcing them to make choices in how they use their&lt;br/&gt;economic and social resources. Using a combination of formal and informal&lt;br/&gt;interviews, participant observation, and archival research, the student will&lt;br/&gt;determine if and how cooperative economic and social ties break down during&lt;br/&gt;the dry season, facilitating the emergence of conflicts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader implications: In addition to contributing to the education of a&lt;br/&gt;doctoral student and a Bolivian undergraduate, the study has practical&lt;br/&gt;applications for those seeking to anticipate and manage coming conflicts&lt;br/&gt;over scarce freshwater. By determining when and how social ties become&lt;br/&gt;vulnerable during periods of severe water scarcity, the research will point&lt;br/&gt;policymakers and development planners to possible avenues for conflict&lt;br/&gt;prevention in marginal urban communities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
