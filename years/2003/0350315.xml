<AbstractNarration>This SLC Catalyst project has the long-range goal of determining how integrating the perspectives of diverse populations can improve technology design, training, and use to enhance learning. In preparation for a full proposal, the project will (1) conduct a meta-analysis of the existing learning technology literature from the perspective of learner diversity (gender, ethnicity/race, socioeconomic status, and disability); (2) convene a series of forums with small, diverse, interdisciplinary groups designed to challenge assumptions and identify key research strands; (3) produce three discussion documents that link the meta-analysis with an innovative research agenda for a science of learning center; and (4) identify final partnerships and prepare a 5-10 year strategic plan that will form the basis for the Science of Learning Center proposal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By defining an area of research that brings together learning theories with diversity and technology, this project will (1) lay the groundwork for understanding learning technologies within a social context, and (2) introduce diversity theories into learning theory.  It will define what this implies for the development of new technologies that support learning among a wide range of learners. The project will influence research in such areas as computer mediated communication, online learning, and learning technology development.  It will build strong partnerships with business, policymakers, and both formal and community-based education that will develop a national agenda for integrating diversity to improve technology-based learning, especially for currently underrepresented populations.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
