<AbstractNarration>The gigabytes to terabytes of data now being produced by scientific and medical &lt;br/&gt;applications on a routine basis create a pressing demand for capable visualization &lt;br/&gt;tools. One of the key problems hindering the development of such tools is the &lt;br/&gt;growing disparity between the available system bandwidth and the total need of &lt;br/&gt;data access during interactive rendering of these large data sets. Unfortunately, &lt;br/&gt;such scarcity of physical bandwidth persists in spite of repeated efforts to &lt;br/&gt;accelerate I/O subsystems. Complementary to those continued efforts in increasing &lt;br/&gt;I/O performance, this project focuses on intelligently decreasing the need of &lt;br/&gt;data access using a unique, coarse-grained method of visibility culling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visibility culling aims at eliminating unnecessary visualization computation by &lt;br/&gt;focusing on parts of the data that are visible from a specific view, culling &lt;br/&gt;occluded portions, which may be substantial, in the early stages of the &lt;br/&gt;visualization pipeline. Although visibility culling has previously been done as &lt;br/&gt;a by-product of the rendering process, it has yet to be explored as an independent &lt;br/&gt;technique for attacking the bandwidth bottleneck. For that purpose, the project we &lt;br/&gt;propose here will focus on the discovery and development of new visibility culling &lt;br/&gt;algorithms that are generic, scalable and efficient. Our key concept is to encode &lt;br/&gt;meta-opacity via precomputation. In any volume each voxel has a predetermined &lt;br/&gt;value of opacity. During rendering, a sequence of voxels is composited in depth &lt;br/&gt;order to form a view-dependent opacity value, called meta-opacity, for each ray &lt;br/&gt;segment. We hypothesize that there exists a way to conservatively and efficiently &lt;br/&gt;encode meta-opacity of a convex-shaped volume block for a range of views under a &lt;br/&gt;family of transfer functions via a one-time pre-computation. We call such encoding &lt;br/&gt;the Plenoptic Opacity Function (POF). Using POF for conservative run-time opacity &lt;br/&gt;estimation, great accelerations by visibility culling in volume rendering can be &lt;br/&gt;accomplished while the transfer function can be modified within the same family on &lt;br/&gt;the fly. Here we test this hypothesis and apply POF to volume rendering in &lt;br/&gt;large-scale parallelism, as well as out-of-core visualization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
