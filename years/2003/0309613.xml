<AbstractNarration>The focus of this research is to explore and systematically investigate 1,2-migratory insertion processes of organotransition metals, including palladium, zirconium, nickel and aluminum.  The central theme of the approach is the use of Pd and Zr as catalysts to produce alkyl aluminums.  The resulting alkyl aluminums are synthetically useful intermediates.  The focus of the educational effort will be the training of students in the necessary techniques for the generation and manipulation of air-sensitive materials.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this Renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Ei-ichi Negishi.  Professor Negishi will focus his work on the use of metals as catalysts and intermediates in order to produce new carbon-carbon bonds.  The new methods being developed will permit the conversion of inexpensive starting materials into valuable pharmaceutical intermediates in the laboratory, and are expected to have an impact on the way in which pharmaceutical companies manufacture drugs, and on the methods used by the chemical industry to produce a variety of important chemical compounds.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
