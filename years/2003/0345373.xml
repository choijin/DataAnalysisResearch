<AbstractNarration>0345373&lt;br/&gt;Bao&lt;br/&gt;A Special Symposium: Mechanics of Biological Materials is to be conducted in Washington, DC in conjunction with the November 16-21, 2003 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) International Mechanical Congress and Exposition. The goals of the symposium are (a) to  bring  together researchers in applied mechanics, bioengineering,  biophysics, biology, and biochemistry to facilitate interdisciplinary studies;  (b)  to  discuss  the  cutting-edge  research  in  this  field  and  to  identify  critical  issues  and  challenges  in  further  developing cellular and molecular biomechanics; (c) to encourage researchers in applied mechanics to enter the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in cell and molecular biology, biotechnology and biomechanics, have introduced the need  to  study  mechanics  as  related  to  cellular  functions  and  molecular mechanisms in biological tissues and materials. Mechanical forces and deformations play an important role in all these aspects, and in regulating cell behavior and function, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and death (apoptosis). Biomechanics should provide a useful tool for modeling and quantitative analyses of biological responses, especially force-bearing, force-generating, and force-sensing functions in cells. Results from the symposium will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of mechanochemical coupling and how mechanical forces regulate cell behavior and function by deforming nucleic acids and proteins, influencing the  transport  of  ions  and  other molecules, and altering receptor-ligand binding kinetic rates, and specificity.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium goals are to be attained in four technical sessions:  (1) Mechanics of proteins and nucleic acids, (2) BioMEMS and bionanotechnology, (3) Cellular and subcellular biomechanics, (4) Biosensors  and  biomaterial systems. Financial support is being provided for 4 speakers, unassociated with ASME, who are leading researchers in the sciences (biophysicists; biochemists (2); materials) that produce the basic knowledge necessary to reach the goals of the meeting.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cutting-edge research and critical issues to be discussed during the meeting constitute the intellectual merit of the project and the multidisciplinary composition of the speakers and attendees and wide distribution of the proceedings of the symposium assures a broad impact from the activity.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
