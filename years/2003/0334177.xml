<AbstractNarration>IP telephony  is a complex application involving multiple layers of the protocols stack and interactions among  multiple  network  devices.  The complexity  is  exacerbated  by  two  additional  factors  .  1)  the requirement that IP telephony interoperate with the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and 2) the requirement that IP telephony functions with existing network middle-boxes such as network address translators (NATs) and firewalls. These complexities introduce vulnerabilities that are prone to both known and perhaps, new forms of attacks. The goals of this proposed focused research are 1) to perform a comprehensive vulnerability analysis of IP telephony and 2) to design a security architecture to counter various types of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks in IP telephony.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will proceed as follows: first carry out a detailed vulnerability analysis of IP telephony using a property driven approach.  In this approach,  define a set of properties that an IP telephony application must satisfy for a specific type of deployment. Then the vulnerabilities will be then enumerated and classified as  potential  ways  to  violate  these  properties  using  a  corresponding  attack.    This vulnerability analysis will form the basis for designing the security architecture. In developing the security architecture, our focus will be in the design and analysis of sensors to detect and control DoS attacks.  While DoS  attacks  have  been  studied,  IP  telephony presents  significant  new  challenges.  Next will  be an investigation of  both  signature-based  and  statistical anomaly detection algorithms. The detection algorithms are complex because the attacks can occur at  multiple  layers  involving  multiple  network  devices  and  attack  both  the  control  and data  plane  of  the  protocol  architecture.  Finally, in a converged network,  an  attack  to  the  IP telephony  system can be made from both the Internet  as  well  as the PSTN.  Recovery algorithms that can quickly recover  once  the  attack  has  ceased will be designed.  The overall architecture will involve cross-layer introspection, i.e., the data from the various sensors at the different protocol layers and  at  the  different  network  elements  will  have  to  correlated  to determine the type of attack and hence the desired response.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
