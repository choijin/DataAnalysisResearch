    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and test the spatial models, algorithms, and software. They are needed to computationally match the real-time measurements of location and orientation with the best candidate object in a geospatial dataset. Integrating location-orientation information data with a digital landscape model and developing a plausible computational model that targets granularity is key to the success of the project. Unlike the current location-based services, which put digital maps on to GPS PDAs, this project will exploit the use of orientation sensors so that geospatial datasets are not only user centered but also egocentrically oriented. This aspect is germane to our product since no distinction could be made between such cogitative aspects as in front and behind an important outcome of the work will be a set of robust and fast algorithms that will form the core technology of an integrated hardware-software-data product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The benefits to society will be felt in several ways. The project will extend the capability of handheld devices and enable a better understanding of the environment through technology. Developing a spatial query device that is simple, easy to use and more intuitive increases accessibility for non-specialist users. The project will advance infrastructure for research and education through collaboration with the Spatial Information and Engineering (SIE) Department at the University of Maine and by being based at the Target Technology Center, an incubator for science and technical research in Orono, Maine. The project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting Teaching, Training and Learning through collaboration with the GK-12 Sensors Project; working with graduates to trial the sensor technology with high school students, and by developing materials for the GIS day at SIE. Participation of underrepresented groups will be addressed through strengthening information technology research in collaboration with the University of Maine, an EPSCoR institution.</AbstractNarration>
