<AbstractNarration>This award supports fundamental theoretical research and education that aims to elucidate two problems at the forefront of research in condensed matter theory: 1) the destruction of superconductivity in disordered than films, and 2.) the origins of pseudogaps arising from doped Mott insulators observed in strongly correlated materials like the high temperature superconductors.  The PI will continue to explore whether disorder can destroy the superconducting state leaving a glassy metallic state in thin films. The PI will use computational methods involving an extension of the dynamical mean field theory to investigate the origins of the pseudogap that occurs in doped Mott insulators. The PI also aims to develop a self-consistent method for calculating the spectral functions based on eigenoperators of finite-sized clusters. The charge transport process in dilute 2D electron gasses will be investigated. The PI will explore the nature of the state that occurs when a clean Wigner crystal melts and the effect of disorder. This work will involve, in part, the use of Monte Carlo simulation methods.&lt;br/&gt;This award also supports graduate education in theoretical solid state physics. In addition to training graduate students, the PI plans to work on a new edition of his graduate level textbook "Advanced Solid State Physics." The new edition will include new material on strongly correlated systems and incorporate forefront research into an educational text. The PI also plans to develop a new course on Quantum Phase Transitions.  The PI will continue to be involved in science outreach to middle school students and will expand this work to include local schools.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award supports fundamental theoretical research and education that seeks to advance our understanding of strongly interacting electrons. The PI aims to elucidate the nature of the states of matter that arise because of strong interactions among electrons and how these states emerge. These remain important problems at the forefront of solid state physics. This project focuses on developing theoretical tools to investigate key experimental systems in which large electron interactions play a dominant role in developing novel low-energy electronic states and experimental systems near quantum critical points. The presence of disorder leads to the possibility of new phases, such as glasses. A focus of this work is on understanding how metallic phases evolve in electrons restricted to two dimensions, as occurs in high temperature superconductors among other materials.&lt;br/&gt;This award also supports graduate education in theoretical solid state physics. In addition to training graduate students, the PI plans to work on a new edition of his graduate level textbook "Advanced Solid State Physics." The new edition will include new material on strongly correlated systems and incorporate forefront research into an educational text. The PI also plans to develop a new course on Quantum Phase Transitions.
