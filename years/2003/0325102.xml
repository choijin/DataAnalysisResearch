<AbstractNarration>Recent  oceanic  observations  (e.g.,  Faroe  passage  and  Denmark  Strait)  show  time-dependent  and steady  components  of  the  strait  flows,  and  aspects  of  the  downstream  mixing.  However,  much  less  is know about the structure of the currents which feed the straits and how the strait flow is coupled to the upstream  basin  circulation.  Second,  recent  theoretical  and  numerical  work  suggests  a  novel  coupling mechanism, but there are no observational data and few laboratory experimental data with which to test and  generalize  these  new  ideas.  The  proposed  comparisons  between  theory  and  laboratory experiments can  be  used  to  suggest  future  oceanic  observations  and  possible  overflow  monitoring  strategies.  The intent  is  to  provide  as  much  information  as  possible  to  guide  future  ocean  cruises,  general  circulation theory, and numerical climate modeling projects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory experiments will be developed and conducted to investigate the coupling of circulation in a finite, rotating basin with the hydraulically controlled flow over a sill. This situation usually applies to layers of deep water passing from one deep ocean basin, which is filled by this water, to another basin through a col, or the deepest saddle point passage. In the downstream basin the water is typically less dense.  The goal is to obtain quantitative measurements with which to examine the basin  circulation,  including  any  feeder  currents,  the  potential  vorticity  dynamics  of  the  coupled  basin-strait system, and the hydraulic flow in the strait. A recent numerical study showed a novel, and as yet unexplained, potential vorticity control exerted by the strait on the basin. Exploration of this mechanism will  be  the  starting  point  for  this  research.  The  proposed  experiments  will  be  conducted  on  the WHOI GFD Laboratory one- and two-meter turntables with tanks containing an upstream basin and a passage to a small catch basin. The work will first explore flows of water under air to permit investigation of flows with relatively small viscous effects in both the upstream basin and strait. It is also planed to pump salty water under a deep layer of fresher water (reduced-gravity configuration), where both increased rotational effects and the role of increased frictional effects in the upstream basin can be explored. Experiments with two  active  layers may be examined  at  later  stages  of  the  work. Various upstream geometric  conditions will  be  investigated  (e.g.,  flat  and  bowl-shaped  basins)  and  the  role  of  different  mass  source characteristics  (e.g.,  boundary  inflow  and interior downwelling).  In all cases layer depths and velocity distributions (with particle imaging techniques) will be measured within both the basin and passage for a wide range of relevant parameters. The experimental work will be parallel to, and compared with, similar theoretical and numerical work already underway at WHOI.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader  Impacts:  Deep  passages  offer  ideal  points  to  monitor  the  overturning  circulation. However, this can only be done properly if the dynamical connections between strait and basin flows are understood.  This  work  will  begin  to  answer  some  of  these  questions  and  should  be  of  wide  interest beyond the specific dynamics explored here.  The PIs are both active in the MIT/WHOI Joint Program and the results of this research will quickly reach the classroom. The grant will also support a graduate student and so further contribute to broader educational goals. Lastly, the grant will generally support the WHOI Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, one of few facilities of its type in the world. The WHOI GFD Lab has a long history of helping scientists and students from WHOI and around the world conduct experimental work on a broad range of fluid dynamics problems.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
