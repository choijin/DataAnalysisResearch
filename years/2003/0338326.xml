    <AbstractNarration>This Track 2, GK-12 project builds upon existing relationships and infrastructure developed in the previous GK-12 project with two school districts serving diverse students traditionally underrepresented in engineering and the College of Engineering and Applied Science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impact of the project is very high. Fellows, in partnership with cooperating teachers, are improving STEM literacy in high-needs schools through a grades 3-12 pre-engineering program and are learning to be effective service learning mentors for undergraduate students engaged in K-12 classrooms. Students are from seven high needs, suburban and urban schools, with large minority enrollments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the Intellectual Merit of the proposal is that the Fellows will use engineering as a vehicle to integrate math and science learning by K-12 students in the seven participating schools. The Fellows will become "engineering ambassadors," who deliver a hands-on engineering curriculum that addresses state educational STEM standards and serve as role models for grades 3-12 students to link the study of math and science to future careers in engineering and technology. This project is receiving partial support from the Directorate for Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Track 2, GK-12: Inspiring and Building Tomorrow's Workforce: A Grades 3-12 Engineering Continuum&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Colorado at Boulder&lt;br/&gt;PI/Co-PI: Jacquelyn Sullivan, Lawrence Carlson and Malinda Schaefer&lt;br/&gt;Partner School Districts: Boulder Valley School District (BVSD), Denver Public Schools (DPS)&lt;br/&gt;Number of Fellows per Year: 8 graduate students, 2-6 undergraduate engineering students&lt;br/&gt;Target Audience: Grades 3-12&lt;br/&gt;Setting: Suburban and Urban&lt;br/&gt;NSF Supported Disciplines: Earth, life, general and physical sciences; engineering; mathematics</AbstractNarration>
