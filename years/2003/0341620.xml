<AbstractNarration>0341620&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Model-Based Monitoring of Air-Traffic Control Software&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Martin Rinard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on developing a new, model-based monitoring&lt;br/&gt;technique that will dynamically examine the data structures and&lt;br/&gt;variable values in the executing computation to find and flag any&lt;br/&gt;inconsistencies. During development, this technique will flag&lt;br/&gt;inconsistencies as soon as they arise, helping the developer to&lt;br/&gt;localize the error by eliminating the continued execution (and the&lt;br/&gt;associated inconsistency propagation) that obscures the source of the&lt;br/&gt;error. After deployment, the technique will alert users to&lt;br/&gt;inconsistencies as soon as they arise, eliminating the problem of&lt;br/&gt;incorrect actions taken because of reliance on incorrect output from a&lt;br/&gt;program operating with inconsistent values or data structures. Key&lt;br/&gt;research issues include the design and efficient implementation of the&lt;br/&gt;specification and model construction languages and the evaluation of&lt;br/&gt;how well this approach works for two purposes: 1) in the context of an&lt;br/&gt;existing system, to check key data structure consistency properties,&lt;br/&gt;to promote design extraction, and to ensure that the design remains up&lt;br/&gt;to date as the software is maintained, and 2) in the context of new&lt;br/&gt;development, to promote design development, support error&lt;br/&gt;localization, and facilitate debugging.  The potential benefits of&lt;br/&gt;this research include reduced software development effort, more reliable&lt;br/&gt;software, and safer software. The research will be performed using&lt;br/&gt;the CTAS software system in the NASA testbed and the TSAFE software&lt;br/&gt;system currently under design at NASA.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
