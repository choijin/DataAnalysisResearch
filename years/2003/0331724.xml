<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;PI: Sean F. Ellermeyer, Kennesaw State University&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0331724&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding for approximately 30 new researchers (advanced graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients) to participate in the Twenty-Third Southeast-Atlantic Regional Conference on Differential Equations. This conference, which has been held yearly since 1981 at various institutions throughout the Southeast-Atlantic region, is being held this year at Kennesaw State University on October 17-18, 2003. The conference will feature four internationally recognized plenary speakers as well as several sessions of contributed talks to be delivered by both new and established researchers in differential equations. Specific topics to be addressed at the conference include ordinary and partial differential equations, integral and functional equations, dynamical systems, control and inverse problems, numerical methods, and applications of differential equations in science and engineering. This conference will provide the opportunity for the personal interaction among researchers that is necessary both for the ongoing maintenance of established research collaborations in differential equations and for the expansion of these collaborations to include new researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
