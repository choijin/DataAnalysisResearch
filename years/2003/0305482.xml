<AbstractNarration>This award supports theoretical research directed at advancing our understanding of both the interplay between interaction and disorder effects, and out-of-equilibrium phenomena in condensed matter systems.  The research will investigate the combined effects of interaction and disorder in two-dimensional electronic systems, and the consequences of this combination on spin polarization effects in Si-MOSFET's; the possible metallic and glassy phases in thin films where a superconductor-insulator transition is observed; and thermal transport of interacting quasiparticles inside gapless superconductors.  The work will address non-equilibrium phenomena, such as spatial heterogeneities and mesoscopic fluctuations in the aging dynamics of glassy systems, and slow relaxation in electronic glasses, such as that recently observed in CdSe artificial solids.  Finally, the research will address non-equilibrium transport, detection, and dissipation of spin currents through quantum wires and dots.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will have a broad impact.  While studying phenomena in specific material systems, new theoretical and computational methods will be developed for addressing fundamental problems of out-of-equilibrium phenomena and of combined interaction and disorder effects in condensed matter systems.  It will also provide the opportunity for solid education and training of graduate students in these areas.  Outreach activities will include continued participation in local high school science fairs.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research directed at advancing our understanding of both the interplay between interaction and disorder effects, and out-of-equilibrium phenomena in condensed matter systems.
