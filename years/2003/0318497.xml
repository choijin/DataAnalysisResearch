<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to provide a political analysis of the legal pluralism in the context of state-society relations and human rights through the lenses of religious personal status laws (i.e. marriage, divorce, inheritance, succession etc.) in Israel, Egypt and India. The study explains why nation-states recognize and incorporate non-state normative orders (customary and religious personal laws) into their unified body of law. In addition, the researchers assess the implications of this incorporation upon the capacities of central state administrations and individual freedoms and rights of citizens in post-colonial societies.  As opposed to many, who assert that polycentric legal orders in the field of personal status laws are due to the colonial legacies of European empires, the researchers hypothesize that most post-colonial nation-states make their decisions whether to recognize and incorporate non-state normative orders based on rational cost-benefit calculations.  The project has far-reaching theoretical and practical implications on the field of law and society. It primarily serves the aim of furthering our understanding of legal pluralism and contributes to the literature by providing ontological and epistemological innovations, such as introducing an alternative new institutionalist approach to the existing colonial legacy theories and suggesting a new terminology and nomenclature.  Since it is a doctoral dissertation, the project blends the scientific endeavor and higher goals of education in its nature with a multidisciplinary approach derived from political science, law, anthropology and sociology.  The main contention of the work is that legal pluralism in the field of religious personal status laws infringe upon the rights of women, political dissidents and seculars. Hence, by the dissemination of research findings, the study contributes to a better understanding of freedom of conscience and religion, and emancipation of women, and under-represented groups from patriarchal and religious oppression in Israel, India and Egypt.</AbstractNarration>
