    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will determine the feasibility of a polycapillary optics-based micro-x-ray absorption spectrometer (XAS) system with a low-power microfocus x-ray source by building a laboratory prototype. The system overcomes limitations of current state-of-the-art systems in that (a) the x-ray source and sample are stationary; (b) a low power x-ray source will be implemented; (c) both XANES and EXAFS analysis are possible using the same instrument; (d) small spot microanalysis with a 15 micrometer x-ray beam is possible with advances in poly-capillary x-ray optics; and (e) the probing energy may be varied by simply choosing the appropriate off-the-shelf mono-chromator. Custom poly-capillary optics will be developed, a new x-ray source characterized, and a laboratory system will be built and the performance of the system will be analyzed to determine spot size, energy resolution, intensity, detection limits, and ease of use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A successful micro-XAS system would be used to determine chemical state information of materials as a tool in manufacturing process control systems, or as for routine screening of field samples. It overcomes the shortcomings of synchrotron based micro-XAS systems (size, availability, cost, maintenance, etc.) and makes it possible to perform chemical state analysis for monitoring manufacturing processes and routine evaluation of field samples.</AbstractNarration>
