<AbstractNarration>Through an established partnership between the Connecticut (CT) Academy for Education in Mathematics, Science, and Technology, and Danbury Public Schools and Stamford Public Schools, CT intends to directly impact 4,020 students and 205 teachers to improve the teaching and learning of science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goals: &lt;br/&gt;CONNtinue will expand the capacity of two Connecticut urban public school districts to: &lt;br/&gt; Make regular use of student achievement information to improve standards-based curricula materials, instructional strategies, and professional development activities; and &lt;br/&gt; Continuously improve classroom teachers' content knowledge and instructional skills to maximize each student's mathematics and science achievement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt; Aiming to bring about change by impacting schools as the unit of change, CT intends to involve classroom teachers, institution of higher education faculty, and educational administrators in improving science and mathematics for all students.  Leading research studies and reports on educational policy and practice will guide activities and events planned by CT to assist the districts.  &lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact:&lt;br/&gt; The scope of work engages school district leaders, school principals, and teams of teachers in the use of student performance data, is driven by measurable goals, and is executed with standards-based guides, strategies, and program evaluation.  CT will work to provide a student achievement model that can be replicated aimed at producing system-wide improvements in other urban school districts throughout CT and beyond.  The project's process and results will be disseminated through state conferences, a project website, and other websites within the public domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
