<AbstractNarration>Media handling systems such as copier and printing machines are optimized for a narrow range of sheet properties. As a result, they often perform poorly when using media with non-standard characteristics, such as recycled paper.  This is due to the fact that copier machines are predominantly controlled in an open loop fashion.  Recent research activities by the PI and his collaborators have addressed the aforementioned robustness problems. However, the results obtained only pertain to media control in the longitudinal direction and most modern media and packaging handling systems also require precise lateral and skew control of the media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this GOALI project are: 1) To formulate and implement a mechatronics solution for media handling systems that will allow accurate steering of the media along three in-plane degrees of freedom, while maintaining high throughput and robust performance to a wide variety of media characteristics. 2) To formulate and implement new extended hybrid control architecture, for media handling systems that can effectively control switching media dynamics with coupled degrees of freedom and nonholonomic dynamics. 3) To develop a new optimal mechatronic design methodology for media handling systems and other distributed mechatronic systems. 4) To develop a fully functional rapid-prototyping research and instructional platform, which will be re-configurable and capable of testing in real-time a variety of control methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of this project will introduce and demonstrate new mechatronics approaches for solving fundamental problems in the control and design of media handling devices, which are currently of critical importance to the American copier and printing industries, and are common to a large class of assembly, manufacturing, robotics and transportation systems. The new developments in this project will be carried out in close collaboration with the Xerox Corporation, the industrial partner in this GOALI project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
