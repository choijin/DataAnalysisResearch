    <AbstractNarration>0330588&lt;br/&gt;Emmermann&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On February 26, 1996, the National Science Foundation and the GeoForschungsZentrum-Potsdam (GFZ) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on "Implementation , Management and Operation of the ICDP". This MOU is an Annex to the Agreement between the NSF and the Federal Ministry for Education, Science, Research and Technology of the Federal Republic of Germany (BMBF) on "Cooperation in Research in the Geosciences". The original MOU was in force for five years and was renewed for an additional five years (until August 31, 2007) in September, 2002 (see enclosed extension 0330588).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the MOU is to specify the terms by which the NSF and GFZ shall cooperate in the scientific planning, management and operation of an earth science research program of scientific drilling on the continents. One of the terms specifies the funding arrangements agreed to by the parties. In particular, article 5 (1) states that: "Each party agrees to provide funding for the overall scientific planning, management, operation and management of the ICDP in the amount of $700,000 per annum, subject to the availability of funds. The annual membership fee shall be paid to the Executive Agency for transfer to the Operational Support Group (OSG) and will be commingled to provide the base funding for the ICDP. The annual contribution of $700,000 shall be paid in US dollars for five years duration of the MOU." The National Science Board in its May, 1996 meeting approved the ICDP (see copies of NSB Memorandum (NSB-96-68) and Minutes of the 336th Meeting (NSB-96-87)). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides the funds for the US membership fee to ICDP for the period 2003 -2007.</AbstractNarration>
