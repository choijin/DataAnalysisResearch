<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DMS 0307166- H Bercovici (Indiana Univ)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposer plans to study free harmonic analysis in the sense of determining regularity properties of free convolutions; free convolutions of measures &lt;br/&gt;seem to exhibit greater regularity than their classical counterparts.  He also plans to investigate limit distributions of free processes, particularly &lt;br/&gt;those arising in the mutliplicative theory.  The proposer also will look at &lt;br/&gt;related problems in operator theory, particularly at the behavior of &lt;br/&gt;eigenvalues of sums of selfadjoint elements of a von Neumann algebra, and the &lt;br/&gt;relationship of these questions with Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.  &lt;br/&gt;Other problems in operator theory will include the classification of families &lt;br/&gt;of isometries on a Hilbert space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research in this proposal is aimed first of all at increasing the &lt;br/&gt;understanding of questions arising in current work in the fields of operator &lt;br/&gt;algebras and operator theory.  The proposer has in the past investigated connections between operators and control theory, and the results in his &lt;br/&gt;proposed work may again have connections with more applied areas.  &lt;br/&gt;In particular, some of the proposed interpolation problems arose from &lt;br/&gt;questions in control theory, and free probability theory does have &lt;br/&gt;connections with physics.  The proposer will involve graduate students in his &lt;br/&gt;work, thus continuing to contribute to the training of a new generation of &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians.  He will also participate in the training of postdoctoral &lt;br/&gt;associates, thus contributing to a successful VIGRE program at Indiana &lt;br/&gt;University.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
