<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Speh/Barbasch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is concerned with the study of automorphic forms,&lt;br/&gt;representations of reductive groups and their applications. &lt;br/&gt;Dan Barbasch, together with various coworkers, is proposing to&lt;br/&gt;continue investigations of the unitary dual of real and p-adic&lt;br/&gt;groups. In particular he will study necessary conditions for&lt;br/&gt;unitarity. He will also continue the study of unipotent&lt;br/&gt;representations, in particular their associated cycles. Joint with &lt;br/&gt;various coworkers he will study occurences of representations in the&lt;br/&gt;dual reductive pairs correspondence, and for p-adic groups he will&lt;br/&gt;study the Bernstein center. Birgit Speh, together with&lt;br/&gt;various coworkers, will continue the study of cohomology of locally symmetric&lt;br/&gt;spaces. In particular she will study representation theoretic&lt;br/&gt;descriptions of modular symbols. She will also work on proving &lt;br/&gt;uniform convergence of terms in the Arthur-Selberg trace formula. &lt;br/&gt;It is expected that the results of this proposal &lt;br/&gt;will contribute significantly to the understanding of the geometry and &lt;br/&gt;topology of locally symmetric spaces. Graduate and undergraduate students &lt;br/&gt;as well as postdoctoral faculty are expected to be involved in studying &lt;br/&gt;problems generated by this research.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Many problems in number theory and mathematical physics are concerned&lt;br/&gt;with functions that are solutions to differential equations which have&lt;br/&gt;certain symmetry properties. These properties are expressed in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics as saying that the solutions form a unitary representation&lt;br/&gt;of a reductive group. A major part of this proposal is concerned with the&lt;br/&gt;determination of the building blocks which are called&lt;br/&gt;unitary irreducible representations. The aforementioned functions&lt;br/&gt;relevant to number theory are called automorphic functions and have&lt;br/&gt;expansions in terms of  unitary irreducible representations. These&lt;br/&gt;expansions can be thought of as generalizations of classical Fourier&lt;br/&gt;series.  The problem of convergence of these expansions is important&lt;br/&gt;for applications to number theory, and forms an important  component&lt;br/&gt;of this proposal. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
