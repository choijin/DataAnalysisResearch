    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I research proposal will demonstrate a novel, inexpensive, nano-crystalline based metal oxide semiconductor sensor array that will provide a new technology platform for the real-time early detection of the presence of molds found in commercial office buildings, schools, hospitals and homes, before their presence can cause problems. The aim is to develop a new low-cost detector for mold that operates in real-time with exceptionally high sensitivity and selectivity to discriminate the marker Microbial Volatile Organic Compounds (MVOCs) specific to harmful strains of mold. This novel approach uses a highly active nano-crystalline metal oxide semiconductor material to achieve the necessary sensitivity and to establish high selectivity to MVOCs through the use of temperature of operation, introduction of catalysts and dopants into the semiconductor oxide film, and by control of the material's morphology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MVOCs are associated with mold growth in problem building environments. The proposed research will lead to the development of an inexpensive sensor array that is capable of real-time detection of the presence of mold. This unique detector would be a new and innovative product for the Heating Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) industry and for building control manufacturers.</AbstractNarration>
