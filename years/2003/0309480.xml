<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0309480&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Kiyoshi Igusa&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator proposes to develop and use his three&lt;br/&gt;new formulas for the Miller-Morita-Mumford classes on the&lt;br/&gt;cohomology of the mapping class group to investigate some of the&lt;br/&gt;main problems in geometric topology, in particular the question&lt;br/&gt;of whether these invariants are nontrivial on the Torelli&lt;br/&gt;group. Igusa also plans to integrate the basic ideas into the&lt;br/&gt;first year graduate topology course at Brandeis. The fundamental&lt;br/&gt;concept being used is that of an A-infinity functor. Since&lt;br/&gt;ordinary homology and cohomology have intrinsic A-infinity&lt;br/&gt;structures and since A-infinity functors give an alternative&lt;br/&gt;approach to spectral sequences, it would be both feasible and&lt;br/&gt;appropriate to introduce this concept at an early stage and to&lt;br/&gt;engage beginning graduate students and gifted undergraduates into&lt;br/&gt;research related topics at an early stage. The lecture notes&lt;br/&gt;would be made available online and expository papers would also&lt;br/&gt;be posted on preprint servers to explain and disseminate the&lt;br/&gt;current uses of this old concept.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is about graphs and surfaces. The study of the space&lt;br/&gt;of all graphs and the space of surfaces is an active area of&lt;br/&gt;research in Topology and Algebraic Geometry which has captured the&lt;br/&gt;attention of mathematicians and theoretical physicists in recent&lt;br/&gt;years because of the work of Ed Witten and Maxim Kontsevich both&lt;br/&gt;of whom received Fields Medals for their influential work. Igusa&lt;br/&gt;brings an innovative approach to this field by apply new methods&lt;br/&gt;in high dimensional Algebraic Topology to the study of these one&lt;br/&gt;and two dimensional objects. Igusa's methods have already solved&lt;br/&gt;several previously unanswered questions, both theoretical and&lt;br/&gt;computational. In this project Igusa plans to tackle some of the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental theoretical problems in this field which his&lt;br/&gt;preliminary research has found to be amenable to his methods. He&lt;br/&gt;also proposed to educate the Mathematical public to demonstrate&lt;br/&gt;the accessibility of these exotic methods. The impact of this&lt;br/&gt;research will be to accelerate the expansion of this important&lt;br/&gt;area of research and to make basic Topology more exciting to the&lt;br/&gt;students who study it by incorporating topics of current research.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
