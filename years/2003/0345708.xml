<AbstractNarration>An EarthScope workshop in the northern Rocky Mountains (NRM) will provide an opportunity&lt;br/&gt;for a diverse array of earth scientists to meet and discuss the opportunities that&lt;br/&gt;EarthScope will provide to improve our understanding of the wide range of processes that&lt;br/&gt;formed this segment of continental crust. The NRM (generally defined as northern Wyoming,&lt;br/&gt;SW Montana, and eastern Idaho) is a unique environment that provides an excellent natural&lt;br/&gt;laboratory for studying many critical phenomena associated with the evolution of the&lt;br/&gt;continental crust-mantle system. We propose to hold a 2.5-day workshop in the early fall of 2005 in SW Montana. The meeting will begin with a general session to inform participants of the current status of EarthScope and provide overviews of the overarching scientific questions related to the&lt;br/&gt;geology of the NRM. An organizing committee will be charged to set the meeting agenda and&lt;br/&gt;participate in selection of speakers and participants. The workshop will provide the&lt;br/&gt;opportunity for smaller working groups to meet and identify scientific objectives and&lt;br/&gt;assess how EarthScope can help address these objectives. Possible working group topics and&lt;br/&gt;lists of individuals who have expressed an interest in attending is provided. A concluding&lt;br/&gt;session will focus on presentations from the individual working groups. Appropriate and timely announcements will allow ample opportunity for all interested parties to apply to attend. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the workshop will be realized through comprehensive web development&lt;br/&gt;that will support workshop logistics, pre- and post-workshop activities, posting of all&lt;br/&gt;workshop products (e.g. talks, posters, discussion summaries, essays, plans), and will&lt;br/&gt;begin to compile a region-wide digital resource collection. The workshop program will also&lt;br/&gt;address the EarthScope Education and Outreach (E&amp;O) objectives by establishing an E&amp;O&lt;br/&gt;working group in parallel with the research-oriented working groups. The workshop will&lt;br/&gt;also serve to identify and recruit colleagues who are interested in contributing to&lt;br/&gt;EarthScope E&amp;O in the NRM.</AbstractNarration>
