<AbstractNarration>AST-0307508&lt;br/&gt;Schombert&lt;br/&gt;This project is a narrow band, continuum color survey of the red and blue populations in distant clusters of galaxies, using a specially designed filter system to resolve age and metallicity effects and distinguish the mean star formation rates in the cluster blue population.  This enables a two-pronged attack on the question of the color evolution of cluster galaxies.  Following the passive evolution of the red population allows an estimate of the time of galaxy assembly, while isolating two blue components, by segregating a starburst contribution, will resolve their epoch of formation.  Combined with existing emission line, kinematic, and morphological work, this research will provide a complete picture of galaxy evolution in clusters for the past eight billion years.  Observational cosmology is a popular subfield of study at the undergraduate level, as well as providing a philosophical framework for society as a whole, and this work will contribute to its understanding.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
