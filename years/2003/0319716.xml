<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support Dr. Monica Smith will conduct two seasons of archaeological fieldwork at the site of Sisupalgarh, located in the state of Orissa, India. Occupied during the early historic period, this city covers 130 hectares and is enclosed by a large brick and mud rampart with eight gateways. Buildings were constructed in both stone as well as brick and monolithic pillars testify to the monumental architecture present. Prior work has indicated a rich and varied artifact repertoire including metal objects (nails, rings, projectile points, sickles) ornaments, coins, beads of ivory and stone as well as abundant ceramics. Four distinct periods spanning the 300 BC to 350 AD period of occupation have been identified. With NSF  support Dr. Smith and her colleagues will conduct a systematic archaeological surface survey of the site to provide data on economic, social and political activities. A detailed topographic map will be prepared and a grid of 50 x 50 meter squares established. This will provide the base for a systematic non-aligned random collection. The data gathered through the two-year field season will be analyzed using GIS to examine how different production and consumption indicators are spatially distributed. On this basis it will be possible to determine the range of activities, commercial and domestic, and how these were integrated into broader economic, social and political systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to evaluate the economic and social configuration of a city under conditions of increasing sociopolitical complexity. Unlike regions of the world in which the emergence of cities is closely linked to broader state level political organization, the Indian subcontinent presents an archaeological record of cities without states. Sisupalgarh and other Indian cities thrived in a period in which political organization was relatively weak and urban zones appear to have been the largest consistent unit of territorial integration in which political leaders invested any surplus in highly visible landscape modifications such as fortifications and monumental architecture.  This project will provide insight into how these unusual entities functioned and how they developed and changed over time. The project is also important because it will assist the career development of a promising young scientist.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
