<AbstractNarration>The investigators propose to organize the next International Conference on "Spectral And High-Order Methods (ICOSAHOM'04)" on June 21-25 2004 at Brown University. The algorithmic themes addressed in this conference are many and new, and attract most leading researchers in spectral methods, h-p finite elements, ENO schemes, high-order finite differences, and wavelets. There are nine confirmed keynote speakers (selected by voting by the scientific committee), four of whom are from USA, and two are women. The topics they will cover are: wavelets, h-p finite elements, singular solutions, electromagnetics, non-Newtonian flows, inverse problems, uncertainty, ocean modeling, fast solvers, and high-order finite differences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spectral and high-order methods have become increasingly important in diverse and important applications as aeroacoustics, electromagnetics and optics, ocean and climate modeling. These methods continue to grow in importance as a simulation tool and attract global attention. The proposed conference, part of a long series, continues to be the main meeting where such methods are discussed and new and exciting applications displayed. Furthermore, emphasis is traditionally placed on involving many young researchers as well as underrepresented minorities and women. As a new thing, the conference will conclude with a round-table discussion consisting of a mix of invited speakers, minisymposia organizers, and researchers from national labs and industry. The objective is to discuss and report to NSF the open issues and future algorithmic and application trends of high-order and other discretization methods and their potential in applications of national interest.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
