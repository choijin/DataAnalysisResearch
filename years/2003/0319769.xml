    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will determine the feasibility of a hybrid reflector/polycapillary collimating optic to produce an intense and uniform x-ray beam at least 50x50 mm2 in cross a sectional area from a high-intensity laser plasma x-ray source. An all polycapillary collimator has been shown to be able to produce an intense, uniform beam up to 30x30 mm2 field size but is impractical for larger beams. Proximity x-ray lithography (PRXL) is a strong candidate for the next generation lithography (NGL) systems needed for continued progress on the semiconductor device roadmap for sub 100 nm feature sizes necessary for ultra high-density, high-speed (&gt;100 GHz) applications. To overcome the physical constraints of a polycapillary collimating optic for large field sizes, a novel hybrid collimator is proposed in which a single bounce reflective (SR) optic serves as a virtual source for a follow-on polycapillary optic thereby increasing its effective capture angle while retaining its proven high gain and beam quality. The critical physical and design parameters for such a hybrid will be examined through measurements and modeling in Phase I.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Development of a high-gain, high-field size hybrid collimator optic to enable a compact PXRL collimated plasma lithography (CPL) system capable of meeting the throughput and resolution requirements for next generation (NG) 300 mm wafer Si-based microelectronics production could have far-reaching and even nationally important consequences. It would provide an attractive, lower cost alternative to advanced and as yet unproven extreme ultra-violet (EUV) and electron projection lithography (EPL) systems. Such a system would take advantage of more than ten years of experience and hundreds of high-density, high-speed circuits that have been made using expensive synchrotron research facilities and would give the US a possible counter to SR based PXRL commercial developments in Japan. In the short term, such CPL systems could seamlessly fit into existing fabrication lines and provide medium throughput sub 100 nm production facilities for specialized ultra high-speed, or high density applications which include a broad range of sophisticated, high-performance commercial and military communications products and systems.</AbstractNarration>
