    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)Phase I project will develop manufacturing, packaging and interface concepts for critical Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) components. The intention is to be able to cheaply manufacture robust actuator/sensors wafers, and isolate them from harsh operating environments including natural, mechanical, or electrical extremes. Currently the issues related to SHM system durability have remained unaddressed. In this project, microfabrication techniques will be developed to fabricate, assemble, wire and package the SHM system components for robust operation. In particular, in Phase I of this project, the piezoelectric actuators and sensor used for damage detection will be packaged, and then tested in hot and wet conditions. Research continued through a Phase II program would aim to package the other supporting components such as the battery and wireless chip, as well as integrating all of these components together for operation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially, SHM technologies have the potential for many economic benefits in a broad range of commercial and defense markets. These systems can be utilized by structures from military or civil aircraft, to cars, ships or spacecraft. The first major benefit is that health monitoring eliminates the need for scheduled inspections. A second major economic benefit is that a continuously monitoring system would allow for the use of the much more efficient condition based maintenance (CBM) design methodology of a structure, otherwise known as need-based repair. A third benefit would be from increased service time of the structure.</AbstractNarration>
