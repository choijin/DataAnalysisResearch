<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This International Workshop on "Historical preservation of structures with FRP composites" to be held in Lecce, Italy, on June 10-11, 2004, following the First International Conference on Innovative Materials and Technology for Construction and Restoration (IMTCR-04).&lt;br/&gt;In the last two decades, advanced composites (fiber-reinforced polymer or FRP) have gained&lt;br/&gt;considerable worldwide interest and growing acceptance in the construction industry. The&lt;br/&gt;historical preservation of structures is one of the most appealing applications of FRP&lt;br/&gt;composites in the construction field. However, this application presents some critical&lt;br/&gt;issues still not sufficiently investigated: long-term durability of FRP-repaired&lt;br/&gt;structures; compatibility of the FRP system with the parent material; minimal invasiveness&lt;br/&gt;and reversibility of the upgrade; optimal material selection.&lt;br/&gt;All the aforementioned issues, of paramount importance for intervention on structures of&lt;br/&gt;architectural/historical interest, are also relevant when dealing with any other category&lt;br/&gt;of structure, when looking at long-term performance and global cost-benefit balance. Each&lt;br/&gt;of these issues requires an interdisciplinary effort between researchers with&lt;br/&gt;material-oriented and structural-oriented backgrounds and experts of architectural&lt;br/&gt;restoration.  The primary objectives of the workshop are to review the advances in research on the topic&lt;br/&gt;of the workshop; provide to researchers with material-oriented and structural-oriented&lt;br/&gt;backgrounds and to experts of architectural restoration the opportunity to interact and&lt;br/&gt;develop a cooperation network; identify the gaps of knowledge on the sub-topics of the&lt;br/&gt;workshop (long-term durability, compatibility, minimal invasiveness and reversibility, and&lt;br/&gt;optimal material selection); identify major barriers to the effective utilization of&lt;br/&gt;advanced composites for historical preservation; renew the human network of experts in the&lt;br/&gt;field and integrate new entrants; prioritize and document the needs for effective research&lt;br/&gt;policies and programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
