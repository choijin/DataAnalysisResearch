<AbstractNarration>Stochastic structural dynamics (SSD) is a broad technical field, and is concerned with random variabilities of structural behaviors under dynamic loads.  The random variabilities may be caused by the uncertainties in loads, material properties, construction processes, and others.  The most well known random loads include earthquake, winds, ocean waves, as well as man-produced forces, vehicles and machines.  Randomness in material properties is inherent in the distributions of grain sizes and orientations at the micro- or even nano-scales.  The imprecisions in construction or manufacturing processes are unavoidable.  All these uncertainties must be considered at the design and retrofit levels, from the point of view of possible structural failure, motion instability, and other unacceptable performance standards, as well as control strategies to avoid them.  &lt;br/&gt;Following the successes of the previous four SSD conferences, all held within the US, the Fifth International Conference on Stochastic Structural Dynamics (SSD'03) will be held in Hangzhou, China on May 26-28, 2003.  The objective is to bring together researchers and engineers involved in SSD and related fields throughout the world to exchange information on state-of-the-art research and state-of-the-practice.  After a decade-long economic development, including construction of a large number of new structures with new materials, China provides a unique opportunity for the US participation of SSD'03 to identify the frontier research areas in structures and materials, especially for SSD applications.  To date, more than 80 abstracts have been accepted, including 25 abstracts from the US, 30 from mainland China, and over 25 from other countries around the world.  Partial travel support for US participants is requested.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
