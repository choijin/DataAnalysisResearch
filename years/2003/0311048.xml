<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Engineering Technology (58)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In collaboration with regional manufacturing businesses, needs for advanced studies in Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) as part of the Manufacturing Systems Management program are identified. The primary goal of the project is to adapt, develop, and implement a model curriculum to prepare students as manufacturing technologists to understand systems integration, and remote human machine interface in a manufacturing environment. Computer Integrated Manufacturing Outreach Laboratory (CIMOL), with the capacity for web based remote delivery, is developed to meet the need for a higher skilled management workforce in the industry. CIMOL uses an integrated approach to curriculum development and includes interdisciplinary involvement from six academic departments. Students participate in laboratory development and creation of the graphical user interface for the remote control of CIMOL. Multiple reproducible curriculum modules are adapted and developed for the delivery of an undergraduate manufacturing technologist education. Project adapts exemplary materials from the NSF sponsored AIM Center and adds an innovative component using emerging Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) technologies. The use of web based graphical user interface exposes a diverse population of students, including geographically remote locations, to advanced manufacturing equipment and facilities. Existing educational partnerships are strengthened through the existing Ozarks Manufacturing Education Center and the creation of new partnerships through K-12 institutions such as the Greenwood Laboratory School and science centers such as the Discovery Center of Springfield.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
