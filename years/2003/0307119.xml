<AbstractNarration>Abstract, Award DMS-0307119&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Michael Vogelius, Rutgers University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Analytical and computational studies of direct and inverse boundary value problems for PDEs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A main object of this project is to delvelop very detailed information &lt;br/&gt;about the response of a system (a PDE boundary value problem) to the presence &lt;br/&gt;of internal inhomogeneities (defects), the spacing of these inhomogeneities, &lt;br/&gt;or changes in the boundary conditions. One important set of tools to obtain&lt;br/&gt;this information are rigorously verfied asymptotic expansions. In the case &lt;br/&gt;of changing, nonlinear boundary conditions another crucial component is &lt;br/&gt;the study of mechanisms that govern the development of (near-)singularities. &lt;br/&gt;The second main theme is then the application of this information to &lt;br/&gt;effectively obtain knowledge about (reconstruct) the parameters of the system &lt;br/&gt;(e.g., the location, and the character of the inhomogeneities) from data &lt;br/&gt;measured  on an accessible part of boundary, or in the ``farfield''. Initially &lt;br/&gt;the focus will be on steady state and time harmonic situations, with consideration &lt;br/&gt;of scalar equations as well as  systems (in particular Maxwell's Equations). &lt;br/&gt;Later on fully time-dependent cases will also be studied. The work has an &lt;br/&gt;essential computational component. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The particular applications that will be investigated concern 1) anti-personnel &lt;br/&gt;mine detection, using Ground Penetrating Radar(GPR) data, and 2) corrosion/oxidation &lt;br/&gt;imaging (and control) using partial voltage and current data. But many other &lt;br/&gt;applications of significant interest come to mind, for instance in the field of &lt;br/&gt;medical tomography. It is expected that the combination of analysis, asymptotic &lt;br/&gt;analysis  and computational work contained in this project will allow for the &lt;br/&gt;design of detection (and location) algorithms that are more precise (less sensitive &lt;br/&gt;to noise), and much faster than those of a general purpose nature. For &lt;br/&gt;reconstructions it is envisaged to work on experimental as well as synthetic data.&lt;br/&gt;I intend to organize two small workshops in the second and third year (of the &lt;br/&gt;period covered by this grant). The first will be devoted to mathematical&lt;br/&gt;and computational aspects of corrosion/oxidation modeling. The second will be &lt;br/&gt;devoted to GPR mine-detection. The participants will be mathematicians and &lt;br/&gt;engineers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
