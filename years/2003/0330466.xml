<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;Abstract for "SENSORS: Collaborative Research: Self-configuring In Situ&lt;br/&gt;Wireless Sensor Networks For Prescribed Fire Management":&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wireless sensor networks offer exciting new technology with the&lt;br/&gt;potential to revolutionize the critical process of fire management in&lt;br/&gt;forests and public lands.  At present, wildland fire management is&lt;br/&gt;limited by the coarse granularity of the collected weather data&lt;br/&gt;received through the portable belt weather kits worn by firefighters&lt;br/&gt;or through the sparsely scattered remote weather stations placed in&lt;br/&gt;forests.  Since weather is the most critical factor affecting fire&lt;br/&gt;behavior and firefighter safety, then the deployment of fire weather&lt;br/&gt;sensor networks offers the prospect of fine-granularity weather data&lt;br/&gt;that can vastly improve decision-making and safety in the fire management&lt;br/&gt;process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on solving the research challenges in designing,&lt;br/&gt;deploying, and testing a self-configuring wireless fire weather sensor&lt;br/&gt;network to support fire management in prescribed fire burns.&lt;br/&gt;Reliability, energy efficiency, and connectivity in rugged terrain and&lt;br/&gt;tree cover pose key challenges.  Human interface requirements like&lt;br/&gt;real-time access, localization, and dynamic reprogramming of sensor&lt;br/&gt;nodes add complexity to the problem.  Specific research objectives&lt;br/&gt;include: design and evaluation of self-configuring wireless systems&lt;br/&gt;that are low maintenance, adaptive and automatically self-organizing&lt;br/&gt;in terms of their network routing; analysis of fault tolerant&lt;br/&gt;techniques like multipath routing to facilitate persistent firefighter&lt;br/&gt;access to in situ sensor readings in rugged terrain; testing of&lt;br/&gt;sustained low power operation through transmit power control,&lt;br/&gt;time-synchronized duty cycles, and energy harvesting techniques such&lt;br/&gt;as solar power; and development of software that supports remote&lt;br/&gt;dynamic reprogramming of in situ sensor nodes.  The deployment and&lt;br/&gt;testing sequence progresses from a series of laboratory and on-campus&lt;br/&gt;experiments to a prescribed fire at a partner experimental forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this research project in terms of broader societal impact&lt;br/&gt;include the improvement of decision-making and safety in the&lt;br/&gt;management of prescribed wildland fires, the development of tools to&lt;br/&gt;enable real-time fire monitoring in rugged terrain, the generation of&lt;br/&gt;scientific datasets to improve forecasting of wildland fire behavior,&lt;br/&gt;the integration of research results into the curricula of university&lt;br/&gt;courses, and increased public understanding of fire behavior in&lt;br/&gt;wildlands through the release of research results via the Web.  This&lt;br/&gt;research effort arises from a partnership between the University of&lt;br/&gt;Colorado at Boulder and the University of Montana.  The group's&lt;br/&gt;collective expertise in computer science, electrical engineering,&lt;br/&gt;forestry, and fire intelligence promotes the spirit of collaborative,&lt;br/&gt;multidisciplinary research in a real-world setting, enhancing the&lt;br/&gt;creativity of students and faculty alike.</AbstractNarration>
