<AbstractNarration> Understanding the demographic transition -the shift from high population growth rates to low rates--has been important in demographic and anthropological research for some time. This dissertation research in cultural anthropology tests three different theoretical explanations of human fertility decisions (the embodied capital theory, the moral economy of childbearing theory, and diffusion theory) as they apply to population growth in Otavalo, Ecuador. The study seeks to understand factors in male reproductive decisions; analyzes the complex relationship between individual attributes, economic conditions and social norms as they pertain to reproductive decisions; and tests hypotheses regarding the interaction of variables that affect the status, health, education, and wealth of families. Data will be drawn from open ended interviews with a random sample of 40 Otavalo residents; two sets of 28 free lists of the expense of children and prestige items owned by respondents; and a survey of 200 respondents; and focus groups to test diverse interpretations of the data. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the study include the new information about fertility decision-making to be provided, which will be important for planners and decision makers concerned with Ecuador's population and resources. In a country that has the highest population density in South America, appropriate population and economic policy is crucial. Understanding what influences fertility decisions is useful for the design and implementation of family and economic programs in Ecuador, both at the local and national levels. In addition the study will generate information to advance general theory and will be an important factor in the education of a young social scientist. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
