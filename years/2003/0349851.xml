<AbstractNarration>This program, taking place at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, is designed to acquaint minority undergraduate students with the field of Materials Science and Engineering by introducing their teachers to this field.  The teachers are faculty and educators from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU.s) from across the nation with varied backgrounds (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, etc.) who have limited or no previous exposure to the field of materials science and engineering.  A Gordon Conference style program setting is used.  An additional component to further develop a long-term relationship with some of the institutions consists of inviting some of the faculty participants to a 6-10 week summer research opportunity.  The proposed activity is extremely important to advancing knowledge and understanding within the field of materials science and engineering and across different fields.  The activity is unique in that it is the only known  program of its type that provides an intensive introduction to the field of Materials Science and Engineering to faculty who may not receive such an opportunity otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity advances discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training and learning.  The program consists of lectures by invited outside experts, laboratory activities, and tours to nearby industrial settings.  Dissemination of the results of the program is accomplished by mailing brochures, postings on the program website, and submission of articles to education-related journals such as the ASEE Prism.  Benefits of the proposed activity to society consist of increasing the diversity of the field of Materials Science &amp; Engineering by acquainting students from underrespresented groups with the field with a result of increased awareness of materials science as a career opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
