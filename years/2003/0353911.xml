<AbstractNarration>Ten students will be recruited from across the United States to participate in a ten week summer program at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Kansas (KU).  The program is open to all undergraduate students, and summer stipends, room and board, travel, and financial support to help defray research costs are provided.  During the ten-week program, each student will develop and carry out an independent research project that explores an important issue in ecology or evolutionary biology.  Although most of these summer research experiences will be based at locations within the U.S., our REU program also offers the potential for an integrated international research experience through a cooperative arrangement with KU's Natural History Museum and Biodiversity Center.  All students will also participate in common field trips, social activities, career discussions, weekly seminars, and other opportunities to present their research as it progresses.  At the end of the ten-week session, the students will present their findings at a formal KU research symposium.&lt;br/&gt;Our students will live as a group in University housing, in close association with students from KU's other REU programs, in order to encourage interactions among students from different disciplines.  This REU site is intended to enhance the undergraduate education and professional development of a diverse set of students who might not otherwise have the opportunity to participate in a research experience.  It is also intended to support individualized training for potential members of the next generation of U.S. researchers in the areas of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and to contribute to the enhancement of ethnic and cultural diversity in the sciences.  Financial support is provided for our REU students to present their research at scientific meetings, and we will strongly encourage each student to submit their results for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  Women and students from underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to apply.  For more information, students should contact the site's Program Director, Dr. Val Smith (vsmith@ku.edu or (785) 864-4565), our Program Assistant, Sharon Green (greensl@ku.edu or (785) 864-5888), or visit http://www.ku.edu/~reu/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
