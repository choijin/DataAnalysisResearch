<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand how associative learning occurs. Previous studies have shown that neurons involved in such behavioral modification (associative learning) undergo several structural, biophysical, and biochemical changes within the cell bodies in neurons. Neurons communicate with each other at the synapse where axons make contacts. The goal of this project is to understand the synaptic mechanisms, at the axonal level, which underlie associative learning in a sea slug (Hermissenda crasicornis). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Established behavior paradigms, as well as biochemical, and physiological methods, will be employed to understand the mechanisms of associative learning in the animal. Although the sea slug is considered a 'simple' model, recent evidence suggests that many of the physiological changes that occur during learning may be conserved across species. Because Hermissenda is a simple model, several experimental manipulations that are impossible to undertake in higher vertebrates are possible in this animal model. It is predicted that several biochemical and electrophysiological changes ensue during, and after learning in the axons. These changes could alter the electrical properties of the neurons, which would result in memory acquisition. The significance of this project transcends its contribution towards our understanding of learning and memory, since it also has a broader impact in educating the public in neurobiology, marine biology, and ecology.  In addition students, including minorities and international scholars, will be involved in collecting Hermissenda, conducting the studies, and facilitate a basic understanding of the mechanisms underlying learning and memory.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
