<AbstractNarration>Similitude Modeling of Structural Damage by Fire&lt;br/&gt; 0301643&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: James Quintiere, University of Maryland &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dimensionless modeling parameters are presented in order to develop physical scale models to &lt;br/&gt;emulate  and  predict  the  behavior  of  full-scale  structures  in  fire  with  respect  to  their  fire &lt;br/&gt;characteristics  and  the  effect  of  fire  on  the  structure.    Experiments  will  be  conducted  at  three scales  to  validate  and  assess  the  accuracy  of  the  scaling.    Fire  and  structural  collapse  will  be studied  for  a  frame  steel  construction  of  a  compartment  subject  to  a  fully  involved  fire.    The motivation of the study is the collapse of the World Trade Center towers due to fire and aircraft damage.    Given  appropriate  accuracy  of  the  scale  model  approach,  the WTC  collapse  can  be demonstrated to be a valid modeling strategy.   The scaling approach has value in design and investigation as the WTC. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This  is  an  interdisciplinary  proposal  between  fire  and  structural  engineering.    These  two &lt;br/&gt;disciplines do not normally converse.  Yet the fire resistance of buildings has been based on input &lt;br/&gt;from  both  practices.    Admittedly,  the  WTC  buildings  were  constructed  with  no  direct &lt;br/&gt;consideration of the actual fire effect other than the requirement in the regulation.  No design for &lt;br/&gt;fire was explicit.  How can this better be done?  Scale modeling offers a viable, and perhaps a &lt;br/&gt;more accurate approach than computer simulations.  Scale modeling is a scientific approach, but &lt;br/&gt;it  should  be  validated.    Even  with  no  complete  success,  the  results  can  aid  in  validating &lt;br/&gt;computational modeling.  The fire scaling can be an input to computational structural modeling, &lt;br/&gt;and can serve to validate computational fire models.  This proposal is the first time a complete &lt;br/&gt;combination of the fire and structural failure scaled experiment is considered.   If successful such &lt;br/&gt;scaling  will  aid  in  the  understanding  of  structural  behavior  in  fire.    Society  will  benefit  from having safer  and more reliable buildings. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
