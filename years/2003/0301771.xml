<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0301771&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Thomas W. Scanlon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These projects study the connections between model theory and&lt;br/&gt;geometry.  In this context, model theory includes the search for&lt;br/&gt;axiomatizations and quantifier elimination results for concrete&lt;br/&gt;structures and the development of general stability and dimension&lt;br/&gt;theories.  The geometric problems to be studied arise in&lt;br/&gt;algebraic, complex analytic, rigid analytic, and differential&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry.  Specific projects include the extension of&lt;br/&gt;the model theory of compact complex manifolds to nonstandard&lt;br/&gt;analytic spaces and rigid analytic spaces.  Some of this work&lt;br/&gt;investigates the extent to which Kaehler manifolds are free from&lt;br/&gt;model theoretic pathologies.  In diophantine geometry new&lt;br/&gt;uniformity and finiteness principles are being sought as&lt;br/&gt;reflections of similar results for enriched fields.  In&lt;br/&gt;particular, a program based on the model theory of separably&lt;br/&gt;closed fields aims to resolve a function field variant of Denis'&lt;br/&gt;analogue of the Mordell-Lang conjecture for Drinfeld modules.&lt;br/&gt;The fine structure of definable sets over D-fields will be&lt;br/&gt;investigated, aiming to extend relative completeness and&lt;br/&gt;quantifier elimination theorems to valued D-fields with richer&lt;br/&gt;analytic structure and to produce effective versions of&lt;br/&gt;quantifier elimination theorems in this setting.  Differential&lt;br/&gt;jet spaces and related constructions will be used to uncover the&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial geometry of regular types in partial differential&lt;br/&gt;fields.  Abstract Euler characteristics and Grothendieck rings of&lt;br/&gt;first-order structure will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea of the branch of logic called model theory is, roughly,&lt;br/&gt;that if we know all of the simply-stated truths about an object&lt;br/&gt;then either we should know how to recognize that object uniquely,&lt;br/&gt;or anything else sharing the same collection of first-order&lt;br/&gt;properties should be revealing like the original and might&lt;br/&gt;sometimes be easier to study.  To be more precise, model theory&lt;br/&gt;studies mathematical structures by considering the first-order&lt;br/&gt;sentences true in those structures, and the family of alternate&lt;br/&gt;structures that also satisfy all of those first-order sentences.&lt;br/&gt;(Sentences in logic are built out of a small repertoire of&lt;br/&gt;elements and constructions.  "First-order" refers to the number&lt;br/&gt;of quantifiers in a sentence, a measure of complexity.)  A model&lt;br/&gt;for the algorithms and bounds sought in some of these projects is&lt;br/&gt;long division: if you are given two whole numbers to divide by&lt;br/&gt;hand then you can estimate the number of steps required by long&lt;br/&gt;division by comparing the number of digits in the decimal&lt;br/&gt;expansions of the dividend and divisor.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
