<AbstractNarration>0338546 &lt;br/&gt;Lillian Cassel&lt;br/&gt;Association Computing Machinery &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: "All in the Family: A Unified Representation of the Computing and Information Related Disciplines" &lt;br/&gt;$71,000 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project, sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery, that involves developing a computing-topics classification and visualization scheme that is both comprehensive and dynamic.  Because the field of computing (and computing related topics) expands rapidly, new topics and application domains are introduced continuously. Educators, practitioners, governments, students, employers, publishers, and others have difficult times trying to distinguish areas of expertise, curricular domains, career paths, related disciplines, and intellectual paths in the field of computing. There have been several efforts to codify the field that have been durable and widely used (e.g., ACM Computing Classification System). However, a more current and comprehensive representation will lend itself to dynamic viewing and continuous change. The PI, along with leaders from both USA and international institutions, proposes to produce such a representation of computing knowledge classifications and derivable connection maps of topics and hierarchies.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
