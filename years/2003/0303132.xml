    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0303132&lt;br/&gt;Trifonov, Ognian T.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Lattice Points, the Gauss Circle Problem, and&lt;br/&gt;the Riemann Zeta-Function&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator studies the properties of lattice points close to smooth&lt;br/&gt;curves and surfaces and applications of these properties to classical&lt;br/&gt;number theory problems. One objective is to improve on the Iwaniec-Bombieri&lt;br/&gt;method and to obtain new results in the Gauss circle problem and on the&lt;br/&gt;order of the Riemann zeta-function on the critical line. Another aim is to&lt;br/&gt;improve on the Fouvry-Iwaniec method for estimating exponential sums with&lt;br/&gt;monomials and to obtain new applications on the distribution of almost-prime&lt;br/&gt;numbers in short intervals and B-free numbers in short intervals.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator and his colleagues are also using Pade approximation&lt;br/&gt;polynomials to obtain new bounds on the fractional parts of rational numbers&lt;br/&gt;and applications to diophantine equations and on the irreducibility of&lt;br/&gt;polynomials. Another line of research is on the convergence of Minmod-type&lt;br/&gt;numerical methods for hyperbolic differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gauss circle problem and the problem of the order of the Riemann&lt;br/&gt;zeta-function on the critical line are two of the most famed problems&lt;br/&gt;in number theory. The Riemann zeta-function is closely related to the&lt;br/&gt;distribution of prime numbers. Knowledge about prime numbers plays a&lt;br/&gt;crucial role in the areas of cryptography and data encryption which are&lt;br/&gt;important both for national security and e-commerce. Hyperbolic differential&lt;br/&gt;equations find applications in problems involving flow (some examples are&lt;br/&gt;gases around aircraft, wake of aircraft, underground contamination,&lt;br/&gt;weather patterns). In most cases it is impossible to solve&lt;br/&gt;exactly the relevant differential equation, so numerical schemes for an&lt;br/&gt;approximate solution are applied. The investigator and his colleagues&lt;br/&gt;have achieved progress and are working toward completely solving an&lt;br/&gt;important open problem in the mathematical theory of numerical methods for&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic differential equations.</AbstractNarration>
