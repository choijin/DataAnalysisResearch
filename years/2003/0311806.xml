<AbstractNarration>Stillman&lt;br/&gt;     This is a collaborative project carreied out by Daniel R.&lt;br/&gt;Grayson and Michael E.  Stillman.  Macaulay 2 is a free computer&lt;br/&gt;algebra system dedicated to the qualitative investigation of&lt;br/&gt;systems of polynomial equations in many variables.   The&lt;br/&gt;investigators continue development of Macaulay 2.  They upgrade&lt;br/&gt;existing algorithms, install more algorithms, develop and publish&lt;br/&gt;new algorithms, implement new algorithms as they are discovered,&lt;br/&gt;add symbolic-numeric algorithm support, improve the&lt;br/&gt;documentation, and make systemic software changes that help&lt;br/&gt;contributors to write, test, and document code.  Areas where new&lt;br/&gt;algorithms can make an impact include the study of numerical&lt;br/&gt;systems, fractions with specified types of denominators, ideal&lt;br/&gt;factorization, systems where the multiplication of the variables&lt;br/&gt;doesn't satisfy the commutative law, geometric optimization, the&lt;br/&gt;analysis of observations of gene expression levels over time, and&lt;br/&gt;bioinformatics.&lt;br/&gt;     Macaulay 2 is part of the infrastructure that supports&lt;br/&gt;mathematical research involving systems of polynomial equations&lt;br/&gt;in many variables.  A measure of its impact is that at least 70&lt;br/&gt;research papers have cited Macaulay 2, at least seven&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians have contributed code, and books and course&lt;br/&gt;materials are now using it.  The experimental results found with&lt;br/&gt;Macaulay 2 are helping in the formulation and development of&lt;br/&gt;tractable conjectures.  Now that the software is approaching&lt;br/&gt;maturity, the investigators place more emphasis on recruiting&lt;br/&gt;developers from the research community and on collaborations with&lt;br/&gt;other scientists on both mathematical and interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;projects that exploit Macaulay 2's capabilities.  They introduce&lt;br/&gt;graduate students and postdocs to the use of computers in&lt;br/&gt;research mathematics through visits and a 5 day workshop in&lt;br/&gt;Urbana.  The study of systems of polynomial equations has a long&lt;br/&gt;and distinguished history in pure and applied mathematics, with&lt;br/&gt;recent impact on such fields as cryptography and robotics.&lt;br/&gt;Increasing computer power, combined with further development of&lt;br/&gt;Macaulay 2, enables scientists to expand dramatically its scope.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
