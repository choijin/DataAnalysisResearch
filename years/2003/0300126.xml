<AbstractNarration>DMS-0300126&lt;br/&gt;Bowman, Douglas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Combinatorics and Analysis of Special Functions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed project uses two classes of broad mathematical techniques,&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics and analysis, to expand knowledge of special functions in &lt;br/&gt;two ways. First it introduces new classes of special functions and &lt;br/&gt;catalogue their properties. Second, it studies new properties of &lt;br/&gt;known special functions. In particular, this project comprises ten &lt;br/&gt;subprojects. These include discovering and classifying algebraic &lt;br/&gt;relationships between special values of multidimensional polylogarithms,&lt;br/&gt;studying the combinatorics of shuffles and their q-analogues, analyzing &lt;br/&gt;the almost everywhere behavior of the Rogers-Ramanujan continued&lt;br/&gt;fraction on the unit circle, and studying continued fractions with multiple&lt;br/&gt;limit values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special functions are those mathematical functions which have recurred &lt;br/&gt;often enough that they have been distinguished with their own name and &lt;br/&gt;have had their properties catalogued.  Indeed, the famous mathematician &lt;br/&gt;Paul Turan once said that special functions would be better named&lt;br/&gt;"useful functions".  The most famous examples are perhaps the trigonometric &lt;br/&gt;functions, which are of critical use in all areas of technology.  As time &lt;br/&gt;progresses and physical, technological, and mathematical knowledge grow,&lt;br/&gt;the set of functions dignified with the term "special" also gets larger.&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, new properties of functions already in the pantheon of&lt;br/&gt;special functions are discovered and these properties are added to the &lt;br/&gt;banks of human knowledge. This project investigates certain natural new &lt;br/&gt;special functions as well as explores novel properties of known special&lt;br/&gt;functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
