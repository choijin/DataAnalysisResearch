<AbstractNarration>This award deals with the development of synthetic techniques and a rational strategy towards preparing transition metal oxide nanocrystals in order to determine their properties as they scale as a function of size, and to be able to generate self-assembled composites from the nanoscale components. The nanocrystals are ideally monodispersed, uniform in composition, crystalline, and can be prepared over a range of sizes from 1-100 nm. An understanding of their mechanisms of formation and their precise character, in terms of morhopology and surface will be conducted.  The transition metal oxides studied have applications in magnetism and ferroelectricity. The benefit of application directed research in these nanoscale materials will ultimately lead to advances in electrical and electronic devices. The nanocrystals studied will include the ferroelectric titanates BaTiO3, Pb(Zr,Ti)O3, manganese oxides, MnO, Mn3O4, MnO2 and binary TMO Oxide Nanocrystals based on the manganese system: CaMnO3 and LaMnO3. The interdisciplinary approach and technological focus will impact science students from levels between and postdoctoral and middle school, and will be a program to promote the understanding of materials science and engineering as a constantly evolving, cutting edge and fascinating discipline.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;With the advent of nanotechnology, comes the purpose and opportunity to explore the applications of inorganic crystals with nanometer dimensions. These tiny crystals can exhibit properties different than at larger lengthscales, and it becomes interesting to find out precisely what those differences are. Knowing those differences can lead to a deeper understanding of fundamental scientific phenomena, such as magnetism, or lead to new and exciting technological applications.&lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
