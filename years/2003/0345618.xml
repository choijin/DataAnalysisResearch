<AbstractNarration>                                                              &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanisms and Rates of Preservation of Biogenic Remains in Continental Shelf and Slope Environments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Karla M. Parsons-Hubbard&lt;br/&gt;Oberlin College&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0345618&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The Shelf and Slope Experimental Taphonomy Initiative (SSETI) is a long-term experiment studying the  fate  of  organism  remains  on  the  sea  floor.  The fossilization  potential  of  organisms  that  die  at  the sediment-water interface is poorly understood, particularly in deep offshore shelf and slope environments.  The modern shelf and slope setting is a reasonable proxy for ancient epicontinental sea deposits and has only rarely been studied with respect to its fossilization potential. The SSETI  experiment  began  in  1993  when molluscan  remains,  crustaceans,  echinoids,  and  woody plant debris were deployed in mesh bags in 21 different EODs at 10 major sites on the continental shelf and slope of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean. Each site has multiple replicates for repeated sampling over the ensuing years to decades. The project proposed here is  to  recover  experimental  arrays  that  have  been  on  the  sea  floor  for  12 years.  Collections of samples have been taken at targeted intervals (1 year, 2 years, 8 years) to document taphonomic rates and processes, and to determine whether different types of shell, wood, test, or cuticle respond differently to processes in the taphonomically active zone (TAZ) in different environments and over time. To answer these questions, repeated sampling of the remains must be accompanied by a detailed characterization of the TAZ.  This is accomplished through porewater geochemical analysis using in situ micro-electrode sampling and through measurements of sediment oxygen demand. The goal of this work is to link the instantaneous chemical conditions in the TAZ to the long-term effects on shells residing at, or just below, the sediment-water interface. Results through year eight show a very tight correlation between the porewater geochemistry and dissolution of molluscan material. These findings are greatly advancing knowledge about the cycling of carbonate on the sea floor and  has  important  applications  to  paleontology,  paleoecology,  and  has  direct  implications  for  carbon budgets and climate modeling. In particular, the results of this work are critical to planners seeking to use the sea floor as a carbon sink.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
