<AbstractNarration>Broad-scale disturbances such as fire, drought and biological invasions can have major ecological consequences. However, it is difficult to study their effects when they are unpredictable in space and time. This research will determine the effect of periodical cicadas on the dynamics of forest systems. Periodical cicadas emerge every 17 or 13 years, depending upon species, after extended below-ground feeding on tree roots. The 2004 emergence is likely to be one of the largest insect outbreaks on Earth, providing the rare opportunity to critically examine the impact of a major biological disturbance. Preliminary work suggests that cicadas have strong preferences among tree species, favor young successional forest sites, and have chronic effects on tree growth. We will contrast forest composition in high density vs. cicada-free sites, and will manipulate cicada colonization by netting blocks of early successional forest. Long-term effects of cicadas on different host species will be examined through the analysis of tree rings. This research will improve our understanding of disturbance events and forest dynamics, and may serve as a useful model for other, less predicable biotic disturbances. Further, this research provides a unique opportunity to educate the local community about forest systems, and to actively involve students in an exciting event that incorporates "science as process" learning activities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
