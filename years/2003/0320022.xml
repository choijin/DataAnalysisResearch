<AbstractNarration>Theoretical and algorithmic approaches to data analysis have played a&lt;br/&gt;central role in the development of modern methods for handling data.&lt;br/&gt;The massive amounts of data gathered in important present-day&lt;br/&gt;applications ranging from the Internet to homeland security to&lt;br/&gt;astronomy and medicine have dramatically changed the requirements for&lt;br/&gt;algorithms and provide ample motivation for a great deal of new&lt;br/&gt;theoretical development. Traditional data analysis tools are incapable&lt;br/&gt;of handling the sheer size and complexity of these gigantic data sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will run three workshops on topics related to the size and&lt;br/&gt;complexity of modern data sets:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Data Quality, Data Cleaning and Treatment of Noisy Data"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Compact Representation of Data"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Geographical Information Systems: Terrain Representation and&lt;br/&gt;Analysis Algorithms"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Data Quality workshop seeks to bring together experts from&lt;br/&gt;different research disciplines to initiate a comprehensive technical&lt;br/&gt;discussion on data quality, data cleaning and treatment of noisy data.&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the workshop are to develop quantitative ways of&lt;br/&gt;measuring the quality of data and to search for an integrated,&lt;br/&gt;domain-independent approach to data cleaning in the situation where&lt;br/&gt;the sheer size of data collections prevents one from manually&lt;br/&gt;scrubbing or even monitoring them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central topic of the Compact Representation workshop revolves&lt;br/&gt;around the following question: Can a large and potentially complicated&lt;br/&gt;data set be replaced by a short sketch such that a certain class of&lt;br/&gt;queries on the original data can be answered (perhaps approximately)&lt;br/&gt;by performing computations on the short sketch?  The workshop will&lt;br/&gt;explore metric embeddings of sampling spaces with complex structure&lt;br/&gt;into spaces that are amenable to simpler analysis; space-time&lt;br/&gt;tradeoffs for data structures; and algorithms for analysis of data in&lt;br/&gt;the streaming model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are called on to store,&lt;br/&gt;combine, display, and analyze disparate types of spatially-referenced&lt;br/&gt;data---locations of telephone poles, streets, rivers, mountains,&lt;br/&gt;buildings, soil layers, pollution levels, voting districts---for&lt;br/&gt;applications ranging from natural resource management to urban&lt;br/&gt;planning.  The goal of the proposed workshop is to address the&lt;br/&gt;challenges in modern GIS by focusing on algorithmic issues encountered&lt;br/&gt;in such systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops will identify areas for research and focus on future&lt;br/&gt;research challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All workshops will seek a broad impact through a mix of theoretical&lt;br/&gt;researchers and practitioners and by helping to stimulate&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary collaborations. Theoretical progress on the research&lt;br/&gt;topics in these workshops will have impact on a wide variety of areas&lt;br/&gt;such as health care, homeland security, environmental management,&lt;br/&gt;disaster management, marketing, bioinformatics, psychology, sociology,&lt;br/&gt;chemometrics, astronomy, and credit card fraud detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major theme of the project is integration of research and&lt;br/&gt;education. It is addressed through participation of graduate students&lt;br/&gt;in the workshops, interaction between students and DIMACS visitors&lt;br/&gt;working in related areas, and tutorial programs organized in each&lt;br/&gt;workshop.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
