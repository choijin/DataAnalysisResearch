<AbstractNarration>DMS-0300784&lt;br/&gt;Rumely, Robert S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  Heights, Capacity, and Dynamics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the Principal Investigators study various aspects of&lt;br/&gt;analysis on p-adic spaces, especially those arising in connection with&lt;br/&gt;canonical heights, capacity theory, and algebraic dynamical systems.  &lt;br/&gt;The project involves the development of both theory and applications, &lt;br/&gt;and comprises three main topics:  adelic  equidistribution theorems for points&lt;br/&gt;of small height; arithmetic aspects of the dynamics of iterated rational&lt;br/&gt;functions; and analysis on Berkovich spaces with applications to dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems, arithmetic intersection theory, and higher-dimensional capacity&lt;br/&gt;theory.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motivation for this work is to understand and generalize certain&lt;br/&gt;recently discovered properties of "height functions".  Height functions&lt;br/&gt;first arose in connection with elliptic curves, and are ubiquitous in&lt;br/&gt;modern number theory.  One of the goals of the project is to establish&lt;br/&gt;properties of heights for arbitrary curves and arbitrary dynamical systems&lt;br/&gt;which are similar to those for elliptic curves. This will be approached by&lt;br/&gt;using methods from potential theory.  Another goal is to establish&lt;br/&gt;"p-adic" analogues of results which are known to hold in the theory of&lt;br/&gt;manifolds.  When completed, the project will reveal new connections&lt;br/&gt;between number theory, dynamical systems, and potential theory.  Funding&lt;br/&gt;for this project will support the infrastructure of the University of&lt;br/&gt;Georgia's number theory group, which has historically been very strong. &lt;br/&gt;The project will impact both the graduate and undergraduate programs at&lt;br/&gt;UGA: some of the questions raised by this research will lead to PhD&lt;br/&gt;dissertation topics for graduate students, and others will provide an&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to involve undergraduate students in cutting edge mathematical&lt;br/&gt;research. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
