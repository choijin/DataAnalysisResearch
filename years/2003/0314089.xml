    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funds to enhance the on-going Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) instrument development program. The (ESP) is a novel instrument that collects discrete water samples autonomously, concentrates microorganisms and automates application of DNA (or other) molecular probes to enable identification and quantification of particular species captured in situ, subsurface. The instrument transmits results of DNA probe array based assays in real- time to a shore based location for processing, interpretation and dissemination. In addition, the ESP archives discrete samples for nucleic acid, microscopic and toxin analyses for verifying real- time data from the probe arrays as well as facilitating discovery based analyses in the laboratory. In this three year project, the PI's propose to: 1) construct a second generation, internet- accessible ESP (2G ESP); 2) refine DNA probe arrays used in the ESP for detecting specific species; 3) develop toxin detection techniques that are applicable for use on the ESP in real-time; and 4) conduct field tests of the 2G ESP in Monterey Bay, California. Identification of specific nuisance, harmful or toxic algal species that pose widespread economic concerns and/or are known to negatively impact the health of humans and wildlife is emphasized.</AbstractNarration>
