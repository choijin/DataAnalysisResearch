<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the acquisition of a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) for magnetic materials research and education at SUNY at Buffalo. The VSM equipment is fully integrated and automated with high sensitivity. Current research projects making use of the new equipment cover a broad range of magnetic materials: giant magnetoresistance spin valves, exchange anisotropy films, magneto-optical multilayers, giant magnetostriction thin films and multilayers, magnetic shape memory alloy bulk, thin films, and multilayers, and materials for ballistic magnetoresistance. These projects are of fundamental interest from the viewpoint of the physics of magnetism, spin dependent electron transport and spintronics.  Research on these materials has broad technological applications in the areas of ultra-high density data storage devices, magnetic sensors, optical storage systems, and transducers for microsystems.  This instrument will enhance the broad goals of the university in nanoscience and nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The availability of this basic tool for routine magnetic characterization of materials at the university will provide opportunities for research and also student training, education, and outreach activities. The new VSM will also enhance collaborative research.  Faculty are active in student training, education, and outreach activities, with the involvement of minorities and women. Continuing and expanding upon previous activities, current efforts involve hands-on training for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. Outreach activities include a five-week summer apprentice program for minorities and women students (typically 14-18) from Buffalo-area inner city high schools, and laboratory experience for undergraduates.  Participating students will benefit from the VSM by learning to use and understand the magnetic behavior of materials. In addition, other researchers from SUNY-Buffalo pursuing research and education in magnetic materials will have access to the use of the new equipment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
