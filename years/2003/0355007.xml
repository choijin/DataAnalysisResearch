<AbstractNarration>This is a three-year program funded by the NSF primarily to carry out&lt;br/&gt;experiments with relativistic heavy ion-collisions, i.e. head-on&lt;br/&gt;collisions of heavy nuclei such as gold near the speed of light. The&lt;br/&gt;principal investigators are T. J. Humanic and M. A. Lisa of the&lt;br/&gt;Department of Physics at The Ohio State University. The main goal of&lt;br/&gt;these experiments is to obtain evidence that collisions of this type&lt;br/&gt;produce a phase transition from normal nuclear matter into a new phase&lt;br/&gt;of matter made up of a large volume of free quarks and gluons (the&lt;br/&gt;constituents of protons and neutrons) called Quark Matter. This phase&lt;br/&gt;transition has been predicted by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is&lt;br/&gt;the theory that describes the behaviour of quarks and gluons in nature.&lt;br/&gt;Thus far, there have been no disagreements between the predictions of&lt;br/&gt;QCD and experiment, so finding Quark Matter would be a major test of&lt;br/&gt;this theory. Quark matter is of additional interest since it is thought&lt;br/&gt;to have been the state of the universe several microseconds after the&lt;br/&gt;Big Bang and may exist today in nature at the centers of neutron stars.&lt;br/&gt;Relativistic heavy ion collisions could provide a method to produce&lt;br/&gt;Quark Matter in the laboratory since it is necessary to create a very&lt;br/&gt;dense and hot region within nuclear matter in order for the initiation&lt;br/&gt;of this phase transition. In addition,  because heavy ions are&lt;br/&gt;relatively large compared with the size of a proton the collision is&lt;br/&gt;extended in time, hopefully allowing the system enough time to reach&lt;br/&gt;equilibrium so that the Quark Matter state is well developed. Thus, to&lt;br/&gt;study this phenomenon one prefers heavy ion collisions at the highest&lt;br/&gt;possible energies and with the heaviest ions available. In the present&lt;br/&gt;proposal heavy ion collisions will be studied with gold on gold&lt;br/&gt;collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven&lt;br/&gt;National Laboratory (BNL) and lead on lead collisions at the Large&lt;br/&gt;Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva. RHIC, which started delivering&lt;br/&gt;beams in Summer 2000, is the highest energy heavy ion accelerator now in&lt;br/&gt;operation. In order to look for signatures that a phase transition to&lt;br/&gt;Quark Matter has taken place, one must study the properties of the&lt;br/&gt;particles produced in the collisions, such as particle momenta and&lt;br/&gt;multiplicities of each type that can be detected (e.g. pions, kaons,&lt;br/&gt;protons, and more exotic particles). This will be done at RHIC using the&lt;br/&gt;large acceptance detectors of the STAR experiment, which can sample most&lt;br/&gt;of the interesting particles per collision. The information obtained in&lt;br/&gt;this way can be used to determine, for example, the physical size of the&lt;br/&gt;interaction region (using two-particle interferometry), the temperatures&lt;br/&gt;reached in the collisions (from particle momentum distributions) and&lt;br/&gt;exotic particle production such as strange baryons. In addition,&lt;br/&gt;preparations will be made to study Pb+Pb collisions at even higher&lt;br/&gt;energies at the LHC with the ALICE experiment. The LHC will provide&lt;br/&gt;beams 30 times higher in center-of-mass energy than RHIC, i.e. cosmic&lt;br/&gt;ray energies, starting in 2007. Thus, the energy dependence of Quark&lt;br/&gt;Matter production can be studies and the search for as yet unpredicted&lt;br/&gt;phenomena can also be pursued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the intellectual merit described above, there are broader&lt;br/&gt;impacts to society of this proposal in the areas of education,&lt;br/&gt;technology and computing. Since undergraduate students, graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and postdoctoral researchers will play key roles in this&lt;br/&gt;project, training will be provided to these groups in how to carry out&lt;br/&gt;research in large collaborations and in general problem solving skills.&lt;br/&gt;Participation in particle detector development and testing will enhance&lt;br/&gt;new technologies which can be adapted to both commercial and government&lt;br/&gt;use. Since this research requires large-scale computing in order to&lt;br/&gt;acquire and analyze data on the teraflop an terabyte scale, new methods&lt;br/&gt;in information science, such as computing grid systems, will be&lt;br/&gt;developed which can enhance the computing power of society as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
