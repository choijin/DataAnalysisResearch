    <AbstractNarration>Face perception is perhaps the most developed visual perception skill, with considerable neuroscience evidence for the involvement of a number of brain areas. Theory and research in this discipline emphasizes a distinction between processes involved in the recognition of identity and the recognition of emotional expressions. Face perception also plays a critical role in social interactions, and considerable research in social psychology has identified consensual, evaluative trait judgments based on facial structure. The babyface overgeneralization hypothesis has been proposed to account for certain consensual trait impressions, and it has been supported using a variety of methods. In particular, adults with facial structures that resemble those of babies are judged to have the childlike traits of naivete, physical weakness, warmth, and submissiveness, and the extent to which an artificial neural network confuses adult faces with those of babies predicts impressions of these traits. The proposed research will test this overgeneralization hypothesis by examining human brain activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Experiment 1 will identify regions and patterns of brain activation that differentiate responses to faces of babies and adults, and Experiment 2 will determine a) whether some adult faces elicit brain activation more similar to that shown to babies' faces, and b) whether trait impressions of these adult faces can be predicted from the similarity of the brain activation they produce to that produced by babies' faces. The proposed research integrates theories and research in the domains of social psychology and neuroscience to advance our understanding of face perception and facial stereotypes.</AbstractNarration>
