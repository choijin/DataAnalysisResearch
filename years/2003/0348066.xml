<AbstractNarration>CAREER: Investigations of Breaking Waves and Fluid-Structure Interactions &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The  designs  for  large  civil engineering  structures  (LCES),  e.g.,  long-span  suspension  bridges, guided &lt;br/&gt;towers/masts,  hydraulic/wind  driven  turbines,  deep water  risers  and  offshore  fixed/floating  platforms are usually governed by wave and/or wind loading.  The  objective  of  this  project  is  to  educate  students  and  advance  research  in water waves  and  fluid-structure  interactions  (FSI)  in  relation  to  the  analysis  and  design  of  LCES.  In  particular,  the  aim  is  to advance computational modeling of breaking water waves and high Reynolds number (Re) flows because model-scale tests used in today.s design cannot reproduce full-scale  structural behavior. Due to this  fact, the most common vibrations problems on LCES are those induced by vortex shedding, that is, both wind flow and wave/current loads.  &lt;br/&gt;Although  previous  investigations  have  been  done,  unresolved  issues  remain  to  be  investigated  of  the &lt;br/&gt;interactions of density stratified multiphase fluids and fluid-solid mechanisms. This is especially true when &lt;br/&gt;the free-surface becomes unstable and breaks and for fluid structure mechanisms with high Re. This project &lt;br/&gt;is concerned with these interactions as they could be responsible  for loss of structural integrity and even &lt;br/&gt;failure. To this end, numerical models can prove to be valuable tools in analyzing and understanding the &lt;br/&gt;mechanisms of free surface instabilities and FSI. However any method that can provide aid should be used, &lt;br/&gt;including, theoretical, experimental and/or computational methods. But computational model development &lt;br/&gt;is prioritized mainly because it is believed that new discoveries can be made in free-surface instabilities and &lt;br/&gt;high Re incompressible flows around bluff-bodies.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merits:  A  principal  challenge  to  be  addressed  is  that  of  moving  interfaces,  as  well  as  the &lt;br/&gt;multitude of scales in the flow. The project is concerned with investigations of breaking water waves and &lt;br/&gt;vortex induced resonance problems of LCES. This project is driven by the following core ideas:   &lt;br/&gt;1)  Extending the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) equation to model breaking ocean waves numerically; &lt;br/&gt;2)  Numerically predicting vortex induced resonance on LCES using an extended LB formulation; &lt;br/&gt;3)  Developing an interdisciplinary FSI course. Civil engineering students will especially benefit; &lt;br/&gt;4)  Using a virtual reality laboratory in teaching and research.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The LB approach, which is based on statistical mechanic concepts, obeys Navier-Stokes equations. It &lt;br/&gt;has  been  used  extensively  in molecular  dynamics  and  physics  but  has  not  been  developed  in  relation  to LCES. To the PI.s knowledge, this is the first time a LB model is being developed to  simulate breaking &lt;br/&gt;ocean waves  and  their  interactions  with  LCES.  It  is  also  the  first  time  a  LB  formulation  contains  FSI, turbulence and nonlinear free-surface model capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;The fundamentals of the model approach have several attractive features, especially with regard to free-&lt;br/&gt;surface  breaking waves,  FSI  and  parallel  solver  development.  The  unsteady  flows  of  interest  are  highly three-dimensional  and  are  further  complicated  by  the  interaction  with  a  fixed  or  oscillating  structure. Therefore,  to  improve  the  learning  process  for  students  and  researchers  at  all  levels,  emphasis  on visualization programming in a virtual reality laboratory to analyze the results of the models is proposed.  Furthermore, as a supplementary project component, the computational models will be validated with planned  flow  field  measurements  and  visualization  experiments.  Free-surface  physical  experiments  are planned  and  will  mainly  comprise  monitoring  sloshing  motion  in  tanks.  The  bluff-body  aerodynamics experiments will  focus  on simultaneous measurements of  structural movement  and  the wind  field. Collaborators will also provide data from both computational and physical experiments. &lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Although the research part of the project focuses on one particular fluid formulation, the &lt;br/&gt;core idea of this project evolves around improving methods of design of LCES through detailed modeling &lt;br/&gt;of  fluid  flows  and  the  coupling  between  fluid  and  solid.  The  career  development  plan  of  the  PI  has, &lt;br/&gt;however, highly interdisciplinary contents making it applicable beyond civil and mechanical engineering. &lt;br/&gt;FSI  and  wave  dynamics modeling  are  important  topics  in many  disciplines,  such  as  computer  science; &lt;br/&gt;astrophysics;  biomedical  engineering  and  earth  science.  The  computational models  proposed  herein will &lt;br/&gt;apply to these other fields of science. It is the PI.s career goal to model problems and contribute in these &lt;br/&gt;other areas as well when the computational fluid dynamics groundwork related to LCES has been explored.  &lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, wave  dynamics  and FSI  research  and education  is  important  to  society  as  it  could  save &lt;br/&gt;lives  by  avoiding  structural  collapse.  A  project  of  this  kind  also  plays  an  important  role  in  energy &lt;br/&gt;development, economic development and in the nation.s balance of payments problems.</AbstractNarration>
