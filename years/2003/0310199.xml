<AbstractNarration>0310199&lt;br/&gt;Ashmawy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description:  This award is to support a cooperative research project between Dr. Alaa Ashmawy, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida and Dr. Ahmed H. Abdel-Rahman, National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt.  Proper design and construction of municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills is a challenge to Egyptian communities where more than 10 million tons of MSW are generated annually, and to U.S. communities where over 200 million tons are generated annually.  In Egypt, compacted clay liners (CCLs) or geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) form the main component of the hydraulic barrier in the landfill liner and cover system.  However, the search for alternative cover and liner systems in both countries is driven by the need for economical solutions while maintaining the same environmental and safety standards.  The investigators plan to design and assess the performance of two alternative systems, namely layered incinerator ash-soil composites and processed construction and demolition debris.  These systems will be compared to conventional liners in terms of their performance effectiveness as well as economical benefits through an extensive laboratory and field-testing program.  The project builds upon the expertise and current research of both investigators in this field, and is expected to provide economical and safe designs for use by private sector landfill operators and municipal authorities in both countries. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Scope:  Identification and evaluation of alternative landfill liner and cover systems is a timely issue of significant importance to the geoenvironmental community.    The research will introduce innovative methods for beneficial use of incinerator ash and construction debris in liner and cover systems.  The facilities needed for successful completion of the project are available at both the USF and the NRC.  The project builds upon the expertise and current research of both investigators in this field, and is expected to provide economical and safe designs for use by private sector landfill operators and municipal authorities in both countries.  The project activities include the participation of a graduate student as well as undergraduate students from underrepresented groups, through an REU program at the University of South Florida's College of Engineering.  International research opportunities are provided to the U.S. graduate student who will visit the Egyptian laboratories.  Research findings will be disseminated through publication in journals, conference proceedings, and the Internet. This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
