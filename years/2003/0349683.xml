    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop an effective diesel particulate filter (DPF) that can be reliably regenerated with integral electrical heating elements. A fabrication process will also be developed that ensures economical manufacturability of the filter in high volumes. The greatest challenge in the design of reliable particulate filter and trap systems has been achieving adequate regeneration, or the oxidation (burning) of particulates that accumulate in the filter substrate diesel engine operation. The objectives of Phase II will include designing an actively regenerating filter structure, optimization of EC material for use in the DPF substrate, development of manufacturing processes suitable for scale up to volume production, construction of prototype DPF substrates, testing, and ultimately integration of the EC-integrated DPF into a functioning DPF system ready for field testing. The anticipated result of the Phase II project is an actively regenerating EC-integrated DPF prototype substrate suitable for field testing in the US EPA.s Voluntary Retrofit Program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EC-integrated DPF will fulfill new emissions controls scheduled to take effect in 2007. There is presently a compelling need for a compact, simple-to-maintain, durable, and effective diesel particulate filter for both new and existing diesel- powered vehicles. The EC-integrated DPF could potentially reduce diesel particulate emissions by 9.5 million tons annually, preventing thousands of premature deaths due to respiratory illnesses, cancer and heart disease. .</AbstractNarration>
