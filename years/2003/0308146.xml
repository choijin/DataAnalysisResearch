<AbstractNarration>In this project the PI will explore issues relating to, and develop a prototype of, a multi-touch tactile computer interface designed and optimized for individuals with physical disabilities, for whom traditional input devices such as the keyboard and mouse can pose significant challenges.  Recent technological advances support the manufacture of 2D multi-touch sensing arrays of arbitrary size and dimension that utilize zero force interaction, are very thin, and robust under a variety of operating conditions.  This multi-touch sensing (MTS) technology opens up new possibilities for a comprehensive tactile interface that incorporates keyboard entry, mouse control, and powerful macro definition in a gesture-based interface.  This research addresses the core hardware and software issues necessary to yield MTS interfaces that are fully accessible to individuals with a wide range of disabilities, and that can accommodate variations in hand size/configuration, range of movements, and movement dynamics.  Specifically, the PIs will focus on individuals with (1) limited motion of the digits and wrist, (2) limited motion of the elbow or shoulder, and (3) irregularity of movement trajectories.  The project will consist of four fundamental components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Image Model Development:  Contact with the MTS produces an "image" consisting of the areas of contact between the user and surface.  Current image models are based on full hand and finger function.  These models will be updated to handle palm, fist, and knuckle gestures produced by individuals with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;2. Contact Trajectory Modeling and Filtering:  Models will be developed to track the spatio-temporal characteristics of user contact images.  Additionally, robust filtering algorithms will be investigated and implemented to minimize the effect of irregular movements due to unintended tremor or spasticity.&lt;br/&gt;3. Gesture Definition and Recognition:  Algorithms will be developed and implemented to recognize an extensive collection of finger, knuckle, palm and fist gestures so as to accommodate a wide range of functional limitations.  Guidelines will be created that help users identify which gestures are most appropriate for their abilities.  Configuration software will be created so that users can map these gestures to the most critical actions for a given application environment. &lt;br/&gt;4. Design and Construction of Integrated MTS Interfaces:  MTS interfaces that meet the particular needs of individuals with disabilities will be designed and constructed.  Designs will include an MTS interface integrated into a wheelchair lap tray and Bluetooth based wireless MTS interfaces.  These integrated interfaces will enable users to control multiple devices, such as PDAs, computers, and ECUs, through a single, customized interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rigorous evaluation procedures will inform all research components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  This research will afford individuals with disabilities more accommodating&lt;br/&gt;and efficient access to computer, PDAs, and the National Information Infrastructure, all of which are now critical in such diverse pursuits as business, education, travel, and leisure.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
