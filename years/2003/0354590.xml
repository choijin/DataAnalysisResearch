<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to facilitate participation by US social scientists in a workshop on New Technology Foresight, Forecasting, and Assessment Methods tentatively scheduled for May 13-14, 2004 in Seville, Spain. The Institute for Prospective Technology Assessment (IPTS) is hosting the workshop for 50-80 persons and the EU Directorate General for Research should be able to cover essentially all on-site costs of the American participants.  The US planning group has issued a general call for papers, encouraging a broad range of submissions.  It will select from among them those who bring new perspectives and are otherwise unlikely to be able to attend.  The stipends in this award will help cover travel costs for 10 Americans to participate in this workshop, which will explore ways to advance the state of the art in assessing emerging technologies. Such "technological intelligence" is increasingly in demand for technology management and policy decision support. Yet, utilization of FTA in the past has been quite limited -- the potential to do better is great.  There is much to be gained from bringing together European emphases on process management and public sector, large scope studies with American leanings toward quantitative methods and private sector, "micro" analyses of specific technologies.   Moreover, fresh approaches are needed to understand changes in the nature of the technologies to be assessed -- from industrial to information to molecular.  There is promise in exploiting rich science and technology information resources more fully and in bringing to bear new insights from complex systems perspectives.  The aim is that the workshop will instigate a series of ongoing activities including research, bi-annual meetings, and nucleation of a thriving professional community.  Academic engagement should enrich the approaches to FTA and lead to courses.  The final report will include a white paper about directions for technology foresight, forecasting and assessment methods, including work on constructive technology assessment.</AbstractNarration>
