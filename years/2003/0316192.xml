    <AbstractNarration>Gardner&lt;br/&gt; The investigator develops and analyzes models of persistent&lt;br/&gt;behavior of locally self-annihilating populations of predatory&lt;br/&gt;and herbivorous mites. The project is stimulated by Huffaker's&lt;br/&gt;classic experiment, which provided the first demonstration of the&lt;br/&gt;mediating role of spatial processes in certain ecological&lt;br/&gt;interactions. Huffaker noted that synchronies in the phases of&lt;br/&gt;population cycles of localized aggregates within host plants of&lt;br/&gt;herbivorous mites and of the mites that preyed upon them&lt;br/&gt;occasionally spread over an entire area, but that the synchrony&lt;br/&gt;can be broken by demographic and environmental stochasticity. He&lt;br/&gt;conjectured that the complementary regularizing mechanisms that&lt;br/&gt;generate synchrony, and the complementary stochastic mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;that generate asynchrony, together generate the complex waves and&lt;br/&gt;patterns seen in these predator-prey interactions in nature.&lt;br/&gt;Existing stochastic patch models have been formulated that&lt;br/&gt;successfully simulate complex, and evidently chaotic,&lt;br/&gt;spatio-temporal patterns that have typically accompanied&lt;br/&gt;persistent dynamics. Accordingly, such models have difficulty in&lt;br/&gt;providing reliable predictions of behavior due to the large&lt;br/&gt;variance seen in replicate data sets. This substantially limits&lt;br/&gt;their practical application to the biological control of crop&lt;br/&gt;pests. In previous work, the investigator formulated a family of&lt;br/&gt;deterministic models, including an idealized paradigm defining a&lt;br/&gt;class of reaction-diffusion systems. He studies two general&lt;br/&gt;issues relating to the analysis and practical applications of the&lt;br/&gt;reaction-diffusion system and related models. First, he&lt;br/&gt;investigates the presence of several distinct families of stable&lt;br/&gt;waves and spatial patterns of these equations, their&lt;br/&gt;instabilities and bifurcations, and the presence of exotic&lt;br/&gt;wave-like patterns. By combined analytical and approximate&lt;br/&gt;methods, he describes theoretical mechanisms by which such&lt;br/&gt;unstable waves can form the organizing center of spatio-temporal&lt;br/&gt;chaos, while in other regimes, complex but non-chaotic, stable&lt;br/&gt;spatio-temporal patterns appear spontaneously. A second topic&lt;br/&gt;concerns the derivation of the model, which is based on&lt;br/&gt;experiment. This addresses the manner in which the&lt;br/&gt;reaction-diffusion model simulates stochasticity through&lt;br/&gt;postulated low-density thresholds in the growth rates. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator studies hybrid numerical procedures addressing the&lt;br/&gt;crucial issue of parameter estimation, which can be problematic&lt;br/&gt;both for stochastic patch models and for the reaction-diffusion&lt;br/&gt;model, but at opposite spatio-temporal scales. For example, the&lt;br/&gt;low-density thresholds involve the micro-local dynamics of a&lt;br/&gt;small number of individuals, whereas large-scale emigration over&lt;br/&gt;large regions is difficult to measure in a laboratory. However,&lt;br/&gt;simple stable waves may suggest one instance in which this may be&lt;br/&gt;possible. The investigator examines this in numerical&lt;br/&gt;simulations with patch models, which may form the basis for new&lt;br/&gt;and simpler experimental designs that can detect such behavior.&lt;br/&gt;Together, these two approaches present a unified picture of how&lt;br/&gt;"dynamic stochasticity" driven by the presence of certain&lt;br/&gt;unstable waves and spatio-temporal patterns is theoretically&lt;br/&gt;linked to parameters of population change governing behavior at&lt;br/&gt;the smallest micro-local scales, and thus the generation of&lt;br/&gt;asynchrony through demographic and environmental stochasticity.&lt;br/&gt; Plant-eating mites, and the mites that eat them in turn,&lt;br/&gt;often show cycles of growth and decline in numbers that are&lt;br/&gt;closely related. Sometimes the populations decline rapidly to&lt;br/&gt;near-extinction levels. But in a classic experiment Huffaker and&lt;br/&gt;colleagues showed that these strongly coupled cycles can be&lt;br/&gt;moderated by small changes in demographic or geographic factors,&lt;br/&gt;leading to a long-term survival of both species that shows itself&lt;br/&gt;in patterns, in time and space, of the numbers of predator and&lt;br/&gt;prey mites. Of course, when the prey mite is eating a valuable&lt;br/&gt;crop, one wants both mite populations to go extinct. So issues of&lt;br/&gt;how mite populations vary together are of considerable practical&lt;br/&gt;importance in the biological control of crop pests. The economic&lt;br/&gt;impact of phytophageous species is considerable, and although the&lt;br/&gt;use of predatory mites as a biological control is widespread in&lt;br/&gt;certain local agricultures, many agricultural enterprises rely on&lt;br/&gt;chemical pest controls. Chemical controls provide a short-term&lt;br/&gt;solution, but have many damaging long-term effects. However, the&lt;br/&gt;risks and uncertainties of biological pest control are difficult&lt;br/&gt;to quantify due to their complex and unpredictable patterns of&lt;br/&gt;behavior. The investigator's numerical simulations indicate the&lt;br/&gt;presence of many different kinds of chaos, some of which achieve&lt;br/&gt;better levels of suppression of both herbivore populations and&lt;br/&gt;crop damage. The project explores new theoretical and&lt;br/&gt;computational tools that may find practical application in the&lt;br/&gt;biological control of crop pests and, in other contexts, in&lt;br/&gt;inoculative control of certain exotic species.</AbstractNarration>
