<AbstractNarration>This U.S.-Polish cooperative research project aims to apply new results obtained in the field of nonlinear light-atom interactions, based on the atomic coherence and quantum interference effects, into the studies of nonlinear magneto-optic phenomena.  The principal investigators are Dr. Dmitry Budker from the University of California - Berkeley and Wojciech Gawlik from Jagiellonian University in Krakow.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity are that the results of the research on novel methods in magnetometry may be applied in medicine, biology, military surveillance, space research and national security.  There may also be no better teaching tool as many of the best young scientists in this field in the U.S. were trained to work on precision measurements - such as the ones proposed in this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project in physics research fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.</AbstractNarration>
