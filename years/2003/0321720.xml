<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Dr. David Browman, Maria Bruno will investigate the&lt;br/&gt;process of agricultural intensification and it role in the development of early&lt;br/&gt;polities during the Formative Period (1500 B.C. - A.D. 500) on the Taraco&lt;br/&gt;Peninsula, Bolivia. The Taraco Peninsula is located in on the southern shores&lt;br/&gt;of the Lake Titicaca Basin in the Andean South America and previous&lt;br/&gt;archaeological investigations here suggest that the first regional polity, the&lt;br/&gt;Taraco Peninsula Polity, emerged c. 250 B.C. Clarifying the development of such&lt;br/&gt;early regional polities is necessary for understanding the emergence of the&lt;br/&gt;basin's first state-level society, Tiwanaku, c. A.D. 500.&lt;br/&gt;Several researchers suggest that increased agricultural production played a&lt;br/&gt;central role in the development of these early polities and the Tiwanaku&lt;br/&gt;state.  It is hypothesized that emerging elites created an economic surplus by&lt;br/&gt;orchestrating the increased production of agricultural goods. Current&lt;br/&gt;understanding of agricultural intensification in the Lake Titicaca Basin,&lt;br/&gt;however, is based only on studies of settlement patterns, stone tool use, and&lt;br/&gt;paleoethnobotanical analysis of crop plants.  Although these studies document&lt;br/&gt;increasing agricultural production throughout the Formative, available data&lt;br/&gt;sets are too coarse-grained to verify postulated links between changes in&lt;br/&gt;agricultural production and concomitant socio-political developments.  Bruno&lt;br/&gt;proposes to resolve this issue by conducting an ethnobotanical study of present-&lt;br/&gt;day agricultural practices on the Taraco Peninsula, Bolivia.  This study will&lt;br/&gt;aid in the analysis and interpretation of archaeological plant remains from two&lt;br/&gt;Formative period sites, Kala Uyuni and Yanapata, from the same region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through 13 months of ethnobotanical fieldwork among Aymara communities on the&lt;br/&gt;Taraco Peninsula, including interviews, participation in agricultural&lt;br/&gt;activities, and farmer-guided plant collections, Bruno will create a&lt;br/&gt;comparative floral collection that reflects local agricultural production.  The&lt;br/&gt;ethnographically derived comparative collection will not only provide data&lt;br/&gt;necessary for the identification of archaeological plant taxa, but also will&lt;br/&gt;furnish corollary data on human activities that create observable patterns in&lt;br/&gt;plant morphology and ecology. These data will aid in the analysis of archaeological plant remains recovered from the Taraco Archaeological Project's excavations at Kala Uyuni and&lt;br/&gt;Yanapata, directed by Drs. Christine Hastorf and Matthew Bandy. Using a&lt;br/&gt;combination of paleoethnobotanical analytical techniques, Bruno will track the&lt;br/&gt;frequency of all plant taxa through time across different archaeological&lt;br/&gt;contexts.  In particular, crops and weedy plant taxa will be analyzed to&lt;br/&gt;elucidate the timing and character of Formative period agricultural&lt;br/&gt;intensification.  AMS dating of carbonized plant remains will allow precise&lt;br/&gt;comparison of agricultural change with documented climatic and socio-political&lt;br/&gt;changes.  This integrative approach will permit Bruno to clarify the role of&lt;br/&gt;agricultural intensification in the development of the Taraco Peninsula Polity,&lt;br/&gt;as well as contribute to more general anthropological theories of agricultural&lt;br/&gt;intensification and the emergence of complex societies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
