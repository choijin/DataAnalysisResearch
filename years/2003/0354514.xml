<AbstractNarration>This grant provides support to enable students to participate in the 2004 NUMIFORM conference, which will be held at the Ohio State University, June 13-17.  The conference, which rotates between the U.S., Europe and Japan, and which is held every three years, brings together researchers in the field of industrial forming processes to discuss recent advances and future directions in the modeling of materials and manufacturing processes.  The conference emphasizes traditional processing of metals and polymers, and will include advanced materials and emerging manufacturing approaches at different scales.  Topics will include bulk and sheet forming, superplastic forming, casting, molding, quenching, materials joining and powder forming, machining, thermal mechanical processing, chemical processing, polymer processing, surface treatment, food processing, composite manufacturing and reactive liquid molding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will enable the participation of about 20 students, and will provide them with an enhanced educational experience, and give them a chance to meet the top researchers in their chosen field.  The topical areas of this conference are vital to the economic health of the nation, and include areas where it is important to maintain a skilled workforce.</AbstractNarration>
