<AbstractNarration>This project will create a digital audio archive that will enable&lt;br/&gt;scientists in several fields to approach novel research issues in speech and language&lt;br/&gt;studies, issues in group decision-making, and issues at the leading edge of&lt;br/&gt;human communication scholarship.  The Supreme Court of the United States&lt;br/&gt;(SCOTUS) has been recording its public proceedings since 3 October 1955.&lt;br/&gt;These recordings - now in the National Archives - span nearly five decades&lt;br/&gt;and consist principally of oral arguments in which justices and attorneys&lt;br/&gt;engage in various forms of persuasion and communication between bench and&lt;br/&gt;bar and, obliquely, among the justices themselves. The arguments have been&lt;br/&gt;transcribed professionally across the entire period, creating a matchless&lt;br/&gt;collection of audio materials coupled with highly accurate transcripts. The&lt;br/&gt;audio - along with other activities captured on audio such as the&lt;br/&gt;announcement of opinions - offers a unique opportunity for researchers&lt;br/&gt;across a wide spectrum of disciplines to engage in novel and transforming&lt;br/&gt;research projects that were once thought beyond the reach of investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chief result of this work will be a complete and continuing archive of&lt;br/&gt;more than six thousand hours of SCOTUS audio.  It will provide synchronized&lt;br/&gt;(i.e., time-coded) transcripts of the collection, identify and tag&lt;br/&gt;individual speakers, build new mark-up tools for these new domains, and&lt;br/&gt;share the corpus with researchers and faculty. The result of this&lt;br/&gt;interaction among political scientists, legal scholars, linguists, and&lt;br/&gt;computer scientists will yield: new knowledge in the modeling of&lt;br/&gt;multi-party discussions with complex goals, novel strategies in small group decision&lt;br/&gt;process analysis, and path-breaking approaches to extended collaborative&lt;br/&gt;commentary addressing the dynamics of human communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SCOTUS archive will be maintained as a shared public resource to&lt;br/&gt;enhance study and understanding of the Supreme Court of the United States. It will&lt;br/&gt;be available to anyone with World Wide Web access. Based on past&lt;br/&gt;experience, principal audiences include: researchers across diverse domains, teachers&lt;br/&gt;and students, lawyers and litigants, and the visually- and&lt;br/&gt;hearing-impaired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, more than a million unique users access selected SCOTUS materials&lt;br/&gt;each month. With a complete and updated SCOTUS archive and improved ability&lt;br/&gt;to query and search, the number of users should expand substantially.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By exploiting common interest and beneficial interactions among diverse&lt;br/&gt;research communities, this project will create a vast collection of digital&lt;br/&gt;objects. Working with partners experienced in data-sharing, the effort aims&lt;br/&gt;at revolutionizing the ability to collaborate with physically distributed&lt;br/&gt;teams of researchers and their students.</AbstractNarration>
