<AbstractNarration>NSF ELECTRICAL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS (ECS) WORKSHOP ON WIRELESS&lt;br/&gt;NETWORKED SENSOR SYSTEMS: PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Wireless sensor network technology has expanded from its origins of over a decade ago to now&lt;br/&gt;include many new communities in both research and applications. New technology requirements&lt;br/&gt;have rapidly appeared along with many new applications. For example, whereas early sensors&lt;br/&gt;focused on seismic and acoustic sensing channels for event detection, the new applications in natural&lt;br/&gt;and urban environmental sensing now require new sensing channels for example, multispectral&lt;br/&gt;imaging for detailed understanding of phenomena and chemical sensing for detection of biological&lt;br/&gt;pathogens in water resources. Also, as applications have evolved, the requirements for precision&lt;br/&gt;have increased as well. Further, new applications may emerge in the future where bounded response&lt;br/&gt;time and distributed control present their requirements. While these new applications appear, the&lt;br/&gt;long standing problems of scarce energy resources and unreliable, energy-intensive wireless&lt;br/&gt;communication remain as challenges.&lt;br/&gt;A broad set of research can be developed opportunities for addressing these new requirements.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the Electrical and Communications Systems (ECS) Division of the NSF can contribute&lt;br/&gt;to a vision of joint development of hardware and software architectures that uniformly consider&lt;br/&gt;sensing, signal processing, event detection, computing, and networking. This research can consider&lt;br/&gt;the unique areas of ECS expertise, for example in the development of jointly optimized hardware&lt;br/&gt;and software architectures, sensor systems, communication systems, and distributed, real-time&lt;br/&gt;control methods.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal describes an NSF Electrical and Communications Systems (ECS) Workshop on&lt;br/&gt;Wireless Networked Sensor Systems. This is intended to engage Grantees of the ECS Division as&lt;br/&gt;well as others to explore the new ECS opportunities, develop a series of new program concepts, and&lt;br/&gt;ultimately create new research avenues on urgent ECS problems. The topics of this workshop will&lt;br/&gt;include the examples of 1) Decentralized Detection and Control with Wireless Sensor Networks, 2)&lt;br/&gt;Wireless Sensor Node and System Energy Barriers and Solution Pathways, 3) Energy-Aware&lt;br/&gt;Networked Sensor and Instrument Systems, 4) Energy-Aware, Wireless Sensor Specific Hardware&lt;br/&gt;and Software Architectures, and others to be developed.&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop is proposed to take place over a two-day period in August 2003, and engage at&lt;br/&gt;least 50 investigators. The Workshop schedule will include brief orientation/discussion periods&lt;br/&gt;along with breakout sessions that are intended to not only produce guiding summary documents,&lt;br/&gt;but to also promote the development of this new community.&lt;br/&gt;Broad Societal Impacts: The wireless sensor research area has promising impact in science and&lt;br/&gt;engineering disciplines including natural environmental science and environmental engineering,&lt;br/&gt;industrial automation, physical security for homeland defense, and healthcare technology. Many&lt;br/&gt;new challenges are rapidly appearing that must be solved to support the wireless sensor network&lt;br/&gt;vision. This Workshop will provide guidance at many levels for the development of new&lt;br/&gt;innovations and research pathways that will have broad impact.&lt;br/&gt;Broad Education Impacts: Wireless sensor research has already demonstrated broad impact in&lt;br/&gt;education through the development of new courses and the direct benefits of engaging&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate student researchers with inherently multidisciplinary research programs.&lt;br/&gt;This Workshop will create a set of new such opportunities specifically in the ECS area, thus&lt;br/&gt;broadening the opportunities for identifying vital undergraduate and graduate student thesis research&lt;br/&gt;objectives and programs. Workshop results will be immediately valuable for student researchers and&lt;br/&gt;their advisors.</AbstractNarration>
