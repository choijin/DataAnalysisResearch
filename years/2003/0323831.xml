<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ilisagvik College of Barrow, Alaska is the lead college in the Consortium for Alaska Native &lt;br/&gt;Higher Education, Inc. (CANHE), a group of six developing tribally-controlled colleges which &lt;br/&gt;were established because Alaska Natives have not achieved proportionate success in higher &lt;br/&gt;education despite years of effort by mainstream institutions.  Alaska Natives are particularly &lt;br/&gt;poorly represented in STEM programs and in related professions. Research resulting from a &lt;br/&gt;TCUP planning grant in 2002 that clarified the extent of the problem, and lessons learned from &lt;br/&gt;the Alaska Rural Systemic Initiative, form the basis for CANHE.s .Strategic Plan for Tribal &lt;br/&gt;Colleges in Alaska.. CANHE institutions will implement the plan, which includes special efforts &lt;br/&gt;in STEM fields, including this .Mending the Net. project.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project.s intellectual merit has two fronts.  First, there are new certificate and degree &lt;br/&gt;programs which incorporate STEM field learning into training that meets the needs of natural &lt;br/&gt;resource development industries. That this learning, for three of the four CANHE institutions, &lt;br/&gt;explicitly blends indigenous knowledge with western science to gain a two-perspectives &lt;br/&gt;understanding of the natural environment, makes the project interesting. That the training &lt;br/&gt;qualifies Alaska Natives for needed employment in economically viable technical industries, &lt;br/&gt;makes the project both practical and critical.  Second, the project uses regional differences as a &lt;br/&gt;strength. The .one size fits all. approach of most colleges and universities fails to employ &lt;br/&gt;different instructional techniques pertaining to STEM fields appropriate to each region.   &lt;br/&gt;.Mending the Net. introduces placed-based STEM programs.  Ilisagvik College, for instance, &lt;br/&gt;applies local people.s knowledge of the Arctic in an applied science program leading to &lt;br/&gt;employment in land management and wildlife biology.   The Interior Athabascan Tribal College &lt;br/&gt;program, on the other hand, includes Native knowledge of the boreal forestry. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project.s broadest impacts include that because the grant recipient and other CANHE &lt;br/&gt;members are tribally-controlled institutions, almost all students involved are Native &lt;br/&gt;American/Alaska Natives . vastly underrepresented ion STEM fields.  CANHE is a statewide &lt;br/&gt;organization with connecting networks to Alaska.s 100,000+ Native peoples. Two of the &lt;br/&gt;programs coordinate closely with school districts and will develop program templates for &lt;br/&gt;CANHE-district collaborations in other regions.  A third program partners with the University of &lt;br/&gt;Alaska and includes faculty development trainings that can be replicated throughout the UA &lt;br/&gt;System by the three UA Affiliate Members of CANHE.  On the industry side, the Bristol Bay &lt;br/&gt;Native Association program expands the infrastructure for web-based course delivery to villages &lt;br/&gt;in preparation for internships and possible employment with VECO, Inc., a primary contractor &lt;br/&gt;on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Some project results, like new academic programs and their curricula, will be available on CDs &lt;br/&gt;and the web.  Others, like .best practices. in STEM teaching and learning for Native students, &lt;br/&gt;will be shared through conference presentations of Native and other educators.  Yet other results, &lt;br/&gt;like the availability of STEM-trained Native interns in wildlife biology, forestry and fisheries, &lt;br/&gt;will be widely publicized, and discussed at industry-related conferences and in the halls of &lt;br/&gt;collaborating organizations like the Barrow Arctic Science Consortium.</AbstractNarration>
