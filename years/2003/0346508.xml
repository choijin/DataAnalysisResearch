<AbstractNarration>This SGER-ACT project (see below) will pursue design and development of a new generation of high-sensitivity infrared sensors whose critical component is a tunable high power narrow-band infrared source.  The infrared source is based on the sharp absorption features of surface plasmons in a two-dimensional metallic photonic lattice, which resides on a silicon carbide substrate.  Use of silicon carbide instead of silicon should allow higher operating temperatures, greater optical output, and increased device sensitivity.  The performance of the optical lattice will be simulated at Iowa State University.  These simulations will permit exploration of many structural designs including change of lattice symmetry.  In addition to addressing a number of fundamental physics (plasmon thermal emission) and optics issues (role of the photonic crystal), this work will guide the fabrication of test devices, to be fabricated by the industrial partner, Ion Optics (Waltham, MA).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work aims to develop sensitive, accurate, field-deployable, lightweight sensors for detection of several chemical warfare agents of national importance in the battle against terrorism.  The project will also have a strong impact on integrating research and education through training of graduate students and postdoctoral scientists in methods for enhancing national security.  The NSF and the Intelligence Community support this award jointly.  It is made as part of the Approaches to Combat Terrorism (ACT) Program in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences.  This program supports new concepts in basic research and workforce development with the potential to contribute to national security&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
