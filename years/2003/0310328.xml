Silver&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Savannah State University (SSU) will implement a five-year comprehensive approach to strengthen the institution's undergraduate science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and research infrastructure. The University will use a combination of NSF and intramural resources to increase STEM enrollment, attain a STEM undergraduate student retention rate of 80% and transition 30% of STEM graduates to graduate study. The project will cut across biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, engineering and technology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Physical infrastructure improvements and expansions will accommodate new STEM programs and improve the quality of instructional delivery in existing STEM programs.  Project objectives include the following:&lt;br/&gt;STEM graduation rate will increase to 40% by 2008&lt;br/&gt;30% of STEM graduates will pursue graduate study by 2008&lt;br/&gt;80% of STEM graduate students will complete their graduate degrees&lt;br/&gt;STEM student enrollment at SSU will increase by 20% annually&lt;br/&gt;STEM retention through graduation will be no less than 80%&lt;br/&gt;40% of computer science, electronics engineering technology and electrical engineering students will be Yamacraw certified by 2008&lt;br/&gt;Equal number of GTREP students will graduate from SSU campus as from the other two GTREP satellite campuses by 2008; and 80% of STEM graduates will join the STEM workforce by 2008.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
