<AbstractNarration>The sizes of problems that need to be solved in modern applications&lt;br/&gt;have grown enormously.  Sampling to draw a (small) subset of the data&lt;br/&gt;to store in main memory and process in detail is thus a natural&lt;br/&gt;alternative to computing on the entire data.&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses the questions of how well the answers from a&lt;br/&gt;sample approximates answers to the full problem for many optimization&lt;br/&gt;problems that go under the name of Constraint Satisfaction Problems. &lt;br/&gt;The project also considers problems where the input data consists of&lt;br/&gt;matrices or higher dimensional arrays. Here adaptive sampling (where&lt;br/&gt;the probability of sampling a piece of the data depends on its&lt;br/&gt;relative importance) has been successfully used by the PI and others&lt;br/&gt;recently. The existing results are to be improved.  Adaptive sampling&lt;br/&gt;calls for making more than one pass through the data. The project will&lt;br/&gt;study models of computation, where the number of passes is measured as&lt;br/&gt;an important resource.  This is expected to contribute to the&lt;br/&gt;discussion of models to handle large data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A third part of the proposal is to continue the &lt;br/&gt;PI's study of rapidly mixing Markov Chains, both&lt;br/&gt;by developing new general techniques and applying to&lt;br/&gt;specific problems like the computation of volumes of&lt;br/&gt;convex sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  The research is expected to have broad&lt;br/&gt;impact since the processing of massive data via sampling is of&lt;br/&gt;enormous importance in modern computing. The&lt;br/&gt;PI teaches specialized courses at Yale and &lt;br/&gt;hopes to disseminate the results of&lt;br/&gt;the research to students through the courses.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
