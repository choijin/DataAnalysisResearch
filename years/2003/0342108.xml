<AbstractNarration>The current capability of neuroscience to monitor and alter brain function has profound ethical implications, which scientists and the public have only begun to examine.  Two recent major conferences were devoted to surveying the ethical implications of progress in neuroscience, one at the University of Pennsylvania entitled "Ethics and the Cognitive Neuroscience Revolution" and one at Stanford University entitled "Neuroethics: Mapping the Field."  These conferences promoted the dissemination of ideas among individuals and the wider public. The current series of workshops will take the next step, in the form of intensive dialogue among relevant experts that will give form and direction to the field of neuroethics. Specifically, the meetings are designed to accomplish the following objectives: (1) Define issues of highest priority for neuroethics; (2) Elucidate scientific progress and obstacles; (3) Engage ethicists and policy specialists in the areas most relevant to each particular issue, to help understand the most directly relevant moral principles and social traditions, relevant regulations or policies now in place, and analogous precedents in other fields; (4) With the relevant scientists and ethicists, collaboratively develop policy positions on each issue; and (5) For each issue, write and submit an article summarizing the major conclusions for publication in a widely read or generalist journal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
