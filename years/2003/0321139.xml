<AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Knox College under the direction of Dr.&lt;br/&gt;Janet Kirkley to acquire a real-time thermal cycler and fluorometer.  This&lt;br/&gt;equipment will enable Knox College faculty and students to perform quantitative&lt;br/&gt;polymerase chain reaction (QPCR).  This technique has a wide variety of&lt;br/&gt;applications, and access to QPCR will enhance undergraduate research,&lt;br/&gt;education, and training.  Because of the ease and speed of QPCR, students will&lt;br/&gt;be able to answer more sophisticated questions directed at understanding how&lt;br/&gt;cells function at the molecular level.  This equipment will replace older, more&lt;br/&gt;time-intensive methods as well as provide new research capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This equipment will be used by undergraduate student researchers and&lt;br/&gt;their faculty mentors to: 1) study how temperature regulates the activation of&lt;br/&gt;macrophage cells, which promote inflammation; 2) investigate the role of the&lt;br/&gt;protein intersectin in the development of the frog Xenopus laevis; and, 3)&lt;br/&gt;address structure-function relationships in the bacterial GrpE protein.&lt;br/&gt;Students will use this equipment in the context of ongoing research projects.&lt;br/&gt;Other techniques can be developed using the real-time capability of the thermal&lt;br/&gt;cycler, and Knox faculty and students will be encouraged to incorporate use of&lt;br/&gt;this versatile equipment in their research programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This equipment will substantially enhance undergraduate research and&lt;br/&gt;education at Knox College.  It will allow students to explore complex molecular&lt;br/&gt;events in cells, leading to a greater understanding of the molecular processes&lt;br/&gt;necessary to sustain life.  Preparation for careers in science will also be&lt;br/&gt;enhanced by students acquiring skills in QPCR, a valuable, cutting edge, widely&lt;br/&gt;applicable technique.</AbstractNarration>
