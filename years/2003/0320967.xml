<AbstractNarration>Two radio spectrometers with frequency coverage from 10 to 800 MHz will be constructed and deployed at the National Radio Quite Zone in Green Bank, WV.  This effort, (i) develops a basic research tool in solar radio astrophysics for use by the wider community, (ii) remedies the lack of an important component of the United States National Space Weather Program: the need for readily available low-frequency, broadband, radio dynamic spectra in western longitudes, and (iii) provides a platform for research and development work on broadband antennas, feeds, and receivers operating from decimeter to decameter wavelengths.  This program has important applications for instrument upgrades as well as future generations of instruments such as the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) and the Frequency Agile Solar Radiotelescope (FASR).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Green Bank Solar Radio Burst Spectrometer (GB/SRBS) is a an instrument designed to perform dynamic spectroscopy of energetic phenomena on the Sun at radio wavelengths. That is, it measures a record of the Sun's radio intensity from 10 MHz (30 m wavelength) to 1050 MHz (30 cm wavelength) once every second. Transient enegetic phenomena on the Sun such as flares and coronal mass ejections produce radio burst corresponding to distinct physical phenomena that produce unique radio signatures in radio dynamic spectra.
