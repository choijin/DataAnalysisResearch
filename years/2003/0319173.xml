    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will increase accumulation of nutritional compounds in plants through overexpression of membrane transporters. Plants are the source of a wide range of natural metabolites important to human nutrition including vitamins, antioxidants, and fatty acids. However these compounds are often produced at exceedingly low concentrations, making cost-efficient extraction extremely difficult. Specialized proteins called ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters mediate movement of these metabolites across membranes for accumulation in storage organelles, such as the plant vacuole. Prior research has shown that overexpression of membrane transporters in crop species can dramatically increase accumulation of specific metabolites. In this Phase I project, ABC protein transport function will be further characterized and applied to improving the efficiency and yield of plant-based nutraceutical production. &lt;br/&gt; The commercial application of this project is in the area of agricultural biotechnology. The use of ABC transporter technology is expected to lead to production of transgenic crop varieties with increased levels of specific carotenoids, unsaturated fatty acids and plant sterols.</AbstractNarration>
