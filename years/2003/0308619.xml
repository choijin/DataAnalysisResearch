<AbstractNarration>This research will advance the state-of-the-art of carbon nanotube-based materials for applications in heterogeneous catalysis.  Carbon nanotubes are a novel material with unusual structural, electronic, mechanical and chemical&lt;br/&gt;properties.  The researchers have developed a unique capability to produce sizeable quantities of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) with controlled structure (diameter and length).  The project will capitalize on this capability&lt;br/&gt;by focusing on the design of unique molecular sieve supports for&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous catalysts, which would have the following characteristics:&lt;br/&gt;large diameter compared to typical zeolites, adjustable channel length, and&lt;br/&gt;chemical inertness. There is also the possibility of adjusting the support's acidity&lt;br/&gt;density, one-dimensionality, and enhanced molecular diffusivity.  To reach&lt;br/&gt;this goal, the SWNT diameters will be adjusted by modifying the synthesis&lt;br/&gt;reaction temperature and by selectively removing small diameter nanotubes by&lt;br/&gt;preferential oxidation.  Heterogeneous catalysts will then be synthesized with varying metal and acidity contents and tested for two reactions of great industrial importance.  These are the aromatization of alkanes and the hydrogenation of aromatics in the presence of sulfur.  Environmental concerns about aromatics have resulted in regulation that limit their handling and transportation as well as their content in diesel fuels and gasolines.  The two processes to be investigated play an important part in minimizing the environmental impact of handling aromatics and diesel fuels.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to broaden the impact of the research activities, undergraduate students,&lt;br/&gt;high-school teachers and selected high school students will participate in&lt;br/&gt;the project.  In collaboration with the American Indian Student Association,&lt;br/&gt;minority Engineering students will be selected to join the research program. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
