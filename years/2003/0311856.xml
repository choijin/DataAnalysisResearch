<AbstractNarration>Bertram&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator and his colleagues study the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cells.  These cells display a&lt;br/&gt;wide range of complex dynamics that are best understood with the&lt;br/&gt;aid of mathematical modeling and analysis.  The investigator has&lt;br/&gt;recently developed a new mathematical model for beta-cells that&lt;br/&gt;postulates an intracellular calcium subspace compartment located&lt;br/&gt;between the endoplasmic reticulum and the cell membrane.  This&lt;br/&gt;model is based on recent data from a collaborating lab, and is&lt;br/&gt;being further developed as new experiments are performed.  One&lt;br/&gt;direction of development involves the investigation of complex&lt;br/&gt;electrical bursting patterns that are often observed in&lt;br/&gt;pancreatic islets and isolated beta-cells.  The investigator&lt;br/&gt;determines, through mathematical modeling, whether these complex&lt;br/&gt;rhythms are due to oscillations in glycolysis -- that is, whether&lt;br/&gt;the coexistence of a membrane-driven bursting oscillator and an&lt;br/&gt;endogenous glycolytic oscillator is consistent with the published&lt;br/&gt;data, and with data from collaborating labs.  One key question&lt;br/&gt;that is addressed is whether these oscillators involving&lt;br/&gt;glycolytic rhythms can be synchronized by electrical coupling.&lt;br/&gt;This is a necessary condition since beta-cells are electrically&lt;br/&gt;coupled in islets.  Finally, the effects of stochasticity through&lt;br/&gt;channel noise are investigated in both single-cell and islet&lt;br/&gt;models.  Channel noise is evident in the electrical patterns of&lt;br/&gt;single beta-cells, and suppression of this noise through&lt;br/&gt;elecrical coupling may play a key role in the more regular and&lt;br/&gt;slower bursting patterns observed in islets.&lt;br/&gt;     The study of pancreatic islets, composed of beta-cells, is&lt;br/&gt;important for a number of reasons.  From a clinical viewpoint,&lt;br/&gt;they are key players in normal glucose homeostasis.  Because&lt;br/&gt;beta-cells are the only cells in the body that make and secrete&lt;br/&gt;insulin, their malfunction leads to type II or late-onset&lt;br/&gt;diabetes, the most prevalent form of the disease.  To understand&lt;br/&gt;what makes the cells malfunction, one must first understand their&lt;br/&gt;normal functioning, which is the primary aim of this work.  From a&lt;br/&gt;biological viewpoint, beta-cells are of great interest as the&lt;br/&gt;focal point of a number of biochemical and cellular processes.&lt;br/&gt;They are similar in many ways to neurons, but have more complex&lt;br/&gt;biochemical regulatory mechanisms.  Thus, information gained from&lt;br/&gt;the study of beta-cells largely transfers over to neurons, as&lt;br/&gt;well as other secretory cells.  Finally, from a mathematical&lt;br/&gt;viewpoint, beta-cells display rich dynamics that can only truly&lt;br/&gt;be understood with the aid of mathematics.  Modeling and anlysis&lt;br/&gt;of beta-cells has led to new mathematics, most of which can and&lt;br/&gt;is being applied to the study of other bursting nerve and&lt;br/&gt;endocrine cells.  The investigator involves graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students in the project, providing them with&lt;br/&gt;research opportunities at the important interface between&lt;br/&gt;biological and mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
