<AbstractNarration>"ABSTRACT"&lt;br/&gt;DUE-0340889&lt;br/&gt;Development of a Finite Element Method Learning Environment for Undergraduates&lt;br/&gt;Worcester Polytechnic Institute&lt;br/&gt;Joseph Rencis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engineering-NEC (59)  This CCLI-EMD proof-of-concept project is designing and developing a prototype open access finite element method learning (FEML)environment.  Educational outcomes for FEML are based upon the criteria recommended by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The materials being created include one full-scale engineering case study in structural engineering and one mini-scale engineering case study. Both case studies use a holistic approach so that students will gain an understanding of the limitations of finite analysis methods. The e-learning objects being designed will support synchronous and asynchronous e-learning environments. The modules target students in mechanical, civil, aerospace and nuclear engineering programs. The project incorporates a full evaluation plan to determine the effectiveness of the curriculum as it is piloted in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. A faculty development and teacher preparation component provides faculty with an understanding of how to effectively use this methodology to create learner centered e-learning objects, and how to deliver the technology by creating and developing rich e-learning environments. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project is adapting Extensible Markup Language to conform to the IMS/SCORM specifications for e-learning to create the e-content for the e-learning objects. The e-learning objects being developed conform to national and international standards for e-learning in order for the material to become part of the National Science Digital Library through the projects website.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
