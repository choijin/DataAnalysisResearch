<AbstractNarration>The Gender and Diversities Institute at Education Development Center, Inc. is developing and maintaining a science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) career development digital library - CaREN, l. or the Career Resources Education Network for STEM- targeted toward engaging middle and early high school students. The resources and, the user services and interface place particular emphasis on the needs and interests of currently underrepresented populations in STEM education and careers, including females, students of color, and youth with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is achieving its goals to: create and sustain an easily accessible, comprehensive career development resource that is inviting and engaging of diverse populations of middle and early high school students, and that builds on their&lt;br/&gt;diverse points of entry and interest, and draws them into an easily navigable range of career exploration options and resources in the STEM field. &lt;br/&gt;Among the project's activities are: 1) the design and development of the CaREN digital library based on development of the Gender and Science Digital Library; 2) the use of current research on effectively accessing and using digital resources; and, 3) utilization of national surveys and focus groups in determining how different populations of middle school students perceive their career development needs, ways that a digital library could help them, and the key components of an engaging design. &lt;br/&gt;CaREN's focus on underrepresented populations is serving to expose more students to STEM career options, thereby increasing their flow into the study of STEM subjects at the high school and college levels.</AbstractNarration>
