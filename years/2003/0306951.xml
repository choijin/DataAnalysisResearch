<AbstractNarration>This individual investigator award supports an experimental research project involving the fabrication of novel electronic devices to investigate new phenomena in mesoscopic charge transport physics.  The experiments will focus on three major thrusts: (1) Charge Shuttle Transport; (2) Crossed Andreev Reflection; and (3) Nanoscale Superconducting Array Devices.  The first objective is to extend ongoing experimental investigations of charge shuttle transport.  The recently identified phenomenon of electromechanical charge shuttling is expected to impact a variety of applications, including: nanodevices, microelectromechanical (MEMS) devices, and biomolecular sensors. To further understand this phenomenon, experiments will be carried out on devices made using chemical molecular recognition at the nanometer scale and micromachining techniques at the micrometer scale. To experimentally investigate crossed Andreev reflection, multiprobe superconducting-ferromagnetic interface devices will be fabricated using electron-beam lithography. These experiments will directly probe the non-local entangled wavefunctions involved in Andreev reflection charge transport. Using ferromagnetic electrodes, the crossed Andreev reflection current can be switched on and off via spin-polarization effects resulting in extraordinarily large magnetoresistive changes. The experiments will contribute to the fundamental understanding of spintronics and devices using quantum coherence.  Lastly, a new generation of nanoscale superconducting arrays will be investigated. This work exploits the use of self-assembled nanoporous polymer templates combined with electrodeposition for integrated nanolithography. The electrical properties of arrays of 10 nm scale superconducting nanowires will be investigated as a coupled superconducting array system. Educational contributions will be made in the form of digital-video-based research training tutorials, advanced courses in the research area, interdisciplinary research meetings, and research opportunities to undergraduates.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator award supports an experimental research project exploring the properties of new electronic devices that advance the development nanotechnology and sensor technology.  The experiments will focus on three major thrusts: (1) Charge Shuttle Transport; (2) Crossed Andreev Reflection; and (3) Nanoscale Superconducting Array Devices. The project takes unique advantage of new nanofabrication research techniques developed at UMass Amherst and facilitated through prior NSF support. The first experimental objective involves charge shuttle transport in which electrical charge is transported between two electrodes by a moving "shuttle" particle. The recently identified phenomenon of electromechanical charge shuttling is expected to impact a variety of electronic and sensor applications. The second topic involves devices fabricated using electron-beam lithography for experimental investigations of crossed Andreev reflection. These experiments will contribute to the fundamental understanding of spin-electronics and devices with quantum coherence.  Lastly, a new generation of nanoscale superconducting array devices will be fabricated using self-assembled nanoporous polymer templates combined with electrodeposition. Educational contributions will be made in the form of digital-video-based research training tutorials, advanced courses in the research area, interdisciplinary research meetings, and research opportunities to undergraduates.  Students will gain knowledge and skills that will be of use to future research and/or technological careers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
