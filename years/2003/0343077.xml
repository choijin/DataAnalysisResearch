    <AbstractNarration>This planning grant to the University of New Haven seeks to restructure the undergraduate engineering education program. The goal of the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) at the University of New Haven (UNH) is to transform its engineering programs to educate students who will better meet the needs of industry and society. The focus of the curriculum reform efforts is to foster interdepartmental cooperation and introduce innovative approaches to our faculty and students, while keeping up with industry demands. The challenge for the faculty is to develop the desirable new attributes while preserving the essential content and best features of the traditional programs. This can be done by coordinating the development of essential skills early in the programs in parallel with a spiral approach for building fundamental engineering concepts. By using active and cooperative learning methods and continuous assessment of new pedagogical techniques, the proposed spiral approach will allow for a more efficient process of developing conceptual understanding. Constant feedback on teaching will lead to continual improvement.</AbstractNarration>
