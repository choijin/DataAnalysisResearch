    <AbstractNarration>This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports research by Gerard F. R. Parkin of the Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, on the synthesis of novel main group compounds. The s- and p-block compounds prepared will feature currently unknown functionalities, such as zinc complexes that bear terminal chalcogenido ligands and gallium complexes with terminal pnictide ligands. Molecules of this type are unknown and are of intrinsic fundamental interest in view of possible terminal-ligand to metal multiple bonding. The syntheses of these complexes will rely upon the use of ligands constructed so as to stabilize the functionalities under investigation. These include various tris-(pyrazolyl)borate and bis- and tris-(mercaptoimidazolyl)hydroborate ligands, C3-symmetric tridentate ligands based on a benzene platform, atranes ligands, terphenoxide ligands, and pyrrolyl ligands. Specific attention will be given to complexes that have novel structures but have a compositional relationship to the materials that have already found industrial applications&lt;br/&gt;The main group elements have a variety of important applications in synthetic chemistry, solid state materials, and catalytic reactions. This project aims at understanding some of the unusual bonding and structural properties of some of the heavier members of the s- and p-block of the periodic table. Understanding of zinc and gallium bonding to terminal ligands may provide some insight into gas phase routes to materials. The project will involve undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students. The PI and his students will be involved in outreach to local schools.</AbstractNarration>
