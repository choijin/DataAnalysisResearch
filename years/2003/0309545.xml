    <AbstractNarration>This award provides partial funding to support a meeting entitled "Eukaryotic mRNA Processing", to be held at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory August 20-24, 2003. This meeting will be the fourth biennial conference in this series. There will be about 300 participants. The focus will continue to be on mRNA splicing and poly-adenylation, but, in line with recent developments, increasing attention will be paid to RNA transport, the impact of the history of a mRNA molecule on its fate (as in nonsense-mediated decay), RNAi, and genomic approaches. The organizers have taken care to ensure the participation of students, young investigators, and underrepresented minorities. Rather than having a pre-determined list of invited speakers, all presentations will be selected entirely on the basis of abstracts submitted. It is expected that, as in previous years, most of the talks will be given by graduate students, post-docs and young independent investigators.</AbstractNarration>
