<AbstractNarration>DMS-0305825&lt;br/&gt;Michael G. Sullivan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much progress has been made in symplectic geometry, and more &lt;br/&gt;recently contact geometry, since the discovery&lt;br/&gt;of holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;Sullivan plans to continue calculating and applying &lt;br/&gt;two sets of invariants based on these curves:&lt;br/&gt;the contact homology of Legendrian submanifolds&lt;br/&gt;in contact manifolds and the periodic Floer homology of&lt;br/&gt;Riemann surface diffeomorphisms.&lt;br/&gt;The former is a special case of symplectic field theory.&lt;br/&gt;Although symplectic field theory is still not rigorously&lt;br/&gt;well-defined, Sullivan and others have&lt;br/&gt;completed the foundational analysis for their&lt;br/&gt;version of contact homology.&lt;br/&gt;Sullivan will extend this alternative version of contact&lt;br/&gt;homology to other manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal is to develop a complete obstruction&lt;br/&gt;of Legendrian isotopy classes.&lt;br/&gt;The latter invariant is conjectured to agree with Seiberg-Witten-Floer &lt;br/&gt;homology. This project will develop the foundations&lt;br/&gt;of this theory, as well as broaden the existing set of computations.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator also hopes to work on applications of the periodic Floer&lt;br/&gt;homology computations, addressing the problems of existence&lt;br/&gt;and classification of symplectic structures on 4-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic and contact geometry explain the&lt;br/&gt;physics of certain dynamical systems, such as&lt;br/&gt;the orbits of planets around the sun, the spin of a top, or &lt;br/&gt;the motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field.&lt;br/&gt;Such systems obey the least action principal, which&lt;br/&gt;among other things can mean that their total energy&lt;br/&gt;or momentum must be conserved.&lt;br/&gt;Many symplectic geometers study holomorphic curves,&lt;br/&gt;a reinterpretation of the least action principal,&lt;br/&gt;which has linked together several independently well-developed&lt;br/&gt;mathematical fields such as complex analysis and differential topology.&lt;br/&gt;The study of holomorphic curves has led to other&lt;br/&gt;``physical" results, such as a generalization of &lt;br/&gt;Heisenberg's uncertainty principal.&lt;br/&gt;More recently, these curves are thought to appear in&lt;br/&gt;other areas of theoretical physics, like string theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
