<AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31) This project involves the evaluation and adaptation of hardware implementations and software architecture simulators for implementation in two courses, currently primarily software-based, in the Hope College computer science curriculum.  Adaptations of the use of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for the computer organization course are based on their use in an electrical engineering course at Bucknell University and in the Circuit Cookbook.  Previous work with the SimpleScalar computer architecture simulation system at the University of Virginia and the University of California at San Diego is being scaled down for use at the undergraduate level in Hope College's computer organization and computer architecture courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is that the implementation of these systems will provide students with more hands-on learning and faculty with visual demonstrations.  It is expected that the students' exposure to hardware and simulation environments, usually missing in undergraduate CS programs, will increase their understanding of hardware and software interactions.  Another outcome is the development of new class and lab materials. The broader impact includes the sharing of the materials and experiences from this grant with other institutions through papers at conferences and workshops and via access to web pages.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
