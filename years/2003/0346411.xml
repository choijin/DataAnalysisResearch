<AbstractNarration>The objectives of Louisiana's 2003-2006 Research Infrastructure Improvement proposal are to enhance Louisiana's R&amp;D competitiveness; to build partnerships among EPSCoR universities, national laboratories, and the private sector; and to recruit students, especially from underrepresented populations, into S&amp;E fields.  In order to accomplish these objectives, the proposed project will support research and educational activities that are not only of the highest intellectual quality, but also will have broad impact within the state of Louisiana.  &lt;br/&gt;The Center for Biological Modular Microsystems (CBM2), a research center of national eminence consisting of established scientists and engineering with state-of-the-arts facilities, will focus in the areas of Bio-MicroElectroMechanical Systems (BioMEMS).  Development of BioMEMS has been recognized as a crucial driver of advances in biotechnology, including DNA diagnostic and forensics.  CBM2 will pioneer the development of an array of micromanufacturing capabilities to build high-aspect-ratio microstructures that serve as masters to reliability and inexpensively fabricate multiscale parts (nm-mm).  These parts, made from a variety of different materials will be assembled into automated systems for applications in high throughput genomics-based research.  The center will constitute a hub for the highest quality research in BioMEMS bringing together multidisciplinary teams of science and engineering faculty from Louisiana State University (Louisiana's flagship university), the J. Bennett Johnston Center for Advanced Microstructures &amp; Devices, LSU Health Sciences Center, Tulane Health Sciences Center, and Xavier University (an HBCU).  The scientific program proposed will focus on manufacturing reliable and cost-effective high-performance devices, while at the same time increasing their functionality through integration using facilities located at the State-supported synchrotron source, the Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research and educational activities will be fully integrated to enhance faculty and graduate student recruiting, to take science to K-12 classrooms, to involve underrepresented students in educational and research opportunities, and to provide options for the State's R&amp;D faculty to expand their expertise and collaboration.  Examples of programs contributing directly to a broader impact are the Joint Faculty Appointments Program to establish competitive science and engineering research teams through faculty hires at its HBCU and research-extensive/intensive institutions; the Information Technology Infrastructure to establish twelve sites across the State providing 95% of Louisiana's active researchers an EPSCoR audio/video center within a 30-minute drive; Links with Industry and National Labs to establish alliances that will expand training opportunities for selected undergraduate/graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, including underrepresented populations; Mini-sabbaticals for Faculty, which will allow researchers to travel to federal agencies, visit research centers, and enhance their research and education programs; and professional development opportunities for K-12 science and mathematics teachers.  The proposed project will bring together the Louisiana academic strengths and resources to establish the pursued research and education infrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
