<AbstractNarration>The decline in the number of students interested in infrastructure management experienced in the last decade has been identified as one potential impediment for the development of this important sector.  Efficient and well-maintained infrastructure systems are essential for societal stability, economic growth, and sustainable competitiveness.  The objective of the Infrastructure Management Education and Research Workshop is to develop a plan to facilitate the strengthening of infrastructure management research and education by addressing this problem.  The strategic plan will identify: (1) areas of research focus, (2) possible causes for the decline in infrastructure management student enrollment, (3) strategies to increase the number of undergraduate and graduate students interested in infrastructure management, and (4) potential solutions for the impediments identified.  The meeting may also facilitate long-term collaborative efforts and networking among the participating scientists.  &lt;br/&gt;The long-term goal of the proposed initiative is to enhance infrastructure management practices through research and education.  The workshop is envisioned as a first step towards the establishment of long-term collaborative efforts that will have a broad impact by focusing on the following specific aims: (1) provide enhanced learning opportunities in the area of infrastructure management for both undergraduate and graduate students so that they may be motivated to pursue careers in the infrastructure area; (2) increase the number of students interested in infrastructure preservation and management; (3) perform research and scholarship activities that enhance human welfare by advancing the state of knowledge in infrastructure preservation, renovation, and management; and (4) establish a network of infrastructure management scientists, educators, and students who will promote the exchange of knowledge and ideas in this field.  These activities will contribute to the provision of a more reliable infrastructure at a lower cost, thus increasing the competitiveness of our industries and promoting sustainable development.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
