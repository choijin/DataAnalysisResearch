<AbstractNarration>0353727&lt;br/&gt;Casten&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Mexico workshop proposal will enable U.S. scientists to participate in an International Conference entitled, "Nuclear Physics Large and Small: Microscopic Studies of Collective Phenomena," to be held in Cocoyoc, Mexico, April 19-22, 2004. Funding will be used to support the attendance of graduate students and post-docs and one or two invited speakers from the U.S.  Organized by Dr. Richard Casten of Yale University and Drs. Roelof Bijker and Alejandro Frank of the Instituto de Ciencias Nucleares of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), the meeting aims to discuss and highlight a number of exciting recent developments in nuclear structure. Many of these developments are intimately connected with the work of Stuart Pittel of the Bartol Research Institute of the University of Delaware and the conference will serve to celebrate his distinguished career and his continuing and highly successful efforts to engage and collaborate with scientists worldwide, many from developing countries. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference will cover a wide variety of active topics in nuclear structure experiment and theory. Among these topics are microscopic models of nuclei, exotic nuclei and loosely bound many-body quantal systems, residual p-n and pairing interactions, and the robustness of magicity.  The advanced many-body aspects of such ideas have broad impact beyond nuclear physics into other areas of many-body physics that link femtophysics (nuclei), nanophysics, and mesoscopic physics.  The conference will bring together both Latin American and U.S. scientists and will encourage future collaborations among them, like the highly successful examples fostered by Pittel over many years. Special efforts to introduce topics to young scientists in attendance will be made and there will be an opportunity for them (and others) to present their work in a poster session.  Short summaries of these posters will be included in the conference proceedings to be published. This meeting is being jointly supported by the Physics Division and the Office of International Science and Engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
