    <AbstractNarration>DMI-0340035&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project proposes to demonstrate a monolithic Wavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) Grating-Outcoupled Suface-Emitting semiconductor (GSE) laser emitting at 1310 nm using quantum-dot (QD) active layers. The QD active layers provide a broad gain bandwidth, reduced temperature sensitivity, narrower linewidths lower chirp compared to conventional quantum well lasers. In addition, QD active layers allow the use of low-cost GaAs substrates. Two-wavelength WDM GSE lasers in a cross-grating configuration emit at different wavelengths from a common aperture that can be efficiently coupled to a single mode fiber. The number of independently controlled wavelengths emitting from a single aperture can be extended to four (Phase II). The knowledge required to develop these lasers requires expertise in materials, optics, gratings, nanostructures, semiconductor processing, thermal transfer, high speed electronics, packaging, systems and telecommunications. Combining the desirable traits of both edge emitting lasers (high power, reliable material, low voltage, use of proven) and vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers (low cost, wafer level testing, simple packaging, high integration ability), the advanced research proposed is an innovative photonics technology that has broad applications in telecommunications, information processing, data communications, fiber to the business and home, instrumentation and computations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This technology would hope too lead to the eventual realization of very high data rates (5 Gbps up to 160 Gbps) at very low cost, and the elimination of barriers to deploying fiber to the desktop and to (or closer to) the home. This should also enable ultra high bandwidth connections for business and entertainment. This proposed project hope to provide an enhanced educational experience for students working on this research since it is performed in close collaboration with science and engineering department of a local university.</AbstractNarration>
