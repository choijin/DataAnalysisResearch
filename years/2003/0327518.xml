<AbstractNarration>Soils are the central organizing entities in terrestrial ecosystems and possess extremely diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic biota. They are physically and chemically complex as well, with micro- and macro-aggregates embedded within a solid-liquid and gaseous matrix that is continually changing in response to natural and human-induced perturbations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in molecular techniques in systematics provide opportunities for the study of biodiversity and biocomplexity of soil biota. The workshop as proposed builds on these opportunities to address soil biodiversity, focusing particularly on the application of molecular methods for its measurement. The workshop will include presentation of jointly authored papers, each followed by working groups led by Taiwanese and North American scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Taiwanese government will provide support for all Taiwanese participants and all local housing and per diem costs, transportation, etc., for the foreign participants.  NSF funding will be jointly provided by the Ecosystem Studies Program and the Office of International Programs, and will be applied to international travel costs for 10 senior and 5-6 junior (postdoctoral) participants from the United States. Also invited are a few colleagues from Canada and the Antipodes (Australia and New Zealand), who will provide their own travel funding.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
