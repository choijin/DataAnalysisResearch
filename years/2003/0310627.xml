<AbstractNarration>Undergraduate educators face important challenges in preparing diverse graduates for a technologically sophisticated and scientifically interdisciplinary community. Lake Forest College Biology Department is meeting this challenge with inquiry-based pedagogy that supports a diverse student-centered learning community. We expect students to develop scientific process and master content by progressing through increasingly sophisticated hypothesis-driven investigations that require collaborative research, critical thinking, and diverse forms of communication. Currently, both courses that anchor our cellular curriculum, introductory Cell Biology and advanced Molecular Genetics, feature DNA-based investigations. Other cellular-level technologies feature prominently in biomedical discoveries. Intellectual Merit: We are creating a more comprehensive cellular curriculum by redressing existing deficiencies in cell culture, microscopy and protein biochemistry. We are adding investigative experiments in these areas by restructuring introductory Cell Biology and adding two more advanced courses.  Inquiry-conducive experiments successful at the College of the Holy Cross that require quantitative microscopy of cells and tissues and biochemical analysis of proteins are being adapted and implemented. To implement these changes, instrumentation for cell culturing, histology, microscopy, and biochemical analysis is being acquired.  The introductory course incorporates investigations in cell culturing and protein characterization. Advanced course students are expanding their investigative independence and technical repertoire by developing&lt;br/&gt;hypotheses based on current literature and conducting investigations featuring cell culturing, histology, fluorescent microscopy, and protein biochemistry. These additions also support other courses and help establish interdisciplinary biochemistry and neuroscience majors. Broader Impact: We aim to graduate diverse individuals thoroughly trained to succeed in a variety of scientific careers, provide innovative K-12 outreach, and nationally disseminate innovations.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
