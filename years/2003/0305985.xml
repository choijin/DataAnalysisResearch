<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;The main theme of the proposed work is on understanding the widespread&lt;br/&gt;phenomenon of dynamic scaling in extended physical systems, building&lt;br/&gt;on stability analysis of coherent structures such as self-similar&lt;br/&gt;solutions, nonlinear wave pulses and vortices. The paradox of dynamic&lt;br/&gt;scaling laws is that typically they can be predicted by back of the&lt;br/&gt;envelope calculations, yet defy rigorous analysis for years.&lt;br/&gt;We will study scaling and stability in a variety of problems of high&lt;br/&gt;current interest: the trend to self-similar behavior in Smoluchowski's&lt;br/&gt;mean-field model of coagulation; scaling and stability of fingering&lt;br/&gt;patterns in viscous fluid flows; models of domain coarsening in phase&lt;br/&gt;transitions; existence and stability of solitary waves in&lt;br/&gt;infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems; and stability of Bose-Einstein condensates with vortices. The work will involve the development of improved methods for stability analysis in nonlinear systems, for the rigorous analysis and numerical computation of self-similar solutions and nonlinear waves, and for physical modeling of step-terrace structures on crystalline surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general aim of this work is to improve understanding of large-scale&lt;br/&gt;dynamic behavior in complex systems.  We aim to develop new and effective mathematical methods and concepts for the modeling and analysis of dynamic behavior in a variety of problems of high scientific interest. We study fundamental mathematical models for the large-scale dynamics of: agglomeration of small particles; mixing patterns in viscous fluid flow; microscopic structure of metallic alloys and semiconductor surfaces; waves on fluid interfaces; and quantum vortices in super-cold gases.  Many issues that will be investigated are of fundamental interest in condensed-matter physics, aerosol physics, chemical engineering, and materials science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
