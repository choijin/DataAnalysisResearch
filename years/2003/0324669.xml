    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The research is aimed at developing a novel cost-effective method for the production of&lt;br/&gt;high performance thin-sheet fabric-reinforced cement composites. Thin elements (about 10 mm thickness)&lt;br/&gt;represent a major category of cement-based composites and may be used as wall panels, exterior siding,&lt;br/&gt;tiles, roofing members, and pressure pipes. For such elements addition of reinforcement is essential in&lt;br/&gt;order to improve the tensile and flexural performance. The proposed fabric-cement systems have the&lt;br/&gt;potential to be used as structural load bearing members, thus competing with other board type materials&lt;br/&gt;such as wood, synthetics, or metals.&lt;br/&gt; The challenge in developing an industrial production method to produce&lt;br/&gt;thin sheet cement elements with fabrics is not only technological, but also scientific, as it is demonstrated&lt;br/&gt;that the production method can have substantial impact on the properties of the final product. To&lt;br/&gt;practically use fabric-cement composites, an industrial cost-effective production process such as the&lt;br/&gt;pultrusion process is proposed here. The main scientific goals of this research are: 1) development of the&lt;br/&gt;pultrusion processing for fabric reinforced cement composites, 2) development of cement mixtures with&lt;br/&gt;appropriate rheology for the process, and optimal mechanical performance, and 3) optimization of fabric&lt;br/&gt;materials and structure for various new and retrofit type products, and 4) development of theoretical&lt;br/&gt;approaches to help the designers with implementation, commercialization, and use of these materials.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual and&lt;br/&gt;educational components of this work will involve the interaction of two senior personnel with several&lt;br/&gt;students in a project that is addressed at an international level. The potential for developing new durable,&lt;br/&gt;strong, environmentally friendly, and economical, construction materials is a global challenge as we look&lt;br/&gt;at the diminishing energy and scarce natural resources. The promising combination of fabric&lt;br/&gt;reinforcement in cement composite products and the pultrusion process is expected to lead to an effective&lt;br/&gt;novel technique to produce a new class of high performance fabric-cement composite materials. Such&lt;br/&gt;breakthrough may open the way for a multitude of new products and applications. It will also address an&lt;br/&gt;economical means of retrofitting existing reinforced concrete structures and masonry walls. The short&lt;br/&gt;term objectives include the development of economical materials and processes to manufacture them. The&lt;br/&gt;long term objective of this project is to present to the engineering community an alternative building&lt;br/&gt;material fit for the 21st century.</AbstractNarration>
