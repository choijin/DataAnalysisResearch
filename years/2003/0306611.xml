<AbstractNarration>The aim of this proposal is to further develop the complexity &lt;br/&gt;theory of Linear Programming (LP), which continually plays a &lt;br/&gt;central role in complexity analysis.  In particular, we analyze the &lt;br/&gt;Markov Decision Problem (MDP) with n states and m actions &lt;br/&gt;for each state, a special class of real-number linear programs &lt;br/&gt;with the Leontief matrix structure.  The research objectives and &lt;br/&gt;activities include the following: 1) Develop a new class of &lt;br/&gt;algorithms, "combinatorial interior-point algorithms", for &lt;br/&gt;solving the MDP, with the best achievable complexity result and &lt;br/&gt;practical efficiency; and establish certain complexity lower &lt;br/&gt;bounds for the MDP, which may provide a "negative result" on &lt;br/&gt;the quest for whether or not there is a strongly polynomial time &lt;br/&gt;algorithm for LP.  2) Both undergraduate and graduate students &lt;br/&gt;will participate in the project, new course materials on the MDP &lt;br/&gt;will be produced, and the PI will also give presentations to the &lt;br/&gt;Stanford Summer Program for grades K-12 and community &lt;br/&gt;college students in the Bay Area. 3) Apply the new fast MDP &lt;br/&gt;algorithm to research activities in function areas such as Call &lt;br/&gt;Admission and Routing, Strategic Asset Allocation, Supply-&lt;br/&gt;Chain Management, Emissions Reductions, and Semiconductor &lt;br/&gt;Wafer Fabrication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the relentless research effort in LP algorithms, a linear &lt;br/&gt;program can be solved today one million times faster than it was &lt;br/&gt;done twenty years ago. Businesses, large and small, use linear &lt;br/&gt;programming models to optimize communication systems, to &lt;br/&gt;schedule transportation networks, to control inventories, to plan &lt;br/&gt;investments, and to maximize productivity.  Furthermore, LP &lt;br/&gt;has become a popular subject now taught in undergraduate, &lt;br/&gt;graduate, and MBA curriculums, advancing human knowledge &lt;br/&gt;and promoting scientific understanding. Recently, there has been &lt;br/&gt;a renewed and strong interest in the MDP (a special large-scale &lt;br/&gt;LP) due to its wide applications.  With the rising demand in &lt;br/&gt;telecommunication network resources, effective management is &lt;br/&gt;as important as ever. Call Admission (deciding which calls to &lt;br/&gt;accept/reject) and routing (allocating links in the network to &lt;br/&gt;particular calls) are examples of decisions that must be made at &lt;br/&gt;any point in time. The objective is to make the "best" use of &lt;br/&gt;limited network resources.  Such sequential decision problems &lt;br/&gt;can be addressed by a dynamic programming model and the &lt;br/&gt;MDP. Another application: the threat of global warming that &lt;br/&gt;may result from the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other &lt;br/&gt;"greenhouse gases" poses a serious dilemma.  In particular, cuts &lt;br/&gt;in emission levels bear a detrimental short-term impact on &lt;br/&gt;economic growth.  At the same time, a depleting environment &lt;br/&gt;can severely hurt the economy - especially the agricultural &lt;br/&gt;sector - in the longer term. To complicate the matter further, &lt;br/&gt;scientific evidence on the relationship between emission levels &lt;br/&gt;and global warming is inconclusive, leading to uncertainty about &lt;br/&gt;the benefits of various cuts. One systematic approach to &lt;br/&gt;considering these conflicting goals involves the formulation of a &lt;br/&gt;dynamic system and MDP model that describes our &lt;br/&gt;understanding of economic growth and environmental science, &lt;br/&gt;as is done by Nordhaus.  However, these MDP problems are too &lt;br/&gt;complex to be solved by the current MDP solvers.  A major &lt;br/&gt;objective of the project is to develop new Markov Decision &lt;br/&gt;Algorithms such that these models would be effectively &lt;br/&gt;analyzed to satisfaction.  Progress in the area of developing &lt;br/&gt;efficient algorithms for solving large-scale stochastic decision &lt;br/&gt;problems will be of great significance in improving industrial &lt;br/&gt;competitiveness, scientific understanding, and technology &lt;br/&gt;learning.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
