<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is the creation of new ultrafast tool servos, which are to be used in conjunction with precision diamond turning machines for the rapid production of surfaces with nanometer-scale resolution requirements. The approach to accomplishing this is to invent novel electromagnetic actuators based upon the variable reluctance principle. The project will develop techniques to avoid problems with actuator nonlinearities that have, until the present, prevented such actuators from being used with any significance in fast tool servos.  In association with the novel actuators, the project will study control algorithms that allow very high bandwidth, acceleration, and accuracy simultaneously.  These techniques will be experimentally proven in a precision diamond turning process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the project will have significant benefit to society by enabling more efficient production of nanosurfaces, and so impact industrial production of new classes of devices using these surfaces.  It will also facilitate transfer of novel enabling technology to suppliers of precision production machines, impact the teaching of courses by using the early fast tool servo prototypes, models, and experimental results as example problems and lab experiments, and facilitate training of undergraduate and graduate students with special attention to the attraction of members of underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
