<AbstractNarration>The overall goal of this project is to improve the community's understanding of the aerosol indirect (or secondary aerosol) effect through examination of the role of carbonaceous material.  Laboratory and field experimental activities will be combined with numerical modeling exercises.  A new method for characterizing cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) will be developed that combines size resolved measurements of surface tension, critical supersaturation and chemical composition, which will allow determination of the effects of organic species on CCN properties in near real time.  The observations made with the new technique will be incorporated into a numerical module designed to simulate aerosol-cloud interactions which when incorporated into global climate models can be used to assess indirect forcing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will expose undergraduate engineers and scientists to atmospheric research.  The PI will expose gifted high school students to atmospheric science with the goal to inspire them to a career in science and engineering.  Two Ph.D. students will be given experimental and numerical modeling experiences.  There are a number of formal education and outreach programs (e.g. SURE and STEP) at the PI's home institution that will be exploited in this project.  Societal benefits are likely with improved understanding of the atmospheric chemical-climate system.  The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international scientific conferences.</AbstractNarration>

Major outcomes: Field deployment and laboratory analysis of field samples (Objective 3)  Organics contribute considerably to the CCN activity of aerosols. Excluding their influence can lead to substantial CCN prediction biases, on the order of 50% or more in climate-sensitive regions of the globe (such as the Arctic). Very simple descriptions of the organic hygroscopicity however can be used that corrects most of the CCN prediction bias. The water-soluble fraction is the prime source of bulk aerosol hygroscopicity. In all the ambient samples considered, the hygroscopicity of organic material was found to be proportional to the volume fraction of soluble organics; the proportionality constant was also found to vary very little across samples. Evidence suggests that surface tension variability is compensated by solute effects to yield a quasi-constant proportionality constant. Knowledge of aerosol size distribution, the inorganic chemical composition, and simplified description of organic hygroscopicity leads to predictions of CCN concentrations that agree with observations to a few %. In areas where the CCN is externally-mixed, closure may be worse; such situations are globally unimportant though.  Surfactants are ubiquitous, and an important amount of them may come directly from the gas phase. The latter was, for the first time, identified and demonstrated during this proposal.
