    <AbstractNarration>Title of Project: Track 1, GK-12: Improving STEM content for K-6 grades in coastal rural schools in Oregon.&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Oregon Institute of Marine Biology, University of Oregon&lt;br/&gt;PI/Co-PI: Drs. Alan Shanks and Janet Hodder&lt;br/&gt;Number of Fellows per year: 9 graduate fellows, 2 undergraduate fellows&lt;br/&gt;School District Partners: Coos Bay and North Bend School Districts&lt;br/&gt;Target Audience of the Project: K-6th grade&lt;br/&gt;Setting: Rural Coastal, low socioeconomic status&lt;br/&gt;NSF Supported Disciplines Involved: Science and Mathematics, Natural Resources&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will provide support to two rural school districts in meeting the challenges of the Oregon standards based education reform in science and math. By building on a partnership we have already developed with the school districts we will permanently enhance Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education in these districts. We will use Oregon Institute of Marine Biology (OIMB) graduate and undergraduate GK-12 Fellows to provide targeted instruction to elementary students (grades K-6), and professional development to teachers in STEM content. STEM education will be enhanced through the presentation of marine and aquatic sciences utilizing and building upon the Marine Activities, Resources, and Education (MARE) curriculum developed at the University of California Berkeley. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal includes our goal to permanently improve teacher's understanding of science content, and their use of inquiry and the scientific method to teach STEM subjects. Summer workshops will familiarize Fellows with the MARE curriculum and provide practical pedagogic knowledge for teaching in K-6 classes, and an understanding of the Oregon based standards system. A MARE Lead Teacher cadre will be developed in each school district that will act as mentors for the fellows and as support for other teachers in the district. These teachers will participate in summer "training" workshops for the Fellows. A second series of summer institutes for additional teachers will strengthen the working partnership between fellows and teachers, and improve the teacher's knowledge of science and scientific inquiry. To accomplish the later goal, teachers in the summer institutes will design and carry out scientific inquiries in the marine habitats of Coos Bay. They will design investigations, collect and analyze data, and prepare a work sample appropriate for assessing the investigation. Fellows will meet weekly with the GK-12 coordinator and OIMB faculty to discuss project implementation and direction and provide opportunities for additional training. They will also meet regularly with the GK-12 Coordinator and Lead Teachers from each school to assess progress. A "decision-oriented" evaluation using both qualitative and quantitative analytic techniques will provide participants with formative evaluations to facilitate decision-making and will be used to analyze project data and draw summative conclusions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project includes the development of a more permanent University/K-12 relationship; the development of teaching, communication, and team-building skills by the GK-12 Fellows; the opportunity for Fellows to gain knowledge and experience of the K-12 teaching community; and the formation of working partnerships with faculty, Fellows, and teachers. Teachers and their students will accrue a number of benefits including up to date scientific information, experiences with real science via inquiry-based investigations, and exposure to working scientists. In addition all participants will strengthen their connection with the community in which they live. This project is partially supported by funds from the Directorate for Geosciences.</AbstractNarration>
