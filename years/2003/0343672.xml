<AbstractNarration>Project abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves an integrated collection of research and&lt;br/&gt;educational activities focused on the theory of error-correcting&lt;br/&gt;codes. Error-correcting codes are combinatorial objects used for the&lt;br/&gt;purpose of reliable communication of information over a noisy&lt;br/&gt;channel. The project focuses on the asymptotic and algorithmic aspects&lt;br/&gt;of coding theory, and in particular aims to construct explicit&lt;br/&gt;families of codes that achieve good trade-offs together with efficient&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for encoding and decoding them. The channel noise is&lt;br/&gt;typically modeled adversarially (as opposed to being generated by some&lt;br/&gt;probability distribution), as this will yield codes and algorithms&lt;br/&gt;with the strongest possible error-resilience guarantees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central technical notion that will be explored is that of "list&lt;br/&gt;decoding". Under list decoding, the decoder is supposed to output all&lt;br/&gt;messages whose encodings are within a certain distance of the received&lt;br/&gt;word. Thus one relaxes the requirement that the decoder's answer&lt;br/&gt;always be unique. This relaxation is necessary to meaningfully pose&lt;br/&gt;the question of decoding beyond the ``traditional'' half-the-distance&lt;br/&gt;bound, and at the same time even when constrained to output a small&lt;br/&gt;list, ends up permitting decoding well beyond half-the-distance of a&lt;br/&gt;code. List decoding is itself an old notion (first defined in the late&lt;br/&gt;50's) but it was only recently that efficient list decoding&lt;br/&gt;algorithms were discovered for useful families of codes. Consequently,&lt;br/&gt;though much progress has been made in the last few years, list&lt;br/&gt;decoding is a subject still in its infancy in terms of its true&lt;br/&gt;potential. In particular, the high level conceptual motivation for&lt;br/&gt;list decoding is that it will enable communication at rates close to&lt;br/&gt;the channel's ``capacity'' even when the noise is adversarial (instead&lt;br/&gt;of obeying an assumed probabilistic model). The codes needed for such&lt;br/&gt;a result are, however, not explicitly known currently. One of the&lt;br/&gt;central goals of this project is to make progress towards the&lt;br/&gt;construction of such codes and the associated list decoding&lt;br/&gt;algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROAD IMPACTS: The project will attempt to provide new tools and&lt;br/&gt;techniques for the study of codes that involve a rare interplay&lt;br/&gt;between algebra, combinatorics, and probability. It will try to&lt;br/&gt;enhance our understanding of the fundamental limits of noiseless&lt;br/&gt;communication possible on various noisy channels, as well as push the&lt;br/&gt;rate of usage of transmission channels in practice much closer to&lt;br/&gt;their true potential even in the face of adversarially effected&lt;br/&gt;errors. Due to the great diversity in the results that it aims to&lt;br/&gt;obtain, the research will enable bringing the different communities&lt;br/&gt;that work on coding theory closer together, and more widely expound&lt;br/&gt;the merits of the asymptotic complexity based approach pioneered by&lt;br/&gt;theoretical computer science. Lecture notes from the offerings of the&lt;br/&gt;courses developed in the educational component will be made freely&lt;br/&gt;available on the web, and will eventually be embellished into a&lt;br/&gt;monograph on coding theory with a focus on computational complexity&lt;br/&gt;that is currently lacking in the standard texts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
