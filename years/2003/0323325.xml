<AbstractNarration>Description:  This award provides support for American participation at the US-India Workshop: Tissue Engineering and Stem Cell Technologies, Trivandrum, India, February 2004.  US PI Robert Nerem, Director, Georgia Tech/Emory Center for the Engineering of Living Tissues, Atlanta and Prabha Nair, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences &amp; Technology, Trivandrum are co-organizers of the workshop. &lt;br/&gt;Participants from the US will meet with others from tissue engineering centers in India, Singapore and Japan to discuss the latest developments in tissue engineering and establish collaborative ties.  The objectives are: 1) to bring together experts in the field of tissue engineering to provide a review and assessment of the state-of-the-art, 2) identify key areas needing intensified research, 3) assess how US-India collaborations would significantly impact the field of tissue engineering, 4) discuss mechanism to initiate and sustain research collaborations, and 5) provide a unique educational experience for resident undergraduate, graduate and medical students, exposing them to the challenges and opportunities that the field presents.      &lt;br/&gt;Scope:  Significant challenges exist in tissue engineering, where cooperation, partnership, and exchange will accelerate the advancement of this field.  From the United States, 12-15 leaders and key people in the field will participate in the two-day workshop.  There will be a large representation of Indian participants from different scientific backgrounds that include students, junior researchers, and women scientists.  This activity will be supported by the Government of India Department of Science &amp; Technology (DST) under the NSF/DST joint program.   &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
