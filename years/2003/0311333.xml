<AbstractNarration>Large communication networks, such as the Web or the Internet, give rise to &lt;br/&gt;a number of challenging algorithmic questions. Our increased dependence on&lt;br/&gt;networks means that reliability and availability of the communication&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure is becoming more critical than ever. This project will consider&lt;br/&gt;some of the algorithmic question raised by such networks. The goal of&lt;br/&gt;the project is to develop algorithms with provable performance guarantees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on two closely related issues. Over the last 20 years or &lt;br/&gt;so, many powerful techniques have been developed for approximation algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on developing new algorithmic techniques, and aims to &lt;br/&gt;develop new techniques for approximation algorithms, and obtain large improvements &lt;br/&gt;in the achievable solution quality for a number of important problems, &lt;br/&gt;where the previous techniques failed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second goal of the project is to develop algorithmic techniques for the &lt;br/&gt;distributed, and selfish environment of large networks, like the Internet. &lt;br/&gt;In such settings the traditional approach of algorithm design is not &lt;br/&gt;appropriate: there is no single entity that has the information or the power &lt;br/&gt;to run such an algorithm. While centralized algorithms cannot be used directly &lt;br/&gt;in such selfish environments, there are very strong ties with certain &lt;br/&gt;algorithmic techniques and some of the central questions in algorithmic game &lt;br/&gt;theory. This project considers two of these issues, cost-sharing and the&lt;br/&gt;price of anarchy. The project will develop new methods for designing&lt;br/&gt;cost-sharing algorithms, and understanding what environments lead to&lt;br/&gt;low price of anarchy. The cost-sharing problem is closely related to the &lt;br/&gt;primal dual method of approximation algorithms. Evaluating the price of &lt;br/&gt;anarchy is closely related to approximation algorithms based on local search.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
