<AbstractNarration>We introduce a revolutionary micro-optical device combining the bulk properties of Photonic Crystals with the wave-optics features of Micro and Diffractive Optics, called 3D Nano-Optical Elements (3DNOES); thereby combining the optical functions of lenses with the spectral properties of filters required for photonics and display applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is aimed at the creation of the infrastructure necessary to realize the unlimited potential of 3DNOE technology. In order to achieve this, the PI, graduate students, and undergraduates will establish advanced design methodologies for the 3DNOES; create novel fabrication methods based on an additive lithography process utilizing both conventional and holographic lithography, develop advanced etching methods for fabricating high contrast PC elements, and demonstrate the hybrid integration of 3DNOES. All of these developments will substantially impact the micro-optics by drastically changing the paradigm from conventional optics to optics fabricated with customized dispersion properties. Examples include biologically inspired optics, novel optical elements based on the ihsuper-prismln concept, super-luminescent diodes for display applications, and wavelength multiplexing devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program has a broad impact on the photonics industry as a whole, since it serves to cross the chasm, which exists between the training of our students at all levels and the future needs of the photonics industry. This is addressed through an integrated plan involving undergraduate and graduate students for core research and development in the design and fabrication of wafer based micro-optics based on 3DNOES. An innovative high school program is proposed to introduce the students to IC based fabrication of micro-optics and expose educators to these advanced concepts of photonics integration with a high school logo competition. Additionally, an internship program with Morehouse College will be established to reach out to those underrepresented in the sciences today and provide them with training for the next century as optical engineers and scientists. In order to further address the workforce training issue, a micro-fabrication course will be developed and integrated into the BSEET program. A brief version of this course will be given to high school teachers and REU students for an introduction to micro and nano-fabrication. Actual ichands-onla training and demonstrations will be focus of the training, with the hopes that it will inspire a new generation of optical engineers and scientists.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
