<AbstractNarration>An experimental program is proposed aimed at discovering methods to achieve good translational and orientational order in 2D arrays of block copolymer domains, methods that could ultimately lead to nanopatterns that could be transferred to underlying substrates.  An assisted self-assembly scheme is proposed whereby the edges of regions defined by optical lithography serve to register and template the order.  Emphasis will be placed on understanding the ordering and disordering processes in melts of both single layer and multilayer films of spherical domain block copolymers and their belends with homopolymers in such regions.  While most experiments will use locally flat substrates with sharp edge structures, the equilibrium order on surfaces with Gaussian curvature (positive and negative) will be explored as well.  Assisted self-assembly is also expected to work for cylindrical domain block copolymer films with cylinders normal to the film surface.  Here controlling they cylinder orientation (with electric fields or surface interactions) while maintaining lateral templating by edge structures is the major challenge.  These experiments will be supplemented with field theoretic numerical simulations of 2D block copolymer ordering in collaboration with Glenn Fredrickson at UCSB.  Strong efforts will be made to involve undergraduates in the research in several ways.  A partnership is proposed with faculty at Harvey Mudd College, an undergraduate institution in Claremont, CA, that will allow their undergraduates to pursue senior research projects that contribute to this research.  These students will have access to the outstanding experimental facilities at UCSB as well as regular Web conferences with the team at UCSB.  At least one undergraduate chemical engineer at UCSB will be involved during the academic year and at least one summer participant will be sought from the various REU programs on the UCSB campus.  A web site will be developed as a learning resource for college and high school teachers, allowing them to teach the principles of crystals and defects using the real 2D block copolymer array structures as model systems.  Strong emphasis will be placed on developing graduate student communication and presentation skills, especially in the context of national and even international meetings.  Interactions are expected to develop with nanotechnology groups at various industrial concerns interested in utilizing the results of this research.</AbstractNarration>
