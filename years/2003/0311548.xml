<AbstractNarration>With increasing data processing needs, many applications belonging&lt;br/&gt;to areas such as communication networks, computational biology,&lt;br/&gt;e-commerce, etc. require the processing of very large data sets under&lt;br/&gt;time and space limitations.  This need makes it necessary to seek&lt;br/&gt;new, more efficient algorithmic models involving resource restrictions.&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this project is to explore the tradeoffs between&lt;br/&gt;limiting the computing resources (time, space, access to input) available&lt;br/&gt;to an algorithm and the resulting loss in accuracy and effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;By testing quantitative properties as well as qualitative ones, the link&lt;br/&gt;between the efficiency/effectiveness of property testing and those of&lt;br/&gt;approximation algorithms can be investigated.  To this end, this project&lt;br/&gt;involves devising sublinear algorithms for checking combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;properties of various types of large data objects such as sequences,&lt;br/&gt;graphs, and sets.  This task can be achieved through intelligent random&lt;br/&gt;sampling of the data,  minimizing the number of bits of the input that&lt;br/&gt;the algorithm needs to access through either reusing samples or choosing&lt;br/&gt;samples carefully so that each accessed bit yields as much information&lt;br/&gt;as possible about the input.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project is in improving the understanding&lt;br/&gt;of resource-bounded computation on different types of large data.  The&lt;br/&gt;new meta-techniques developed are expected to apply to a variety of&lt;br/&gt;problems in different application areas which now see the processing of&lt;br/&gt;input as a major bottleneck.  For students of computer science, these&lt;br/&gt;techniques bring a new point of view to understanding the possibilities&lt;br/&gt;and limitations of computation as well as an understanding of data-related&lt;br/&gt;limitations and bottlenecks of certain types of applications that need to&lt;br/&gt;be addressed via unconventional models.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
