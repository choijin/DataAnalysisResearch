<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;PI:  Steinfield   Institution:  Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Special Projects Office of the Division of Chemistry is supporting Dr. Jeffrey Steinfield of the Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who will organize and conduct a symposium entitled  "The Chemistry of Global Change".  Dr. Joseph Francisco of Purdue University will be co-organizer of the symposium.  The symposium will be a Presidential Event at the 226th American Chemical Society (ACS) Meeting, Sept. 8, 2003, in New York City.  The goal of the symposium is to discuss the current state of climate science; modeling and greenhouse gas measurements; coupling between climate change and atmospheric chemical cycles involving ozone, aerosols and oxidizing radicals; technology options for energy production in a "greenhouse constrained" world; and the viewpoint from developing countries.  The symposium will also discuss communication and perception of this complex set of issues among professional chemists, the public, students, and policymakers.  The speakers, panelists and invited guests include minorities, women, and representatives of developing countries from universities, industry, and government laboratories having expertise in environmental science, atmospheric science, climate modeling, energy economics and communications.  The symposium organizers plan to make the presentations available to students, teachers and the press. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
