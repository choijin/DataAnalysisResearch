    <AbstractNarration>The 2003 CSHL Eukaryotic DNA Replication Conference will be held in Cold Spring Harbor, NY, on September 3-7. The meeting will be devoted to fundamental research topics related to chromosome duplication, structure, and function. The rapid advances made in this field over recent years make frequent meetings on this topic necessary. The meeting will ensure that recent results will be communicated and that investigators will have the opportunity to discuss them directly with one another. The participation of younger investigators and women scientists will be encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The areas to be covered by the 2003 meeting will include studies on (1) the replication of virus chromosomes, including SV40, polyomavirus, cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus, papillomaviruses, Epstein-Barr virus; (2) chromosomal replication and gene amplification in organisms as diverse as yeast, Drosophila, Xenopus and mammalian cells; (3) control of DNA replication in the cell cycle; (4) structure and function of chromosomal elements such as origins of replication and telomeres; (5) control of cell cycle progression and S phase specific gene expression; and (6) DNA replication checkpoints and DNA repair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is especially appropriate that this meeting be held in the year celebrating the fifthieth anniversary of the discovery of the double helix of DNA and its implications for inheritance.</AbstractNarration>
