<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geosciences Institute for Education and Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Earth Science Program at the University of Michigan-Dearborn will develop an annual research program for selected grade 5-12 teachers and students from the Detroit Public School System.  The program is designed to extend research and learning opportunities in the geosciences to underrepresented groups within the City of Detroit.  This project addresses two problems. People of color comprise 80% of the population within the City of Detroit, but they comprise less than 10% of all science majors at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, and fewer than 3% of geoscience majors.  In addition, Earth Science is now required to be taught in the 5th, 8th and 11th grades in Michigan public schools, but fewer than 2% of the teachers who regularly teach these classes have ever had a college-course in geology.  NSF funding will be used to develop the fundamental program, which, if successful, will continue with support from the Detroit Public Schools and the University of Michigan-Dearborn. The program will consist of a three-week session whereby 10 selected teachers and a maximum of 20 of their students will participate in geoscience research projects located within southeast Michigan.  During the three-week session the students will spend two days each week in the classroom and laboratory for an introduction to the research problem.  The remaining time will be spent in the field assisting faculty, graduate and undergraduate students with ongoing research projects.  Following the three-week session, the teachers and their students will maintain contact with the faculty through a specially developed web site.  Teachers and students will assist UM-Dearborn faculty and students in presenting the preliminary research results to the Geosciences Session at the Michigan Academy of Arts, Sciences and Letters Annual Meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
