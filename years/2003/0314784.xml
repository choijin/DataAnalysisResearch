<AbstractNarration>The focus of this research is to explore the mechanisms of photochemical reactions.  Cis-trans isomerization of olefins and competing cyclization reactions will be examined.  A two-pronged approach combining photochemical and spectroscopic observations is employed to characterize the photochemistry and  photophysics of individual ground state rotamers.  Measurements of the temperature, solvent, concentration, and excitation wavelength dependencies of photoproduct quantum yields will be correlated with steady state and transient spectroscopic measurements.  Complex responses will be analyzed by principal component analysis with self-modeling (PCA-SM), or by singular value decomposition with self-modeling (SVD-SM).  This will allow resolution of composite responses into the individual response of each molecule that contributes to the response.  The research will also involve the synthesis of molecules designed to test theories of the photophysical and photochemical responses of organic molecules to light absorption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this Renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Jack Saltiel.  Professor Saltiel will focus his work on the mechanisms by which organic molecules absorb light and undergo photochemical transformation.  The knowledge which emerges from these studies is expected to contribute to our understanding of vision and the production of vitamin D, as well as to the training of graduate, undergraduate and post-doctoral students in chemistry.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
