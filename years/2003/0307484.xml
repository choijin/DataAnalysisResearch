<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-0307484&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Viktor Ginzburg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present proposal focuses on two projects closely related to&lt;br/&gt;the principal investigator's previous work funded by NSF&lt;br/&gt;grants. These projects are the problem of existence of periodic&lt;br/&gt;orbits for Hamiltonian dynamical systems and the study of&lt;br/&gt;topological properties of certain Poisson manifolds. The first&lt;br/&gt;problem Viktor Ginzburg addresses in this proposal is the&lt;br/&gt;investigation of the size of the set of regular energy values on&lt;br/&gt;which a Hamiltonian system does not have periodic orbits. By the&lt;br/&gt;almost existence theorem, this set must be of zero measure and&lt;br/&gt;from counterexamples to the Hamiltonian Seifert conjecture it is&lt;br/&gt;known that this set may be non-empty. Thus the question is to&lt;br/&gt;bridge the gap between these two results.  Another series of&lt;br/&gt;problems discussed in the proposal concerns the existence of&lt;br/&gt;periodic orbits for Hamiltonian systems of a special nature,&lt;br/&gt;including those describing the motion of a charge in a (strong)&lt;br/&gt;magnetic field or, more generally, the existence of periodic&lt;br/&gt;orbits near Morse-Bott non-degenerate symplectic extrema. These&lt;br/&gt;problems are closely related to the investigation of the&lt;br/&gt;(relative) Hofer-Zehnder capacity function and the Floer homology&lt;br/&gt;of certain Hamiltonians. The objective of the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;in the area of Poisson topology is to study connections between&lt;br/&gt;the geometry of Poisson structures and topology of underlying&lt;br/&gt;manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian dynamical systems describe many classes of physical&lt;br/&gt;processes in which dissipative forces can be neglected. For&lt;br/&gt;example, planetary motion in celestial mechanics and some&lt;br/&gt;electro- or magneto-dynamical processes can be, and usually are,&lt;br/&gt;treated as Hamiltonian dynamical systems. One of the classical&lt;br/&gt;subjects in the theory of dynamical systems is the study of&lt;br/&gt;periodic orbits (i.e. cyclic motions). Periodic motion is the&lt;br/&gt;simplest and most common type of motion after equilibrium.  It is&lt;br/&gt;believed that a vast majority of Hamiltonian systems have&lt;br/&gt;periodic orbits and systems without such orbits have only been&lt;br/&gt;recently discovered. Yet, in all but simplest problems, finding&lt;br/&gt;periodic orbits requires the use of advanced and powerful&lt;br/&gt;mathematical methods.  The investigation of periodic orbits lies&lt;br/&gt;at the very core of the modern theory of Hamiltonian dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems. One of the main themes of the proposal is determining&lt;br/&gt;how large the collection of periodic/aperiodic energy values can&lt;br/&gt;be and showing that systems of a particular type carry periodic&lt;br/&gt;orbits of all energies. This class of systems includes those&lt;br/&gt;describing the motion of a charge in a magnetic field and the&lt;br/&gt;proposed research has potential applications to physics and&lt;br/&gt;mathematical aspects of mechanics.  The last part of the proposal&lt;br/&gt;concerns the investigation of connections between geometrical and&lt;br/&gt;topological properties of a certain class of spaces arising in&lt;br/&gt;the study of systems with symmetries and in quantum mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
