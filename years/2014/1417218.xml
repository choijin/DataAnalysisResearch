<AbstractNarration>This project will test stress percolation hypothesis and its utility for working with geologic materials.  Both scientists and engineers have assumed that when a rock is loaded by either tectonic forces or within the context of engineering projects, the load is borne evenly throughout the rock.  The PI has developed an alternative hypothesis that the stresses produced by external loads on a rock are distributed throughout the rock according to a pattern that resembles the pattern created by water flowing through otherwise dry sand.  If the hypothesis proves correct, then stress distribution in rocks will join a large class of phenomena that exhibit 'percolation' behavior, including the patterns of stress distribution observed in granular materials.  Thus one implication of the hypothesis is that there is a single unifying physical model for deformation of all earth materials. The value in understanding the stress distribution in rocks is that it will allow us to create better models of rock deformation and better predict the mechanical behavior of rocks, which has implications for deepening our understanding of a variety of Earth processes as well engineering applications.  The existence of stress percolation and a refined understanding of how it operates in rocks has tremendous implications for many disciplines beyond geophysics.  Researchers in materials science, metallurgy, and shock physics, all struggle with the so called 'polycrystalline problem' - like rocks, many solid materials are composed of aggregates of crystalline grains with a variety of properties.  Understanding the response to loading of many of these materials has presented challenges similar to those experienced by those working on rock deformation.  Thus, this research will contribute to a better understanding of mechanical problems in all of these disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using finite element (FEM) simulations of a polycrystalline material the PI has recently shown that local variations in stress and strain participate in large-scale patterns, likely caused by stress percolation. The patterns are a function of the heterogeneity and statistical distribution of elastic and plastic properties across the population of mechanical components (grains and grain boundaries) in the material.  Greater degrees of heterogeneity lead to more intense stress concentrations across a less dense pattern.  Lower degrees of elastic heterogeneity lead to a denser pattern of stress transmission that carries smaller modulations.  Paralleling the development of shear bands in granular materials, the stress patterns lead directly to shear localization.  The proposed project will compare the stress and strain heterogeneity observed in experimentally deformed mono-phase rocks with the stress and strain heterogeneity observed in FE models tuned to simulate these rocks.  Specifically, the variation in the orientation of local stress tensor as predicted by FE models will be compared with microstructures that are sensitive to the compression direction such as twins and kinkbands and the distribution of the magnitude of the local compressive stress predicted by the FE models will be compared with local compressive stress distributions derived from synchrotron x-ray diffraction data from in-situ deformation experiments. Model design elements to be examined include the shapes of grains, grain boundary and grain interior rheology, as well as model size and aspect ratio. The impact of using 2D vs 3D models will also be examined. Additional direct comparisons will be made between the pattern of variation in microstrains observed on the surface of experimentally deformed polycrystalline slabs and the results from FE models built to match EBSD maps of the slab surfaces. These comparisons between models and experimental data will provide a test of the stress percolation hypothesis and provide a foundation for further investigations of stress percolation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The deformation behavior of rocks governs the dynamic behavior of our planet including the formation of mountains, the creation of faults that lead to earthquakes and even plate tectonics and the style convection in the Earth's mantle, which is responsible for the formation of Earth?s atmosphere and oceans.  The major goal of this project is to test the stress percolation hypothesis which posits that forces are transmitted through crystalline solids (e.g. rocks) along strong pathways, also known as 'force chains'.   The existence of stress percolation in crystalline solids would help explain a number of phenomena including the distribution of microcracks, the formation of shear localization and even the formation of mineral banding in gneiss.  Under this project we explored a variety of strategies for measuring stress percolation in-situ including Raman spectroscopy, nano-indentation and atomic force microscopy.  We also worked on techniques for measuring the microscopic distribution of strain in our samples including digital image correlation and electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI).  We have identified a successful protocol for mapping stress in both quartz and calcite using Raman spectroscopy and demonstrated that there are significant variations in stress states between crystals in fibrous quartz while it is being deformed.  We also successfully developed a protocol for using ECCI on silicates and other insulating materials (including alumina and diamond) and was able to image dislocations and twins with this technique.   Broader Impacts  Fundamental aspects of deformation processes are the same for rocks, ceramic and metals.  Therefore improving our understanding of rock deformation can have implications for the deformation behavior of human created materials.  The techniques for applying ECCI to non-conductive materials may be of particular interest to materials scientist working on advanced ceramics and polycrystalline diamond.  In addition, as part of this project one postdoctoral scholar and two graduate students were trained and 14 undergraduates participated in our research projects.
