<AbstractNarration>The issue of bias in state-of-the-art global models that are used to study decadal climate variability and prediction has been a long-standing problem in the field of climate science. Biases in tropical precipitation, circulation, and sea-surface temperature (SST)  affect simulations of seasonal to interannual, decadal, and longer-time climate variations. Additionally, under this effort three doctoral students will be trained for careers in climate modeling, contributing to national scientific workforce capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to reduce tropical precipitation biases in Community Earth System Model (CESM) and a new version of the CESM that incorporated the superparameterized cloud scheme, SP-CESM. Tropical precipitation biases have been attributed to poor cumulus parameterizations, ocean coupling feedbacks, ocean eddy mixing deficiencies, land-atmosphere interaction, and remote effects of insufficient low clouds. Sources of error will be separated by looking at the initial development of the biases over the first decade of simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cumulus parameterization errors develop within days to weeks, local ocean coupling errors develop in months, and the remote effect of midlatitude low cloud biases may take years to affect tropical precipitation. This initial rainfall and SST bias development will be used to test improvements to the cloud microphysical parameterizations in CESM and SP-CESM, as well as changes to the cumulus parameterization in CESM. Changes affecting Southern Hemisphere midlatitude low cloud cover will be a focus. The  goal will be to significantly reduce the tropical SST and precipitation bias in both models for both initialized multiyear forecasts and long-term projections while maintaining good ENSO variability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We use global climate models (GCMs) to understand past and current climate and its variability, and to project human-induced climate change due mainly to greenhouse gas emissions.  Ideally, GCMs would perfectly predict average present-day temperature and rainfall everywhere on the earth.  Due to uncertainties about how to represent clouds, turbulence, land surfaces, and many other processes, our GCMs have ‘biases’; e. g. they may predict too much or too little rainfall on average in certain regions and seasons.   By looking how these biases can be removed, we hope we can make GCMs more accurately simulate present day and future climate.     In this project, we analyzed the ‘double-ITCZ’ rainfall bias, which most climate models have to some extent.  This bias refers to simulating too much rainfall just south of the Equator in the eastern and central tropical Pacific Ocean, where there is also a year-round rainfall belt north of the Equator.  With this bias, the single rainfall belt we observe in reality becomes two belts in the climate model simulation, hence its name.   We compared three different but related climate models.   One, CESM, strongly exhibits this bias.  Its successor, CESM2 (which was developed while the project was active), and SP-CESM, an experimental and more computationally expensive climate model designed to better simulate the thunderstorm systems that generate most tropical rainfall, exhibit this bias more weakly.  What makes these models do better?     After a lot of in-depth analysis and hypothesis testing, we found there is not a simple one-line story.  In all the models, the bias sets in within a couple of months of simulation, if we start with our best guesses at the real state of the ocean, atmosphere, and land at some particular time.  The SP-CESM has a lower bias than CESM because it produces weaker (and more realistic) east to west surface winds across the equatorial Pacific ocean, but our analysis suggests that SP-CESM gets this encouraging result only because for computational efficiency, it doesn’t include a process called convective momentum transport that it ideally should include (‘the right answer for the wrong reason’).  The CESM2 gets a better results due to a set of changes made to improve global cloudiness that happen to cause the southeast Pacific Ocean to become particularly more cloudy, which blocks sunlight, cools the ocean and shuts down rainfall in that region.  In both cases, the double-ITCZ bias was improved more by accident than on purpose, even though it is a well-recognized, long-standing issue with this climate model and others.  The project has helped us track and understand these results in hindsight, even though it did not actually directly lead to the model changes that reduced the rainfall biases.
