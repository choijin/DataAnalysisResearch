<AbstractNarration>This media and research project will develop and study the use of new media, broadcast television, and social networks to introduce Citizen Science to a national audience, and motivate their direct involvement and participation.  Project deliverables will include:  four nationally-distributed public TV programs hosted by Waleed Abdalati, Director of CIREs at the University of Boulder and former NASA Chief Scientist; online videos for training and outreach of citizen science partners; digital engagement via social media; and a custom-designed application ('2nd screen app') that enables users to obtain additional informational content, share information, and connect with other viewers.  The evaluation and research study will build new knowledge on  how these deliverables can motivate the public to become citizen science participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators estimate the four television programs will reach approximately 80% of U.S. television households.  In addition, videos and other content will be distributed through channels such as iTunes, Hulu, Netflix, and social media.  Target audiences will include the general public, citizen science activists, and professional scientists. Underrepresented groups will be reached through special Google Hangouts, and professional societies such as SACNAS and AGU. The research components of the project will provide evidence on how traditional researchers respond to citizen science, and explore the deliverables' use as recruitment tools for citizen science projects and impacts on viewers' attitudes, behaviors, and skills related to citizen science. Data will be collected from multiple sources, including online surveys, in-person focus groups, and analyses of users' online postings.    Retrospective surveys will be administered to explore changes in behavior regarding whether respondents have increased their interaction with professional scientists, or participated in citizen science initiatives. A quasi-experimental study will be conducted to assess the value added by the 2nd screen app.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>THE CROWD &amp; THE CLOUD initiative includes a four hour public television mini-series on citizen science and crowdsourcing, hosted by former NASA Chief Scientist Waleed Abdalati, as well as a full-featured website (CrowdAndCloud.org) and a social media presence on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Funded by NSF, the project&rsquo;s goals are to increase public awareness of the potential of citizen science to contribute to public health and safety, disaster response, environmental sustainability and STEM engagement.

Each episode features exemplary citizen science projects and lively profiles of contributors and organizers, ranging from well-established activities (such as Audubon&rsquo;s Christmas Bird Count) to more recent start-ups such as EyesOnALZ (using online games to speed up Alzheimer&rsquo;s research) and Smartfin (placing sensors on surfboards to monitor ocean acidification and temperature.) Extrapolation from limited Nielsen ratings provides an estimate of a cumulative national viewership in the United States of some 4-5 million, with many thousands more interacting or watching online. The programs are also accessible at CrowdAndCloud.org, PBS.org and on Amazon Prime. Viewers via PBS.org skewed younger than the usual public TV audience, with 33.5% falling into the 25-34 years old demographic, and with a roughly equal mix of male and female.</p> <p>The project&rsquo;s website provides biographies of those appearing, interactive links to Featured and Related projects, and&mdash;most importantly&mdash;a JOIN A PROJECT page, powered by SciStarter (also funded by NSF), allowing users to select a topic, enter their location and discover a range of citizen science activities in which they might be interested. This functionality addresses CROWD &amp; CLOUD&rsquo;s goal of helping &ldquo;turn view-ers into do-ers.&rdquo; Added online activities included Facebook Live hangouts following the WORLD Channel feeds, which were enhanced with real-time tweets, and web exclusive coverage of citizen science involvement in the &ldquo;Great American Eclipse.&rdquo;</p> <p>CROWD &amp; CLOUD benefited from extensive collaboration with a wide number of citizen science groups and organizations in addition to those named above: CoCoRaHS (the Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow network), NOAA, Public Lab, OpenStreetMap, the Red Cross, &ldquo;Bucket Brigade&rdquo;, Trout Unlimited, the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project, Mosquito Alert (Barcelona, Spain), the Nature Conservancy, Bright Focus Foundation, USGS&rsquo;s National Phenology Network, iNaturalist, the World Bank, Google, Berkeley Space Sciences Lab, and more.</p> <p>Valuable guidance and input was received from a distinguished group of Advisors, the Citizen Science Association, and the European and Australian Citizen Science Associations. Presentations were made by project staff and Advisors at the White House; the Library of Congress; the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine; the American Association of Public Administration; the American Geophysical Union (2015 and 2017); the US Science and Engineering Festival; the UN World Data Forum, and at other regional and international science outreach events. Special screenings were arranged for the US Embassy in Beijing, and the OpenStreetMap segment was subtitled in Arabic for viewing in a refugee camp in Lebanon.

Key findings are that &ldquo;The Crowd &amp; The Cloud&rsquo;s broadcast and digital media succeeded in making viewers aware of citizen science initiatives around the world, changed people&rsquo;s perceptions of citizen science, and motivated a new wave of individuals to engage in scientific research to fill in knowledge gaps, track trends using large datasets, or address problems within their local communities.&rdquo; Rockman found that both viewing the videos and using the website were more effective than experiencing either alone, and that the online resources were most likely to motivate people to participate in citizen science.
