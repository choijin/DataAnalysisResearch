<AbstractNarration>The parameterization of air-sea interaction at high wind speeds  continues as a topic of great interest to air-sea exchange. Being able to predict air-sea gas exchange of radiatively important gases such as carbon dioxide is needed to project climate scenarios.  A previous NSF award (AGS- 1036062; 1036006 Collaborative Research: Measuring Air-Sea Gas Exchange in High Winds for Improvement of Physics-Based Air-Sea Transfer Parameterizations: HiWinGS) funded a 4-year project to develop and improve gas exchange measurements.  A HiWinGS cruise to the Labrador Sea was successfully completed in Oct-Nov 2013, yielding more than 700 hours of coordinated flux and wave physics observations, including more than 100 hours at wind speeds of 15-27 m/s. This is a unique data set. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific goals of the analysis work undertaken here are to:&lt;br/&gt;1) present an analysis of the observed transfer coefficients for heat, momentum, the trace gases DMS and CO2 with respect to wind speed, stress, bubble plume characteristics and sea state; &lt;br/&gt;2) further develop the refined physical representations for gas transfer at high wind speeds in available bulk flux algorithms; and &lt;br/&gt;3) engage in a critical assessment of the various CO2 flux data sets obtained from the HiWinGS cruise.</AbstractNarration>

In general, the rate of gas transfer increases with increasing wind speed, and the gas transfer velocity is often modeled as a simple function of wind speed alone, but the wind speed dependence is not the same for all gases.&nbsp; A model which treats the various physical mechanisms independently (i.e. a &lsquo;universal&rsquo; physical model) can, in theory, represent the air-sea transfer of any gas species .&nbsp; But we have an incomplete understanding of many important physical mechanisms, especially with respect to the details of&nbsp; transfer enhancement by breaking waves and bubbles at high wind speeds.</p> <p>Direct measurements of gas transfer enhancement at high wind speeds are challenging &ndash; laboratory studies in wave tanks do not fully represent conditions in the open ocean, and measurements at sea from ships and buoys are difficult.&nbsp; The <em>High Wind speed Gas exchange Study</em> (HiWinGS) was conducted to develop improved methods for measuring trace gas fluxes from a ship and to deploy these methods, together with a suite of wave and bubble measurements, on a dedicated research cruise under high wind speed conditions with large waves.</p> <p>Initial work by HiWinGS participants focused on developing an improved method of measuring air-sea CO2 flux using recently developed cavity ring-down gas analyzer technology (CRDS).&nbsp; The CRDS eliminates <em>some</em> of the interferences and limitations affecting other CO2 flux analyzers, resulting in significantly improved flux detection limits (Figure 1).&nbsp; Development work by HiWinGS collaborators in the UK focused on new and novel instruments to measure wave spectra and bubble size distrubutions in the surface ocean under high wind conditions.&nbsp;

A physical gas transfer model (COAREG) incorporating the Reynolds number parameter reproduces the mean trend in transfer velocity with wind speed for both DMS and CO2, but fails to provide a significant improvement in mean squared error compared to the emiprical wind speed model.&nbsp; We conclude the Reynolds parameter may not adequately capture the relevant sea state dependency.&nbsp; It may also be overly optimistic to expect a large decrease in mean squared error since other sources of additional random error (sampling error, etc.) may be much larger than variance related to sea state.&nbsp;

Biologically-derived soluble surfactants in the ocean are known to reduce gas transfer.&nbsp; Due to location and season, HiWinGS may be much less affected by surfactants compared to other cruises and this may explain the transfer suppression observed in previous field studies.&nbsp;
