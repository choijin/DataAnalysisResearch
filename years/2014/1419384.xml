<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for several international activities directed by the International Council for Science that are closely aligned with the strategic goals of the US Global Change Research Program (USCCSP) and with several NSF programs on Global Change Research.  This award will help support US leadership in international science activities and to enable collaborations that are mutually beneficial for US science and international partners in areas of global strategic importance.  These activities will principally focus on two global environmental research activities Future Earth and Integrated Research on Disaster Risk.  Future Earth is a ten year research program to provide the knowledge for responding effectively to the risks and opportunities of global environmental change and for supporting transformation towards global sustainability in the coming decades. It has developed out of the current ICSU-sponsored Global EnvironmentalChange (GEC) programs following a series of reviews and foresight exercises.  Integrated Research on Disaster Risk is a ten-year global undertaking that seeks to address the challenges caused by natural hazard events, mitigate their impacts, and improve related policy-making mechanisms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcome Report 2019     The National Science Foundation (NSF) Grant GEO-1419384 "Support for the International Council for Science (ICSU) global sustainability and environmental research activities" for the period 1 September 2014 &ndash; 31 August 2019 has built upon previous grants of NSF and lead to significant project outcomes.  Some Outcomes from the last grant period (covered by NSF grant GEO-1419384) include:  Building global scientific networks and communities  The ICSU regional offices in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean and Asia and Pacific, which played a key role in organizing regional consultations for Future Earth on behalf of the Alliance in 2011 and 2012, are continuing to promote the programme in their regions to ensure broader geographical representation and global diversity in the running of Future Earth. Scientists from the global south were enabled to participate in international sustainability conferences and regional Future Earth meetings and structures, such as scoping meetings for emerging Knowledge-Action Networks (e.g. the Health KAN and Risk KAN).  An international network of government science advisers (INGSA) was successfully launched and has been supported in organizing biennial conferences focusing on capacity building for science advisers around the world, with dedicated support for participants from the Global South. Vaughan Turekian (NAS) was on the Scientific Committee of the most recent conference (2018). Professor Kelvin Droegemeier, Director, Executive Office of the President, Office of Science and Technology Policy, gave a keynote talk at the ESAF (European Science Advisors’ Forum/INGSA joint meeting in Dublin in June 2019.     Supporting strategic international programme development  Reviews of the following international programmes/bodies have been carried out, to evaluate performance and give strategic direction for the future, with the participation of US scientists:  the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)   the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR)   the Programme on Integrated Research on Disaster Risk (IRDR)   the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)  the Urban Health and Wellbeing programme.(UHWB)     Convening global scientific input of relevance to the 2030 Agenda  ICSU coordinated scientific inputs to the development of the SDGs, and followed up with a well-received 2015 analysis of the SDG targets and a 2016 report on SDG interactions (‘Guide to SDG Interactions: From Science to Implementation’) targeted at policy makers. The ISC continues to engage actively in the implementation of Agenda 2030, including through its role as co-leader of the Scientific and Technological Community Major Group.  ICSU organized inputs into the UN Habitat III process that saw the adoption of the new Urban Agenda in 2015, a framework for action globally towards sustainable urbanization. Since then, ISC has worked with the urban scientific community to reflect on the implications of the SDGs and the New Urban Agenda for the kind of science needed, which resulted in a UCL-Nature Sustainability expert panel report on the future of Urban Science.     Strengthening of international science-policy interface mechanisms  ISC coordinated the first external review of the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) with regards to its four functions as knowledge generation, scientific assessment, policy support and capacity building and made recommendations to increase its effectiveness as a science-policy interface.     Bolstering knowledge infrastructures  The ICSU-CODATA Commission on Data Standards for Science convened the first "Inter-Union Workshop on Data Standards: Developing a Roadmap for Data Integration" which was held in Paris, France on 19-21 June 2017. The workshop comprised individuals or representatives of groups that are expert in the field. The major outcome of the meeting is a Roadmap of Priorities for inter-union cooperation and the ICSU-CODATA Commission.  Cooperation in global data governance has been advanced through support for the annual World Data System (WDS) committee meetings and contributions to the highly successful biennial World Data Conferences (2014, 2016, 2018), including support for early career researchers.  NSF funds enabled the science committee members to attend the 15th meeting of the World Data System Scientific Committee that took place on 16-17 September 2016 in Colorado, USA as well as help facilitate the Science Data Conference (‘SciDataCon 2016’) in Colorado from 11-13 September 2017 as part of International Data Week.  SciDataCon 2016 was a great success, with attendance figures reaching more than 600, a very rich programme covering a broad scope of themes, and a series of interesting keynotes. It was motivated by the conviction that the most significant contemporary research challenges&mdash;and in particular those reaching across traditional disciplines&mdash;cannot be properly addressed without paying attention to issues relating to data.   The Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) organized the OceanObs’19 conference on 16-20 September 2019 in Honolulu, with the ambition of improving coordination and capacity to deliver integrated and user-oriented observing worldwide. The ISC sponsored the conference and nominated scientists from developing countries to participate. Many US scientists were involved in the organizing committees.
