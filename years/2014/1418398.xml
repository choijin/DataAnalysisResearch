<AbstractNarration>This study will document the prevalence, type and quality of recovery plans in coastal counties throughout the southeastern U.S. and examine the effectiveness of recovery plans in reducing vulnerability to disasters.  Disasters disrupt communities and people's lives.  Socially vulnerable groups, including women, racial and ethnic minorities, the elderly, poor and persons living with disabilities may suffer disproportionately from disasters.  This may be in part because these groups do not participate in the disaster planning process or because their unique needs are not typically addressed in disaster plans.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An inclusive planning process that includes public participation and engagement of socially vulnerable groups will lead to higher quality recovery plans. Higher quality plans will, in turn, lead to more disaster resilient communities. A resilient community faces future disasters with reduced vulnerability, fewer inequities and a more sustainable future.  Research findings will also be translated into practice though partnership with a demonstration community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ While there has been a longstanding awareness that the needs of socially vulnerable populations are not well addressed in plan-making, there is still considerable debate over how to incorporate the voices and true desires of socially vulnerable populations to achieve equitable outcomes in disaster recovery.  Early planning theorists believed that planners could advocate for and represent the needs of socially vulnerable groups.  These ideas were later criticized for inadequately engaging socially vulnerable stakeholders in the plan-making process, failing to provide vulnerable groups with authentic decision-making authority, and inability to break down power relations so that vulnerable groups could shape their own destinies, not relying on others.   While there are many examples of how an active and engaged public, especially among vulnerable populations, can produce better outcomes in planning, this recognition has not been widely applied to the field of disaster recovery planning.   Our project, through a plan quality analysis, a household survey, and a survey and key informant interviews of emergency managers had several important findings.  Increased participation in general led to better plan quality scores overall. Public engagement in recovery planning is most successful when planners actively engage socially vulnerable individuals and groups directly and when dedicated staff are assigned to participation activities.  A majority of residents felt that recovery plans would be better if they incorporated input from a wide range of stakeholders, including socially vulnerable groups. The number one reasons residents did not participate was lack of knowledge that they could. Some vulnerable populations were less aware of the recovery plan, including the elderly and those living in poverty, while others were more aware, including those with children and those without access to a working vehicle.  Residents prioritized recovery activities around infrastructure and public safety, yet ranked activities related to public information and housing as less important.
