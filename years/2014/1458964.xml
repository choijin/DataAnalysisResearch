<AbstractNarration>Almost 30% of the Pacific plate south of the equator formed in a period where Earth's magnetic field was exceptionally stable. During this Cretaceous period, the Ontong-Java-Nui (OJN) volcanic outpouring also occurred, creating a large plateau (1/100 of Earth's area) that eventually split apart. With no reversals of the magnetic field to generate the characteristic crustal anomalies that allow scientists to track tectonic plate motions, it has not been possible to understand the cause-effect relation between this deep-generated volcanic activity and the change in plate motion at the surface. While satellite measurements provide some indication of seafloor structure, it is not possible to discern the narrow abyssal hills that form at the fast spreading centers that controlled the plateau breakup. Direct seafloor mapping and sampling are required. Undergraduate and graduate students will receive training in marine geological data acquisition during this study and some will participate in the post-cruise analysis via class projects. Podcasts of a research seminar will extend the reach of the new knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OJN breakup must have occurred via spreading at the Osbourn Trough, along unmapped spreading centers in the Ellice Basin. Like other early Cretaceous oceanic plateaus, the OJN seems to have formed near a triple junction. Better understanding of Pacific tectonics during the Cretaceous normal superchron should shed light on the connections between oceanic plateau formation, breakup, plate reorganizations and associations with mantle plumes. In addition, paleolatitude data from the super-plateau remnants can to be tied to a common Pacific reference frame to refine the Pacific apparent polar wander path, which could then be compared with the Indo-Atlantic reference frame to determine the relative contributions from hotspot drift and true polar wander. This is a long-term undertaking that will require several expeditions and contributions from multi-disciplinary investigators. This study takes the first step in this process with a multibeam survey of the Ellice Basin that will combine mapping of the central parts of this large basin where extinct spreading centers are likely to be located and remnants of fracture zones can be easily discerned. Coupled with selective dredging and Ar dating of basaltic rocks, including samples from IODP Site U1365 near Osbourn Trough, it will be possible to determine the timing of the inferred change in spreading direction, termination of Ellice Basin spreading, and the end of rifting along the Osbourn Trough.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funding for this project has supported a reconnaissance oceanic expedition to the poorly mapped Ellice Basin located in the Equatorial Pacific between the Ontong Java and Manihiki plateaus.  Based on limited ship data and satellite altimetry, Brian Taylor [2006] had proposed that the super plateau had split shortly after formation around 120 -125 Ma due to seafloor spreading in the Ellice basin as well as at the Osbourne spreading center, but due to the age of the basins, their depths, lack of good regional surveys, and the inability of satellite altimetry to discern abyssal hill fabric, it was unclear if the his hypothesis was viable.  In 2011 we had obtained 5 days of multibeam data via a collaboration with colleagues at KIOST in South Korea.  Co-PI Hamilton (participated in that survey and mapped part of the central portion of the Ellice Basin (we were restricted to international waters).  That data showed clear seafloor spreading fabric and formed the basis for our 2012 EPSL paper and the subsequent NSF proposal to expand the mapping of the basin.  We collected multibeam bathymetry, along-track potential fields, and 16 targeted dredges of seafloor basalt over a 36 day cruise during the 2016-17 holiday season.  The project was a collaborative undertaking between the University of Hawaii at Manoa and Oregon State University and supported two graduate students: one MS student at UHM and one PhD student at OSU.  We also had onboard assistance from a PhD student from the University of Sydney.  Due to R/V Kilo Moana scheduling delays we also ended up requiring the services of Eric Hellebrand (then at UHM) to step in as dredge master on short notice.  Our survey went well but a poorly calibrated/maintained multibeam system meant we lost bottom reflection to the higher noise-level in some channels when we mapped heavily sedimented regions of the seafloor.   The goal of the project was to better understand the evolution of the Ellice Basin as it opened up during the Cretaceous Quiet Zone and apparently split the two large plateaus mentioned above.  While not mapped by our expedition, the Osbourn spreading center further south apparently also split the Ontong Java Nui plateau into another piece, the Hikurangi Plateau.  Because there are no seafloor magnetic anomalies that can provide age control, we must instead rely on the dating of heavily altered samples of seafloor basalt collected by dredging several scarps along fracture zones.  We are still awaiting these dates due to a combination of a processing delay caused by an unfortunate fire at the OSU lab as well as the need to develop new techniques to date these highly altered rocks.  OSU is also dating earlier samples obtained near the Osbourne Trough as that reorganization also involved what is called the Manihiki plate (on which the plateau by the same name is located).  Meanwhile, we have processed the multibeam bathymetry and merged it with all available bathymetric data in the wider Ellice region.  This composite map allows us to confirm that extensive seafloor spreading took place between the Ontong Java and Manihiki plateus, apparently soon after plateau formation ceased or possibly even while still ongoing.  The initial plate motion during the early rifting is not yet resolved, but we have resolved a long stage of predominantly east-west spreading that is partly reflected in the large fracture zones that are visible in the satellite altimetry. Furthermore, closer to the basin center we have confirmed a second stage (which we speculate may be tied to a global reorganization event around 100-105 Ma.  Finally, intriguing evidence suggests that a third stage of spreading took place but this stage was aborted relatively soon and the central Ellice basin spreading activities ceased.  It is not clear where spreading continued afterwards but we speculate the spreading center jumped to the east of the Manihiki plateau.  Seamounts crossing the central Ellice basin have been dated in the ~92-95 Ma range and hence places an young age limit on the extinction of spreading.  As is often the case with reconnaissance surveys we are left with many more questions than answers, not entirely a bad thing of course.  The connection between Ellice spreading and the Nova Canton Trough (NCT) is very complex, and with a stage pole not far from the NCT the spreading fabric changes are of too short in wavelength to adequately resolve in satellite altimetry ? it will require further shipboard mapping to clarify the wider evolution of this area.  We anticipate that once the chronology of the samples has been established by OSU we will be in a better position to confirm or modify our hypothesis for when the various plate motion stages changed, which would allow us to better place the Ontong Java Nui breakup in a wider plate tectonic context of the Pacific basin.
