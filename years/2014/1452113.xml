<AbstractNarration>Using physical buildings as a metaphor for software systems is a well-established idea, dating back at least to Fred Brooks' book, The Mythical Man-Month, from the mid-1970s. A recent paper by Landwehr suggests that software systems on whose security we rely might be more trustworthy if the software analog of a building code were developed and applied to them. This proposal is to support planning and participant travel for a workshop that aims to develop both (1) an initial draft for a building code for a specific domain of software-controlled systems, medical devices, which compose a domain of cyberspace in which security and  trustworthiness are particularly critical, and (2) a related agenda for research into assuring desired security properties of such systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this workshop is to advance the adoption of proven techniques for assuring that software controlling medical devices is free of common sorts of vulnerabilities and to develop a research agenda that will provide the basis for continuing improvement of the security of future medical device software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop could lead to significantly less vulnerable medical device software systems and could also motivate appropriate research in the area. The techniques for using a building code structure can be used to extend the approach to other possible software domains where security is a critical consideration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A workshop was held to develop a draft building code for medical device software security and a related research agenda. The aim of the code is to reduce the security vulnerabilities present in future medical devices.  For each proposed element in the building code (such as a particular type of test or analysis) the class of vulnerabilities it addresses and the evidence of its effectiveness was sought.  Where there was inadequate evidence available for the effectiveness of a technique, that technique became a candidate for the research agenda.  The workshop was successful in achieving a consensus on a draft code and research agenda; the resulting reports are available at http://tinyurl.com/y7pcuacv and http://www.computer.org/cms/CYBSI/docs/BCMDSS.pdf.  The first presents both the workshop organization and the draft building code, while the second focuses on the draft building code proper.  Subsequently, the draft code has influenced the development of industry standards relating to medical device security and was input to an FDA workshop to identify gaps in medical device regulation.  Residual funds from the initial workshop were applied to a second workshop to develop a building code for power system software security, which produced a draft building code and research agenda for that domain; these reports are available at  http://tinyurl.com/yac2typg,  and https://www.computer.org/cms/CYBSI/docs/BCPSSS.pdf.   Again the first provides a full description of the workshop organization and the draft building code, while the second focuses primarily on presenting the draft building code.  Both workshops attracted the support of additional sponsors: the IEEE Cybersecurity Initiative (both workshops), and the Department of Energy?s Cyber Resilient Energy Delivery Consortium at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (power systems workshop only).
