<AbstractNarration>The proposed project seeks financial support to students and researchers to attend a Workshop o Defects on Wide Bandgap semiconductors. Some of the budget will also be used to partially support meeting expenses. The meeting will take place in the University of Maryland, College Park MD on September 22, 2014.. It is the first in its series to foster the important field of defects in wide bandgap semiconductors paving the way toward a better understanding of the fundamental limitations existing in power devices and electronics. Key researchers in the field have been invited to participate in the symposium A strong student and young researcher participation is also expected.</AbstractNarration>

However, a high density of crystal defects in WBG materials is significantly hindering the progress in realizing many of the beneficial attributes of WBG-based power electronics systems. For example, there is an overwhelming evidence to suggest that manufacturing yield and cost are critically controlled by material defects. Recent results also suggest that long-term field-reliability of WBG-based power electronics systems may be seriously compromised although definitive conclusions cannot be reached. The main objective of this one-day Workshop was to bring together nationÃ†s leading experts in the WBG supply chain to identify fundamental research needs in WBG materials for advancing power electronics switching applications.  Radically new material synthesis and characterization techniques with atomic-level control that lead to dramatic reductions in bulk and interface defects are needed for WBG materials operating at high voltages and extreme environments. This will require real-time in-situ material characterization during its synthesis and when the material is subjected to extreme environmental stress. The role of crystal defects on electronic properties in both the ground and excited states of the material under prolonged stressful field-operating conditions must be understood in order to assess the durability of WBG-based power electronics systems. The deliberations emanating from the workshop are summarized in this presentation which identifies the fundamental research needs in material synthesis and characterization techniques, and modeling and testing methodologies required to assess the role of material defects on long-term field-reliability.  In light of the current state-of-the-art of WBG power semiconductors, the Workshop attendees recommended the following key research topics: Investigate (1) radically new material synthesis techniques that show promise of low defect density at high growth rates in homo-epitaxial and hetero-epitaxial materials; (2) testing and modeling approaches for growth optimization and in-situ characterization of materials during and post synthesis procedure; (3) reliable and high-performance MOS interfaces with low gate oxide charge and interface state density; and, (4) device and test structures to evaluate the role of material defects on static and switching characteristics of high-voltage power devices.
