<AbstractNarration>This project examines the impact that regulatory policy has on out-of-hospital care provided by certified health professionals.  It examines the different ways that certified health professionals interpret regulation, follow rules, and understand their scope of practice, given the differing regulatory environments in which they operate. The research asks whether and how the professionalization and regulation of certified health professionals impact the provision of health care; whether regulation operates as intended; and whether voids created by the absence of regulation are filled by other means.  In addition, the research examines whether and how certified health professionals seek legal status and regulation, the varying ways in which law is mobilized toward this end, and the impact of such mobilization on the professional identities and legal consciousness of certified health professionals.  Answering these questions contributes to theoretical understanding of the important relationship between law and health, and has broad implications for policy-making and the regulation of health care outside of the dominant medical model.  The broader impact of the research also includes training and education of undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project utilizes ethnographic participant-observation, interview research, and documentary evidence coupled with interpretive social science methods in order to analyze the regulations surrounding out-of-hospital care in the United States.  In the face of a complex web of regulations and disparate enforcement state-by-state, the project focuses on three states where regulatory environments and implementation varies, and relies on a case study of Certified Professional Midwives (CPMs).  The findings of this research will advance sociolegal scholarship and theory on the implementation of laws, legal mobilization, and legal consciousness of social movement and professional actors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The "Impact of Regulatory Policy on Out-of-Hospital Care, Legal Mobilization, and Social Movements," set out to understand the complex regulatory network that certified professional midwives and their clients face, in the states where they are legal and regulated, legal and unregulated, and illegal and unregulated.  PI hoped to trace the impact of legal status and regulatory policy on 1) the provision of care, 2) methods of legal mobilization for legal status, and 3) the definition of the social movements meant to support that mobilization.    Funding for the project was instrumental in achieving several notable outcomes.   First, the funding enabled PI's participation in the BirthPlace Lab's mapping study - an interdisciplinary and international project undertaken by several scholars that maps data regarding birth outcome and the integration of care between midwives and other maternity care providers. That study's website, as well as the journal publication related to it, clearly show that the more highly integrated care is, and the more access to midwives that birthing people have, the better the outcomes.  The study also indicates, however, that the mere presence of regulatory policy -  of laws that legalize and regulate the practice of midwifery - does not guarantee integration of care and the attendant better outcomes.  The kind of regulation and oversight matters.  Indeed, the presence of law often aids in access, but it does not mean midwifery is well-integrated into care systems.   These findings, as well as interviews and ethnographic participant-observation with midwives and activists working in states where the practice is legal and regulated, led to a second (solo-authored) article on the limits of law and legal status to achieving autonomy in birth.  PI's research showed that even in legal states midwives face regulatory barriers to their actions that do not conform to best practices of the profession, as well as additional barriers to their practice in the form of social approbation and hostility from doctors and nurses in situations of transfer of care from home to hospital.   PI found that midwives and their advocates respond to the need for legal and social change in a variety of ways, and through both political and legal mobilization.  Relying heavily on guidance from their professional association, as well as national networks of midwives and consumers, state level advocates form consumer groups that lobby their state legislatures; they engage in political mobilization through letter-writing, electioneering, and legislative hearings; they engage in legal mobilization through the defense of midwives facing criminal sanction, and through support of women bringing tort actions after obstetric violence; and they engage in social movement activism meant to change cultures of birth in their locale by designing T-shirts that promote midwifery, hosting Labor Day picnics, Holistic Health Fairs, Red Tent events, and Birth Options Conferences, and providing community education on out-of-hospital birth.   Increasingly, and interestingly, midwives and their advocates are engaging a language of both professionalization and reproductive justice.  They seek licensure that recognizes their education and skill, as well as the ability to practice in ways that help to eliminate racial disparities in birth outcomes and access to care.  This convergence of goals is newly emerging in the consciousness and activism of midwives and clients.  PI's forthcoming book (Attending to Birth: Expanding the Margins of Reproductive Care; Stanford University Press) investigates the points of convergence and disjuncture in these multi-pronged strategies.  One of the goals of the manuscript is to understand the legal consciousness of movement actors who continue to seek law and regulation, even when to do so contradicts their understanding of the practices they seek to regulate - and even in the face of evidence that shows the limits of law for integration of care.  In addition to the two articles and one book as products of this funding, PI further developed a component of her class 'Reproductive Law and Politics,' to integrate the data and analysis gleaned from this project. PI also trained and worked with a team of seven undergraduate students over three years.  To varying degrees, those students engaged in interviewing, participant-observation, coding, and theorizing.  One of those seven is enrolled in a Masters of Public Health program, another is in their first year of a PhD in legal studies and geography.  A third works as a care coordinator for the armed services and is beginning to investigate PhD programs in sociology, and two others are in law school.    The remaining two have entry-level jobs in their chosen fields, where they use the skills they developed on the research team - particularly those in data analysis and entry, and critical and holistic thinking.  Through dissemination of the research in scholarly venues, anticipated dissemination to legislators and policy makers, and the ripple effect of student-participants (both on the research team and in the classroom), the impact of the work will be broad.
