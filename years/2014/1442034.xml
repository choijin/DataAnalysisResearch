<AbstractNarration>IEEE SECON is a premier research conference on wireless networking that has been the venue for presenting the latest research on sensor networks and the Internet of Things. It is one of the top four conferences in this space, the others being ACM Mobicom, ACM Sensys, and IEEE Infocom. The current conference scope is to focus on sensors, sensor networks and their applications, with its large and varied application domains. SECON 2014 will be held in Singapore in July 2014. By supporting 15 graduate students to attend SECON 2014, this proposal will increase the dissemination of the conference research results to a larger and a more diverse audience, which otherwise would not have been able to attend. In so doing, this proposal will contribute to the strength and inclusiveness of the research community, and will lead to the long-term health and vitality of SECON. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By giving preference in grant awards to women and under-represented students, the organizers hope to increase the participation among these groups. By advertising to a wide range of colleges and universities, participants from a more diverse set of institutions should be able to attend and benefit from the conference. A broad and diverse population is vital to the health of the research community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award was used to fund travel grants for four graduate students, attending US universities, to participate in the IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communications, and Networking (SECON) 2014. The conference took place in Singapore between June 30th and July 3rd.   A committee of three faculty members reviewed all travel grant applications and we were pleased to accept all applications. Each student received a maximum of $1,000 to be used to cover travel expenses.  We are pleased to inform you that we had a very successful technical conference. Starting from 234 submitted papers from 35 countries, 67 papers were accepted and presented in 17 technical sessions of the main conference (28% acceptance rate). In addition, 11 poster papers, 7 demonstration papers and 13 workshop papers were presented.  One of the goals of SECON is to encourage the development of promising young minds and talents in the field. To this end, the funding for student travel grants which NSF generously provided has enabled the committee to make travel grant awards to deserving individuals from US universities.   We and they appreciate your support that has allowed them to attend IEEE SECON 2014 where they interacted with leaders in the field. The conference was also enhanced by their presence, enthusiasm and high quality presentations and contributions.  The remaining funds will be used to fund future SECON conferences.
