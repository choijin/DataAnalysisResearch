<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project funded the post-doctoral studies of Mary Wootters at Carnegie Mellon University. The scientific focus of this project was on error-correcting codes.  Error-correcting codes are a tool to protect data from noise: suppose that a sender, Alice, wants to send a message to a receiver, Bob, but the message may become corrupted en route.  To overcome the noise, Alice will encode her message with an error correcting code, and send the resulting codeword to Bob.  Bob then sees a corrupted codeword, which he must decode to obtain Alice's message.  Error correcting codes have applications throughout computer science, mathematics, and electrical engineering, including in communication, storage, algorithm design, and complexity theory.  The goal of this research was to understand more about the structure of error correcting codes, and in particular around a notion called "list-decoding."  In the list-decoding setup, there is too much noise for Bob to uniquely recover Alice's message, and so instead he must do the best he can, returning a short list of possible messages that Alice might have sent.     This project produced the four research papers:  * The first paper (Rudra, Wootters, 2015) addressed a combinatorial question about list-decoding; the informal take-away is that "most" "nice" codes are near-optimally list-decodable.  Before this work, we knew of only a few very structured classes of "nice" codes that had this property, and so this work expanded our understanding of the combinatorics of list-decoding. This work was published in ITCS 2015.  * The second paper (Hemenway, Wootters, 2015) addressed the algorithmics of list-decoding, and gave a code for a related notion (called "list-recovery") which admits extremely fast, sublinear-time algorithms.  This work was published in ICALP 2015, and was invited to the special issue of ICALP in Information and Computation.  * The third paper (Guruswami, Wootters, 2016) developed improved algorithms for error correcting codes used in distributed storage.  More precisely, this work showed that Reed-Solomon codes, a standard in many distributed storage systems, can be decoded with less communication than the standard algorithms, saving bandwidth in data centers; this work has already sparked several follow-up works by other research teams.  This work was published in STOC 2016, and the journal version was later published in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory.  * The fourth paper (Hardt, Megiddo, Papadimitriou, Wootters, 2016), unrelated to coding theory, was about learning in the presence of strategic agents, and established a new algorithm for classification (for example, deciding if someone will be admitted to a school) in a setting where people might have an incentive to "game" the classifier.  This work was published in ITCS 2016.       While funded by this project, Wootters organized an interdisciplinary workshop on Algorithmic Coding Theory at ICERM, aimed at bringing together coding theorists working across different communities (math, computer science, and electrical engineering).   Finally, the project provided a valuable educational opportunity for the Wootters, funding her post-doc and giving her the opportunity to learn a new set of skills (specifically, algebraic coding theory) and to break into a new field (specifically, coding and information theory).
