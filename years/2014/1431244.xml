<AbstractNarration>Spectrum sharing plays a key role in realizing plans to make available new swaths of spectrum for wireless applications. The benefits of spectrum sharing cannot be fully realized without addressing interference among coexisting heterogeneous secondary networks. Although coexistence issues in the ISM bands have been studied before, the situation in the TV bands and other shared access spectrum (e.g., 3.5 GHz band) is more complex and challenging due to the signal propagation characteristics, incumbent protection rules, and the disparity of PHY/MAC strategies of secondary systems. To date, most research efforts have focused on incumbent protection, and little attention has been given to the coexistence of secondary systems in the context of spectrum sharing. The proposed research aspires to fill this void by 1. studying the viability of using stochastic neural networks for modeling and solving the CDM problem and 2. developing novel rendezvous techniques for unicast and multicast scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group plans to integrate project findings in relevant graduate courses at their respective institutions. In the second year of the project, the investigators will jointly organize a session on heterogeneous coexistence and spectrum sharing at the Virginia Tech annual Symposium and Wireless Summer School, which is an educational outreach event that serves the wireless industry. The group also proposes to give a tutorial presentation on heterogeneous coexistence and spectrum sharing at relevant conferences, including the IEEE DySPAN Conference, the flagship conference on dynamic spectrum access and spectrum sharing technologies. The group will also collaborate with our industry partners from Raytheon and Space Micro to demonstrate a sample of the proposed solutions on their spectrum-agile radio platforms.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The role of radio spectrum as a critical economic growth engine was highlighted in the National Broadband Plan (NBP) and in the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) report entitled "Realizing the Full Potential of Government-Held Spectrum to Spur Economic Growth".  Recommendations in the PCAST report include creating "the first shared-use spectrum superhighways".   The U.S. government has set in motion several initiatives to identify and make available new swaths of spectrum to support the development of new wireless applications and technologies as well as promote the development of new regulatory policies for maximizing spectrum utilization efficiency.       Many pundits predict that the recent spectrum initiatives set in motion by the federal government may trigger the next wireless revolution. Supporting this prediction is the overwhelming interest and participation by industry stakeholders in the ongoing development and standardization of spectrum sharing technologies.  Spectrum sharing enables heterogeneous wireless networks to coexist in the same or overlapping spectrum bands to maximize spectrum utilization efficiency. In such deployment scenarios, coexistence mechanisms are needed to enable "congenial" sharing of the spectrum among the coexisting networks. Without such mechanisms, harmful interference between the networks may degrade their performance, and may even threaten the viability of the wireless applications that are supported on those networks.         This project studied a number of key problems in the coexistence of heterogeneous wireless networks, including the following:  * Development of a coexistence decision making (CDM) algorithm.  A CDM algorithm is needed to make coexistence-related decisions and allocate spectrum. The CDM problem is different from the conventional spectrum allocation problem in a number of important ways.  The investigators advanced the state-of-the-art by devising a systematic method of modeling and solving the CDM problem.  * In-band signaling for collaborative coexistence. Collaborative coexistence mechanisms rely on information exchange mechanisms to enable heterogeneous networks to exchange coexistence-related information (e.g., traffic load or network characteristics) and negotiate the partitioning of the shared spectrum. Although using a dedicated out-of-band control channel simplifies the problem of enabling collaboration, the current/upcoming standards do not or are unlikely to support such an out-of-band channel.  The investigators have studied in-band signaling approaches that meet the performance requirements.  Building on their previous work, the research team developed in-band-signaling approaches that utilize rendezvous protocols.   * Quantifying the impact of coexistence on network performance.  Due to interference and constrained spectrum access opportunities, spectrum sharing between coexisting networks impacts the performance of those networks, and it is critical to quantify and assess this impact in order to develop more effective coexistence solutions.  The investigators studied the impact of spectrum sharing in a number of important coexistence scenarios, including coexistence between Wi-Fi and Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC), between radar and cellular networks, and between radar and Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT).        The project findings were disseminated through presentations, panel discussions, and journal/conference publications.  The investigators expect that the findings will have a significant impact on the ongoing research on shared spectrum access technologies, especially on the technologies being developed to take advantage of unlicensed spectrum.  The research findings are also expected to make an impact on the related regulatory policies that are currently being discussed or planned.
