<AbstractNarration>The project aims to improve how humans, particularly those with degenerative cognitive conditions or limited cognitive capacities, interact with complex computing or computer-enabled services (broadly called cyber-systems). To advance the state of user interfaces (UI) and create more adaptive interaction modalities, the foundational knowledge regarding human-cyber interaction (HCI) must incorporate more neuro-physiological evidence.  The project proposes a three-step plan for attaining this advance. First, three experimental subject groups will be carefully selected and recruited for comparative analysis: 1) healthy and young adults 2) demented or near-demented older adults, and 3) adults suffering from mild brain trauma. Second, experimental sessions will be conducted based on incrementally complex information searching and messaging tasks that require executing the tasks inside an MRI machine. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the experimental phase is to collect neuronal activation patterns using fMRI, as well as behavioral data associated with response time and accuracy.  Third, the experimental findings will be analyzed to establish potential association among neuronal evidence, behavior, and UI performance.  The broad technical aim of the initiative is to establish and refine methods for gathering neuro-physiological evidence under complex HCI conditions, and develop new user modeling techniques for supporting flexible and effective interaction.  Development of advanced user interfaces capable of monitoring and establishing risk factors associated with impending or existing brain-degenerative conditions is a longer term translational aim. The resources and outcomes produced will be broadly shared among scholars in computer and information science disciplines, with the aim of promoting and supporting training of next-generation HCI researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF funded Search-induced Neuro Activation Patterns (SNAP) project, grant #144896 (PI: Mostafa), has two primary foci: the influence of search complexity on neuronal activations and the association between behavioral responses and neuronal activations. The primary aim is to develop a set of behavioral "markers" associated with search activities that are indicative of a wide variety of physio-psychological conditions, including hard-to-detect and early-stage cognitively degenerative conditions.  Intellectual Merit  Last year was an active year for the project team.  The team published three papers and presented research findings in two international forums (see below).  A key advance we also made is expansion of our data collection to include subjects from the military, as was our original goal in the proposal.  The subjects were recruited from an active elite branch of the special-forces that are typically exposed to extreme warfare conditions (i.e., to evaluate them for subtle traumatic effects).   15 subjects were included from the special-forces in our study.   Although, ongoing validation is continuing, a remarkable level of similarity was discovered across subjects in terms of their behavioral and neuro-physiological responses (see included image) and the results also validated the outcome of the findings from the previous subject group.  The next phase of the work will involve collecting data from an elderly group.  Our aim is to involve both non-military and military subjects in the elderly group.   Our broad hypothesis is that the behavioral and neuro-physiological responses generated by the elderly group based on the easy tasks will be similar to the behavioral and neuro-physiological responses generated by the young adults on the hard/challenging tasks, potentially helping us reach two critical conclusions: 1) that there are systematic and predictable degradations in brain functions that may have concrete neuro-physiological basis (patterns we detect in the brain) and 2) behavior such as search interactions is likely to be marker for underlying neuro-physiological changes and their associated functions.
