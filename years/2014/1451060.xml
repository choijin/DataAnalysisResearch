<AbstractNarration>This award is for the partial support of the 2014 MRS Meeting Symposium H on Micro/Nano Engineering and Devices for Molecular and Cellular Manipulation, Stimulation and Analysis. This major international meeting will provide a single forum for discussion of the latest developments in biomedical research in molecular and cellular sensing, stimulation, and characterization. Regular meetings of the key researchers in this field are necessary for the exchange of ideas, information, and state-of-the-art technologies, in order to enable and accelerate advances and breakthroughs in the fields of biomedical science and nanomanufacturing. This international symposium is a key mechanism for linking basic science with engineering towards the development of nanotechnology-enabled biomedical applications, which are of significant importance to the US and world economies. This symposium offers a means for the open exchange of new and previously unpublished scientific ideas. It will include presentations and extended discussions and interactions among international participants. This gathering has been instrumental in the generation and incubation of breakthrough and transformative ideas in many areas of nanotechnology, nanomanufacturing and biomedical engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will partially support the participation of junior participants, including undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty members. The funds will support the attendance at the conference of 12 participants and undergraduate awards.</AbstractNarration>
