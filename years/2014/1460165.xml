<AbstractNarration>This project addresses coronal mass ejections (CMEs) which are violent expulsions of plasma from the Sun that contribute to space weather. It is vital to understand how these eruptions happen and how they propagate towards Earth in order to accurately predict their behavior. The current fleet of solar and space observatories provides unprecedented temporal and spatial coverage of the surface magnetic field, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray coronal structures. In this study, data-constrained simulations of CME initiation and propagation will be performed starting from realistic initial conditions for the magnetic field and plasma of an active region that contains a flux rope on the verge of eruption. These simulations will provide a unique opportunity to investigate the processes behind the eruption and early development of CMEs. &lt;br/&gt;The project has the following science objectives: 1) Develop models of CME initiation that are highly constrained by observations in order to study the early development phases of CMEs; 2) Constrain CME properties near the Sun (kinetics, morphology, shock and compression region parameters) based on the flux rope properties and the ambient coronal field, and 3) Reproduce the observed three-part and two-front structure of CMEs and their in situ properties using data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. &lt;br/&gt;Data-constrained non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) models of observed erupting active regions will be used as initial conditions to the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) global MHD code. The initial conditions on the active region and flux rope plasma will also be constrained by data using recently developed analysis techniques. These tools will be used to propagate more realistic CMEs to 1AU. The properties of the simulated CMEs (direction, velocity, acceleration, morphology, and shock-driving capability) will be compared with all available observations (coronal EUV and X-ray, white-light and in situ data).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Space weather profoundly affects life on Earth.  One key component of space weather is the existence of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are eruptions on the Sun that fling charged particles such as electrons and protons into interplanetary space.  These charged particles can interact with the Earth's magnetic field, and have adverse effects, including damage to satellites, interrupting airline communications, and disrupting electrical grids.  Modeling the initiation of these events and understanding the energy transfer during them is paramount in the prediction of space weather.  In this project, we used data from orbiting solar observatories to construct models of the magnetic fields of real events and used these models as the initial state in sophisticated simulations that derive the characteristics and propagation details of these events.  We find that the simulated CME produces observed quantites that are similar to the real CME, an exciting development that bodes well for future space weather prediction.  Addiitonally, this project explored the energy transfer during a simulated coronal mass ejection, based on a real eruption that ocurred in May of 1999.  We discovered that the heating of the material in the lower part of the CME was due to compression of the material as the magnetic fields changed shape during the eruption.  These findings are key to understanding how much energy is available for the CME.       Last Modified: 08/30/2019       Submitted by: Katharine K Reeves]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
