<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be in the availability of low cost thermoelectric modules that can be sold at a price that will allow them to be used in a wide variety of waste heat applications.  Two thirds of all of the energy produced in the world is lost as waste heat and a low cost thermoelectric module will make it economically viable to recover a portion of this energy as electricity.  Recovering waste heat in America will reduce pollution, greenhouse gasses and our dependence on foreign oil.  Recovering waste heat in developing nations will make affordable electricity available to many families for the first time ever.  A few watts of electricity will provide lighting and the ability to charge cell phones.  Examples of some products that can use low cost thermo electrics to generator electricity or to be self- powered are furnaces, water heaters, wood burning stoves and fireplaces, space eaters, engine heaters and other industrial heaters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to reduce the cost of the thermoelectric module by reducing the amount of the expensive bismuth telluride used in the module.  The amount of bismuth telluride used is reduced by using smaller elements but using smaller elements makes the effects of thermal expansion differences, high heat flux and high current fluxes more pronounced.  This proposal describes how these effects can be better understood and proposes several methods that can minimize them.  Proposed methods include replacing some rigid components with flexible ones and to build in features that will accommodate thermal expansion differences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PROJECT OUTCOMES REPORT  The Phase 1 project objective was to identify a method of fabricating a thermoelectric module that uses less bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) alloy than is used in state of the art power modules. The only widely used commercially successful thermoelectric modules use Bi2Te3. Despite decades of research, an economic alternative to Bi2Te3 has not been found. In this project, Hi-Z identified a practical method of drastically reducing the amount of Bi2Te3 that is used in a module. The alloy is expensive and is the largest single material cost in a thermoelectric power module. Using less Bi2Te3, the module cost could potentially be reduced to a fraction of its present cost. This was accomplished using two unrelated approaches.  In Phase 1,      module architecture was developed which could accommodate significantly      smaller Bi2Te3 legs. Previously the use of small      legs has limited the usefulness of thermoelectric power modules due to the      thermally induced stresses created during module operation which damage      undersized legs and/or their electric and thermal contacts. In Phase      1B, the legs were fabricated using net shape forming technology which      eliminates kerf losses (and thereby significantly reduces the amount of Bi2Te3 used) in traditional wafer/dicing fabrication of Bi2Te3 legs.    Small Legs  While reducing the size of the leg may seem obvious and is common practice with thermoelectric cooling modules, it is more challenging on power modules. The materials used in thermoelectric power modules vary widely in thermal expansion properties. As the modules are heated to the high temperatures commonly required for power generation these differences in thermal expansion create excessively high stresses that cause the legs to fracture or the electrical/thermal bonds to fail unless compromises in the module design are made.  When fabricating a module with very small legs these stresses are greatly exaggerated. To keep the module heat flux at a manageable level it is necessary to space the small legs further apart. This means that the space between the modules must be filled with a material that has a different thermal expansion coefficient that will move the legs at a different rate than the conductor joining the two legs. Alternatively, if the space between the legs is left empty then the conductors must be bonded to a plate that creates the same problem.  Very small legs have a correspondingly small contact area. Applying higher forces on a smaller area quickly increases the stress to unacceptably high levels.   This work demonstrated a method of using a flexible conductor to join two legs together. With a flexible conductor the legs are free to move building negligible stress.  Net Shaped Leg  Commercially available thermoelectric modules almost exclusively use Bi2Te3 as the thermoelectric material. Bi2Te3 is normally cast into directionally solidified ingots and then sliced and diced into legs of the appropriate size. Up to 50% of the original ingot is lost during the slicing and dicing process due to kerf losses and incomplete square legs cut from the cylindrical ingot.  Using powder metallurgy to form net shaped legs is difficult because Bi2Te3 has a unique anisotropic crystal structure with weak van der waals bonds. During conventional cold press and sinter operations air is entrained in the green leg during pressing. As the leg is sintered, this air is unable to escape and expands causing the leg to swell and delaminate along the weak van der waal bonds. To prevent this failure it is common to use expensive alternatives such as extrusions, spark plasma sintering or vacuum hot pressing. This project demonstrated a production friendly method of fabricating high quality net shaped legs.  Results  Phase 1 resulted in a demonstration module that produced full power but used 15% of the Bi2Te3 used in Hi-ZÆs original module and 35% of the Bi2Te3 used in Hi-ZÆs low cost module.
