<AbstractNarration>Our internal biological clocks are synchronized with our external surroundings and regulate our daily (circadian) rhythms of behavior and physiology. The mammalian circadian system is composed of multiple clocks located in the brain and throughout the body. Most studies have investigated the central clock in the brain, which synchronizes to the environmental cycle of light and dark. In contrast, other clocks, such as those that respond to feeding time, are "black box" mysteries because their locations in the body are unknown. In this project, behavioral, molecular, and mathematical approaches will be combined to investigate the timekeeping mechanisms of these elusive clocks and how they functionally interact with the circadian system to control behavior. These studies will identify genes that are important for timekeeping in these clocks and future studies evaluating the expression patterns of these genes could lead to the identification of the location(s) of these oscillators, which could transform our understanding of the function of the circadian system.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research is a unique opportunity for undergraduate and post-doctoral trainees to participate in a project that will address long-standing speculation about biological timekeeping. The studies will teach trainees about the value of experimental observation, creativity, and using multiple technical approaches when developing and testing hypotheses. Trainees from all academic levels, including a postdoctoral fellow, undergraduate students and high school students, and from diverse demographic backgrounds, including women and underrepresented minorities, will be immersed in an environment rich in the study of circadian biology. Finally, this project will provide opportunities for community outreach, because lab members organize and operate the biological clocks booth at free events for children of all economic and racial backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>

Organisms anticipate daily changes in environmental factors; this anticipation, critical to survival, is achieved by the circadian clock. Light entrains the light-entrainable oscillator located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus of the brain. There is another putative oscillator, the food-entrainable oscillator (FEO), which entrains to daily food availability and controls food anticipatory activity. The existence of another putative circadian oscillator has also been described, the methamphetamine-sensitive circadian oscillator (MASCO), for which the output can only be observed during long term exposure to low dose methamphetamine. Although it has been known that the FEO and MASCO are located outside of the SCN, the anatomical locus for these pacemakers has not yet been identified.     Intellectual Merit  The major goals of this project were (i) to identify genes that are important for timekeeping in the circadian clock that controls food anticipatory activity (FEO) and the clock that controls methamphetamine-induced circadian behavior (MASCO); and (ii) to investigate these circadian oscillators as components of the integrated circadian circuit (SCN-FEO-MASCO).  The overarching finding of this grant is that the outputs of the SCN, FEO, and MASCO are integrated to drive behavior. While the SCN is often considered the master regulator of locomotor activity rhythms, circadian researchers have underestimated the impact of the "secondary" FEO and MASCO pacemakers under normal conditions (ad libitum feeding and without methamphetamine). We found that the FEO and MASCO are coupled to the SCN and influence locomotor activity rhythms. Conceptually, this organization of ascendant pacemakers allows an organism to integrate distinct environmental inputs, such as light (day/night and season), food availability, and reward-related stimuli and then adapt the timing of its behavior accordingly.

Beyond the relevance to the basic understanding of the mammalian circadian system and regulation of complex behavior, these findings also have a translational impact. Both timed exercise and palatable snacks are highly accessible; therefore, these have the potential to be used as methods for treating human disorders caused by disruptions of the circadian clock.  These results were published in 6 peer reviewed journals.     Broader Impacts  The first broader impact of this NSF project was the scientific training and career development of high school, undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral trainees (9 total). These studies taught trainees the value of experimental observation, creativity, and using multiple technical approaches when developing and testing hypotheses. The trainees were from diverse demographic and ethnic backgrounds, and 78% were women, a population underrepresented in science. Importantly, all of the trainees have continued scientific research in their current positions.  The second broader impact of this NSF project was ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
