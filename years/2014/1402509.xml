<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium 2014" that will be held from May 27-31, 2014, on the campus of Kansas State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is the thirty-fourth installment of the Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium (GPOTS), a series that annually brings together a diverse group of mathematicians whose primary research interests are in operator theory or operator algebras. The main foci of the 2014 event are the following: the Kadison-Singer conjecture; classification of C*-algebras; applications of set theory to operator algebras; graph algebras; von Neumann algebras. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium (GPOTS) is an annual conference with a 34-year history, which has been hosted by 20 distinct institutions during this time.  Operator algebras and operator theory are closely related areas in mathematical analysis that interact with numerous other areas  of mathematics, while also providing bridges to theoretical physics and  computer science. The primary goal of GPOTS is to provide a forum for junior researchers and experts in the field to present their work to the community, exchange ideas, and forge collaborations.  GPOTS 2014, held on campus at Kansas State University from May 26-May 31, boasted over 130 registered participants (typical numbers for GPOTS are 80-120), over half of whom were graduate students or postdoctoral researchers.  Of the 15 plenary speakers; two were women, one was Hispanic, and one was a faculty member at a small liberal arts college.  60 of the registered participants contributed 10-20 minute talks.   Scientific themes and plenary speakers were selected to cover a broad range of subject areas within operator algebras and operator theory and to welcome experts in these areas into the GPOTS community:  at least five of the 15 plenary speakers had never before attended a GPOTS.  Two of the seven scientific themes -- foundations of math and the Kadison-Singer conjecture -- had not before been focus areas at GPOTS.  A six-person scientific committee, the members of which are well-known   experts in their areas as well as devoted mentors and leaders in the   community, contributed to planning these aspects of the  conference.  GPOTS, with its inclusive philosophy, has always played a large role in the development of human resources.  Traditionally, all participants are welcomed to contribute talks, with students and other junior researchers being especially encouraged to do so, while the presence of experts allows for interaction between the academic generations.  At GPOTS 2014, over half of the contributed talks were given by students or untenured faculty.  A new programmatic feature was introduced at GPOTS 2014:  scheduled open problem sessions.  These were designed to provide a setting more formal than a talk but more inclusive than a private conversation for participants to participate in new research.  These five hour-long sessions were each attended by several dozen participants.    All talks were held in a newly-renovated building on campus with a large lounge right outside the main lecture hall.  Dormitory space was offered to all participants at no cost (it was covered directly by the NSF funding); over half took advantage of this option.  Over the course of the week, there was a reception, an excursion to the Konza Prairie, a banquet, and several working lunches.  A "Women of GPOTS" lunch was an opportunity for junior and senior women to discuss work-life balance.   Reports from participants via a voluntary survey indicated that the conference facilitated mentoring relationships.  When asked to report on the results of interactions with senior researchers at GPOTS 2014, 30 of the junior researchers reported receiving feedback on their  talks, ten help on their job search, nine help with manuscript or thesis  preparation, and six help in other ways. Senior researchers reported administering such assistance in similar numbers.  Participants also reported progress on numerous projects started or discussed at GPOTS 2014, in such areas as graph algebras, operator algebras on L^p spaces, non-commutative function algebras from free analysis, and classification of C*-algebras.  Many participants reported forging new collaborations that have resulted in research in progress or manuscripts already on the math arXiv or in publication.   Comments volunteered on the participant survey include the following.   The organizing committee invited a wide range of scholars.   GPOTS  provided me with an excellent opportunity to interact with several  researchers regarding...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
