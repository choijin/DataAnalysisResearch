<AbstractNarration>Major scientific breakthroughs are accomplished by teams of scientists working together, remotely, and accessing distributed datasets and advanced tools via the United States and global research networks.  As new cyberinfrastructure technologies emerge to meet the growing needs of the science community, campus personnel at U.S. institutions must learn and adopt the new technologies for U.S. scientists to remain competitive.  This need extends to smaller colleges and universities where cutting edge expertise may be less readily available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this project, the Great Plains Network is partnering with experts to improve knowledge, expertise and research cyberinfrastructure at campuses in Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma and South Dakota.  Partners are KanREN, MOREnet, OneNet, Reed Network, Network Nebraska, Internet2, ESnet, University of Chicago and University of Oklahoma.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project objectives include benchmarking and periodically reassessing progress of campuses in the region toward implementing existing and emerging cyberinfrastructure technologies, developing and delivering an online curriculum to improve expertise, creating opportunities for campus participants to learn from leaders in advanced cyberinfrastructure and network technologies, providing outreach to campuses and building a community of support and encouragement for the implementation of new technologies.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project measures progress by growth in the number of active campus participants across this project's lifespan, growth in the number of unique campuses participating in the project, participant mastery of advanced technology concepts covered in training, and an increase in number of campuses implementing these specific technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project promises to directly benefit scientists in the fields of physics, bioinformatics, climate modeling, and weather forecasting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to build a long-term, scalable and enduring partnership among small, medium and large institutions of higher education and state and regional networks in Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma and South Dakota that could, ultimately, serve to improve campus network knowledge, expertise and research cyberinfrastructure through a program of outreach, training and engagement.   We termed this the ENCITE Project.   We added a sixth state, Arkansas, during the first year of the project.  As originally conceived, the project built on existing relationships between the Great Plains Network, the regional connector to Internet2 and ESnet, six state networks that connect to GPN, and the colleges and universities that connect to those state networks. The ENCITE Project also took advantage of long-term relationships among GPN, the state networks and national leaders in research and education.  Project activities included   Annual Meeting and Workshops, Online webinars in advanced cyberinfrastructure topics, Campus visits,  Training on grant proposal preparation, Facilitation of grant proposal development in science and technology.   We trained several hundred individuals via online training, campus visits, and workshops.  Individuals who attended webinars were located at campuses throughout the United States.  They indicated that the material presented was highly useful and often impacted the direction of cyberinfrastructure development on their campuses.    Campus visits were also quite successful, but did not occur in every state because the state networks were not all equally well developed in each state. In the the future, we would recommend that when working through other organizations, in this case the state networks, that the PI consider engaging a part time individual in each organization to work directly on the project.  The effort expended on the ENCITE Project lead to the development of improved relationships between faculty and staff representing information technology, research and science (e.g., chemistry, physics, humanities, education), and administrative domains, to improved information technology planning and awareness, and to improved cyberinfrastructure skills across campuses in the targetted region and beyond.
