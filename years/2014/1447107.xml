<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on theoretical and computational developments needed for the next generation of seismic models. This effort concentrates quantifying the impact of uncertainties in models and to rigorously incorporate uncertainties into the algorithms behind the models.  The last decade has seen considerable improvements in modeling capability and a substantial expansion of geophysical observations including data from dense seismic networks, networks of permanent GPS installations and spatially synoptic geodetic imaging data from orbiting radar and optical satellites. Despite these efforts, perhaps the biggest obstacle to significant progress in observational earthquake source modeling arises from imperfect predictions of observations due to uncertainties in Earth structure - the impact of which are generally overlooked. Indeed, for large earthquakes, our ability to measure ground motions far exceeds our ability to model them.   The expected benefits of this approach include improving the sharpness of our images of seismic and aseismic fault slip processes -- thereby directly impacting both our models for fault mechanics and inferences of seismic hazard.   The algorithms developed here are directly applicable to other problems such as models of volcano deformation. All tools developed here will be documented and openly available to the geophysical community as open source.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops the concept of the misfit covariance as used in inversions for the distribution of slip on subsurface faults. The misfit covariance is a combination of covariances in observations (often assumed independent) and covariances associated with inaccurate model predictions (often entirely ignored). Yet, this prediction error can dwarf the observation error and can induce important covariances between observations. These covariances dictate the relative weighting between disparate data types as well as the information content found in observations from dense networks.  The proposed approach to estimating the full model prediction error relies on developing computationally tractable methods for estimating the sensitivity of geodetic and seismic observations to perturbations in assumed material properties.   This approach exploits recent advances in Bayesian earthquake source modeling and new massively parallel computational approaches using GPUs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focussed on improving our understanding of the physics of subsurface fault slip associated with large earthquakes as well as the behavior of faults that slip aseismically.  For example, an important question is to discrimentate exactly which portions of a fault 'stick slip' producing earthquakes, versus which portions tend to creep or slide aseismically.  Answering questions of this nature requires us to increase the fidelity or focus by which we can image fault slip.  This goal is challenging since we are limited to observations on the surface of the earth in order to image what is going on below the surface.   In other words, this kind of imaging is inherently difficult and susceptible to artifacts due to both noise in our observations and limited sensitivity to processes happening at depth.  Typically, most imaging approaches can only recover very blurry and muted images that challenge our ability to answer important geophysical questions such as that posed earlier.  To this end, we developed the theoretical, algorithmic and computational basis for the next generation of finite-fault slip models. Our general formalism avoids unnecessary smoothing of the inferred images and quantifies the impact of epistemic uncertainties (i.e., errors in our model assumptions) and rigorously incorporates such uncertainties in approaches designed to constrain models using observations from geodesy and seismology.   These new generation of models directly impact both our understanding for fault mechanics and thus eventually our inferences of seismic hazard.  In addition, as these tools rely on high performance computing approache, particularly the use of GPUs, we believe we are advancing the general capabioities of geophysical inverse theory and HPC methods.  This project trained several new Ph.D. students, with results published as 4 articles in top-ranked journals.  We have applied our tools to data from earthquakes in South America and Italy and have thus also increased our understanding of local geophysical processes in these vulnerable areas.    All developed software is freely available and documented.         Last Modified: 05/19/2020       Submitted by: Mark Simons]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
