<AbstractNarration>This collaborative research project contributes to theories of rights mobilization and claims making through consideration of how local political and civic context shapes rights mobilization and implementation.  Research is based on in-depth interviews with federal, state and local government officials, representatives of advocacy groups and other civil society organizations, and persons making labor rights claims to ascertain how variation in political and civic context affects legal consciousness, willingness to mobilize around rights claims, implementation strategies, and government accountability.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several broader impacts will result from this research.  First, research findings will inform debates over how best to implement federal rights initiatives that seek to improve educational and occupational mobility as well as civic engagement.  Second, this research will inform the work of various community organizations and government institutions responding to rights claims and their implementation.  Finally, this project will inform course development and research training of graduate students in two public universities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In June 2012, President Obama created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to offer qualified young undocumented immigrants a 2-year (renewable) stay of deportation and the ability to apply for a legal work permit.  DACA signified an important departure from the federal enforcement-only approach in place for over two decades, potentially expanding the residence, education, and labor rights of up to 1.76 million young undocumented immigrants (Batalova and Mittelstadt 2012).  DACA, however, is a federal administrative directive, not a law, and unlike the last major legalization program in 1986, no federal resources were ever allocated for its implementation. The case of DACA therefore raises questions about how new rights resulting from administrative, rather than legislative or judicial, relief are actually implemented in local communities.     In this research we analyzed (1) how federal, state, and local government bureaucracies on the ground responded to a sweeping new unfunded federal rights directive like DACA, (2) how civil society organizations mediated the implementation of large-scale policies like DACA, and (3) how young undocumented immigrants made claims on their rights after receiving a temporary reprieve from deportation and the new legal right to work.  Our aim was especially to determine how local context affects the implementation of federal policies such as DACA, with a focus on how federal, state, and local government bureaucracies, civil society organizations and consular office coordinate, and how immigrants navigate the resources available to them.      Our findings reveal several key trends.  We find that community organizations, local government officials, and consular representatives engage in a combination of outreach strategies, including one-on-one sessions with DACA-eligible individuals and workshops/group processing sessions. They each have their advantages as well as constraints and challenges.  We found that local government funding in the San Francisco Bay Area and the New York City Metro Area was instrumental for increasing awareness about DACA and for boosting DACA applications.     Beyond government entities, collaborations between different organizations (e.g., immigrant rights groups, legal service providers, foundations, faith-based organizations, etc.) and between different sectors (public sector/government and private sector/various civil society organizations) are important in the implementation of the DACA program in each of the three metro regions where we conducted research. However, we also find that collaborations have formed at different times and for different reasons, and the collaborations are funded and managed in different ways across regions. Differences in political context (at the local and state levels) play a role, but so do the composition of the local immigrant populations and density and maturity of the local infrastructure of civil society organizations.     Individuals have benefited significantly from the deportation relief and work authorization provided by DACA.  DACA has also opened educational opportunities to beneficiaries, as well as various credentials and licenses that were not previously available.  However, the legal aid resources available for accessing the program have varied from region to region, with suburban and rural areas facing particular access challenges.  Low-income individuals (the vast majority of DACA recipients) also struggled significantly to meet the fee to apply for DACA and to collect required documentation.   We also find that certain communities remain underserved, such as those in urban, suburban, and rural areas, and among older immigrant applicants who are not college-bound or college-educated, and in the Asian immigrant community.     Moving forward, our findings confirm the importance of a clean path to citizenship for all undocumented immigrants that includes federal investments in immigrant rights and integration.  The recent months of policy uncertainty around DACA have threatened the progress local communities have made. Our findings suggest that federal officials should work with&mdash;not antagonize and threaten&mdash;state and local officials who have developed innovative policies to advance immigrant well-being, while holding accountable those sub-national officials who terrorize immigrant communities.  Federal officials should also partner with civil society&mdash;including well-established funders and community organizations as well as new ones&mdash;to implement any future federal expansions in immigrant rights.  This research confirms that we are better served with investments in immigrants? integration into and not their exclusion from American society.
