<AbstractNarration>Hypoxia occurs when dissolved oxygen concentrations in aquatic habitats drop below levels required by living organisms.  The increased frequency, duration and intensity of hypoxia events worldwide have led to impaired health and functioning of marine and freshwater ecosystems.  Although the potential impacts of hypoxic exposure are severe, there is little known about the consequences of systemic, sub-lethal exposure to hypoxic events for populations and communities of fishes.  The objective of this project is to determine whether sub-lethal exposure to hypoxia during early life stages leads to poor growth and hence increased mortality.  This project will use "environmental fingerprint" methods in fish ear stones (otoliths) retrospectively to identify periods of hypoxia exposure.  The project will compare consequences of hypoxia exposure in different fish species from the Gulf of Mexico, the Baltic Sea, and Lake Erie, thus examining the largest anthropogenic hypoxic regions in the world spanning freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems.  In addition, the research will increase awareness of hypoxia-related issues by disseminating curriculum materials to high schools in southern Texas that are dominated by Hispanic and Latino American students.  As a part of this program, two high school teachers will be sponsored to participate in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration "Teacher At Sea" program, where they will gain first-hand experience in biological sampling in the northern Gulf of Mexico "Dead Zone" and help lead teacher training workshops for additional high school teachers to implement hypoxia-related curriculum in their classrooms.  In addition, this project will contribute significantly to basic information for critical stakeholder groups in Baltic Sea and Great Lakes fisheries via the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea and the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission.  Two graduate students and one post-doc will also be supported in part by this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will employ long-term, permanent markers incorporated into fish otoliths to identify life-long patterns of sub-lethal hypoxia exposure far beyond time spans currently achievable using molecular markers.  This work will capitalize on patterns of geochemical proxies such as Mn/Ca and I/Ca incorporated into otoliths and analyzed using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to identify patterns of sub-lethal hypoxia exposure.  The investigators will then determine whether exposure results in differential growth and survival patterns compared to non-exposed fish by tracking cohorts over time and identifying characteristics of survivors.  Because this work involves multiple species in multiple hypoxic regions, it will allow cross-system comparisons among unique ecosystems.  The results from this project will thus provide unprecedented insight into effects of hypoxia exposure in three major basins using novel biogeochemical proxies, thereby paving the way for a fuller understanding of the impacts of "dead zones" on coastal resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Aquatic hypoxia, or water containing such low oxygen so as to be harmful to many higher forms of life, is expanding in the world's oceans, estuaries, and great lakes.  Hypoxia can have many different kinds of effects on organisms, including physiological stress, slower growth, damaged reproduction, and even death.  But some organisms can swim away from hypoxic waters, allowing them to survive even if they experienced hypoxia for a little while.  We often do not know the full impacts of hypoxia because it is difficult to find out if a fish swam through hypoxic waters at some point earlier in its life.  In order to answer questions about the full effects of hypoxia, we need an internal indicator of hypoxia exposure histories within organisms like fish.  In a novel study, we developed and refined proxies of individual fish exposure to hypoxia by taking advantage of the "data-logging" properties of fish otoliths.  Otoliths, which literally means "ear-stones," are small, calcium carbonate organs that form part of the fish's hearing and balance system.  Otoliths grow throughout a fish's life, laying down growth rings much like trees do, and thus they provide a natural calendar-clock for every fish (Figure 1).  Besides visual patterns, chemical information is incorporated as trace concentrations of various elements and isotopes.  Lifetime records can be measured by taking fine-scale transects from the otolith core, which formed at birth, and continuing through the growth bands to the outer edge, which formed just before the fish was captured.  Otolith elements can also be quantified by making two-dimensional maps of entire cross-sections of the structure (Figure 1c).  In the case of hypoxia, we found that the trace element manganese (Mn), which is dissolved in the water at low oxygen levels, is available and is taken up by fish and eventually incorporated into the otoliths at the time of exposure.  We found that Mn uptake is affected by the fish's growth rate as well as by low oxygen in surrounding waters.  We discovered that another trace element, magnesium (Mg) is also sensitive to growth rate and appears to be related to metabolic rate in many fish taxa; but it is only indirectly sensitive to hypoxia.  Thus, we can divide Mn by Mg concentrations to at least partly remove the influence of growth rate on the hypoxia proxy.  We studied exposure and impacts in four fish species in three regions of the world known for chronic to severe hypoxia: the Baltic Sea (cod and flounder), the Gulf of Mexico (Atlantic croaker), and Lake Erie (yellow perch).  In all species, the Mn/Mg proxy picks up the hypoxia signal.  We find, however, that the responses to exposure are varied.  Baltic Sea cod appear to be the most severely impacted by hypoxia; cod are in declining body condition (Figure 2).  Heavily exposed cod have lost on average 39% of their length and 64% of their body weight at Age 3 compared to healthy cod (Figure 3).  Their growth is further compromised by parasites and diseases that cannot be fought off due to lower metabolism caused by lack of oxygen.  In the Gulf of Mexico, hypoxic waters form every summer because of warming surface waters and the massive inputs of nutrients and fertilizers from the Mississippi River that fuel massive blooms of phytoplankton which consume oxygen when they decompose.  This creates a large area of hypoxia called the "Dead Zone."  This "Zone" is patchy and changes in size over time, however, so the magnitude of fish exposure was unknown.  Using our otolith tracking procedure, we found that between one-quarter to one-half of all Atlantic croaker showed evidence of hypoxia exposure in their first year of life.  This means a large proportion of this fish survives hypoxia.  There were no major apparent effects of the hypoxia exposure on growth of survivors, perhaps because Atlantic croaker have a greater physiological tolerance of low oxygen compared to a species like cod.  However, croaker that experienced the most hypoxia showed evidence of significantly altering their food web interactions, perhaps as a result of swimming away from hypoxic waters at the bottom of the sea floor.  These results highlight the complex responses of various fishes to hypoxic stress, and the responses can differ significantly depending on the species and system.  Our project showed that internal chemical indicators within a fish can reveal an amazing amount of information about their movements and life history, including exposure to stressful hypoxic waters. Additionally, it led to a surprising discovery of a tracer of lifetime fish condition.  Our results provided essential information about the magnitude of hypoxia exposure and the impacts on growth and performance of mobile fish species.
