<AbstractNarration>Species have been identified and classified by taxonomists using morphological traits for millennia, but only recently has it been possible to understand the genetic changes causing these differences.  Flying fishes (Exocoetidae) have extremely exaggerated paired fins and an extended lower caudal lobe that allow them to glide for extended periods out of water, whereas the closely related halfbeak group (including Medakas) have normal fin extensions.  In this project researchers will test the hypothesis that Potassium channel genes that are affect caudal fin lobe length variation in zebra fish are also regulating caudal fin morphology in flying fishes.  A new analysis pipeline will be developed to: 1) identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) correlated with differences in fin length within exome sequences of flying fishes and Medaka, and 2) map these SNPs onto the zebra fish genome to allow for functional testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will train a graduate student in diverse developmental, genetic, systematic and evolutionary techniques and will deposit extensive genome sequence data from flying fishes in public databases. The analysis pipeline developed to analyze the SNP data will also have broad applicability for other researchers interested in investigating the genetic basis of morphological evolution in non-model species.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ After diverging from a shared common ancestor, closely related species frequently develop changes in the relative sizes and proportions of their organs and tissues. These changes can reflect species-specific adaptations that underlie much of the obvious physical differences between species. How organs and tissues know when to stop growing at appropriate sizes, and how they vary in size during evolution are fundamental questions in both evolutionary and developmental biology.  Outside of laboratory model systems, little is known about the genetic changes associated with variation in organ sizes during evolution.  Unfortunately, as there are relatively few genetic tools and resources for the vast majority of species, making inroads into this question is challenging.     In this grant, we developed and expanded a genetic technique to access near complete protein-coding DNA sequence from many related species that had lacked and previous genetic information. Using this approach, we produced a large dataset of genetic information that can be analyzed for identifying genetic patterns associated with shifts in skeletal proportions in the Beloniformes fishes.  The Beloniformes group of fishes includes the flying fishes, which can leap out of the water and use greatly elongated fins as wings for aerial gliding in the escape of predators.  Using genetic and experimental tools for understanding fin growth in the laboratory model fish species the zebrafish, we have initiated experimental validation of several of these genetic changes identified during the evolution of this group to address whether these can cause increases in fin length.  Beyond our investigations into changes in proportionality and organ size regulation, the Beloniformes dataset is useful itself for a wide variety of evolutionary questions and will serve as a community resource.     The techniques developed through this grant could be applied to nearly any species. Thus, diverse questions in biology could be addressed through comparing sequence information from groups of related organisms with variation in traits of interest. These large datasets can then support the broad scientific community in addressing numerous biological questions. Further, as many threatened and endangered species lack prior genetic information, this approach could be applied to catalog large amounts of genetic diversity and potentially be used to monitor and set conservation regulations.
