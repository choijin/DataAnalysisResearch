<AbstractNarration>All nanoscale devices are subject to random diffusive forces that lead to slow, uncontrollable transport of materials and information.  Synthetic nanoscale systems designed for computational  and self-assembly tasks, require more precise control over energy- and information-carrying molecules.  Such systems include nanoscale devices currently being developed for delivery of diagnostic logic circuits to cells, querying the state of health of specific cells or subcellular structures, and conditional release of therapeutic cargo molecules. Ideally, such systems could employ programmable synthetic molecular motors to ferry information and materials in directed motion over a complex network of tracks, analogous to natural molecular motors in living cells, thus enabling behaviors otherwise not possible in a purely diffusion-driven environment. In this project computational models, simulation algorithms, and data visualization tools will be developed that will help synthetic chemists build the next generation of nanoscale walker systems. In the project, students at all levels (high-school to postdoctoral) will be trained in interdisciplinary research. High-school students will be engaged on the project through already established, tracked science involvement programs that emphasize participation of traditionally underrepresented groups. In the context of the project, a regular seminar will be developed on nanoscale technology, molecular computing, and molecular robotics within the biomedical engineering degree program, to educate future generations of students (undergraduate and graduate) in this emerging field of science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous work has shown that simple DNA-enzyme driven synthetic walkers can move superdiffusively along nanoscale tracks, and can do mechanical work. In this project more advanced walker designs with large, complex body shapes and heterogeneity in their interactions with other walkers and molecules in their environment will be modeled and simulated.  This class of structured walker scaffolds will exhibit modes of motion not available in symmetrical walkers, e.g., rotational persistence, orientation-aware sorting, chiral walker-walker and walker-track interactions.  These features will be used to break symmetries in the walker's local environment, leading to stronger directional biases and more efficient directional transport. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to understand the algorithmic basis of how a walker's shape and structure affect its motion, and how these features can be composed, modularly, into larger nanoscale transportation systems with programmable control, to achieve directed transport even under the randomizing and disorienting influence of Brownian motion. The models developed will enable more complex nano systems to be engineered to take advantage of programmable nanoscale transport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach taken in the project is computational. Walker motion is treated as a continuous-time Markov process, at a level of abstraction that balances physical detail and computational tractability.  A hierarchy of Monte Carlo simulations will be developed to approximate physical and chemical processes at the appropriate relative scales, while maintaining computational tractability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aimed to understand the engineering and computational potential of multivalent catalytic molecular-scale walkers, which are a class of synthetic molecules typically consisting of a small protein "body" and several attached "legs" made of DNA.  The project focused on designs where the DNA strand in a leg is catalytic and capable of cleaving other DNA strands present on the walking surface.  The project explored the design space of such walkers through a combination of mathematical analysis and computer simulation.  Among the guiding questions were: How can we improve the speed at which a walker explores the surrounding territory? Can teams of walkers be put together to further improve the exploration? Can simple computation be achieved by coordinated the movement of walkers on a specially prepared landscape?    Among the principal research outcomes:  1. Designed and implemented software for writing efficient simulations of walker systems, and more generally scientific simulations, in the high-level programming language python, by translating core computations to machine-level code on the fly.  2. Developed a mathematical analysis for tethered molecular walkers placed on independent tracks, showing that in this scenario single-legged walkers can perform better than two-legged ones.  3. Developed a model of single-file walkers with memory, showing the existence of a phase transition between an ordinary diffusive (slow) phase when catalytic effects are low and a superdiffusive (fast) phase with higher catalytic effects.  4. Developed a model for spatially distributed computation in which signal-carrying walkers race on tracks and pass through gates on custom-designed surface to compute logic functions.  5. Developed a theoretical framework and fast parallel algorithms to detect individual particle-binding events between pairs of fluorescently-marked walkers, or other chemically interacting particles, from the noisy single-particle trajectories from experimental samples.   Among the principal educational outcomes, two postdoctoral scholars and three graduate students were trained in interdisciplinary research. Two PhD dissertations were completed with support from the project.         Last Modified: 10/05/2019       Submitted by: Darko Stefanovic]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
