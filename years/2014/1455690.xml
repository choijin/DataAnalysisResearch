<AbstractNarration>The Arctic is an integral part of the Earth system where multiple interactions unite its natural and social domains. The Arctic's significance derives from growing evidence that it is experiencing rapid and amplified signatures of global climate change and that the region could itself be a critical throttle on planetary dynamics. Ongoing assessments of how the Arctic system is wired-together and how sensitive its environment is to change remain highly uncertain. We have entered an era when environmental management must confront regional, whole biome, and pan-Arctic challenges. Consequently, the science and policy issues surrounding Arctic system change are highly intertwined, interdisciplinary and constitute a quintessential synthesis challenge. Understanding this challenge requires the development of a collaborative research framework that can not only improve our understanding of the Arctic system, but also promote interdisciplinary science on Arctic coupled systems, connect science with policy, educate the next generation of students and make Arctic research relevant to the public. This award will support an effort to begin that process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this award are to design an Arctic Synthesis Collaboratory concept through a formal, community-based planning exercise, which will use a series of four workshops to identify tractable core science questions that contribute to systems-level Arctic research. The workshops will also assess linkages to ongoing activities within the Arctic research community, explore the readiness of modeling, data and observatory assets, and identify opportunities to apply systems-level thinking in the policy-formulation realm and in other educational activities. Discussion would also focus on the appropriate structure and function for such a collaboratory partnership. These four workshops will bring together members of different Arctic disciplinary research constituencies and provide input to a strategic report that will serve as a potential roadmap for a community-designed Arctic systems synthesis research agenda and supporting collaboratory. Ultimately this should advance the approach taken by the research community and help align research efforts with societal needs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project and its resulting report (Opportunities and Challenges in Arctic System Synthesis: A Consensus Report from the Arctic Research Community, 2018) present arguments for new science to study the Arctic as a system, recognizing that the High North has unique strategic importance to the nation and to the world&mdash;in terms of its resource base and economy, sociopolitical dimensions, and, of course, as a critical throttle point for global change. Improved understanding will therefore be essential in order to manage this important element of the planet. The research community is poised for significant growth in understanding the role of the Arctic as a system, with that position afforded by recent research into the interplay of its physical, biological, chemical, and social science components. In this project, several workshops were convened to identify core science questions, challenges and opportunities to forward systems-level thinking across the Arctic.     INTELLECTUAL MERIT  For this work, the Arctic system was defined as a suite of coupled atmosphere, ocean, and land subsystems distributed across the high northern latitudes, interacting with themselves and the lower latitudes of the Earth system. An important conceptual framing was added to this definition, with these interactions and interconnections best viewed as a series of what are termed currencies, the most important of which comprise the cycles of water, energy, carbon, and major biogeochemical nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus.  Major recommendations of this report are based on a consensus recognition of the need for strategic national commitments that support research programs capable of producing: 1) a more comprehensive understanding of the sources, scope, and impact of Arctic-system change ; 2) integrated models and databases to better understand the Arctic as a system; 3) long-term data collection in the Arctic at sufficient temporal and spatial scales to understand the links between extreme events and changes ongoing across the region; 4) improved understanding of the linkages between model results and observations; 5) a co-design process for new research that reflects the interests of system researchers together with those of decision-makers and practitioners; and, 6) support for infrastructure, operations, community engagement and education, and cross-disciplinary research opportunities.     BROADER IMPACTS  The community has made great strides using many fundamental technical resources already in existence, including key measurements from Arctic observatories as well as advances in modeling approaches and analysis tools. And, over the last decade, Arctic researchers have begun to not only approach Arctic research questions from multiple disciplinary perspectives, but also have begun to adopt into their studies what traditionally have been isolated approaches and under-utilized data sets. A rich information archive is accumulating, including data from global satellite observations, buoys and moorings, permanent and ephemeral meteorological stations, and isolated process studies that advance knowledge of system mechanics and dynamics. Efforts toward higher-level syntheses and data fusion will stimulate new technologies and analyses, which will enable more science-based input into policy dialogues. This benefits basic science, but such a result will also yield improved decision-making for addressing the growing number societally significant changes that are happening across the Arctic.  Thus, the key recommendation of this study is a call for a revitalized and deepened national commitment to a coherent program of systems-level research, by its very nature interdisciplinary and capable of accelerating the development of state-of-the-art experimentation, observatories, data processing, and simulation modeling. It is also recognized that such an effort will not succeed without an affiliated dialogue, organized as a coordinated effort that engages a broad cross section of Arctic researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and Indigenous stakeholders to identify, requisition, interpret, and act upon the systems-level knowledge that will be necessary to effectively adapt to and potentially attenuate the many interconnected impacts of Arctic system change.  The research challenge discussed in the final report are made all the more timely by rapid changes in the Arctic?s climate, biogeochemistry, and socioeconomic systems and in the broader context of global change in the Anthropocene.
