<AbstractNarration>PI: Victoria Sork (University of California-Los Angeles)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoPIs: Matteo Pellegrini (University of California-Los Angeles), Paul Gugger [University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (UMCES), Appalachian Laboratory] and Steven Salzberg (Johns Hopkins University) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Senior Personnel: Shawn Cokus and Sorel Fitz-Gibbon (University of California-Los Angeles)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oak trees, which contain more biomass in North American ecosystems than any other tree genus, provide major economic and ecosystem value to society. Valley oak, a keystone species for biodiversity in California, provides an excellent study system for the development of genomic tools that can inform management for economic use, conservation, carbon sequestration, and restoration of resilient forests threatened by climate change. This project will produce a high quality genome sequence for valley oak and annotate the structure and functions of different parts of the genome as an intellectual resource for the scientific community and resource managers. The data will be helpful to forests geneticists working on oaks throughout the Northern Hemisphere, and it will also provide new insight about the evolution of adaptation to climate and contribute to the current understanding of which parts of the genome are important in adaptations to different environments, and which provide information important in managing oak forests under climate change.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability of plants within the same species to grow across heterogeneous environments is a major topic for plant science. Given the rapid rate of climate change, the ability of long-lived plant populations to respond to these changes is an urgent question. The major goal of this project is to use state-of-the art whole-genome sequencing approaches to develop genomic resources for understanding local adaptation of valley oak (Quercus lobata) to different environments, as well as provide a resource to the broader scientific community and natural resource managers. Taking advantage of unique features of this keystone California oak, this project will (1) provide a complete, high-quality sequence of the valley oak genome with structural and functional annotations of genic regions and repetitive elements; (2) whole-genome sequences and genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from 190 trees from natural populations, and (3) candidate SNPs that are under natural selection along climate environments, which will contribute to understanding local adaptation to climate and provide further annotations relevant to environmental adaptations. In addition to addressing the fundamental question of how individual plants adapt to different climates, a long-term significance is that the project will provide new knowledge on how genomic diversity can respond to changing climate conditions. The materials generated in this project will be made publically available through NCBI, Dendrome (dendrome.ucdavis.edu/), and a newly created oak genome website and FTP site (valleyoak.ucla.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Oaks emerged as a genus over 55 million years ago during a period of globally warm temperatures, with an eventual distribution from arctic to more southern Northern Hemisphere latitudes. As earth?s climate cooled, species moved south and the genus underwent parallel diversifications resulting in 400-600 species (depending on taxonomy) with a varied set of ecological and evolutionary characteristics. Currently, this genus has more biomass and more species in Northern Hemisphere ecosystems than any other woody plant, including <em>Pinus</em>.

We assembled sequences from short, long, and Hi-C reads to create twelve chromosome-spanning scaffolds with high contiguity that are highly concordant with linkage groups from <em>Quercus robur</em>. Analysis of these gene sequences revealed that effective populations sizes of <em>Q. lobata</em> and <em>Q. robur</em> have declined since the early Miocene as the genus was diversifying. Our annotation identified ~40,000 mapped protein-coding gene loci, which include ancient hexaploid segments with high gene expression levels as well as large numbers of tandemly-duplicated gene families. The remnant hexaploid segments are enriched for transcription factors that could enhance functional variation, while the tandemly duplicated genes are enriched for resistant genes and self-incompatibility alleles that could promote survival and outcrossing. &nbsp;Finally, we generated methylomes<em> </em>from several tissues that revealed context-specific patterns of DNA methylation and unusual intergenic regions that may promote diversification. &nbsp;We hypothesize that these unusual genomic characteristics in oaks may underlie theei high species diversity and forest dominance.</p> <p>Using the annotated genome assembly of valley oak, we have conducted experiments to better understand how oaks will respond to rapid climate warming.&nbsp; We demonstrated differences in gene expression response to drought conditions for populations sampled from different climates.&nbsp; Through landscape genomic studies of nuclear sequence data, we have identified climate-associated genetic gradients across the species range and identified candidate genes that may be involved with local adaptation to climate.&nbsp; Through a species-wide association study correlating&nbsp; DNA methylation patterns with temperature, we detected multiple highly methylated loci within a gene family known to be involved in dehydration response.&nbsp; We have also demonstrated in field experiments which types of DNA methylation shows high heritability and which ones show high plasticity, thus, demonstrating how analysis of DNA methylation may provide another tool for assessing local adaption.&nbsp;</p> <p>One application of this project illustrates how genomic resources can be used to develop strategies to manage oak populations at risk from rapid warming.&nbsp; In a separate large scale common garden experiment, we found evidence that valley oak populations are maladapted to current temperatures, which creates problems for selecting seed sources for forest restoration and management projects.

The remnant hexaploid segments are enriched for transcription factors that could enhance functional variation, while the tandemly duplicated genes are enriched for resistant genes and self-incompatibility alleles that could promote survival and outcrossing.  Finally, we generated methylomes from several tissues that revealed context-specific patterns of DNA methylation and unusual intergenic regions that may promote diversification.  We hypothesize that these unusual genomic characteristics in oaks may underlie theei high species diversity and forest dominance.  Using the annotated genome assembly of valley oak, we have conducted experiments to better understand how oaks will respond to rapid climate warming.  We demonstrated differences in gene expression response to drought conditions for populations sampled from different climates.  Through landscape genomic studies of nuclear sequence data, we have identified climate-associated genetic gradients across the species range and identified candidate genes that may be involved with local adaptation to climate.  Through a species-wide association study correlating  DNA methylation patterns with temperature, we detected multiple highly methylated loci within a gene family known to be involved in dehydration response.  We have also demonstrated in field experiments which types of DNA methylation shows high heritability and which ones show high plasticity, thus, demonstrating how analysis of DNA methylation may provide another tool for assessing local adaption.   One application of this project illustrates how genomic resources can be used to develop strategies to manage oak populations at risk from rapid warming.
