<AbstractNarration>The grant provides travel support for graduate students to attend the 2014 Logic and Computational Complexity Workshop that will take place in Vienna, Austria, on July 12-13, 2014, which is taking place during the Vienna Summer of Logic event, which encompasses the Federated Logic Conferences (FLoC'2014). Funding for student travel has significant broader impacts because of the opportunity it gives the students to become part of their research community, discuss their research with others, listen to and meet with leaders in the field. This workshop is international and provides an international dimension, because students will have experiences relevant to becoming part of a global workforce.</AbstractNarration>

As logic is gaining renewed interest in many areas of CS beyond theory, support for attending the workshop allowed young researchers in these fields who are interested in logic to gain both a valuable historical perspective as well as to learn about current research directions on an aspect of logic particularly relevant to CS.  ASE is the premier research conference for automated software engineering. In 2015, ASE brought together over 250 researchers and practitioners to discuss foundations, techniques and tools for automating the analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance of large software systems.    At ASE, graduate students had the opportunity to engage with experts while learning about the state-of-the-art in automated software engineering research. In addition to the presentation of 55 technical research papers, the program included 5 experience papers, and 16 new ideas papers. ASE also featured a tool demo track, and included two panels. There were five workshops and six tutorials as well as a Doctoral Symposium and two social events. The Doctoral Symposium was a full day symposium that provided students with useful guidance and feedback on their dissertation research and facilitated networking within the scientific community by interacting with established researchers and with their peers at a similar stage in their careers.  Student feedback indicated that their participation in these activities played an important role in their training and academic career development.
