<AbstractNarration>This grant supports documentation and research on Naso (also known as Teribe), an endangered Chibchan language spoken in the mountainous region of Panama that borders Costa Rica. There are approximately 500 speakers of Naso, but only a few elders are fluent users of a special form of Naso called tlokwo rönge 'profound words'. In tlokwo rönge, pairs of rhyming words are the basis of couplets that convey metaphors relating to local, traditional indigenous life. The grammatical and sound structure  of this poetic register has not been documented before. Other Chibchan languages spoken nearby (Bribri, Cabécar, and Kuna) are known to have similarly structured poetic language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Methods used in this project will include elicitation of phonological and grammatical properties of the 'profound words', and interviews recording speakers' intuitions about the meaning, performative context, and knowledge surrounding the origins and areal diffusion of the words. The latter point makes the study relevant to the study of difrasismos, or poetic couplets, found across Mesoamerican languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader questions addressed in this project are: What are the motivations for using parallelism in verbal art across languages of the world? What do these structures tell us about the human mind? While definite answers are not assumed to result from this project, the case study of Naso verbal art aims to advance the scientific literature by building on theoretic models within phonology and poetics. This project responds to a need to document aesthetic and rhetorical properties of natural discourse, as motivated by the apparent loss of these structures in situations of language shift.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This award supported the documentation and description of verbal art patterns in Naso, a Chibchan language spoken in Panama. During the initial stage of the award, the PI trained Naso speakers to document the broadest range of variation in verbal art forms in a range of contexts and speakers. In the second stage, the audiovisual recordings were transcribed in ELAN, and repurposed for the creation of a Naso Cultural encyclopedia with five volumes: Cosmology and Mythology, Traditional Songs, Verbal Art, Artisanry, and Traditional Medicine. The transcriptions, encyclopedia, interviews, and participant observation were the means by which data was gathered and synthesized for the dissertation.</p> <p>The findings of this dissertation project include the detailed description of patterns of several types of Naso verbal art (jokes, poetic couplets, interactive rejoinders, homophony and synonymy, ideophones, and other expressives). This contributes to our theoretical knowledge of what verbal art can look like in everyday language and communication. Furthermore, the results show that speakers agree on precise and general explanations and interpretations of what verbal art is, from specific cases to accidental but successful verbal art forms. The dissertation project thus provides a new way of looking at data and speaker interpretations of verbal art, where it will provide an example for new research on verbal art to be more inclusive and broad in order to capture more diversity for our theory of verbal art.</p> <p>The results of this dissertation have potential to impact other related disciplines, in specific anthropology, as well as comparative literature/English. Because the dissertation contains much description and data of different types of verbal art forms, it can inform our understanding of what can count as "poetic forms", which in comparative literature departments are often limited in understanding to the canonical literature produced on Indo-European languages, and to forms such as poems. The deep ethnographic approach to this dissertation also can impact the field of anthropology by showing its relevance for linguistics. I show how ethnographic care through methods of interviews and participant observation are naturally tied to the way we research speaker intuitions, which are the basis of grammatical linguistic analysis.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/19/2019<br>      Modified by: Natalia&nbsp;Bermudez</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1465235/1465235_10365476_1553014711748_IMG_6083--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1465235/1465235_10365476_1553014711748_IMG_6083--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Naso authors presenting encyclopedia"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1465235/1465235_10365476_1553014711748_IMG_6083--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Naso authors presenting encyclopedia"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Naso Cultural Encyclopedia editor (Natalia Berm?dez) and authors from left to right: Daniel Villagra, Hormelio Santana, Yerlardin Villagra, Maximina Gamarra, Deyni Nicol?s, and Reinaldo Gonz?lez.
