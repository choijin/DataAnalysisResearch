<AbstractNarration>Climate change is often described as a significant global challenge best addressed with centralized national and international institutions. But in the US, the federal government's role has been limited while many states and localities are leading in the development of climate mitigation and adaptation policies. This kind of polycentric governance, where hundreds of subnational US governments and thousands of businesses are actively addressing climate change, is surprising. Social science research to date has largely focused on exploring the occurrence of climate mitigation or adaptation policies at just one level of government while ignoring the consequences of those policies: actual changes in environmental performance by Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emitters. This shortcoming stems, in part, from availability of data; there were no facility-level GHG emission trend data until 2007 when Congress created the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). We use these data to create a 5-year panel dataset along with data collected from secondary sources, a web-based survey of a range of stakeholders, and interviews from six case studies to be analyzed with both quantitative and qualitative methods. This research relies upon a comprehensive combination of theory, multilevel statistical modeling, and qualitative comparative analysis to better understand a complex, longitudinal, and multilevel governance challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team uses an institutional policy analysis framework to examine three aspects of the polycentric nature of climate governance in the US. First, we will describe the types of climate risk governance arrangements that have developed across and within the states. Second, we will examine when and where these institutional arrangements spur Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reductions at facilities. Third, we will analyze the institutional elements and interactions that are most effective in changing environmental performance. This collaborative project begins the difficult work of evaluating the extent to which different US climate risk governance arrangements affect GHG emission trends. The project results will inform evidence-based climate policy choices, governance decisions, and public understanding. To maximize the impact of this research, the team will assemble a diverse advisory board that includes business and environmental professionals, along with state and local government officials. Their advice on data collection, dissemination, and outreach will help ensure that the results from this project are robust and reach a range of stakeholders. Moreover, research results will be subjected to peer-review in scholarly conferences and journals. Research results will be made publically available through a website that includes: (1) a web and mobile phone map application of facility-level GHG emission reduction performance; (2) access to datasets, reports, conference papers, peer-reviewed publications, and (3) webinars to disseminate project findings broadly.</AbstractNarration>

By 2013, GHG reporting and registries were the most common state-level (43) initiative followed by climate action plans (38), advisory boards (24), reduction targets (20), and GHG emissions standards or caps (14). Among US local governments, municipal actions peaked in 2010 with over 650 jurisdictions participating in the International Council of Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) climate protection program and voluntarily committing to reducing their GHG emissions. Likewise, the US Conference of Mayors reported over one-thousand members as signatories of the Mayors Climate Protection Agreement (MCPA).

We adapted a parsimonious typology of polycentricity as a foundation for our research on US climate risk governance. Image 3 displays the four categories of ideal-type governance arrangements: (1) centralized, coordinated in the upper-left cell; (2) centralized, rent-seeking on the lower-left; (3) fragmented in the lower-right cell; and (4) polycentric in the upper-right.

Two regional GHG arrangements spanning multiple cooperating political jurisdictions include the Western Climate Initiative (California and three Canadian provinces), formed in 2007, and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), formed in 2009. Finally, we include a climate governance arrangement that may be terminated: the Obama administration?s Clean Power Plan. Our research found RGGI as the most coherent and durable polycentric climate risk governance arrangement in the US. Moreover, we found that when states and localities get involved in climate policy, facility-level GHG emissions are systematically lower. Our case study work revealed the complexity behind this trend noting that GHG emission reductions are sensitive to state level policy change. For example, while Massachusetts and Washington State adopted six and five climate policies respectively, the former saw more GHG reductions (see Image 4). The critical nature of climate change in the United States combined with the polycentric decision-making often inherent in federalism allow for continued opportunities to make sense of policy choices and institutional features across and within the US states.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2018<br>      Modified by: Mark&nbsp;Stephan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1431378/1431378_10327061_1543525296987_Image1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1431378/1431378_10327061_1543525296987_Image1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="State Climate Change Initiatives"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1431378/1431378_10327061_1543525296987_Image1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="State Climate Change Initiatives"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The number of different types of climate change initiatives by state in 2013 (Data collected from the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES.org)).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Troy D.
