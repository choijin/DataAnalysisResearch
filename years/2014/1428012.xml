<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program, Hamline University will acquire a portable X-Ray fluorescence spectrometer.  An X-ray fluorescence spectrometer is an analytical tool used to determine the chemical elements in a sample.  Because it is portable and hand held, it can be used to analyze samples away from a laboratory, for example in a classroom, at an archeological site, or to examine art objects or cultural heritage materials in museums.  The instrument will be shared with researchers at Minnesota State University-Mankato and two non-profit organizations, the Minnesota Historical Society (MHS) and the Midwest Art Conservation Center (MACC). It will be used in undergraduate chemistry courses, a teacher education course and a forensics/anthropology course. It will also be used in high school courses and in elementary school demonstrations. This community outreach includes a large minority student population. The societal benefit includes understanding and preserving cultural artifacts.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) identifying the chemical composition of forensic samples, art and cultural heritage objects; (b) characterizing artifacts for provenience; (c) understanding the influence of the Golgi membrane on the formation of paired-helical fibers (PHFs) from the protein tau; (d) synthesizing aluminum oxide (alumina) nanoparticles; and (e) developing a searchable database for rapid and reliable field use of materials commonly found at crime scenes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this project was to acquire a portable X-Ray Fluorescence (pXRF) Spectrometer to enable greater research and educational opportunities for faculty and students at Hamline University, a primarily undergraduate liberal arts institution.  The beauty of this instrument is that it can measure what chemical elements are in an object without changing or damaging the object.  Over the course of the award, the pXRF was incorporated into five courses training 76 undergraduate students how to use the instrument.  Students used the pXRF in their courses to analyze art objects, toys, food products, and household goods to gain a better understanding of chemistry in the world as well as the scientific method.  One course that was developed, The Lifecycle of a Painting, required students to use chemical instrumentation like the pXRF to determine what materials and pigments were in oil paintings to better understand how those materials and in turn how the painting?s appearance might change over time, which could change our interpretation of the art.  This award has supported a number of research endeavors in a number of fields.  The first and only scientific study of the Fort Union Trading Post?s Native American glass trade bead collection was conducted as a part of this award with the goal of learning more about the source of glass bead disease, an irreversible glass degradation process.  This preliminary study provided some insight into glass bead disease, that lead and calcium content are correlated to glass condition, but more importantly it highlighted the need for a larger study to fully understand this complex system.  That will aid conservators in their goals of preserving cultural heritage objects containing these glass trade beads.  This work was presented by two students at two national conferences.  Another project used the pXRF to detect metals in pharmaceuticals through its packaging.  This work aimed to provide a fast screening tool to identify toxic heavy metals in substandard pharmaceuticals.  The results of this study were presented at a national conference.  Students in Hamline?s Biology department used the pXRF as a part of a large project on antibiotic resistant bacteria in our environment.  They showed soil with elevated copper and iron content yielded less bacterial growth when compared to their control sample. Finally, students used the pXRF as a service-based research project analyzing toys from members of the Hamline community.  Students utilized the portability of the instrument to conduct the analysis weekly in the campus student center, which enabled them to also provide some basic chemical education to their customers during their demonstrations.  Of the children and pet toys studied, 14% were found to contain heavy metals of concern (lead and chromium).  In addition to the toy testing, 75 people are estimated to have approached the table and gain chemical education and basic knowledge of the instrument?s operation.     The acquisition of the pXRF at Hamline has enabled the growth of intra-collegiate collaborations between the Departments of Chemistry, Biology, and Anthropology as well as collaborations with other institutions such as the Minnesota Historical Society, the Midwest Art Conservation Center, and local high schools.  Research and education projects continue as a result of award, benefiting students at Hamline and the broader community.
