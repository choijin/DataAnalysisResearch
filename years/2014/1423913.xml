<AbstractNarration>Around the world, people are shifting their language use from the minority language of their parents to the dominant language of the place they live. Through this process, minority languages are being lost. This research project will delve deep into the details of the sound system of Turoyo, an endangered Neo-Aramaic language originally spoken in southeastern Turkey, to provide a fine-grained analysis of one aspect of sound change in the language - the loss of the secondary articulation known within Semitic studies as emphasis. The project will study the language as spoken within a close-knit immigrant community in northern New Jersey.  The research question is:  Is emphasis being preserved within this community, and how are social factors affecting the preservation or lack thereof? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will consist of two parts: (1) fifty interviews directed by a sociolinguistic questionnaire to discover more about the culture's effect on the vitality of the language, and (2) an extensive acoustic study involving three generations of speakers to discover the acoustic correlates of emphasis in Turoyo, and how faithfully emphasis is being passed on between generations.  The results of these two studies will be synthesized to determine what social factors correlate to the most faithful preservation of emphasis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is important for three main reasons. First, this study will help in the goal to come to a clear, cross-linguistic definition of emphasis. Second, understanding the intricate details of this sound change in Turoyo will help linguists to better understand sound change in contact situations in general. Third, the community that will be studied is actively trying to pass the Turoyo language on to their children, but they do not seem to be succeeding. Why is this the case? This project will reveal the type of factors that are hindering this community from reaching their goal, and this information can then be applied to similar contact situations around the world.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project is an extensive sociophonetic study of emphasis in Turoyo, an endangered Neo-Aramaic language, as spoken by a close-knit community of about 170 families in a community in northern New Jersey.  Emphasis, the linguistic phenomena involving consonants and vowels that exhibit a secondary articulation in the back of the throat, presents a unique window into the phonetics and phonology of Turoyo, as well as into the sociolinguistic aspects of this languages change amidst continual contact with English.   Fifty interviews were conducted, directed by sociolinguistic questionnaire, which found that Turoyo is being spoken less in younger generations.  Family, social network, and religion had the most effect on the language choices of people in the community, but ultimately, it was identity that made the most difference.  An acoustic study was conducted, which entailed recording eighteen speakers spread evenly throughout three generations.  Although seven acoustic correlates of emphasis were tested in Turoyo, only one (F2) was found to be a significant acoustic correlate.  That acoustic correlate was being faithfully passed on between generations.   Despite the faithful preservation of emphasis in Turoyo via F2, the language is still being spoken less by younger generations.  In order to strengthen the language?s vitality, the language should be spoken exclusively in the family, as much as possible in the social network, and be used and valued in the community and at the church.  Most importantly, opportunities should be given to the young people to explore and solidify their identity as a Turoyo speaker in the United States.  This project advanced our understanding of a number of different things.  First, it contributed to our knowledge of Neo-Aramaic languages, which are extremely under-studied, by detailing not only the sociolinguistic situation in the Mor Gabriel community but it also gave a fine-grained analysis of the acoustics of one aspect of the language.  Second, this project documented these things for a language that is considered to be severely endangered (UNESCO) and the need to document it was urgent.  Third, this project contributed to the scientific study of language.  Previously, emphasis had been studied almost exclusively in Arabic.  In order to come to a better understanding of emphasis, it needed to be studied in other languages so that we would know not just what emphasis looked like in Arabic, but what it looks like cross-linguistically.  This project did that and found that only one of the acoustic correlates (F2) held cross-linguistically.  Finally, Turoyo is one of thousands of languages around the world that are currently in similar contact situations, and the results of this project can be used a reference for similar situations.  The broader impacts of the work were for the northern New Jersey community in which the language is spoken.  This project revealed the specific areas the community should focus on as it seeks to pass the Turoyo language on to the younger generations (i.e. speaking the language in the family, speaking the language in as many social networks as possible, using and respecting the language at church, and providing opportunities for the young people to explore and understand and solidify their identity as a Turoyo speaker in the United States).  Other communities in similar situations can apply this example to further their own language transmission and language teaching goals.  The project also elevated respect for the Turoyo language (which has historically been considered inferior to Syriac, the language of the church).
