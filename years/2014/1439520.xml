<AbstractNarration>Online learning environments are rapidly expanding the nature of the data that can be collected about student opportunity to learn and the details of the learning process. As high schools, community colleges and universities enroll more students in blended or online courses, the volume of data about what students are doing surpasses typical educational research methodologies. Borrowing from multiple traditions, analysis of educational discourse data addresses multiple persistent problems in education, including the development of ways to better predict student success during a course and to design interventions to provide support. The researchers in this proposal will build a community to address three important areas: ethics in data sharing; technical issues in data sharing; and, plans for an infrastructure to support and develop capabilities in both of these. The community built in this effort will collaboratively create the necessary metadata and standards for data sets and tools, templates for appropriate approval to use online discourse data, and de-identification algorithms that can be shared across data platforms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted through two interrelated workshops parsed by planning meetings with an expert advisory board. An initial workshop will focus on educational discourse and the undergraduate experience to identify the issues around the infrastructure necessary to support collaborative education discourse research. The second workshop will focus on the specific infrastructure needs for working with discourse data from massive open online courses (MOOCs). A white paper will be constructed and disseminated that addresses ethical and technical issues and solutions, as well as infrastructure needs to facilitate collaborative educational discourse research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project three workshops were held to explore the ethical, technical, and infrastructure issues facing the interdisciplinary community of educational discourse researchers. This intellectually diverse community, made up of learning scientists, psychologists, linguists, and computer scientists, faces unique challenges in understanding how social learning happens in primary, secondary, university, and informal life-long learning situationas. Through these workshops, issues of privacy and identity, data representation, semantics, linked datasets, and natural language processing techniques were explored.  The result of this project is an increase in the capacity of the community of researchers, specifically with an eye to the establishment of more diverse and holistic understandings of the challenges and opportunities facing educational discourse research. This is evidence by joint publications between attendees, shifting research agendas and collaborations between researchers, and new infrastructures, tools, and techniques created for educational discourse research.  While issues related to the ethical investigation of discourse, infrastructure to support research on discourse, and an awareness and capacity to use computational tools and techniques related to discourse (e.g. social network analysis, natural language processing) continue to face researchers, the community now has shared perspectives as to both the challenges and the opportunities available, and is better enabled to capitalize on the large educational data streams which are being made available through technology-enhanced learning environments.
