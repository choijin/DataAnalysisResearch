<AbstractNarration>Algorithmic mechanism design, or Â "incentive engineering", is a topic of great importance at the intersection of game theory, economics and computer science. Research in this field focuses on the design and analysis of algorithms or protocols that are explicitly designed so that rational participants, motivated solely by their self-interest, will end up achieving the designer's goals. In the age of the Internet, the set of important mechanism design applications is vast, including online auctions, advertising auctions, file sharing, routing and scheduling, among others. This project is aimed at developing the foundations of algorithmic mechanism design and its applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the primary goal of the project is to develop simple and robust mechanisms for fundamental problems in algorithmic mechanism design under more realistic modeling assumptions than those used in the past. Building on the theoretical foundations of game theory and computer science, the research will explore auction design in the fundamental setting of agents whose values are correlated or common, and in more realistic settings where agents that do not know their values can spend time and money to learn about them. The PI will also explore mechanism design in repeated and online settings, as well as game-theoretic matching problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has a great potential to influence mechanisms employed in online auctions, a huge societal benefit.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       Mechanism design is a fascinating subfield of game theory and microeconomics, focusing on incentive engineering. A mechanism is an algorithm or protocol that is explicitly designed so that rational participants, motivated solely by their self-interest, will end up achieving the designer's goals. In the age of the Internet, the set of mechanism design applications is vast. These include the design of online auctions (such as those used by eBay), advertising auctions (such as those run by Google and Facebook), file sharing, routing, scheduling, video streaming etc. The primary objective of the project was to revisit fundamental problems in algorithmic mechanism design using more realistic modeling assumptions.  To this end, the PI considered a number of foundational questions in this field, with particular focus on the development of more practical and robust mechanisms and the theory that underlies them.  Major results include the following:  1. The PI and her coauthors developed near optimal revenue mazimizing auctions in the much more realistic setting where agents' values for goods being sold depends on the information available to all the agents (as opposed to depending only on each agent's individual information).   2. The PI and her coauthors developed new algorithms for pricing an app in a new model where consumers "pay per play", that is, each time they use the app. This way of pricing has significant advantages over standard approaches and provides theoretical justification for the concept of a "free trial period".  3. The PI and her coauthors solved a fundamental optimal pricing problem that arises in a myriad of settings, such as companies offer shipping options (e.g., Fedex and Amazon.com), Internet Service Providers offering bandwidth plans, and Bitcoin miners setting a policy for transaction fees. It applies to any setting in which customers have a sensitivity to time or some other feature of service. In these settings, a seller can price discriminate or otherwise segment his market by delaying service, or providing lower quality/cheaper versions of a product.   4. The PI and her coauthors showed how to use "time-of-use" pricing as a technique for efficiently matching supply and demand of temporal resources such as energy, computing resources on a cloud computing platform and charging stations for electric vehicles.  5. Stable matching is the problem of matching up members of two groups so that there is no pair, one member of each group, that would prefer to be matched to each other than to their match. Stable matching was the subject of a recent Nobel Prize in Economics, and is relevant to the problem of matching hospitals and residents or employers and employees, among others. The PI and her coauthors gave a new and improved upper bound on the number of stable matchings an instance can have.  6. The PI and her coauthor have published a new textbook on game theory.                      Last Modified: 11/16/2018       Submitted by: Anna R Karlin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
