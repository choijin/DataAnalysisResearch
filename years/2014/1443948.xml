<AbstractNarration>This project will make possible the participation of ten students and twenty junior faculty and postdoctoral researchers at the annual conference of the Society for Advancement of Chicanos &amp; Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) that will take place on October 15 - 18, 2014 in Los Angeles, CA.  The postdoctoral researchers and faculty participants will play two roles: they will be speakers in scientific sessions during the conference and they will be active mentors to undergraduate and graduate students attending the conference.  The SACNAS conference attracts well over 3,000 scientists and students, mostly from underrepresented groups, to experience scientific symposia, student presentations, and a comprehensive collection of mentoring and professional development sessions. The mission of SACNAS is to foster the success of Chicano/Latino and Native American scientists to attain advanced degrees, careers, and positions of leadership in science. The mathematics presence at SACNAS is about 300 strong, making it one of the largest gatherings of minority mathematics students and professionals in the country. This annual conference inspires minority students to go on to graduate school and eventually become influential mathematicians and scientists.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The titles of the sessions to be supported include Mathematical Applications in Physiology, Combinatorial Algebraic Geometry, The Discrete Side of Mathematics, Problems in Algebra and Diophantine Equations, Advancing the Next Generation Towards Full Representation in STEM, Current Research Trends in Mathematics Education, Young Latinas in Math and Computer Science, Beauty and the Beast---Our Real Life Relationship with Mathematics, New Discoveries in Public Health and Life Sciences through Statistics, and Applications of Mathematics in Biology. While the presentations will be accessible to students, they focus on recent findings in these areas including publications co-authored by undergraduate students. The goals of the talks are to present current research by active investigators that can serve as dissertation topics, to promote research in the mathematical sciences among groups traditionally underrepresented in mathematics, and to expand the network of mentors in mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The goal of this project was to offer a collection of mathematical sciences research sessions within the national conference of the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) in Los Angeles on October 15-18, 2014. The group of sessions was conceived as a mathematics conference within the larger conference with the objective of presenting current topics of research in mathematics and mathematics education to a large concentration of students from minority groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.     There are multiple reasons why this activity had a much larger impact at the SACNAS annual conference than at any particular university. SACNAS is a 40-year-old society of scientists that fosters the success of minority scientists, from college students to professionals, in attaining advanced degrees, careers and positions of leadership. SACNAS has pioneered successful mentorship strategies and the conference offers 45-50 workshop sessions on graduate school survival, applying to graduate school, job search, mentorship, funding, and more.

The SACNAS conference has fine-tuned mechanisms for establishing and maintaining a network of contacts.   This project took full advantage of the opportunities for students at the conference and ensured that faculty mentors and speakers in mathematics and mathematics education were well represented.

The topics of the sessions in this project represented current research in a variety of mathematical areas. Due to the broad spectrum of mathematical and scientific interests of the student participants, each session was organized in a different area of mathematics, including Combinatorics, Abstract Algebra, Number Theory, Discrete Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Mathematics Education. The speakers were selected for their outstanding research accomplishments, ability to involve students in research, speaking and mentorship qualities.    Broader Impacts. Despite considerable efforts by diverse organizations including the federal government, African Americans, Latinos and American Indians remain underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. The research sessions in this project reached over 250 mathematics students and professionals from minority groups underrepresented in mathematics. Because the speakers, who were mostly from ethnic minorities, also functioned as mentors during the SACNAS conference, they had a positive impact in studentsÆ desire to pursue a graduate degree in the mathematical sciences or in graduate studentsÆ progress toward a Ph.D. Many of the students that attended the conference were first-generation college students so that their decision to go to graduate school truly represents an increase in minority representation in the mathematical sciences.
