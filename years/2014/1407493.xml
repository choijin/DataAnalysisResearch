<AbstractNarration>Non-technical:   This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research, and co-funded by the Nano-Biosensors Program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (ENG/CBET) to the Johns Hopkins University, is to study electroactive biomaterials that are relevant to regenerating nerves, cardiac tissue and skeletal muscle, all known to respond to external electrical impulses. New electroactive biomaterials that are capable of acting both as field carriers and as better cell migration matrices will be poised to impact many emerging tissue engineering and bioenergy applications. Before these impacts can be realized, it will be critical to quantitatively characterize the magnitude of electric fields present in these constructs and the specific impacts on cell biology.  These investigations span several areas of contemporary materials science thus requiring a cooperative scientific effort among chemistry and engineering.  The approach described here builds on a new material platform developed at Johns Hopkins whereby small organic molecules are combined with electronic and biological functions.  The molecules thus created can self-associate under biological conditions to yield nanoscopic fibrils that resemble the structural elements of the extracellular matrix.  The present project seeks to understand how the electronic properties of these nanoscale materials will impact cell behavior and to use this knowledge to engineer specific cellular outcomes directed by optoelectronic inputs.  This research will expose students to the state of the art in biomaterial design and characterization techniques used for optoelectronic and in vitro studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:  This award to Johns Hopkins University will support an innovative program in optoelctronic biomaterials that combines organic-based electronic function and cell-growth-promoting oligopeptides.   It involves a systematic study of the synthesis of peptide nanomaterials, the assessment of their electrical and photonic properties under aqueous and biotic environments, and the assessment of their cellular influence in vitro. The key hypothesis is that nanoscale electric fields engineered into peptide-based hydrogel scaffolds will have direct spatial and temporal influence on cell adhesion and growth. New electroactive biomaterials that are capable of acting both as field carriers and as better cell migration matrices will be poised to impact many emerging tissue engineering and bioenergy applications. Before these impacts can be realized, it will be critical to quantitatively characterize the magnitude of electric fields present in these constructs and the specific impacts on both material properties and cell biology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research activities were described in six published manuscripts and one filed patent.    We measured several key electrical and photonic transport metrics over the course of this project, including sheet resistance, field effect mobilities of peptide nanostructures, and the use of peptide nanomaterials to serve as voltage transmitting "gates". We reported measurements for a large library of peptides with specific sequence variations in order to understand the extent to which we can control electrical properties at the molecular level.  Our work demonstrated that we have the ability to exert orders of magnitude control over electrical transport and hydrogel mechanical properties.  We also validated several aspects of photon migration and electric field creation by photonic stimuli.   Our work also entailed mechanical characterization of hydrogel matrices along with using chemical cross-linking to further tune the mechanics.  We also explored a variety of electrical and photonic stimulations to assess the impacts on cell physiology during culture.  This research program provided critical insight about how optoelectronic stimulation can induce localized nanoscale electric fields that directly impact biomaterial surface charge or interfacial energy, and how these fields will influence cell response to the environment and/or each other. Advances from this specific research plan will extend to the repair of other electrically stimulated tissues and will stand poised to make continued contributions in other contemporary biomedical and energy-related research areas.  One of the unique training elements of this work rests with the opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.
