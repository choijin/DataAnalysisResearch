<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical:&lt;br/&gt;This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to the University of Colorado at Boulder is cofunded by the Biotechnology, Biochemical, and Biomass Engineering program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (ENG). This award supports the study of adult stem cell for the potential treatment of injured or diseased tissues.  While these cell-based therapies provide a possible avenue to restore function and improve quality of life, current limitations in their translation include the inability to control the differentiation of the stem cells, low survival of the transplanted cells, etc.  Biomaterial systems that provide the right signals to these cells could help overcome many of these problems.  To address this significant need, this project will develop advanced biomaterial systems for the culture of bone-marrow derived stem cells, and the materials and methods will allow us to better understand which signals are important and how they should be presented to the cells.  We expect that this research will translate into new biomaterial systems for the delivery of adult stem cells that will improve their safety and efficacy.  During this research, graduate students will be trained in state-of-the-art methods at the interface of biology with engineering, and prepared for scientific careers in areas of national need (e.g., biomaterials, medical devices, and drug delivery).  The team will also integrate undergraduate students and high school students as part of a sustained effort to communicate this work to the local public through outreach programs.  In addition to publication of results that will be broadly accessible, we will also continue to develop hands-on demonstrations for visiting secondary students, teachers and parents, as the visual aspects of imaging cells in 3D captures the attention and excitement of many prospective future scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the development of hydrogel biomaterials for the culture of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). hMSCs are adult stem cells that are being used in numerous clinical trials to promote healing of injured or diseased tissues.  With this award, hydrogel scaffolds will be synthesized and characterized that allow one to introduce important biological signals at the interface of the biomaterial matrix with the hMSCs.  The approach exploits a thiol-ene reaction mechanism and particularly an allyl-sulfide functionality.   Many thiol-containing biomacromolecules (e.g., proteins, peptides) can be conjugated to the ally-sulfide moieity through reversible exchange reactions, which allow user-controlled modification of the scaffold biochemical functionality.  Since the expansion and controlled differentiation of hMSCs often involves sequential presentation of biological signals, the materials developed as part of this award will allow us to study and engineer systems for improved culture of hMSCs, as well as design improved hMSC delivery vehicles for therapeutic applications.  As part of this research, students at multiple levels (high school, undergraduate and graduate) will be trained in polymer and peptide synthesis, bioconjugation techniques, hydrogel characterization, stem cell culture and advanced light microscopy methods.  The knowledge learned from this research will be integrated into course content in advanced Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering courses, as well as communicated to the general public through numerous outreach programs at the University of Colorado.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview.  Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are stem cells that can be isolated from bone marrow and possess the remarkable ability to differentiate into bone, cartilage, muscle, and fat cells.  As such, hMSCs hold promise in medicine as a means to repair tissue. To realize the potential of hMSCs, we need strategies that enable the expansion of hMSCs on large scale while still maintaining their therapeutic potential. hMSCs are highly sensitive to their growth environment and lose their differentiation potential when cultured under conditions that do not mimic native tissue. For example, hMSCs spontaneously differentiate when cultured on tissue culture plastic because it does not mimic the mechanical properties of native tissue. The scientific objective of this project was to develop culture platforms that better mimic the material properties of native tissues so that hMSCs can be expanded on large scale while maintaining their multipotency. Specifically, we designed sophisticated materials that mimic native tissue viscoelasticity (ability of a material to flow under stress). We also developed materials that enable us to present the signaling proteins found in tissues that could be used to influence hMSCs differentiation.   Intellectual Merit. During this project, we advanced fundamental science by designing two different types of materials that exhibit viscoelastic behavior similar to that of native tissue. Specifically, we developed new photochemical reaction that enables control over the viscoelastic properties of the material in the presence of hMSCs. Alternatively, materials were developed that respond to pH changes to induce viscoelasticity.  Using both of these platforms, we investigated how hMSCs respond to viscoelastic substrates and observed that viscoelasticity promotes hMSC proliferation. These findings suggest viscoelastic materials may be advantageous for large-scale production of hMSCs. Finally, we also developed a photochemical reaction that enable reversible presentation of signaling protein to cells, which better recapitulate the native tissue architecture. These findings have contributed to many fields, including the rheology of soft materials, three-dimensional stem cell culture materials, tissue engineering, and biomaterials development.     Broader Impacts.  The information gained during these studies is having a significant impact on the intellectual advancement and broader technological developments across several fields, including wound healing, tissue engineering, and stem cell culture.   This is benefiting society by advancing the development of biomaterials that can improve medical devices and products, and ultimately quality of life.  During the completion of this research, students at all levels (high school, undergraduate, and doctoral students) received advanced and interdisciplinary training to prepare them for careers in STEM fields.  All project personnel were trained in an environment with teams of chemists, biologists, and engineers, and learned not only advanced research methods, but also how to communicate their scientific results.  Many of these students worked with the PI to reach out to the broader community through events such as:  laboratory tours to middle school girls, mentorship of elementary school students working on science fair projects, tutoring of students at local high schools, and numerous seminars to the general public to teach about the impact of biomaterial science and engineering in society.  Notably, many of these activities were targeted to expose under-represented student groups to career opportunities in STEM.
