<AbstractNarration>This proposal funds an early-career workshop in Cyber-Physical Systems. The target audience includes late-stage graduate students; postdoctoral fellows; and assistant professors early in their academic careers.  The workshop is multidisciplinary, and is designed to focus on foundational CPS ideas applicable across multiple domains such as energy, transportation, and healthcare.  The workshop hopes to identify new research directions through brainstorming discussions, plenary talks, and poster sessions.  The community of early-career researchers has typically not been addressed by previous CPS workshops or PI meetings; engaging these individuals will foster new partnerships and collaborations, contribute to the growth of new and creative ideas that are foundational to CPS across multiple application domains, and will contribute to the nurturing of early-career PIs and prospective PIs in CPS - thereby positively impacting the CPS innovation ecosystem.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This CPS workshop brought together early-career professionals, mainly students and postdocs, to discuss new directions for CPS. The main objectives of this workshop were twofold. First, the participants brainstormed about new directions for CPS research. Since the participants had not yet committed to a particular research agenda, we believe their contributions were unbiased and unique. Furthermore, some of the new directions may be crosscutting multiple CPS application domains, since the workshop was not focused on a particular application. Second, the workshop educated the early career professionals on CPS, and it will encourage them to contribute to and publish in the CPS community.Intellectual Merit: This workshop brought together early-career professionals, who are not yet committed to a research agenda. The discussion and interaction among these individuals uncovered non-traditional core research opportunities and new potential application areas for CPS research. It also catalyzed a discussion that crosscuts multiple CPS application areas, unlike most previous CPS workshops that focus on one particular application area.Broader Impact: The workshop educated early career professionals about CPS research and funding opportunities, to help them integrate into the CPS community early in their careers. The workshop also featured presentations and information sessions on potential CPS-related career paths in academia as well as industry and the government. In particular, the attendees were informed about prestigious fellowships, such as the AAAS Policy Fellowship and the Presidential Innovation Fellowship, which may help early-career professionals working on CPS to take lead roles in science and technology policy making. The workshop resulted in several position papers and posters.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/26/2017<br>      Modified by: Sertac&nbsp;Karaman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
