<AbstractNarration>This comprehensive, collaborative research project, leading to the design and validation of a survey instrument will elucidate the extent, character, and attitudes towards the use of computation in undergraduate physics courses.  A knowledge base of the computational component of undergraduate physics courses is useful for educational research, programmatic development, and effective employment of undergraduate physics majors. The survey will be the first comprehensive and rigorously statistical national assessment of the position of computation in undergraduate physics courses.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will be conducted over a period of two years involving a variety of stakeholders.  A Workshop, crucial to the validity of the survey questionnaire and the usefulness of its results, will be convened to complete the process of probing the thinking and experiences of stakeholders in advance of designing the survey.  Workshop participants will represent several interest groups: faculty and administrators from different educational institution types and enrollment profiles; representatives of businesses, government agencies, and organizations that employ physics bachelor degree recipients; a specialist in computational physics education research; and students drawn from the current cohort of physics majors.  Participants will set requirements for the design of a survey of computational methods and their use in undergraduate physics courses, and articulate the desired outcomes from analysis of the results of the survey.  Attitudes as well as practices in relation to computation will be surveyed.  An external evaluator, with expertise in formative and summative evaluation, and significant experience in assessing changes in the undergraduate physics curriculum will use mixed methods to translate the issues and language treated in the workshop into a survey and questionnaire that measures current computational practices in physics courses and the climate for change in the physics departments that teach them.  The PI and the evaluator will consult to gain insights in learning to understand how the design and operation of the Workshop succeeded in eliciting the knowledge needed for constructing the survey and how such advisory workshops can be improved.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results will increase the knowledge base needed to replicate in physics education what the scientific and engineering worlds have been doing for decades-gradually integrating computational modeling into the standard toolbox for professional practice.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project used a focus group of computational physicists in collaboration with researchers at Michigan State University, the American Association of Physics Teachers, and the American Institute of Physics to develop a nationally-distributed survey on the state of computational physics education. Our project surveyed 1246 faculty from 357 unique institutions across the United States including faculty at two-year colleges, bachelor?s and master's institutions, as well as in departments with PhD programs in physics. Our project found that:  A significant growth in the fraction of faculty teaching computation in their courses over 10 years ago. Just over 50% of departments have a simple majority of faculty with experience teaching computation to physics students. The majority of those teaching computation in physics courses do so using homework and projects. A minority of faculty use interactive techniques for computational instruction or assess student learning of computation in exam settings. Few departments offer a major or minor in computational physics. While many departments do not have a simple majority of faculty with experience teaching undergraduates computation, two year colleges have the greatest opportunity for growth. Major factors that indicate if a faculty member teaches computation tend to be influence by personal decisions or stances rather than departmental or universities mandates of customs.
