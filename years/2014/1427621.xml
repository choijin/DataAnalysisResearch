<AbstractNarration>An award is made to the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center to purchase a tandem mass spectrometer for plant cellular and subcellular metabolic studies. The investment in mass spectrometry technology and method development at the Danforth Center benefits integrated studies of plant metabolism and provides guiding protocols for the greater scientific community. The projects supported by this new instrumentation aim to increase productivity of food and biofuel crops through a detailed understanding of how plants turn energy provided by the sun to biomass and how plants sense and respond to their environment and attack by pathogens. As part of the development of new technologies, PI Bradley Evans and Co-PI Doug Allen will perform a special study with young investigators from Harris-Stowe State University to probe the new instrument's capability to analyze difficult samples. This will add to the educational outreach taking place at the Danforth Center. Currently, the training of tomorrow's scientists occurs through an active NSF-REU program, recruitment of high school students that work in Danforth Center laboratories for classroom credit, participation in a regional program for high school students - STARS (Students and Teachers As Research Scientists), workshops for teachers and an interactive middle- and high school mentoring program that connects our scientists with nearby schools. These programs are essential to core Danforth Center mission goals to strengthen the plant science community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long term goal is to improve plant productivity that: i) proficiently feeds a growing world population, ii) provides sustainable feed-stock alternatives to petroleum and iii) supplies useful bioactive compounds; all designed to improve quality of life. Advanced tandem mass spectrometry instrumentation is needed to investigate metabolites present at very low and dynamic levels and segregated to specific cells and organelles. A major impediment to understanding biochemical function in plants is our incomplete characterization of metabolism. Plant metabolism is a very dynamic process and operates in tiny compartments and low amounts of material. Thus it is the fine architecture and dynamic metabolic events throughout plant life that define function, fitness, agricultural yield and allow plants to respond to changing environments and stresses. These activities are, however, not quantitatively understood and incomplete metabolic characterization prevents elucidation of biochemical pathways and gene and protein functions, thereby precluding successful applications in biotechnology. Sensitive mass spectrometers that are capable of analyzing minute concentrations have the potential to transform understanding in many aspects of plant function. Research efforts on NSF-funded and other projects at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center and surrounding community are advancing science through methods development on scantly present metabolites and will be greatly extended by this technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary: This project has funded the acquisition of a SCIEX 6500 QTRAP with SelexION technology and an Eksigent 200 MicroLC.  This instrument consists of a hybrid triple-quadrupole/linear-ion trap mass spectrometer (6500 QTRAP MS/MS) with a removable differential mobility spectrometer (SelexION technology, DMS) as well as a micro-flow ultra-high performance liquid chromatography system for separation of complex samples and introduction of them into the mass spectrometer (microLC).  Intellectual Merit:  Using this instrument, Danforth Center Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Facility staff and trained personnel have developed improved methods for detecting and quantifying a range of important biological molecules found in plants and related organisms. One group is the phytohormones (salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, auxins, cytokinins and their associated conjugates and derivatives).  These specialized molecules are found at trace levels in plant tissues and control various aspects of plant development including growth, death and defense from pathogens, herbivores and abiotic stresses.  Other specialized metabolites this instrumentation has enabled detection and quantitation of are the alkaloids from Narcisuss sp.  These compounds have shown promise as anti-cancer treatments and in the treatment of Alzheimer?s disease, but production in native plant species is not sufficient or sustainable.  Understanding the biosynthetic pathways required for their production will enable bioengineering of the pathways in organisms for commercial production.  Another example of trace level metabolites this instrumentation has enabled the detection of is the inositol polyphosphates; these low-level metabolites are found in all higher eukaryotes and are important in intracellular signaling and development.  Of particular interest at the Danforth Center is the fact that inositol polyphosphate play a role in lipid accumulation in algae, an observation that can aid in the development of industrial algal strains that accumulate high levels of oil for biofuel production.  Other projects where this instrument acquisition has had a major impact involve detection and quantitation of diverse lipid species &ndash; membrane lipids, storage forms and biosynthetic intermediates (acyl-CoAs, acyl-ACPs and organic acids).  Detection and quantitation of these diverse lipid metabolites is crucial to unraveling the processes by which organisms ?decide? to expend energy on growth versus lipid (oil) accumulation, an aspect important for biofuel development. The use of this valuable instrument, data and methods produced by it and Danforth Center Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Facility staff and trainees  has been cited in 16 peer-reviewed publications as of May 2018; this number is expected to grow in the years to come as in prior awards of this type to the Danforth Center.  Broader Impacts:  Throughout the course of this project Danforth Center Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Facility staff have trained 15 graduate students, post-doctoral associates and technicians to become competent primary users of the instrumentation.  In addition, 5 undergraduates were trained to use the instrument as part of our NSF-Funded Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. The instrumentation and Facility Staff have served as critical scientific infrastructure for the Danforth Center and the greater Saint Louis region as a source of access to high performance instrumentation through collaboration and fee-for service work as well as for training the next generation of bioanalytical scientists.
