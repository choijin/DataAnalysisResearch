<AbstractNarration>The vast majority of animals, plants, and fungi reproduce through outcrossing, or the exchange of gametes between two individuals. Why is this form of reproduction so common? Cloning, which only requires a single individual, is far more efficient. Evolutionary biologists have struggled with this paradox for 40 years. The Red Queen Hypothesis argues that outcrossing is maintained because it promotes the production of genetically diverse offspring that can escape parasitism. In contrast, cloned offspring are genetically identical to their parents and thus may be attacked by parasites that have adapted to infect their ancestors. The proposal will definitively test this hypothesis using a natural population of freshwater snails and their sterilizing parasites. The research will combine long-term field observations and experimental manipulations to determine if outcrossing snails gain an advantage over clonal snails in the presence of parasites.  The results will provide one of the most extensive evaluations of selection on reproductive mode and genetic diversity in nature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadly, the project aims to understand the power of genetic diversity to maintain parasite resistance in host populations. These findings will bear upon the work of researchers using applied disease systems to address human and animal health, crop management, and conservation. They will particularly benefit the management of populations in which diversity is declining (conservation) or manipulated (agriculture). Moreover, the investigators are committed to undergraduate education. They propose to translate their work into an interactive laboratory exercise in which to instruct undergraduates in the evolution of interactions between hosts and their parasites.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In this Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant, we proposed a combination of field observations and experimental manipulations to test if parasites contribute to the maintenance of sexual individuals (the Red Queen hypothesis) in the freshwater snail species <em>Potamopyrgus antipodarum</em>. This research has resulted in a much stronger understanding of how selection by parasites varies in space and time in natural populations. Additionally, we demonstrated that this variation in parasite selection has implications for the spread of infectious disease and the maintenance of genetic variation (Gibson, Jokela and Lively <em>American Naturalist </em>2016; Gibson, Xu and Lively <em>Evolution </em>2016; in prep). Lastly, we tested a key prediction of evolutionary theory and supported the crucial assumption of evolutionary biologists that sexual reproduction is costly (Gibson, Delph and Lively <em>in review</em>). We have successfully disseminated the interesting results of our research. This funding has resulted in 2 articles published in prestigious, international journals (Gibson, Jokela and Lively et al, <em>American Naturalist </em>2016; Gibson, Xu and Lively et al. <em>Evolution </em>2016), one article currently in review at <em>Evolution Letters</em>, and an article in preparation for submission to the <em>American Naturalist</em>. I was invited to present this work at the 2015 European Society of Evolutionary Biology&rsquo;s Congress in a symposium on the evolutionary ecology of sex. I was also invited to present this work at the 2016 Evolution meeting in Austin, TX as part of the prestigious WD Hamilton symposium. The presentation earned Honorable Mention for the WD Hamilton Award. In additiona, I mentored three undergraduates (two women) on this project. One coauthored the manuscript in Evolution. All three published their research in the Indiana Journal of Undergraduate Research and two presented posters of their research at the Midwest Ecology and Evolution Conference in 2015. These students intend to continue in biological fields (e.g. PhD in ecology, MS in genetic counseling). For Broader Impacts, we proposed to create an educational activity to teach host-parasite coevolution in high school and college classrooms. We were successful in this aim. We created the Red Queen game, a simple card game in which students test predictions of the Red Queen hypothesis by generating and analyzing their own data. We published this game in Evolution and Outreach (Gibson, Drown and Lively 2015). It has been used in over 10 classrooms in US and UK high schools and universities. The game was recognized by the Society for the Study of Evolution&rsquo;s TH Huxley Award for excellence in evolution outreach and education. I will present this work at the National Association of Biology Teacher&rsquo;s Meeting in November of this year.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/05/2016<br>      Modified by: Amanda&nbsp;Gibson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
