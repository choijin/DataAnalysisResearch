<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Cellulose is an abundant renewable polymer from plants and can be processed into fibers of different thicknesses all the way down to the nanoscale.  However, the morphology and property relationships of the primary structural components -- cellulose crystals and microfibrils -- in the natural cellulose are still not clear. In order to more effectively incorporate sustainable nanoscaled cellulose into composite materials, including water filtration membranes, it is necessary to improve our fundamental understanding of the structure, morphology and properties of these polymers as functions of fiber source and processing methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research includes both an experimental and a theoretical component and extends from fundamental science to water-filtration applications.  It will also have a broad impact in training of students in scientific research relevant to sustainable materials. A range of educational activities will be developed to engage undergraduate and high school students in thinking about access to clean water as an issue of global sustainability while learning about the fundamental concepts on water purification. This project has the potential to lead to the development of new environmentally and economically sustainable materials for water filtration that could positively impact the lives of many people around the globe. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a fundamental understanding of the structure, morphology and properties of cellulose microfibrils (i.e., nascent crystals), their relationships with fiber source and isolation method, and the applications of these naturally occurring nanoscale materials for water purification.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research takes advantage of the recent findings that the chemical treatment using TEMPO-mediated oxidation followed by mechanical disintegration can produce negatively charged cellulose microfibrils. The large surface density of charged carboxylate groups in oxidized microfibrils not only improves the dispersion capability in water, allowing detailed structural analysis, but also provides opportunities for chemical grafting of other radicals. In this research, structural information on cellulose microfibrils will be determined by combined synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and molecular simulation techniques. In addition, surface-modified cellulose microfibrils (with both positive and negative charge capability) will be explored as superabsorbent materials to remove contaminants (e.g. viruses and toxic metal ions) in water, and their performance will be correlated with structure and functionality.</AbstractNarration>

PI and his team have accomplished every aspect of the proposed activities in this project, where the major accomplishments are summarized as follows.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The notable intellectual merit of this project can be categorized in three areas. (1) A simple nitro-oxidation method to extract functional nanocellulose directly from untreated (raw) biomass, especially non-wood species, has been demonstrated for the first time. The demonstrated method greatly reduces the need for multi-chemicals, and offers significant benefits in lowering the consumption of water and electric energy, when compared with conventional multiple-step processes to prepare nanocellulose.&nbsp; In addition, the effluent produced by this method can be efficaciously neutralized using base to produce nitrogen-rich salts as fertilizers. &nbsp;(2) The structural information of nanocellulose in the dispersion state was obtained by synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques, where the results indicated that typical nanocellulose particles could be described by a ribbon model.&nbsp; The structural results from SAXS were further confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic forced microscopy (AFM).&nbsp; (3) Surface modified nanocellulose particles with either positively or negatively charged surface were found to be very effective media (as adsorbents and membranes) to remove oppositely charged contaminants (e.g. viruses and toxic metal ions) from water, where the removal performance was significantly better than most existing adsorbent materials.&nbsp; The results from this project have led to 21 peer-reviewed scientific papers, 2 comprehensive reviews, 2 chapters in books and encyclopedias, 6 pending patent applications, 22 presentations in national and international scientific meetings, and 26 invited lectures in universities, governmental and industrial research institutes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The broader impacts of this project are as follows. PI and his team has leveraged the existing research and education programs in the Center for Integrated Electric Energy Systems, Innovative Global Energy Solutions Center, Center for Science and Math Education, and Environmental Change &amp; Sustainability Field School (in Turkana Basin Institute, Kenya) at Stony Brook University and provided unique opportunities to 1 post-doc, 4 PhD students, 3 MS students, 24 undergraduate students and 16 high school students (summer research) to carry out various research projects to advance nanocellulose technologies for water purification.&nbsp; It was especially noteworthy to point out that 7 high school students have won the semi-finalist status (2015-2017) and 1 student has won the finalist status (2017) in the Intel Science Talent Search and then the Regeneron STS Scholars Competition; 5 high school students have won the semi-finalist status (2015-2017) in the Siemens Competition. In the broader aspect, the knowledge obtained from this project can bring significant social, economic and environmental benefits to society by providing innovative technologies that can simultaneously (1) convert low-valued or underutilized biomass, such as agriculture waste, into high-valued water purification materials, and (2) treat a broad range of existing and emerging water contamination problems, such as bacteria, viruses and toxic metal ions, in a eco-friendly and sustainable manner. In a way, this project has addressed the rapid changes in social, economic and governance norms regarding the nexus of Food, Energy and Water Systems (FEWS) due to increasing global populations, while reaping benefits that will improve the quality-of-life for mankind.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/18/2018<br>      Modified by: Benjamin&nbsp;S&nbsp;Hsiao</p>
