<AbstractNarration>In this project, the PI will study geometric spaces that have singularities. Most of the existing literature in geometry deal with non-singular, thus smooth, geometric objects such as a plane, a sphere, a saddle surface and their generalizations. On the other hand, most objects in nature are non-smooth with singularities of varying degrees of complexity. The PI proposes to study certain singular geometric  spaces by analyzing maps  into and  between them that are optimal in the sense that they minimize energy.   From the analysis of these maps, the PI proposes to study  symmetry properties of the singular geometric spaces. Such results are of interest in mathematics and physics and will lead to a greater understanding of the natural world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A natural notion of energy for a map between geometric spaces is defined by measuring the total stretch of the map at each point of the domain and then integrating. Harmonic maps are critical points of the energy functional. They can be seen as both a generalization of harmonic functions in complex analysis and a higher dimensional analogue of parameterized geodesics in Riemannian geometry. Next to totally geodesic maps, harmonic maps are perhaps the most natural way to map a given geometric space into another. In this proposal, the PI proposes to extend the harmonic map theory for singular geometry and apply it to solve problems in other fields. When studying harmonic maps, natural questions that arise are: Under what conditions are harmonic maps regular? If it is not regular, what is the Hausdorff dimension of the singular set? Is the singular set rectifiable? We consider these questions in the singular setting (i.e. the domain and/or target space of a harmonic map not necessarily a smooth Riemannian manifold). By gaining a better understanding of these issues, we realize the potential applications of harmonic maps in the singular setting that include rigidity problems in geometric group theory and understanding degeneration of hyperbolic structures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Most  objects in nature are not smooth; they contain certain  roughness such  as edges and sharp corners.  Yet most existing  literature in  geometry  deals with smooth geometric objects such as a  plane, a sphere or a   saddle surface.  A smooth geometric object is  often understood by studying their maps.  A familiar example is in  cartography,  the science of graphically representing a geographical area.  Maps produced by cartographers contain   a variety of useful information such as location systems and   altitude.  We can try to understand features of the Earth by analyzing  these  maps.  In this project, we studied non-smooth or singular objects  by  constructing and analyzing a special class of maps called harmonic maps.  A   natural notion of energy for a map between geometric spaces  is  defined  by measuring the stretch of the map at each point and  summing  them up.  Maps that minimize energy are called harmonic maps.    A geodesic, or the shortest curve between two points, is a   one-dimensional harmonic map.  More generally, harmonic maps are a   higher dimensional versions of geodesics.   Harmonic maps are a   natural way to map one geometric space into another, and by analyzing   these maps, we have made a number of important discoveries about  singular  geometric objects.  Through this project, we have trained  graduate students, postdoctoral  students and early career  mathematicians, particularly those in groups  underrepresented in our field.  In mathematics, "just 15 percent of tenure-track positions are held by women, one of the lowest percentages among the sciences along with computer science (18 percent), and engineering (14 percent)" (The Atlantic, Nov 2016).  To combat this gender inequality in our community, it is important to nurture and encourage  female mathematicians in the early parts of their careers. To this end,  we have participated in collaborative research projects with many  untenured female mathematicians, and these collaborative works have resulted in  publications in leading journals.
