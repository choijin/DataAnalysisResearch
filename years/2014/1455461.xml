<AbstractNarration>Large-bodied, long-lived fishes sometimes dominate aquatic food webs. Their rise to dominance causes declines in abundance of small-bodied fishes, rise in abundance of invertebrates, and high concentrations of algae, including noxious species that form toxic blooms in nutrient-rich lakes. These modifications are accompanied by changes in lake productivity and availability of nutrients that limit the productivity in many lakes. Often the populations of top predators and the food web structure that they enforce appear to be stable, persisting for many years.  However, the factors that stabilize dominant populations of top predators are not well understood. The researchers will investigate if material transported from land, including dissolved as well as large particles such as leaves, help to support the production of top predators and thereby stabilize their dominance in lake food webs.  The investigators will archive data collected from the study lakes since 1984 and make them available to the public. Multiple students will be trained during the course of this project and the findings from this study will be communicated to the public through blog postings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators in a series of experiments from 1984-2015 in a suite of lakes investigated stability and change in food webs in response to predator harvest and stocking as well as nutrient enrichment.  Other experiments studied the contributions of terrestrial organic matter to production of many consumers including large-bodied long-lived fishes. So far, however, the individual experiments have been analyzed separately. A comprehensive evaluation of the full set of experiments is needed to determine the role of terrestrial organic matter in food web patterns and the response of food webs to harvest, stocking and nutrient enrichment. More specifically, existing data from whole lake experiments will be used to investigate: (1) the interactive effects of nutrients, terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM), and consumer assimilation of terrestrial organic matter (allochthony) on the biomass of herbivorous zooplankton and the capacity of large-bodied grazers to withstand predation, (2) the effects of terrestrial prey on the stability and resilience of lake food webs and the strength of trophic cascades, and (3) the regulation of whole-ecosystem respiration by nutrients, terrestrial DOM, and food web structure.  Beyond this contribution to basic science, the project will create an online, publicly-available database of data from the 32 years of whole lake experiments, train students in the use of large-scale experimental data, and create blog posts that present results of the research for a general audience.</AbstractNarration>

The project synthesized a 32-year series of whole-lake experiments conducted to investigate trophic cascades, interacting effects of nutrients (inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus) and food web structure on ecosystem processes, contributions of terrestrial organic matter to lake consumers, and resilience indicators for alternate states of ecosystems.     The experiments showed that top predators control food web structure and thereby regulate algal biomass, production, and lake gas exchange with the atmosphere. Effects of food web structure and nutrient inputs on algal biomass and production are similar in magnitude. One of the main findings of the synthesis of whole lake experiments was that over the 32 years, fluctuations in precipitation changed concentrations of colored dissolved organic carbon in the experimental lakes. The fluctuations of organic color decreased the effect of nutrients on algal biomass and production and increased whole-ecosystem respiration.     Experimental additions of inorganic 13C to whole lakes showed that carbon in aquatic consumers is significantly augmented by the surrounding forest. Nutrient enrichment increases the importance of aquatic production to aquatic consumers, but terrestrial sources remain a significant source of carbon. An ecosystem model based on data from the suite of experimental additions indicates that lakes with high organic matter inputs from forests had relatively lower biomass and production but that terrestrial material provides significant support to consumers.     Lake ecosystems exist in alternate states: the food web may be dominated by large fish that prey on smaller fish, or small fish that prey on invertebrates; the lake water can be clear with low biomass of suspended algae, or turbid with high biomass of suspended algae.
