<AbstractNarration>Understanding conceptual change in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education is critical for helping students develop deep understandings of complex ideas and models, and thus, for supporting undergraduate students' success and persistence in STEM fields. This EHR Core Research (ECR) project in the area of STEM learning will explore how multiple factors influence college biology students' conceptual change regarding evolution by natural selection. The project team will gather data from introductory biology courses across the United States, and expects to analyze responses from a total of about 14,000 students. The results of the analyses will provide evidence to support the refinement of theories of conceptual change regarding evolution by natural selection, suggest new ways to promote conceptual change in the classroom, and provide a model for future studies of conceptual change in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The categories of variables that the project team will investigate include students' motivation, epistemic beliefs, cognitive and metacognitive strategies, formal operational reasoning, and biology content knowledge. Students in each of 60 different participating introductory biology classes will be administered the Conceptual Inventory of Natural Selection (CINS), as well as three other instruments (in different combinations) both pre- and post-instruction. This will support structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses of how the variables influence conceptual change in each individual class, as well as the development of an overarching model summarizing the ways in which all variables investigated influence undergraduate students' conceptual change in introductory biology.</AbstractNarration>

In particular, the project sought to identify what students needed to learn science concepts that were "tricky" in the sense that they contradicted lessons from everyday life. The basic design of the project was to monitor learning in introductory college science courses using pre- and post-instruction tests and a to give students a variety of surveys and tests to measure their attitudes, dispositions, knowledge, and skills. During the course of the project the research team examined a list of student traits to see which ones were the best predictors of learning. These included seven types of motivation, study strategies, epistemology, grit, growth mindset, need for cognition, biology content knowledge, and formal operational reasoning ability. Learning was monitored in biology courses in 18 randomly selected universities from aounnd the country. The results of the project were remarkably simple. Over and over again, formal operational reasoning ability was the best predictor of learning in college biology courses.
