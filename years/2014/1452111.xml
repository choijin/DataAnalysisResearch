<AbstractNarration>The PI will investigate geometric invariants which associate automorphic forms to structured manifolds.  The homotopy theoretic construction of these invariants is related to properties of holomorphic Eisenstein series on unitary groups.  A geometric construction of these invariants will also be pursued, using higher dimensional field theories.  These geometric invariants, when regarded as invariants of framed manifolds, give rise to invariants of elements of the stable homotopy groups of spheres.  The arithmetic properties of such families of automorphic forms arising from periodic families in the stable homotopy groups of spheres will also be investigated. Similar analysis for unstable homotopy groups of spheres will be considered using Goodwillie calculus.  The PI also proposes an educational program to identify and develop diverse undergraduate talent at MIT through ROUTE partnerships (Reading Outreach for Undergraduate Talent Exploration).  These partnerships will pair MIT undergraduates who are interested in the mathematics major, but may not know what mathematicians do, with graduate student mentors to engage in semester long directed reading projects. These mentoring partnerships will be targeted to undergraduates who are members of underrepresented minority groups.  The PI will solicit undergraduate research projects from outstanding students completing the ROUTE program, some of which will advance his own research agenda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will advance our current understanding of geometry.  It will also link this new understanding to physics, as the proposed research involves generalizations of string theory.  As the proposed research involves using number theory to study geometry, it will associate new arithmetic structures to known geometric structures.  The ROUTE partnerships will create a pathway to tap the diverse talent pool represented by the MIT undergraduate population, and will attract a more diverse collection of individuals to pursue the mathematics major.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With the support of this grant, the PI solved a conjecture of Arone, Dwyer, Kuhn, Lesh, and Mahowald for the prime 2 - that the Goodwillie spectral sequence for the circle collapses at the E2-page.  Working with Charles Rezk, the PI established a generalized version of Quillen and Sullivan's rational homotopy theory which applies to unstable vn-periodic homotopy.  With Kyle Ormsby, the PI performed new computations in the theory of topological modular forms (tmf) with level structures.  The ring of cooperations for tmf was studied in collaboration with Ormsby, Nathaniel Stapleton, and Vesna Stojanoska.  This paved the way for the study of the Adams spectral sequence based on tmf.  With Agnes Beaudry, Prasit Bhattacharya, Dominic Culver, and Zhouli Xu, the PI developed a method to study Adams spectral sequences based on non-flat cohomology theories.  This technique was employed in the case of connective K-theory to completely compute the corresponding Adams spectral sequence for the sphere spectrum through the 40-stem.  This technique was also adapted to the study of the tmf-based Adams spectral sequence of a certain type 2 complex.  In this context, the PI and his collaborators proved an analog of Mahowald's "Bounded Torsion Theorem", isolating the possibilitites for counterexamples to the telescope conjecture at chromatic height 2.  The PI and his collaborators also performed low dimensional computations of this tmf-based Adams spectral sequence.  These low dimensional computations prove a spectral sequence studied by Bhattacharya-Egger for the K(2)-local homotopy groups of the aforementioned type 2 complex collapses.  This results in the first example of a computation of the K(2)-local homotopy groups of a type 2 complex at the prime 2.  The tmf-based Adams spectral sequence was also employed by the PI, with Michael Hill, Michael Hopkins, and Mark Mahowald, to show that the only even dimensions d less than 140 for which the d-dimensional sphere  admits a unique differentiable structure are 2, 6, 12, 56, and perhaps 4 (the odd dimensional cases were solved by a combination of the work of Kervaire, Milnor, Hill, Hopkins, Ravenel, Xu, and Wang).  With the support of this grant, the PI created a mentoring program at MIT to increase access to graduate study in mathematics to underrepresented groups.  The PI also started a bridge program for incoming graduate students to Notre Dame to help equalize the program for students coming from a diverse range of undergraduate institutions.  The PI advised seven PhD students with the support of this grant, and coorganized five conferences.       Last Modified: 12/30/2017       Submitted by: Mark J Behrens]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
