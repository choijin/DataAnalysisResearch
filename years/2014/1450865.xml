<AbstractNarration>Water plays a central role in many natural chemical and biological processes as well as industrial and technological applications.  A fuller understanding of the chemistry of water and aqueous solutions is expected to have important impacts on a wide range of fields including green chemistry, environmental remediation, atmospheric science, biological sciences, biomedical research, and pharmaceutical development.  To help build up our knowledge of aqueous solutions, Dr. Bruce Gibb of Tulane University, Dr. Paul Cremer of Pennsylvania State University, Dr. Amar Flood of Indiana University, and Dr. David Mobley of the University of California, Irvine co-organize a workshop entitled "Accelerating our Understanding of Supramolecular Chemistry in Aqueous Solutions." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop, to be held on May 31-June 4, 2015 in Virginia, is jointly supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program, the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods (CTMC) Program, and the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry.  It brings together physical scientists who study water and aqueous solutions and supramolecular chemists who investigate non-covalent forces and intermolecular interactions.  Tutorial presentations and breakout discussion sessions are scheduled to facilitate a rapid exchange of knowledge and experiences between the two groups of scientists, the generation of new ideas and perspectives, and the formation of new collaborative efforts.  The long-term goal of the workshop is to further understand the chemistry of aqueous solutions through bridging the knowledge gap between bulk-scale phenomena and the chemical events occurring at the molecular/supramolecular level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On May 31 &ndash; June 4, 2015, a diverse group of researchers from academia and the federal government met in Arlington, Virginia to explore issues surrounding the challenge to understand non-covalent interactions in water. A central point of discussion revolved around the need to close the gaps between the physical and experimental understanding of water. The workshop was designed to accelerate the development of molecular-scale models of aqueous solutions, whilst serving the equally important task of encouraging more extensive experimental work in the aqueous realm. Drs. Bruce Gibb, Tulane University, Amar Flood, Indiana University, David Mobley, University of California at Irvine, and Paul Cremer, Pennsylvania State University, co-organized the workshop, which was supported by the Division of Chemistry (Award #1450865) (See Appendix A, B and C, respectively, for the List of Participants, Workshop Program, and attendee exit survey)  During the course of the five-day workshop, participants were represented as two groups: The first group studies water and aqueous solutions and the second investigate non-covalent interactions between organic molecules. In this document we respectively define these as the Physical Scientists Group (PSG) and the Supramolecular Chemistry Group (SCG). Central to the workshop were eight scientific sessions. These were composed of tutorial presentations by tutors from the PSG and SCG and follow-on breakout sessions, in which six subgroups assessed the state-of-the-art, and considered open research questions under the session topics. In addition the workshop consisted of summary and conclusion meetings.   The scientific findings of the workshop can be summarized as follows:  The complexity of the hydrophobic effect needs to be addressed collaboratively.  The effects of both endogenous and exogenous factors affecting this phenomenon need to be studied more systematically and in more detail.  Furthermore, wherever possible the complexity of the hydrophobic effect should be acknowledged; the field of studying water and aqueous solutions is not helped by inappropriate simplifications or inappropriate terminologies. To strengthen its contribution to the field the SCG needs to diversify the host families in its portfolio, and provide more opportunity for the PSG to probe the effects of polarity, polarizability, charge, curvature, and low-symmetry.  As well as simple host-guest systems to enable understanding, the SCG needs to close the gap in complexity seen between natural and artificial systems. The chemical space provided by foldamers is ripe for development by the SCG and the PSG to explore these ideas. The PSG should seek out the different classes of host currently available to establish new collaborations that can provide as yet unexplored tools (hosts) for probing the properties of solutions in aqueous solution.   For example, there is a broad range of hosts currently available that can act as test-beds for spectroscopic development. The SCG should make itself aware of the different techniques that can probe the solvation shells of solutes and seek collaborations with members of the PSG that can offer new insight into the properties of their hosts.  Combining the talents of both the SCG and the computational community of the PSG has the potential to greatly affect the design of new hosts, and how force field development proceeds in the coming years.  Collaborations between the SCG and the PSG offer the prospects of greatly increasing our understanding of the kinetics of binding and assembly processes; an area that, relative to thermodynamic investigations, is greatly underdeveloped. It is recommended that the PSG help the SCG with chemometric analysis to design optimal procedures and experiments; so long as the grand challenge of good, reliable data is overcome. Accurate and superior non-linear regression methods for determination of affinities should become mainstream.  Calibration standards for &Delta;G of association should be developed.  Concomitantly, both the PSG and the SCG need to be aware of the state-of-the-art of solvation thermodynamics, and importantly, the point that it is not yet clear what thermodynamic data is the most important to build an atomistic-level understanding of associations in water.  There is a vast swathe of chemical space concerning ions in water that is still not understood.  New hosts are required to strengthen the SCG?s understanding of anion recognition and its impact on the Hofmeister effect.  There is also a need to extend knowledge on cation hydration and how these ions play a role in the Hofmeister effect.  There is considerable opportunity also for collaborative efforts to understand trans-membrane ion transporters. In the biological realm, an unresolved question is the role dynamic water plays in the thermodynamics or kinetics of protein folding, ligand binding, enzyme catalysis, and more generally the structure and properties of macromolecules.  There is again considerable opportunity for communication between the SCG and the PSG. There are great opportunities for both communities to generate simple, informative supramolecular systems at artificial interfaces to provide understanding of how recognition at aqueous interfaces differs from the bulk.
