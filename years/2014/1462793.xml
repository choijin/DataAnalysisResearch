<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the conference "Equivariant and Motivic Homotopy Theory" held at Reed College, in Portland, Oregon on May 30-31, 2015. This meeting will bring together leading researchers, postdoctoral associates, and graduate students interested in equivariant and motivic homotopy theory to share recent progress and ideas for future research in these fields during a two-day research conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will focus on the interplay between equivariant and motivic homotopy theory.  Each field has enjoyed recent success in resolving a number of longstanding problems, including the Kervaire invariant one problem and the Milnor and Bloch-Kato conjectures.  They remain relevant to the study of such wide-ranging topics as topological Hochschild homology, algebraic cobordism, chromatic homotopy theory, and algebraic K-theory, and both topics are vibrant fields of research.  The conference will catalyze research progress through a series of eight talks by disciplinary experts and multiple forums in which participants can communicate and collaborate on topics such as (generalized) infinite loop space machines, Picard groups of stable homotopy categories, and computations of stable motivic and equivariant homotopy groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information can be found on the conference web page&lt;br/&gt;http://people.reed.edu/~ormsbyk/eqmotconf2015/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Conference on Equivariant and Motivic Homotopy Theory hosted at  Reed College May 30-31, 2015 provided researchers and students from  across the country with the opportunity to share knowledge and insights  related to two burgeoning, interconnected areas of mathematics.  NSF  funding was used to support 19 graduate student and early-career  participants in addition to 8 speakers.  The conference hosted a total  of 45 participants at all career stages and further disseminated the  talks by posting lecture notes on a publicly available website.   Additionally, several Reed College undergraduate math majors attended  the talks and helped manage logistical tasks for the conference; this  provided them with valuable exposure to the broader mathematical world.  The  topics of the conference gave researchers from distinct backgrounds an  opportunity to meet and share ideas at the interface of equivariant  stable homotopy theory and motivic stable homotopy theory.  These fields  have been intertwined since the 1990's, but successes in each (the  resolution of the Bloch-Kato conjecture, the Kervaire invariant one  problem, etc.) have arisen independently, and only a handful of  investigators are simultaneously active in both fields.  Of particular  interest in this conference were concepts related to infinite loop space  theory in both contexts, and new results on nilpotence and periodicity  in motivic homotopy theory which may have analogues in the equivariant  world.  Talks were contributed by Michael Andrews (MIT,  Non-nilpotent self-maps in motivic and equivariant homotopy theory),  Aravind Asok (USC, Algebraizing topological vector bundles), Bertrand  Guillou (Univ. of Kentucky, Eta and the structure of motivic Ext),  Jeremiah Heller (Univ. of Bonn, Endomorphisms of the equivariant motivic  sphere), Michael Hill (UVA, Towards the equivariant Dyer-Lashof  algebras), Po Hu (Wayne State Univ., Equivariant K-theory of compact Lie  groups with involution), Igor Kriz (Univ. of Michigan, Calculations of  "ordinary" RO(G)-graded cohomology over (Z/2)^n), Mona Merling (Johns  Hopkins Univ., Equivariant algebraic K-theory).
