<AbstractNarration>The Afar region in East Africa encompasses the only on-land exposure of a rift-rift-rift triple junction and, hence, affords an unusual opportunity to study the extensional tectonism from the early break-up of continents to seafloor spreading. Present-day extension across the Afar is accommodated by magmatic, axial rift zones (Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and the main Ethiopian Rift) and amagmatic extension across the region in between. Although much geological and geophysical research has been conducted in the region, knowledge on how extension is accommodated here remains poorly understood. This study will evaluate competing tectonic models of rift formation in the Afar through a combination of structural and landscape analysis, remote sensing, and geochronology. The resultant understanding of extension across Afar rift will provide insight into the evolution of rift-rift-rift triple junctions and continental rifting, in general. The project will advance desired societal outcomes through participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM, improved STEM education through curricular enhancement at a HBCU institution, development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through the training of graduate and undergraduate students, and increased partnerships through international collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will examine the structure and late Cenozoic tectonism in the Afar region in an effort to decipher the neotectonic framework of an active rift-rift-rift triple junction. The interaction between the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea rifts have led to the development of a large-scale accommodation zone that presently is marked by half grabens and tilted fault blocks in central Afar. Understanding the partitioning of extension across Afar rift will provide insight into the evolution of rift-rift-rift triple junctions and continental rifting, in general. This research project aims to conduct fieldwork and remote-sensing analyses that will provide a basis for estimating the magnitude extension across part of the central Afar accommodation zone, as well as Quaternary kinematics. The Afar Stratoid volcanic rocks (4.0 ? 1.0 Ma) are a regionally extensive lava surface that predates the initiation of grabens in the Afar and, hence, provides a viable datum for estimating the magnitude of extension during the Quaternary. Additionally, comparison of long-term (Quaternary) deformation with more recent kinematics (e.g., from late Pleistocene landforms and available GPS observations) provides an initial means of assessing the evolution of the accommodation zone (e.g., co-axial strain versus progressive strain and rotation). Combining structural and neotectonic analyses, the project will accomplish the following: 1) constrain structural geometries and the viability of a regional datum for restoration; 2) estimate horizontal extension across part of the central Afar, including estimation of the contribution of small faults to regional strain; 3) estimate late Pleistocene rates of faulting for major faults using tectonic landforms; 4) use long-term drainage evolution for spatial and temporal constraints on initiation of amagmatic extension.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Afar region of East Africa presents a unique opportunity for sub-aerial geologic investigation of rift-rift-rift triple junction.  This yields insight into the evolution of extensional tectonic environments from continental breakup to the initiation of seafloor spreading.  In the Central Afar, three arms of the triple junction (Red Sea-Gulf of Aden-Ethiopian rifts) converge.  Amagmatic extension of the crust occurs in between volcanic rifts of localized strain.  The current episode of extension deforms a widespread surface covered by flood basalts.  This study used remote sensing and field-based investigations to document the timing of initiation of the present phase of extension within the central Afar region, as well as the spatial distribution of extension rates and finite strain.  Using satellite remote sensing, a high-resolution digital terrain model allowed mapping of major faults and measurement of associated fault throw.  Subsequent analysis of the fault populations indicated the presence of high strain localities within the amagmatic portion of central Afar that could potentially be the locus of future magmatic extension zones via which the linkage between the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden rifts may take place. Additionally, the timing of initiation of faulting and graben formation was inferred by modeling stream valley entrenchment and knickpoint retreat.  This approach was calibrated using cosmogenic Cl-36 measurements in the Dobe Graben of Ethiopia.  Once calibrated, the method was applied regionally and demonstrated a diachronous nature of graben formation with in central Afar.  Surveying and dating of Late Quaternary faulting rates also depicts spatially variable uplift rates in central Afar. An additional component applied interferometric satellite radar to measure present-day deformation within the Afar rift.  Collectively, the results favor crustal stretching in response to plate motions as a viable tectonic model for central Afar rather than the ‘Bookshelf faulting’ or ‘Microplate’ models.   Although central Afar is sparsely populated, it is of significant importance to Ethiopia as it is the artery through which access to the ports of Djibouti (Gulf of Tadjoura) and potentially Assab (Red Sea) flows. Moreover, economic developments including dam and irrigation schemes, large scale commercial farms, and salt mining endeavors are undertaken in central Afar. The results will contribute to a more informed assessment of earthquake hazard in the region to protect existing and future economic assets.
