<AbstractNarration>Medical anthropologists have long recognized that problems of poverty, hunger, and disease are embedded in social and economic structures that constrain people's everyday lives.  Experiencing deprivation or discrimination over a lifetime can "get under the skin" and produce detrimental health effects.  With rising rates of chronic illnesses, it is now increasingly important to understand those situations in which people manage to counter these effects, actively modifying their social, cultural, and physical environments in positive ways.  Community allotment gardening, a form of urban agriculture popular in the United States since World War II, is one means by which people in cities try to improve their local food environment.  Understanding whether, and under what circumstances, community gardening reduces health burdens will help social scientists to better understand the relationship between culture and human biology. The research also has practical applications for urban health providers and for planners concerned with urban agriculture and zoning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Northwestern University doctoral student, Sarah R. Taylor, with guidance from Dr. William R. Leonard, is carrying out the research in two Chicago neighborhoods characterized by different levels of socioeconomic hardship.  Her research explores the social, environmental, and health impacts of community gardening over the course of a full gardening season.  She is documenting changes in health and well-being using objective measures, such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels, as well as subjective measures, such as perceived stress, lifestyle habits, and quality of life among gardeners and controls.  In addition, ethnographic interviews and participant observation will yield in-depth information about how people actually utilize their gardens, their motivations for gardening, and the perceived benefits.  By combining in-depth qualitative and quantitative research methods, findings from this research will elucidate the underlying processes by which the practice of community gardening works to shape the health and well-being of urban residents.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  In this study, the researchers set out to test popular claims about the health benefits of community food gardening by examining the health and well-being of urban gardeners in two diverse Chicago communities. A multi-method approach was used, combining: (1) direct assessment of health status, (2) standardized health surveys, and (3) semi-structured interviews. Based on limited available evidence from the literature, it was hypothesized that gardeners would show better health outcomes and report better well-being than individuals on the garden wait-lists at the end of the season.     Quantitative Results  Despite the demographic diversity of the two community areas in which this project took place, the individuals who signed up for garden plots and who took part in this study were overall white, well-educated, middle class, and healthy. Both gardeners and wait-listed controls showed modest changes in health outcomes over the course of the season, and whether someone had access to a garden plot had no effect on results. On average, gardeners spent only two hours per week engaged in gardening activity, and the amount of time spent gardening was not associated with changes in health status.  While gardeners as a whole did not show major improvements in health status over the course of the season, there were important changes among sub-groups:  gardeners with high blood pressure or high cholesterol experienced more marked improvements in health status than their healthier counterparts. Healthy weight gardeners reported feeling less stressed over time, whereas overweight and obese gardeners reported no change in perceived stress. In addition, results from hair cortisol analysis showed a decrease in stress hormone among gardeners but not among wait-listed controls.     Qualitative Results  The most salient themes during semi-structured interviews were leisure, personal health, satisfaction, and food empowerment. Although many gardeners felt that food empowerment was important, both gardeners and controls were economically stable and were not driven by concerns of subsistence. Gardeners had a variety of reasons for gardening, but every gardener in this study described the experience or practice of food gardening as a hobby or a site for casual experimentation rather than as a focused means of food production. Gardeners also reported feelings of peace, tranquility, and relaxation consistent with stress-relief, even if they did not explicitly use the term "stress-relief" during interviews.

Taken together, the quantitative and qualitative results suggest that community food gardening may be an attractive and meaningful way for urban residents to maintain health and reduce stress for a few hours each week. However, the allotment framework may not be the most effective means of achieving a healthy community and increasing community involvement in diverse settings where improvements to nutrition and physical activity are more sorely needed.
