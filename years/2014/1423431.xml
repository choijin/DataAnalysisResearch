<AbstractNarration>Analog components are increasingly prevalent in our mobile, handheld, health monitoring, automotive, GPS and other embedded devices (e.g., in the iphone 5, twenty out of twenty eight components are of analog/mixed signal type). The benefit of using analog devices over purely digital devices is that they offer low power, low cost and high flexibility of parameters in the design space. However, the design flexibility comes with a tradeoff of complexity in the verification/validation of these systems. While verification of the correctness of a digital design is a hard problem, analog systems introduce complexity in behavior that surpasses digital verification. Hence, with the growing use of analog components, ensuring that these systems are correct is critical to their design process. Since analog components were isolated single components in previous generations of devices, there has been a void in the research in this area. This project attempts  a methodology to provide a quantum leap over the current practices of analog validation and have the potential to bridge the gap between analog design and design automation tools, paving the way for other analog verification methodologies to evolve further. Course material on analog and mixed signal verification for undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Illinois and elsewhere will be developed as part of the proposal. MyTri, a professional networking portal for women in computing will be further developed by the PI with NSF funds as well.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a technical standpoint, the design of analog and mixed-signal are much more complicated than purely digital design, due to nonlinear behavior, continuous state spaces, as well as traditional methods of manual validation. In the context of system level integration, Monte Carlo simulations methods, the de facto standard for analog circuit validation, fall short of the intended goal of  providing an ability to generate input stimulus, control the type of simulations, specify desired constraints or trigger events, as well as provide debugging, diagnosis capacity and a method to evaluate the test coverage. This work proposes a validation environment with all the capabilities listed above. The proposal is to analyze randomized tree based search algorithms. These algorithms can be made controllable to achieve different validation objectives. The problems addressed in the proposed work are computationally very complex, and thus, scalable solutions to these problems is a challenge that will also be addressed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Analog and mixed signal (AMS) chips now comprise a majority of the chips used in mobile computing,  communication devices, electric vehicles, and portable medical equipment  today. This trend is projected to grow in the future, as analog chips become ubiquitous in SoC designs.  Due to their versatility, AMS chips are increasingly being  used in medical devices and electric vehicles, where safety and reliability  are critical concerns.  Verifcation and validation of the behavior of these complex systems is a daunting challenge. The scale and complexity of today?s AMS circuits is far beyond the hand-crafted, isolated analog circuits of the past. However, the research in validation has not kept pace with these trends. Traditional validation methodologies are inefficient, expensive, error-prone, and frequently misleading in predicting unknown behaviors, worst case corners and stressing weak components of the circuit. It is critical to automate the validation tasks for analog circuits to meet growing demands on their application.     The analog design process is an iterative process that goes through the cycle of specification, followed by design, optimization and validation. Currently every task in analog validation is manual and ad-hoc. As  a result, the analog design process is error-prone, expensive and very time consuming.  Our mission is to provide automation in analog design to  improve the quality and reliability of analog circuits. In particular, we focus  on optimization and validation of analog circuits.  Analog circuits exhibit complex nonlinear dynamics and have  hundreds of dimensions. Any method for validating analog  circuits has to be scalable and faithful to the nonlinearities of the circuit.  To address these significant problems, we need a new scalable,  efficient, versatile, mathematically sound techniques.     Intellectual merits: In solving each of the analog validation problems, we used a novel data structure and search algorithm- random trees. These are more efficient and scalable in searching the state space of circuits than the state of the art techniques. Searching the space of circuits is a vital operation required for debugging, verifying as well as optimizing the circuit designs. Our random tree search is "goal-oriented", or directed towards a specified objective. This becomes the focus of the search and directs it. This has proved to be very impactful in solving problems related to analog validation and optimization. We invented the first directed testing methodology for analog and mixed signal system validation. We invented a technique to simultaneously generate tests that have high coverage as well as towards a goal (like avoiding a region where the chip is known to fail). We also invented a technique to efficiently determine the worst case behavior of an AMS design before it is fabricated, to help design the parameters of the system. We also found a way to reduce time taken to test AMS systems post manufacture by around 90% by compressing each test.
