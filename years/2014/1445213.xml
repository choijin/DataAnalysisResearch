<AbstractNarration>The unprecedented oil and natural gas development through hydraulic fracturing greatly improves U.S. economy and made it the world?s biggest energy producer in 2013. However, the numerous barrels of wastewater produced every year during fracking are considered the single greatest environmental impediment, costing the industry $5 billion per year to dispose. Due to increasing public health and environmental concerns about deep well injection and long distance transportation, on site treatment and reuse of such wastewater becomes an emerging need.  This proposal aims to develop and apply a new microbial desalination technology with energy production for produced water management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, the team will develop a trailer prototype demonstration system that treats wastewater at 100 bbl/day (4,200 gallon/day), which is industry's expectation on functioning and investable prototypes. This system will have much lower cost per barrel water treated, and will significantly reduce the manufacturing and monitoring cost through the integration of low-cost 3D printing technique and microcontroller based automation system. The system will also be adaptable to different water conditions through the real-time monitoring and control of operational parameters, such as retention time, loading rates, and supplemental pre/post treatment units.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Science Foundation Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program is designed to facilitate researchers and mentors with entrepreneurial training to broaden their impact and value beyond the University through commercialization. Our team called microbial desalination consisted of Dr. Zhiyong Jason Ren as the principal investigator, Dr. Casey Forrestal as the entrepreneurial lead and Mr. Xuehua Bai as business mentor.  The goal of the project was identify market opportunities and potential commercialization pathways for microbial desalination technology developed at the University of Colorado.  The new microbial desalination technology uses microorganisms in an electrochemical cell, similar to traditional fuel cells, but instead of using hydrogen, it uses wastewater as the fuel to achieve simultaneous electricity production, organic matter removal, and most importantly salt water removal.  Given these unique functions our team was keenly aware that there may be many market opportunities for the technology and having a better understanding of the market wants and needs was crucial to developing a commercialization strategy.  The exploration and production of shale oil and gas through hydraulic fracturing has been growing rapidly all across the United States and especially in our home state Colorado.  With this production of unconventional oil and gas come a difficult to treat salty wastewater called produced water, which is estimated more than 800 billion gallons per year. Treatment of this wastewater is not only difficult but costly, and therefore over 90% of the produced water generated are not treated but simply discarded in deep underground injection wells. Such practice causes a lot of concerns including its linkages to local earthquakes, truck traffic, water source contamination, and others. With our novel approach to simultaneous water treatment and energy production we felt that entering the oil and gas market was the best approach, but we also wanted to explore alternative market opportunities.   Initially, we found that the treatment of produced water was the largest market at $2.4 billion annually but that there was a lot of competition and that the industry. People in the industry are extremely cautious to embrace new technology because of being sold lies in the past.  Alternative market opportunities we identified and explored were in municipal wastewater treatment, municipal water treatment, landfill leachate treatment and even NASA.  However, because of the emerging need, market size, and product market fit we decided to focus most of our efforts on entering the oil and gas market.  Using lessons learned from the I-Corp curriculum, we drove around the country and interviewed 109 customers, key partners, regulators, and researchers. We were very excited that there is an excellent opportunity to commercialize our technology.   Since finishing the I-Corp curriculum we have formed a company called Bioelectric Inc., with the support of University of Colorado and established entrepreneurs in the field.  We feel poised to enter the market and make a profound impact on both the local economy and the environment.  From knowledge gained through customer interview we identified that our technology was not at the scale at which the industry would investing in, therefore currently we are making a concerted effort to scale the technology the industries specified minimal viable product (MVP).  Additionally Bioelectric Inc, has been accepted into an incubator program through the non-profit Rocky Mountain Innosphere, to continue customer discovery and go to market strategy.  We also obtained very interesting research findings recently and here are some media reports:http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150225122739.htm; http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2014/11/reclaimed-fracking-water-treatment-shale-gas  Our team throughout the I-Corp program felt that this was not only an opportunity to learn and identify if a startup...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
