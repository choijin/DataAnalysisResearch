<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The University of the District of Columbia (UDC) will implement a project entitled: Course Development for a 21st Century Smart Grid Workforce.  The Smart Grid courses to be developed at the certificate and the bachelor degree levels will provide students the cross-disciplinary knowledge and skills required to design, implement, deploy and manage Smart Grid technologies and fill the gaps between the utility workforce of today and the Smart Grid's workforce needs of tomorrow.  Senior engineering students will develop an educational Smart Grid Simulator with the functionality and attributes typical to renewable energy resources. This simulator will be made available to benefit other educational initiatives on Smart Grid technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to address the shortage of qualified workforce and Smart Grid specialists by focusing on three objectives: 1) to develop introductory to advanced Smart Grid courses and experimental resources to prepare students with interdisciplinary knowledge and skills for preparing the future Smart Grid technology workforce, 2) to develop short courses to help to address the knowledge gap of the current utility workforce, and 3) to inform citizens and educators about Smart Grid technology and its impact on society, the environment, the economy, and career opportunities. The courses will be an integral part of a renewable energy minor at UDC. The project aims to establish the University as a premier training center for the energy workforce in the area of Smart Grid technology.</AbstractNarration>

This project was aimed at training the next generation of engineers, specially underrepresented minorities, to prepare them for employment in the emerging field of smart grid technology. The project facilitated the development of new engineering courses, and thus, providing our students the knowledge needed to pursue advanced degrees in power engineering and equipping our student with contemporary knowledge required for employment in the area of smart grids. These new courses are smart grid communications and security and power electronics, and are now part of the electrical engineering curriculum and offered on a yearly basis. The project also facilitated the establishment of a new general education course that exposed students from non engineering backgrounds to the importance of renewable energy and smart grid. The project led to University infrastructure improvements by establishing a new power electronics lab that is being utilized by both undergraduate and graduate students. Through this grant, a smart grid trainer was purchased for the renewable energy lab and was utilized by students in mechanical and electrical engineering, and was also incorporated in outreach activities to high school students interested in the field of engineering, on a yearly basis. The smart grid trainer was also showcased to engineering and non engineering students during Engineering Week at UDC. Our overarching goal has been to contribute to training a diverse workforce for the 21st Century Smart Grid. This project has allowed UDC faculty and student to be actively involved in research and education in the area of smart grid technology. Students and faculty have published many papers and have attended many conferences, including winning the best paper award at the 2018 IEEE Green Energy and Smart Systems Conference.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Sasan&nbsp;Haghani</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
