<AbstractNarration>Wolbachia pipientis is a bacterium that infects a large number of insects, including important human disease vectors such as mosquitos.  This bacterium is maternally transmitted and is known to cause a variety of effects in the insect host including manipulation of reproduction and suppression of virus replication.  Because Wolbachia is capable of suppressing virus replication in insect hosts, it is being used to decrease the spread of human diseases (so-called "pathogen blocking"). It is critical, therefore, to better understand how Wolbachia infects hosts and alters host cell biology.  Although Wolbachia infect upwards of 40% of insects on the planet, there is surprisingly little known about the exact mechanism used by the bacterium to manipulate its host.  This is largely due to the fact that Wolbachia occurs inside host cells and cannot be genetically manipulated presently.  This project will use a novel approach in this system to identify proteins used by the bacterium to alter host cell biology.  By identifying and characterizing these proteins, much will be learned about the basic biology of Wolbachia and the host cell components utilized during infection. Results will also lead to comparative analyses in other symbiotic systems. Undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in science will be trained with project-based research related to this project on Wolbachia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching scientific goal of this project is to identify the mechanisms by which an extraordinarily widespread bacterium interacts with its host.  Wolbachia pipientis is an intracellular alpha-proteobacterium that forms symbioses with an extremely broad array of invertebrates, including isopods, nematodes, and insects.  Wolbachia is currently of interest with regards to vector control because mosquitoes harboring the bacterium are unable to transmit important human diseases. Because Wolbachia are not currently culturable or genetically tractable, little is known about the molecular basis of interaction with eukaryotic hosts.  Wolbachia encodes a type IV secretion system and is thought to secrete proteins (termed "effectors") into the eukaryotic cell to alter the biology of its insect hosts.  This project will use a powerful method to identify and study the biochemical function of probable effectors in Wolbachia.  The investigators will identify candidate effectors through genomics and  bioinformatics.  They will use a yeast genetic screen and a secretion assay in a heterologous system to further identify and characterize these candidates.  Finally, the researchers will investigate the biochemical function and cellular effects of these proteins in the Drosophila host.  These results will be the first comprehensive analysis of Wolbachia secreted substrates and will lead to significant advances in the Wolbachia field and comparative work in other symbiotic strains (such as those infecting filarial nemotodes).</AbstractNarration>
