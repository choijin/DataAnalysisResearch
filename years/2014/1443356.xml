<AbstractNarration>Recent observations and model results suggest that collapse of the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica may already be underway. However, the timeline of collapse and the effects of ongoing climatic and oceanographic changes are key unanswered questions. Complete disintegration of the ice sheet would raise global sea level by more than 3 m, which would have significant societal impacts.  Improved understanding of the controls on ice-sheet evolution is needed to make better predictions of ice-sheet behavior. Results from numerical models show that buttressing from surrounding ice shelves and/or from small-scale grounded ice rises should act to slow the retreat and discharge of ice from the interior ice sheet. However, there are very few field observations with which to develop and validate models. Field observations conducted in the early 1980s on Crary Ice Rise in the Ross Sea Embayment are a notable exception. This project will revisit Crary Ice Rise with new tools to make a suite of measurements designed to address questions about how the ice rise affects ice discharge from the Ross Sea sector of West Antarctica.  The team will include a graduate and undergraduate student, and will participate in a range of outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New tools including radar, seismic, and GPS instruments will be used to conduct targeted geophysical measurements both on Crary Ice Rise and across its grounding line. The project will use these new measurements, together with available ancillary data to inform a numerical model of grounding line dynamics. The model and measurements will be used to address the (1) How has the ice rise evolved over timescales ranging from: the past few decades; the past millennia after freeze-on; and through the deglaciation? (2) What history of ice dynamics is preserved in the radar-detected internal stratigraphy? (3) What dynamical effect does the presence/absence of the ice rise have on discharge of the Ross Ice Streams today? (4) How is it contributing to the slow-down of the proximal Whillans and Mercer ice streams? (5) What dynamical response will the ice rise have under future environmental change?</AbstractNarration>

Complete disintegration of the ice sheet would raise global sea level by more than 3 m, which would have significant societal impacts. Improved understanding of the controls on ice-sheet evolution is needed to make better predictions of ice-sheet behavior. Results from numerical models show that buttressing from surrounding ice shelves and/or from small-scale grounded ice rises should act to slow the retreat and discharge of ice from the interior ice sheet. However, there are very few field observations with which to develop and validate models. Field observations conducted in the early 1980s on Crary Ice Rise in the Ross Sea Embayment are a notable exception (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>: Location map). During the 2015-16 austral summer our team of six flew via LC-130 from McMurdo to Crary Ice Rise to conduct targeted geophysical measurements across the ice rise (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>: Radar and seismic transects). We use these data, together with emerging satellite data to address questions about the origin and evolution of the ice rise and how it might affect future ice discharge from the Ross Sea sector.</p> <p>Our active source seismic surveys reveal that Crary Ice Rise is underlain by extensive, thick (more than 600 meters) and possibly young (last glacial maximum) sedimentary sequences. Further, the sequences exhibit evidence of erosion by past overriding of the ice sheet. (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>: Active source seismic data).</p> <p>The radar-detected geometry shows bed elevations range from 500m below sea level in the upstream region to&nbsp;just 250 m below sea level at the downstream&nbsp;and NE sectors. In addition, most of the ice rise is 40-80m above the modern flotation level; a notable exception is the upstream&nbsp;<em>tail</em>, where it is less than 10m above flotation (<strong>Fig. 4</strong>: Radar-detected geometry). Radar profiles across the grounded central region of the ice rise reveal multiple diffraction hyperbola extending up to 340 m above the bed. Waveform modeling and 3-D mapping of the stratigraphy and composition of the diffraction hyperbala confirm they were once rifts or basal crevasses (now filled with refrozen sea water) in a floating ice shelf. Attenuation of radar waves by frozen brine in the rifts and crevasses mask the bottom echo in many locations (<strong>Fig. 5:</strong> Radar-detected englacial structures). Furthermore, the tops of many of the paleo-rifts near the divide are buried 200m below the surface. This observation provides a powerful constraint on the timing of the first grounding at about 1200 yrs BP. &nbsp;The depth of burial on the NE side of the divide (30-40 m) indicates more recent grounding (400-500 yrs BP).</p> <p class="p1">In summary, our data show that the modern ice rise is not a remnant of the expanded Ross Ice Sheet, but rather it formed when the Ross Ice Shelf re-grounded locally after the grounding line had retreated inland from its present position. Our data support the following sequence of events: (i) prior to 1200yrs ago, the grounding line had retreated inland from Crary Ice Rise; (ii) about 1200yrs ago, a rifted ice shelf grounded on the south-west side of the ice rise. Assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, the shelf that first grounded on Crary Ice Rise was at least 500m thick. (iii) about 450yrs ago, the north-east side of ice rise grounded.</p> <p class="p1">More recent evolutions of the ice rise are accessible through comparison of time series of velocity vectors within the surrounding ice shelf; the first measurements were in 1976 as part of the RIGGS project. Subsequent satellite measurements (e.g. 2010, 2019) exhibit significant changes in both speed and direction, likely a result of ongoing slowdown of Whillans Ice Stream (<strong>Fig. 6</strong>: Velocity vectors). In addition<span>, the changes in flow have contributed to upstream thickening and migration of the ice rise.</span>&nbsp;More recent ICESat-derived changes in thickness also show relatively small changes on the grounded section of the ice rise, and large changes on the Whillans ice plain upstream of the ice rise.
