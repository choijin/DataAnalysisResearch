<AbstractNarration>Coastal environments today are receiving unprecedented amounts of nitrogen, an important nutrient that, in excess, results in nuisance algal blooms, oxygen deficiency, and fisheries collapse. Mitigation efforts will depend on an understanding of the natural pathways by which nitrogen is removed. This research will examine the environmental conditions that control two microbial nitrogen removal processes, denitrification and anammox. There are still many uncertainties concerning the environmental factors that control these processes in coastal ecosystems, as the anammox process has only recently been discovered and hypothesized to rival denitrification in its removal of nitrogen. These uncertainties will be addressed through a series of environmental monitoring and tracer experiments conducted in seagrass sediments in Australia. This work will be accomplished in collaboration with Dr. Dirk Erler, an expert in the field of coastal nitrogen cycling with access to unique analytical equipment and field sites at Southern Cross University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, this research will investigate (a) the environmental conditions conducive for the production of the greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide, in systems where denitrification and anammox co-occur and (b) the role of organic carbon in determining the contributions of anammox and denitrification to nitrogen removal. Chambers will be installed on sediments in seagrass beds to enable in situ monitoring of denitrification, anammox, and nitrous oxide production rates. Isotopic tracers will be added to the incubations to track the formation of end products of nitrogen cycling processes by mass spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. These sediments will also be analyzed for a suite of environmental parameters that can be examined as possible controlling factors. Very little nitrogen cycling research has been conducted in seagrass ecosystems, so this study will provide novel insights into nitrogen removal processes and greenhouse gas production in this environment. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Australian Academy of Science.</AbstractNarration>

Mitigation efforts will depend on increased understanding of the natural pathways by which nitrogen is removed. This project examined the environmental conditions, such as carbon supply, that control two microbial nitrogen removal processes in seagrass ecosystems, denitrification and anammox. Additionally, this project sought to determine the amount of nitrogen released as nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. This project is expected to make several important contributions to the fields of ecology and oceanography. (1) An improved understanding of the role of seagrass ecosystems in the global budget of nitrous oxide. This study will provide some of the first measurements of production rates of nitrous oxide from seagrass environments. These measurements could be used to determine the global role of seagrass systems in global climate change, particularly because this study examined nitrous oxide production in the context of environmental controlling factors such as carbon supply and other nitrogen removal pathways. (2) Enhanced awareness of the contributions of two competing microbial nitrogen removal pathways, denitrification and anammox, to total nitrogen removal in coastal systems. The anammox process was discovered less than two decades ago and is now recognized to rival denitrification in its removal of nitrogen worldwide. It is thus crucial to understand how these processes interact in order to improve knowledge of the global nitrogen cycle. This study is the first to determine the rates of denitrification and anammox simultaneously in a seagrass ecosystem. (3) Insights into the role of quality and quantity of organic carbon addition on nitrogen removal in seagrass ecosystems. As seagrass systems provide nearly 1/6 of marine carbon storage, the impact of carbon on nitrogen processing therein is likely to be quite strong. (4) The first environmental application of the newest modification of the Isotope Pairing Technique (IPT), a modeling approach that determines the rates of individual and total nitrogen removal pathways using a stable isotope tracer. Nitrogen removal rates modeled by the new version of the IPT can be compared to those modeled by earlier versions to determine effectiveness of the modeling approach and its impact on our understanding of nitrogen removal pathways worldwide.</p> <p>Preliminary findings have been disseminated at two seminars at Southern Cross University and Michigan State University.
