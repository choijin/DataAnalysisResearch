<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award provides for the acquisition of geochemical instrumentation which will serve faculty and undergraduate student needs within the Claremont University Consortium (CUC), providing rapid and cost-efficient instrumentation to analyze chemical composition in a wide range of rock, soil, sediment, seawater, and biological materials. This instrumentation will substantially accelerate activities within the research programs of faculty as well as foster interdisciplinary collaboration. The ICP-OES will expand the analytical facilities of the Environmental Science, Biology, Chemistry, and Geology programs and will strengthen collaborative teaching and research among the students and faculty in diverse disciplines from separate institutions. Acquisition of the instrumentation will directly serve a diverse group of undergraduate STEM and non-science majors through integrated lab work in courses and individual student research training. In-house instrumentation will greatly enhance students? ability to directly and clearly connect first-hand scientific training and research to real-world concerns with scientific, environmental, and/or social benefits. The instrument will be housed at the W.M. Keck Science Department of Claremont McKenna, Pitzer, and Scripps Colleges, and faculty at each of the five Claremont Colleges (including Harvey Mudd and Pomona) will use the complete analytical system to train an economically and socially diverse group of STEM and non-science undergraduates on analytical instrumentation, data acquisition, processing, and interpretation. Training in geochemical analysis will help foster success for graduates who go on to work in industry or conduct graduate research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this award funds the acquisition of an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) instrument, coupled to a laser ablation (LA) inlet system and microwave digester. The LA-ICP-OES and microwave digester will allow researchers to generate paleo-reconstructions of seawater temperature and elemental cycling from the skeletons of long-lived organisms to understand variability within our climate and ocean systems, trace the progression of ancient mining and human movements with trace element time series derived from speleothems and fossil teeth, constrain the compositional suitability of barite in soils for Ar/Ar geochronology to help generate a new partial chronology for Pliocene-Holocene climate records in the desert Southwest, analyze feldspar and hornblende to unravel crystal growth stages and mineral responses to changing magmatic and metamorphic conditions and in analyses to understand cycling of nutrients during the Cambrian explosion. Additional users will also incorporate analyses by ICP-OES into their research and teaching programs. Academically, the instrumentation will be used to measure soil chemical compositions in the core course required of all non-science environmental analysis majors and minors at Claremont, and in an upper division soil science course. Senior thesis students and upper level science students at all five CUC colleges will use the instrumentation to measure heavy metals in a variety of materials to determine product origins and interpret potential consumer health impacts. Similarly, the instrumentation will support a pilot group-thesis project to measure suspended sediments in rivers in Costa Rica. Thus, this ICP-OES will provide hands-on undergraduate training through both structured laboratory activities and original student-faculty research.</AbstractNarration>
