<AbstractNarration>The University of Montana (UM) College of Humanities and Sciences (CH&amp;S) will utilize NSF-MRI funding to acquire a Breuckmann SmartScan 3D Scanner for the purpose of education and research among faculty, staff, and students in various departments, including Anthropology, Computer Science, Biology, and Geosciences. The research applications of this equipment include high resolution digital capturing of prehistoric and historic artifacts, fossils, and biological materials for the purpose of morphometric examination, preservation, and curation. Educational applications include teaching morphometric analysis and digital forensic reconstruction techniques. The 3D scanner will be located in the Social Science Research Laboratory (SSRL), which is operated and maintained by the CH&amp;S. The SSRL offers a computer-oriented teaching environment and a technical research laboratory to faculty, staff, and students in the College of Humanities and Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acquisition of this instrument offers significant intellectual merit.  The PI, co-PI, and other UM faculty use the high resolution 3D scanner to expand their research capabilities as well as the educational offerings available to students. The quality of ongoing research is greatly enhanced by this technology and it provides an impetus for students and staff to pursue new research directions. Investigation and development of standardized methods for improving the overall quality of research associated with artifacts, fossils, and other items are already underway at UM.  However, the capabilities offered by this instrumentation permit this research to grow to its full potential. The ability to perform high resolution 3D scanning in-house allows UM scholars to be on the leading edge of three dimensional object imaging and analysis based research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant transforms 3D imaging research and the education capabilities currently available at the UM and thus offers a range of broader impacts. The faculty and researchers involved in this grant project are committed to diversity and have a reputation for working with a diverse student body that includes underrepresented populations such as Native Americans, women, non-traditional, and special needs students.  Involvement with research projects utilizing technological equipment fosters interest and encourages these students to seek careers in the science and technology fields by offering better opportunities for advancing their education. Acquisition of the Breuckmann SmartScan 3D Scanner allows UM the ability to capture unique and fragile artifacts in a high precision digital format that can be made readily available for educators and researchers through digitally rendered files. This increases the availability of special materials and allows pieces to remain safe while exact replicas are in use, bolstering K-20 outreach efforts by producing items that can leave the laboratory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With support from the National Science Foundation, The University of Montana (UM) purchased and installed a Breuckmann Smartscan Three Dimensional Imaging System.  The new system is located in a permanently dedicated space within the UM Social Science Research Laboratory (SSRL) where it is operated by trained technicians and available for a variety of research and education projects.  Use of the new scanning system offers significant intellectual merit in its application to research projects at the UM.  Some of these projects include studies of global human cranio-facial variation, examination of rare incised artifacts from a prehistoric village in the Interior Pacific Northwest, and research into variability in Montana fossils.  Consequently, research employing the system contributes to our understanding of evolutionary process and human history. The system also offers multiple broader impacts including opportunities to enhance student training in 3D scanning technology, development of traveling materials to teach children in primary and secondary schools about the fossil record, and creation of a digital zoological museum focusing on specimens from the UM Wright Museum of Zoology. The latter effort will be particularly beneficial to zooarchaeological and forensic scientific researchers across North America.  The SSRL staff are working to publicize the availability of the instrument to a variety of audiences spanning the local community to professional societies including the Society for American Archaeology.  The intent here is to generate wide interest in developing collaborative research with UM faculty and staff involving 3D scanning with this instrument. Announcements are planned for UM news magazines, professional magazines, and the local newspaper. The Breuckmann Smartscan Three Dimensional Imaging System offers a significant contribution to the research and educational infrastructure of The University of Montana.
