<AbstractNarration>NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components to prepare young scientists for careers in biology and provide them an opportunity to establish international collaborations and take advantage of research facilities and opportunities abroad.  Forging strong international collaborations is mutually beneficial to the U.S. and the foreign hosts.  The fellowship to Carly D. Kenkel supports a research and training plan to investigate the evolution of symbiont transmission mode using reef-building corals as a model system.  The research will advance basic scientific knowledge concerning the evolution of mutualisms and elevate understanding of the coral-algal symbiosis, the foundation of one of the most ecologically and economically important ecosystems on earth.  The host institution is The Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Line Bay.  Training goals include acquiring expertise in novel biochemical techniques, next-generation sequencing methods and bioinformatics analyses. Educational and public outreach activities include establishing a high school internship program at AIMS in collaboration a local school.  This fellowship is being funded jointly by the Office of International and Integratiave Activities and the Directorate for Biological Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symbioses are ubiquitous in the natural world, yet little is known about how transmission mode evolves in any system.  Reef-building corals are a good system in which to study this question because symbiont transmission mode has diverged repeatedly and recently across coral lineages. This research tests the hypothesis that vertical symbiont transmission (direct transfer of symbionts from parent to offspring) stabilizes mutualistic relationships.  Laboratory experiments use biochemical and physiological assays to quantify resource sharing between coral hosts and algal symbionts in closely related corals with different symbiont transmission strategies. Comparative genomic methods are being used to identify genes involved in the evolution of different transmission modes by looking for signatures of selection.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Cooperation between species has played a major role in the diversification of life. A continuum of relationships can be found in nature, ranging from short interactions, such as cleaner wrasse and their reef-fish clientele, to life-long partnerships, as in the coral-algal symbiosis, to fully integrated organelles, like mitochondria within eukaryotic cells - the very cells that make up the human body! Yet despite abundant examples, there is still much to learn about how and why these partnerships become more or less integrated over time &ndash; what drives two independent organisms to become a single super-organism?</p> <p>Corals are an especially interesting group in which to study this question because some coral species naturally differ in the degree of integration with their symbiotic algal partners. Most corals acquire the algae from their environment, which is called &lsquo;horizontal transmission&rsquo;. But some coral species are able to pass their algae directly to their offspring, in the process called &lsquo;vertical transmission&rsquo;. &nbsp;Vertical transmission is thought to be an important step in the creation of a &lsquo;super-organism&rsquo; because it ties specific hosts and symbionts together for the long-term, allowing them to benefit each other for multiple generations.</p> <p>The broad aim of this postdoctoral fellowship was to investigate corals as a potential model system in which to study transitions in cooperation between species and to investigate a factor predicted to strengthen the coral-algal relationship: vertical symbiont transmission. First, I tested whether vertical transmission led to increased benefits in a laboratory experiment. I compared three pairs of closely related coral species with vertical and horizontal transmission. I examined the physiological response of these corals, including calcification, photosynthesis, bleaching and the sharing of nutrients between hosts and symbionts. I found that species that pass symbionts on to their offspring in their eggs are more bleaching tolerant. I also discovered that while bleaching causes the coral to lose algae, both the coral animal and remaining algae continue to cooperate through the sharing of nutritional resources. &nbsp;This means that though bleaching is defined as the break-down of the coral-algal relationship, it does not necessarily mean that these partners cheat each other out of resources.</p> <p>My second aim was to understand the genetics of vertical transmission &ndash; what genes allow some corals to pass their symbionts to their offspring? To do this, I first had to sequence the expressed genes (the genes that make proteins) of coral species that are vertical transmitters and coral species that are horizontal transmitters. I used next generation sequencing and bioinformatics to assemble these &lsquo;transcriptomes&rsquo; and have made these new genetic resources freely available for use by other scientific researchers and the broader public (<a href="http://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/carlslab/data/">http://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/carlslab/data/</a>), which will help other scientists who also research these species.</p> <p>Investigating natural differences in the transmission of symbionts will contribute to understanding the diversity of life on earth, but there are also pressing applied reasons to probe deeper into the coral-algal relationship. This symbiosis is the foundation of one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet: tropical coral reefs. Climate change threatens corals because of the sensitivity of the coral-algal symbiosis to environmental stress. Therefore a greater understanding of coral-algal relationship will be key to understanding and mitigating coral bleaching.</p> <p>Broader outreach activities conducted as part of this award included in-classroom engagement with K-12 students from regional Queensland discussing topics ranging from basic coral biology to careers in science. In addition to individual presentations to various Townsville schools, I co-coordinated Science Excellence School Open Days at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), served as a CSIRO <em>Scientists-and-Mathematicians-in-Schools</em> mentor for Kirwan State High School&rsquo;s marine biology class and participated in the <em>Catch a Rising Star: Women in Science Queensland</em> in which I coordinated the Emerald, QLD trip. Overall, 800+ students were directly impacted over the two years of this award. Additional activities included a public lecture at the Museum of Tropical Queensland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Discover More Talks&rsquo; series, participation in the AIMS Open Day 2015 and co-curation of the @realscientists &ldquo;Coral Week&rdquo; twitter feed, which garnered 200,000+ impressions.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/28/2017<br>      Modified by: &nbsp;</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1401165/1401165_10331081_1498667246562_IMG_1252--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1401165/1401165_10331081_1498667246562_IMG_1252--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Driving the tender"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1401165/1401165_10331081_1498667246562_IMG_1252--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Driving the tender"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">I obtained a QLD boating license to drive the vessel tender in order to collect corals for my research project.</div> <div class="imageCredit">D.
