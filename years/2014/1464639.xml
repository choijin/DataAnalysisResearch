<AbstractNarration>With this award, funded by the Division of Chemistry, Professor Hongtao Yu of Jackson State University and his collaborators in the REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) Leadership Group will conduct a workshop for current REU site Principal Investigators and potential REU Site Principal Investigators (approximately 60 total invited participants) to discuss best practices in running effective REU sites. The REU Site Program represents a multimillion dollar effort by the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation to provide talented undergraduates the opportunity to engage with professors and other scientists in authentic research experiences.  Many of these REU students do not have opportunities to engage in research in their home institutions.  Running an effective REU site Program is challenging, and the workshop will provide opportunities for Principal Investigators to share strategies for making the REU experience as high-impact as possible for the student and faculty participants.  Investment in this workshop will help to strengthen the impact of the significant investment of NSF resources into the REU Site Program.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Prof. Yu and his colleagues will convene the workshop in the summer of 2015 in San Antonio, Texas.  Objectives for the 2015 Workshop include:  the bringing together of the Chemistry REU PI community to facilitate the exchange of ideas in formal and informal settings; the engagement of REU PIs in a discussion of critical issues in management of an REU site, including the recruitment of a diverse cohort, participant tracking, and training in research ethics; the engagement of REU PIs with other NSF communities (e.g. the LSAMP Community); a discussion of the unique issues related to working with Community College and non-traditional students.  Participants at this workshop will learn skills and develop their professional networks, enabling them to be more effective leaders of undergraduate research efforts at their home institutions.</AbstractNarration>

A pre-workshop questionnaire was set up using the website and was sent to all REU PIs to respond.  It received 39 respondents.  During the first night of the welcoming mixer, a total of 52 participants registered online and flew in.  After registration, it was followed by a mixer and dinner.  The current Chair of the REU LG, Dr. Justin Fermann welcomed everyone and shared the pre-workshop survey results.  The "Get-to-know" each other mixer really facilitated the interaction. PIs gained a great deal of information about other sites.  These valuable information were able to help the new PIs on "how to run their own sites" or to seasoned PIs on "how to improve their sites".  As one of the main objectives, we on Targeted Recruiting for Broadening Participation by inviting three prominent speakers for the workshop: 1) Dr. Benjamin Flores, Director of the University of Texas System LS AMP; 2) Dr. Emanuel Waddell, former Director of Alabama LS AMP; 3) Dr. Glake Hill, former Director of Mississippi LS AMP,Jackson State University.   The three speakers gave a detailed account of the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LS AMP) program on its history, setup, alliance structure, student activities, etc.  They spoke from three different angles and the three LS AMP programs on how to recruit and nurture underrepresented minorities (URMs) for each individual REU programs.  The talks were very informative and to some REU PIs, they are very enlightening to hear what actually happens when they send in a recruitment flier. Finally they discussed ways to recruit and work together.   The speeches were followed with a panel discussion by adding Dr. Gloria Thomas, Louisiana LS AMP program, for REU PIs to ask questions and to discuss how to work together.  This was followed with breakout sessions by pre-assigned six tables for all participants.   The second major session was on participant tracking and common application. Dr. Audrey Rorrer, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Assessment Director for College of Computing &amp; Informatics, Evaluator, Center for Education Innovation, presented a talk on "CISE REU Evaluation Toolkit". It was further evaluated to see whether the common application would be adopted.    Workshop Assessment:  An assessment instrument for the workshop was developed and distributed to the participants.  They were collected at the end of the workshop and the results are summarized below.  A total of 26 questions were asked to gain answers with a rank of 1 (Excellent), 2(Very good), 3 (good), 4 (Fair), and 5 (Poor).  The sheets were collected and summarized below in the Table.  As can be seen, the average score is in the range of 1.1 - 2.1.  This means the workshop was planned and run very well for the participants.   The participants (REU site PIs) obtained the information they needed to conduct their site activities, especially for those new sites and anticipated sites.   Provided the links between LS AMP programs with REU sites to collaborate on broadening participation. Provided program details and issues related to LS AMP program as an education theme for the REU PIs. Provided other venues for REU LG to consider to advertise the REU Sites to URMs.   Provided information for participant tracking and assessment Provided tools for REU PI?s to improve on REU participants training on scientific writing and presentation skills development.  Provided information and feedback for consideration for "Common Application" for the REU LG to consider.    We also dealt the only score that is above 2, "NSF REU LG Website Information".  Although the LG Website is a good one, there are things to be improved.  The LG had since made improvements to the website after the workshop based on this evaluation and other prior observations. We are confident the website is improved.            Last Modified: 07/29/2016       Submitted by: Hongtao Yu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
