<AbstractNarration>The photosynthetic reaction center is a remarkable machine that absorbs light and transfers electrons across a biological membrane.  Membranes are very thin insulators so this process is similar to charging a capacitor.  Once charged, the capacitor discharges by driving the biosynthesis of stable energetic molecules or fuels.  All life on earth depends on this process. This research program will continue to support the development of a generation of young scientists with diverse backgrounds, primarily graduate students, who go on to productive careers at the interface of the physical sciences and biology, biotechnology, and energy-related science.  In addition to scientific publications, the results of this work are presented in many invited talks that reach out to diverse communities from the high-school level to government agencies looking to future directions in nanoscience, biotechnology and energy-related science. Photosynthesis is a topic of deep interest to a wide community of scientists and engineers as well as to the general public. This work provides the basis for the development of new courses both for college freshman and graduating seniors stressing the importance of critical reading using current frontiers and controversies in biophysics firmly grounded in the physical sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this research are to better understand the mechanisms by which photosynthetic reaction centers harvest and store solar energy, and to develop model membrane assemblies that mimic natural biological membranes and their interactions.  This research will focus on understanding how the organized environment in proteins modulates the spectroscopic and redox properties of bound prosthetic groups like chlorophylls and quinones and on the mechanism of the initial light-driven reactions.  A significant part of this work involves the development of new experimental and theoretical methods that will have a broad impact in other areas of science and technology.  Stimulated by studies of this important integral membrane protein, novel membrane assemblies will be developed to create defined architectures for the organization of any membrane protein.  Membrane proteins serve as gatekeepers for the otherwise impervious membranes that surround cells and internal organelles.  They are also the primary contact between cells.  These proteins are difficult to work with and characterize in their native environment, and this research will create new ways to study their function by designing architectures that are compatible with sophisticated optical and electrical detection methods.  Thus, the two objectives are deeply connected as different aspects of membrane biophysics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit  We seek to understand how the organized environment in proteins modulates the spectroscopic and redox properties of bound prosthetic groups like chlorophylls, hemes and retinals, with important functional consequences. While focused on photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs), the concepts and approaches can be applied to any organized biological system. A significant part of this work involves the development of new experimental and theoretical methods, and these can have a broad impact in other areas of science and technology. Nearly every spectroscopic, structural, and theoretical method has been applied to some aspect of photosynthesis research. In many cases a question related to photosynthetic function stimulated the first application of a physical method to a biological problem, which then impacted other areas of biophysical research and other disciplines.  These concepts and techniques have spun off complementary research programs in our lab and many others.  The RC is the minimal assembly of chlorophylls, quinones and proteins needed to achieve the initial light-driven charge steps of photosynthesis.  As a protein assembly associated with a biological membrane, the RC's function is to separate charge across the membrane in response to light, much like charging a capacitor; this capacitor is then discharged by reactions that take place in the dark and lead to the synthesis of ATP, the energy currency of cells. While the primary sequence of the RC has been extensively manipulated by site-directed mutagenesis, we sought to expand the scope of possible changes by using amber suppression to introduce non-canonical amino acids.  This is the most significant achievement of the past grant period as it opens up a broad range of new ways to manipulate RC structure and function.  We have also used advanced imaging mass spectrometry methods to obtain information on the sub-micron scale organization of lipids in model biological membranes.  While such organization is generally believed to exist, at least locally, and is the key to many biological functions, these new methods provide the first direct information on this organization.  Lastly, in collaboration with Noah Burns' group, we have studied the self-assembly of highly unusual ladderane lipids found in anammox bacteria.  These bacteria are responsible for roughly 50% of the nitrogen in the oceans, and these lipids are believed to play a key role in the membrane of the organelle that is responsible.  Broader impact  Sustained support from NSF has greatly impacted the training of a generation of scientists with diverse backgrounds, primarily graduate students, all of whom have gone on to productive careers at the interface of the physical sciences and biology, biotechnology, and energy-related science.  The work has been presented in many invited talks and at workshops, including ones that reach out to diverse communities and government agencies looking to future directions in nanoscience, biotechnology and energy-related science.  The PI has developed a new course in Biophysical Chemistry for senior Chemistry majors and, due to high demand, a parallel course for first year graduate students.
