<AbstractNarration>This collaborative grant will help address current shortcomings of the data we have on Western droughts during the last 6,000 years. Currently most data on droughts has been derived from tree-ring records, but we have realized that although tree-ring data give excellent annual resolution, trees tend to record only summer weather while they are actually growing the ring, and winter weather is under-represented because ring growth is slow or stopped during this season. Given the importance of winter precipitation for much of the West, this gap in data has made accurate modeling difficult, and this grant will attempt to address that by sampling lake sediments, which 'record' the weather throughout the year in their bottom sediments, although at less than annual resolution. This work will result in a new map of droughts throughout the study period that will incorporate previous lake and tree-ring records from a region spanning from British Columbia in the Northwest to New Mexico in the Southeast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grant will produce six new lacustrine sediment records (two from British Columbia, two from Alberta and two from New Mexico) that would extend 6000 years through the middle Holocene and conduct sedimentological analyses on core transects from closed-basin lakes to constrain water-level changes as a physical means of confirming the magnitude of hydrologic change inferred from the stable isotope measurements. The Penn State group will use paleodrought data produced previous efforts in Washington and British Columbia, as well as data from published research to improve intermediate complexity Earth system model (EMIC) data assimilation exercises, while the Pitt and UMN-D groups will produce new lake-level and stable isotope data from sites in the Pacific northwest and the desert southwest that have already been identified and in several cases cored. The team would combine analyses of open-basin isotope records and leaf wax deuterium measurements with the closed-basin and algal biomarker records to produce reconstructions of drought variability that are not influenced by changes in the isotopic composition of precipitation. The team has quantitatively interpreted the lake sediment oxygen isotope and lake level records using hydrologic and isotope mass balance models, and will synthesize the resulting data to produce a gridded, paleodrought network. These reconstructions would be used to investigate hypotheses regarding contrasting, North-South drought patterns in the Pacific Northwest and the desert Southwest during the Medieval Climate Anomaly, the Little Ice Age and middle Holocene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will support two graduate students in the field and laboratory, as well as some undergraduate research activities, and the results will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at professional conferences and public meetings. The collected cores will be available for further sampling by other researchers, and the results will be made publicly accessible and available in a NOAA database.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We recovered sediments from 12 lakes in Washington and Alberta and produced dated stable isotope records detailing paleohydrology from 5 of these systems (Castor, Round, Shark, Middle Hogarth, and Celestine).  These independently-dated archives of precipitation-evaporation balance from the Pacific Northwest document changes in climate over the last 6,000 to 14,000 years.    One of the major contribution of this work has been the establishment of a drought index based on combining oxygen isotope records from an open and closed basin lake system.  The &#8710;d18OCastor-Lime drought index is the first of its kind to extend past ~8,000 yr BP and can be used to evaluate drought in the North American west. The &#8710;d18OCastor-Limedrought index indicates that the Pacific Northwest experienced extensive drought conditions at times across the early and middle Holocene. These records, along with other lacustrine-based paleoenvironment and paleoclimate records from the wider northwestern North American region point to a period with droughts of greater magnitude, longer- duration, and impacting a greater geographic area between ~12,000 to ~6,000 yr BP than seen during the last 6,000 years. These results provide insight on the timing and relationship between early and middle Holocene lake lowstands and external forces on hydroclimate, where extensive drought likely occurred in response to high summer insolation that resulted in hotter, drier, and longer summers. Drought across this time period may have been further enhanced by reduced winter precipitation leading to lower lake levels and contributing to overall drier conditions.     As summer temperatures increase across the region in relation to global warming, there will likely be increased drought conditions due to snow and ice melt occurring earlier in the summer months and to enhanced evaporation levels throughout the summer months. The Pacific Northwest is currently prone to drought and fire and these phenomena could increase with rising summer temperatures which will impact humans, animals, and plants. Further research is needed to clarify the extent to which changes in precipitation and temperature during the early and middle Holocene influenced lake levels in the region, however records indicate that climate in the region was significantly different from the last 6,000 yr and what we experience today. Continued evaluation of climate and environment during the early and middle Holocene will be important for preparing for future regional and global climatic influences on the region.      Ongoing work is aimed at using high resolution oxygen isotope and charcoal accumulations from Castor and Round Lakes, eastern Washington, to reconcile conflicting proxy records from different sources and investigate climatic changes over the past millennium at the highest possible resolution.  Regional compilations of tree ring records indicate that the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) was marked by persistent megadroughts, whereas the Little Ice Age (LIA) was generally wet (Cook et. al 2010), in contrast to carbonate lake records from the region (Steinman et. al 2014).

The background component of charcoal records from the two lakes are closely correlated to one another, suggesting it reflects the regional signal of biomass burning from the region. Past studies from western North America suggest the LIA was a period of suppressed biomass burning (Marlon et. al 2012). We find fire events occurring throughout the records, but suppressed fire activity during the wet 19th century. Fire events appear to closely follow wet winter/dry summer conditions, when abundant fuel is grown and promptly desiccated. Elevated charcoal accumulation occurs during the periods of multi-decadal drought during the Little Ice Age, indicating that these dry spells did not sufficiently discourage fuel generation at our study sites to prevent extensive fire events. Our reconstructions show the value of both quantitative hydrological modelling of isotope records as well as high resolution, multi-proxy lake sediment analyses.
