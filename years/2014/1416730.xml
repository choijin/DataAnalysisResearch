<AbstractNarration>Despite recent gains in global agricultural productivity, sustained, equitable, and stable access to food continues to be a concern in many parts of the world.  This interdisciplinary research project will examine why people in one region are faced with food insecurities in order to gain insights that will have wide-ranging utility.  This project will enhance understanding of the critical societal problem of food security and will communicate potential solutions to decision makers by developing tools that synthesize qualitative and quantitative information from geography, sociology, decision science, and sustainability science as well as cross-disciplinary knowledge on food insecurity.  Because food security is a complex problem that involves many stakeholders across different spatial scales and within different contexts, the investigators will use computer modeling to enhance understanding of the key elements  of the food system, explain food insecurity, and provide tools for long-term policy making for improved food availability, access, and stability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will focus on a study of food insecurity in dryland West Africa, a region where changing environmental conditions and socioeconomic systems have left many people hungry despite increases in agricultural productivity.  The investigators will develop and test a collection of small, independent computer models to describe and analyze different aspects of the food system. They will use mental modeling, multilevel structural equation modeling, agent-based modeling embedded in a geographic information system, and system dynamics modeling in an integrative, participatory, and iterative manner in order to examine mechanisms affecting food security.  Mental modeling will help depict and communicate stakeholder perceptions, while multilevel structural equation modeling will be used to explain how individual attributes and structural factors affect food availability.  Agent-based modeling embedded in a geographic information system will help describe spatial and temporal variability of food access, thereby explaining how individual behaviors link with livelihood vulnerability, while system dynamic models will evaluate how the dynamics of climate change, drought, hunger, and humanitarian relief over time impact on food security. Each model will build a progressively richer understanding of the problem, and an overarching scenario study tool will encapsulate the models and provide a transdisciplinary platform for synthesizing information from the models through scenario generation and evaluation.  Model development, evaluation, and application will be informed by on-the-ground discussions with stakeholders in the study region.  This project is supported through the NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (IBSS) competition.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Project Overview</strong></p> <p>Since the late 1960s, agricultural productivity has dramatically increased around the world. Yet, despite decades of investment in expanding soil productivity, technology transfer, and international aid, sustained, equitable, and stable access to food continues to be a concern in many countries in Africa.</p> <p>Research has suggested that food security is a complex issue involving different aspects like food availability, access, utilization, and stability, which differently affect individuals, families, communities, and countries. To date, scant attention has been paid to how individuals and households perceive their food insecurity, how the uncertain global environmental change drives local and regional food-related decisions, and how both the biophysical and human factors influence food production, access, and consumption.</p> <p>Building on these foundations, this interdisciplinary research project has examined why people in select countries in Africa face food insecurities. This study involved developing models that represent different scales of the problem, use different data sources, and focus on various elements of the food system ? from climate influence and soil productivity, through food market analysis, technology adoption, to social and behavioral factors like gender roles in the family, household poverty, dietary intake, and social support.</p> <p>Through discussions with individual families, NGOs, local officials, and scientists with on-the-ground knowledge of the topic, the research team has developed simple standalone computer models to represent and examine food system processes at various spatial, temporal, and human choice scales. The model outcomes have been presented back to stakeholders for validation and feedback. Finally, an all-encompassing scenario study tool has been built to streamline the synthesis of the models' results and discover food security scenarios that hold under a broad range of future environmental and social conditions (Image 1).</p> <p><strong>Methods</strong></p> <p>To guide data collection, analysis, model development, and synthesis, we designed a framework, called <em>Participatory Ensemble Modeling</em>, with three principles in mind (Image 2): (a) developing models that represent perspectives of different decision-makers, (b) building simple models that correctly describe the system, and (c) leaving some level of uncertainty in the models to allow for exploration of various future scenarios. Models were built from data rather than theories. We performed in-person interviews and focus group discussions, acquired and processed archival data at the community and regional scale, and gathered globally available country-level quantitative data.</p> <p><strong>Research Outcomes</strong></p> <p>The project's outcomes fall into two broad methodological categories: (1) contribution to modeling food security at various spatial and temporal scales, (2) contribution to big data scenario analysis. <em>Contribution to modeling</em> consisted of building multiple representations of the food system using four modeling methods (Image 3): (a) mental models diagrammed human decision behavior, and the perception of food insecurity on an individual level using data from interviews, (b) multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) examined various interrelationships among food security drivers operating on many scales, (c) agent-based modeling (ABM) explored how the dynamic relationships between the environment (land use, soils, climate, social support) and farming practices expose families to food shortages, and (d) system dynamics modeling examined how stocks and flows of resources critical to food production and distribution operate over time. <em>Contribution to scenario analysis</em> aimed at developing a new scenario analysis tool to synthesize the standalone models' results. This computational tool facilitates long-term policy-making by identifying scenarios that meet three criteria: robustness (identify policies that will not collapse under unusual future conditions), optimization (select policies based on preferred outcomes), and efficiency (make sure that the policies are low-cost and fast-delivery).</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p> <p>Our multi-scalar research and insights allow us to explore policies and options for enhancing food security not tied to only national or household levels. For example, we highlight the importance of community-scale dynamics in ensuring food security under climate, cultural, and demographic change. By constructing simple standalone models, we demonstrate a <strong>stepwise approach to scenario analysis</strong>. Outcomes can be analyzed: (1) <em>individually</em> (for example, MSEM revealed that the most critical drivers of national-level undernutrition are fertilizer use, food production, diet energy adequacy, GDP per capita, tractor density, and poverty), (2) <em>in combinations</em> (for example, results from both MSEM and ABM show that interdependent factors mainly drive the future of food security - e.g., successful solutions to family food deficiency require water-resistant crop varieties AND better allocation of work due to intergenerational changes in family structure), or (3) <em>as a synthesis</em> of the results of all models, that are used to generate 'stories' of possible futures using the quantitative scenario analysis tool, together with narratives, pictures, diagrams, and photographs. Such flexible model outcome synthesis allows for building individual-model upshot scenarios presented to specific groups interested in only certain aspects of the food system as well as comprehensive, in-depth all-model scenarios that outline the future of food security at many different angles.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Arika&nbsp;Ligmann-Zielinska</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416730/1416730_10325915_1606710690206_IMAGE1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416730/1416730_10325915_1606710690206_IMAGE1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="IMAGE1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416730/1416730_10325915_1606710690206_IMAGE1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="IMAGE1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Example problems at different scales of the analysis addressed using different models.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Arika Ligmann-Zielinska</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Arika&nbsp;Ligmann-Zielinska</div> <div class="imageTitle">IMAGE1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416730/1416730_10325915_1606710839124_IMAGE2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416730/1416730_10325915_1606710839124_IMAGE2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="IMAGE2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416730/1416730_10325915_1606710839124_IMAGE2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="IMAGE2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Modeling framework used in developing different stand-alone models.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Arika Ligmann-Zielinska</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Arika&nbsp;Ligmann-Zielinska</div> <div class="imageTitle">IMAGE2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416730/1416730_10325915_1606711170763_IMAGE3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416730/1416730_10325915_1606711170763_IMAGE3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="IMAGE3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416730/1416730_10325915_1606711170763_IMAGE3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="IMAGE3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematic representation of model development and validation.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Arika Ligmann-Zielinska</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Arika&nbsp;Ligmann-Zielinska</div> <div class="imageTitle">IMAGE3</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
