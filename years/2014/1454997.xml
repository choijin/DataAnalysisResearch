<AbstractNarration>There is a growing need for providing supplementary educational resources for the students and parents to use at home. Access to high-quality content and sequencing that content remain to be two of the main challenges.  This team has developed a technology that has the potential of becoming every teacher's assistant and help them develop their instructional plans, collaborate with their peers and experts, access high quality instructional/educational resources, receive mentoring, and connect their students/parents to educational resources that can be used at home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology "CPALMS" is a K-12 educator portal that includes 16 web-based apps for curriculum planning, collaboration, and professional development. In particular, a curriculum mapping (CMap) tool was developed to guide and assist districts, schools, and teachers in developing interactive, detailed curriculum plans and connect them with thousands of high quality and vetted instructional resources to help them implement the curriculum standards (e.g., Common Core State Standards). This tool provides smart recommendations for instructional/educational resources based on the teacher's plans and timeline. This portal was developed by an NSF grant which aimed to get four school districts in Florida to pilot the portal.</AbstractNarration>

Some of the most significant outcomes of the grant include:  Our team completed the I-Corps training program which was an essential component of the grant. This was an excellent training program that helped us create a business model to test through potential customer interviews and negotiations for the commercialization efforts of the system.   We conducted more than 178 customer interviews during the life of the project. The project goal was to conduct 100 interviews.   The training and customer interviews helped us identify gaps in our solution that needed to be filled before commercialization could be accomplished.   Prior to the program, we identified the entire portal as the product but through the program we discovered that we have several products packaged as one but better commercialized separately.   Establish a business model that includes a pricing structure that we are able to test in the marketplace.   Meet potential customers, learn about their problems, and how we can solve them   License our technology and content. One license has been issued and expanding and the other one is in advanced discussions. A third one is in the planning phase.   Overall, we believe we had a very successful project and this grant was a tremendous opportunity for our team. We believe this will continue to help us expand our support to K-12 educators and sustain all the work we have been able to accomplish so far.
