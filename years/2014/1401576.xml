<AbstractNarration>Non-genetic phenotypic variation plays an important role in many biological phenomena. It is generated by a variety of physiological mechanisms and maintained by non-genetic inheritance with variable degrees of fidelity. Transitions between phenotypes are influenced by the internal history of the cell and the environment. The environment, on the other hand, can be altered by the population through metabolism and secretion of chemicals. Therefore, phenotypic variability and population fitness must be understood as a triad dynamical problem of cells-population-environment with dynamic interactions between all levels playing equally important roles. This research project will deepen our understanding of how non-genetic inheritance contributes to phenotypic variability in microorganisms and how variability affects the population fitness. This in turn will help better understand the evolution of such traits in living organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will study of the dynamics of protein expression and population fitness. Initially, the influence of growth rate and non-genetic inheritance on the dynamics of protein expression controlled by the LacO promoter will be studied. Based on the acquired data here, together with similar data collected by collaborators on the GAL system in yeast, a universal model describing how the dynamics of protein expression contributes to the variability in protein copy-number across a population will be developed. Afterwards, the dynamics of population fitness and its symbiotic interaction with protein expression will be examined. In addition, the influence of different types of environmental stress on the fitness dynamics and protein expression will be assessed using the LacO system as before and a second model system with engineered plasmids expressing antibiotic resistance. The last stage of the project will focus on the dynamic interaction between phenotypic variability and population fitness in spatially inhomogeneous environments, where the environment can alter the phenotype and thus its interaction with the environment and the population fitness. For this purpose, the sensing network of Escherichia coli will be used as a model system, with the ratio of the receptors Tar/Tsr being the phenotype of interest. This study will examine the variation in the ratio of the two proteins, and aim to: (i) measure the effect of growth rate and protein inheritance on the Tar/Tsr distribution, and (ii) study the dynamics of phenotypic variability and population fitness in spatially inhomogeneous environments. The experiments described above will utilize microfluidic and microscopy techniques, and will be coupled to a theoretical component that aims to develop quantitative modeling of the data acquired and provide predictions that can be experimentally verified. The project will integrate research in the interdisciplinary field of biological physics with education to: (i) Include high school teachers and students in research projects in the PI's laboratory and develop instructional material based on their work to be distributed to high schools in the area. Students from under-represented minority groups will be particularly encouraged to participate in this initiative. (ii) Develop biophysics experiments for students' undergraduate laboratories, and (iii) Introduce new instructional material focusing on applications of physics in biology into courses at all levels in the undergraduate program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.</AbstractNarration>

To accomplish these goals, we planned to specifically:  1) Study the dynamics of protein expression (as a quantitative representative of a cellular phenotype) at the single-cell level and determine how the observed variability in the protein copy-number across the population emerges from the single-cell dynamics.  2) Measure the population fitness (growth rate) dynamics under different environmental stress conditions, and determine its effect on the expression of proteins relevant to the fitness.  3) Combine the results of both previous sections in an attempt to understand and quantitatively describe population dynamics in spatially inhomogeneous environments.  Within the period of this project, we have successfully completed several studies that have significantly advanced us closer to our main goals:  1)    We have built an experimental system, which has delivered valuable data on the cell growth and protein expression dynamics at the single-cell level (see image 1). This has enabled us to develop a new mathematical framework that provides a quantitative explanation for how non-genetic variability in any cellular trait emerges in a population from the single-cell dynamics.

These achievements provide a new viewpoint into a fundamental question about cellular homeostasis, and we expect that they will improve our understanding of the problem and our ability to study it experimentally with advanced techniques.  In addition to the scientific achievements, under the umbrella of this project, a total of 5 graduate and 1 undergraduate students, 1 postdoctoral researcher, 3 high school science teachers, and 4 high school students were trained in experimental research for different periods of time.  Finally, our scientific results have been also shared with the community in various ways:  1)      5 published papers in peer-reviewed journals and 2 manuscripts under review.  2)      5 invited and 1 contributed conferences and workshops talks, and 9 invited talks at different universities.  3)      Experimental data was shared with various theoretical groups.
