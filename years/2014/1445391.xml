<AbstractNarration>This proposal is for support of the next three Northeast Probability Seminars. The first of the three meetings will be held November 20-21, 2014 in New York City at Columbia University.  The Northeast Probability Seminar is a two-day conference to be held annually during the month of November. The goal of the conference is to have talks by both well established and promising probabilists. The organizers will continue to invite women to speak and to seek speakers from other underrepresented groups. The meetings will have four featured talks, two on Thursday morning and two on Friday morning. Thursday and Friday afternoons will be set aside for informal sessions where participants will be encouraged to give ten-minute presentations of their recent work or to discuss open problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specialized mathematical meetings like this are very important. They give people an opportunity to exchange ideas and try out new theories. They also give young people an opportunity to question experienced mathematicians. Regional meetings are especially important because it is easy to follow up on significant conversations. They also foster the sense of belonging to a group of active researchers--in this case the Northeast Probability group.The conference website is: http://www.math.csi.cuny.edu/probability/NortheastProbabilitySeminar/</AbstractNarration>

The last three conferences, supported by this grant, were extremely successful and reinforced the group's intention to continue holding  an annual probability seminar  that would draw researchers and graduate students in the Northeast and would give young investigators a chance to interact scientifically with specialists. Close to ninety mathematicians attended, some from as far away as Tennessee, Georgia, Indiana and California.     Specialized mathematical  meetings like this are very important. They  give people anopportunity to exchange ideas and try out new theories. They also  give young peoplean opportunity to question experienced mathematicians.
