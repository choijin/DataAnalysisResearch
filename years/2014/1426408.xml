<AbstractNarration>Asset pricing theory has recently been criticized for its inability to explain historical data from field markets. Yet its poor record does not mean that it is scientifically invalid. Our experience (as experimentalists) is that theorists are not aware of the scientific record of asset pricing theory (how well it works in a controlled setting). The aim of the workshop is to sensitize theorists to this record. It should make them aware not only of the successes (of the theory), but also of where the theory fails (and how the failures can be addressed). It is hoped that the workshop heralds a new era where theorists work in closer collaboration with experimentalists. The PIs have a long track record not only in financial markets experimentation, but also in the experimental method in general (having contributed successfully to neuroscience), and they have published in asset pricing theory. As such, they are uniquely positioned to moderate the proposed dialogue between theorists and experimentalists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Financial economics is rather abstract and mathematical, and its value is difficult to ascertain from merely observing real-world financial markets, which operate in a complex environment where many key variables either remain unobserved or cannot be measured reliably. In the last decade, however, tools have been developed to study financial markets in the laboratory, where real people trade for real money. The controlled setting is designed to emulate the theoretical context and as such has proven to be  an ideal testing ground. The workshop aims at bringing together theorists and experimentalists in order to start a dialogue. Experimentalists are to be taught what aspects of the theory are defining, and hence, need to be tested, and theorists are to be encouraged to explain their models in terms of experiments with which to gauge scientific validity, which requires theorists to understand the experimental approach. We thereby import into finance a longstanding tradition from the physical sciences. The goal is to move finance to an evidence-based discipline. This will ultimately benefit financial markets policy formulation and rule making, which until now have primarily been model-based, or in the rare occasions where the data were available, informed only by empirical analysis of historical data.</AbstractNarration>

We aimed at a balanced audience, and in particular, we made an effort to obtain gender balance: of the 21 participants on the program, six were women. Participation was solicited based on an initial list drafted with input from the advisory committee. In addition to invited participants, locals from the University of Utah (faculty; students) attended the conference.  The format of the conference promoted interaction: theorists were to present work (including previously published) that they thought should be put to experimental testing; experimentalists presented work that exemplified the goals, scope and power of experimentation. Each paper had a discussant, pairing experimentalist-discussants with theorist-speakers and v.v. Topics ranged from traditional asset pricing to advanced topics such as collateral equilibrium and financial contagion.   The conference was extremely well received. We asked participants to summarise what they thought about it, and report several responses below. George Constantinides, U of Chicago: "The Sundance conference for the promotion of experimental validation of the theory of asset pricing, organized by Peter Bossaerts and Elena Asparouhova, brought together top leaders in experimental economics (Charles Plott, Bill Zame, and the organizers), market design (John Ledyard), and upcoming scholars in the field of experimental economics to present their research and exchange ideas.

The NSF grant was wisely spent. I very much hope that Peter and Elena will organize such conferences in the future." Sophie Monais, Wharton/U of Toulouse: "I presented an experimental research project on "Risk sharing and asset pricing." My research is at the crossing of economics and finance. While the experimental methodology is widely used and recognized in economics, it is not standard in finance. Consequently, it is usually much more difficult to convince researchers in finance that we can actually learn from observing the behavior of subjects in a lab, and that this may help improving the theory.

Charles Plott, Caltech, "I had not realized the substantial  overlap between my research interests and current interests in finance.  In that respect, the conference was an eye opener.  I managed to get a deeper insight about how the finance community thinks, the evidence they look for and how the structure of their models differ from those I typically use.  In addition, I now know people who I had only known by name previously.   The feedback on my own work was valuable.  The finance people sat up and looked when I presented material that I would typically place in remote footnotes and the results I thought were profound were sometimes met with yawns.  Exploring  why led me to an understanding that I could never have gotten from simply reading journals. I left with projects in mind."  Ryan Oprea, UCSB, "This is one of the best thought out, innovative and ultimately successful academic workshops I have ever attended.  I think it's central idea -- to bring experimentalists and theorists together to discuss a topic in a structured way -- is a model for making progress in theoretically motivated experiment...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
