<AbstractNarration>Many models in the sciences and engineering are solved approximately using computational methods, and it is necessary to theoretically justify the reliability of the computed approximations. In addition to providing justification of the numerical methods, the theoretical analysis often provides insight for the development of new methods with improved efficiency, accuracy, and viability. In this project, the investigator and a graduate student will construct, analyze and implement numerical methods for classes of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations arising in stochastic financial models, stochastic differential games, and other applications in finance and engineering. The overall aim of the project is to develop methods that can be implemented using current computational software and to derive explicit estimates of the approximate solutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this project is to propose robust finite element discretizations for a class of fully nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations and to develop a comprehensive convergence theory.  The project consists of two integrated components: (1) The development of finite element methods for second order elliptic equation in non-divergence form with non-smooth coefficients; the building-blocks of the HJB problem, (2) The construction, implementation and convergence analysis of practical finite element discretizations for the HJB problem.  The work will broaden the mathematical theory of the finite element method to problems that have been relatively untouched in the numerical community. The success of this project will have broad impacts in the mathematical and computational applications of stochastic optimal control in finance and engineering.  In addition, the impacts of this project are felt though the training of the next generation of computational scientists, course development, and dissemination to the mathematical and scientific computing communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of this project is to construct efficient and practical computational methods for fully nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations, a class of problems arising in stochastic optimal control.  The proposed finite element methods are constructed with either continuous or discontinuous basis functions that are readily available on computational software packages; thus, the methods are relatively simple to implement for computational scientists.  In the first step of this project, the PI developed several new computational methods for a class of partial differential equations (PDEs) in non-divergence form, the building blocks of the HJB problem.  Algorithms were constructed to compute this class of problems with continuous and discontinuous coefficients, and non-trivial theoretical analysis was developed proving the convergence and efficacy of the methods.    The second step of the project extended these discretization techniques for linear PDEs to the fully nonlinear HJB problem.  A compehensive stability and convergence analysis that theoretically justifies the reliability of the methods was developed under realistic assumptions of the data.  In addition, algorithms to compute the resulting nonlinear algebraic system were developed and implemented.        The PI advised three graduate students during the project's duration at the University of Pittsburgh: Sarah Khankan, Quinn Donahoe, and Mohan Wu. Sarah developed and implemented mixed finite element methods for PDEs in non-divergence form and  constructed efficient solvers of the resulting algebraic system. Quinn studied and implemented related variational problems with nonlinear constraints. Mohan Wu constructed computational methods for PDEs in non-divergence form and to the fully nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.      The PI organized the conference, "Nonlinear PDEs, Numerical Analysis, and Applications," held on October 2-3, 2015 at the University of Pittsburgh and supported in part by the NSF conference grant DMS-1541585. This conference created a forum for junior and senior researchers to discuss and to disseminate recent advances on numerical methods for fully nonlinear PDEs and their applications. In addition, the PI co-organized  the mini-symposiums "Advances in finite element and boundary elements" at the WONAPDE 2016 conference and "Recent trends in finite element methods" at the 2017 AMS Spring Southeastern Section Meeting.
