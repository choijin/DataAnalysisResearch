<AbstractNarration>CBET-1403405/1402142&lt;br/&gt;Ahn (Syracuse)/Ronney (USC)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Portable electronic devices (PEDs) such as cell phones and laptop computers have ever-growing needs for electrical power, yet the batteries they use provide only 1 to 2% energy per pound as hydrocarbon fuels.  Because hydrocarbon fuels pack high energy densities, they are the fuel of choice for power generation at large scales.  However, this is not done at small scales since engineers have been unable to scale internal combustion or steam engines down to the sizes required to generate electricity for PEDs.  Tiny fuel cells (which convert fuel directly into electricity) have been used to power PEDs, but have only succeeded by using fuels such as hydrogen or methanol which have safety issues and/or very low energy per pound when the weight of the storage tank is included.  The present work proposes to use propane and butane, the same easily-stored, high energy density fuels used in disposable lighters, for generating power for PEDs and provides a very simple, versatile system for supplying air to the device.  The results of this work could have a significant impact on PEDs with electrical energy storage densities exceeding batteries by a factor of 10.  Moreover, disposal of empty fuel cartridges in landfills is preferable to disposal of used batteries containing toxic metals.  This work will involve undergraduate and graduate engineering students and also educate K-12 students through programs at Syracuse and USC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Portable electronic devices have ever-growing needs for electrical power, yet batteries provide only 1 to 2% of the energy density of hydrocarbon fuels.  Scale-down of internal combustion engines and electrical generators to MEMS scales has been unsuccessful due to issues with heat losses, friction and the difficulty of manufacturing parts at small scales with sufficient precision.  The PIs propose to generate electrical power from hydrocarbon fuels at small scales using (1) thermal transpiration in nanoporous materials for fuel and air pumping; (2) combustion on Pt- and Au- catalysts with room-temperature ignition; and (3) single-chamber solid oxide fuel cells requiring no seals or separation between fuel and oxidant for power generation within the thermal transpiration pump.  Reactors of arbitrary shape will be constructed using parts built using a unique 3-dimensional printing technology for porous sintered stainless steel.   The activity of supported Au nanoparticles for low-temperature ignition of hydrocarbon oxidation will be measured using in-situ FTIR/Gas Chromatography analysis.  To determine what property has the most impact on low-temperature oxidation, their surface structure modifications will be assessed via Scanning Electron Microscopy and their chemical modifications via X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy.  The effects of ion substitution on the properties of double-perovskite structures will be investigated and the catalytic behavior of several precious-metal, oxide-supported electrocatalysts will also be examined.  A high purity source of gadolinia-doped-ceria is expected to increase the electrolyte conductivity, yet retain the processability for thin-film electrolyte fuel cell fabrication.  The envisioned system is self-contained, has pumping and power generation integrated into one device, has no moving parts and operates only on thermal and electrochemical energy supplied by hydrocarbon fuels (i.e., it has no parasitic electrical energy losses).  This research could also enable spin-off applications to other systems requiring gas pressurization or vacuum pumping, e.g. micro gas chromatographs or toxic chemical agent sensors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project has resulted in significant steps to the development of a self-contained power generation system with no moving parts, utilizing readily available hydrocarbon fuels. The project first developed a fundamental basis of a thermal-transpiration based power system.  First a cubic combustor was designed to house the fuel cell. All six faces employed Alstrome glass microfiber filters, 1.1 mm thick with nominal pore radii of 0.6 or 1.6 &micro;m as transpiration membranes. All six faces of the combustor would demonstrate transpiration.  Five sides were exposed to air and one side to the fuel.  Four combustors were fabricated using varying parameters.  SOFCs were also successfully fabricated in a planar geometry.  The starting materials for the SCSOFC electrolyte, anode and cathode were, respectively, Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC); NiO+SDC (60:40 w/w); and Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-&delta; (BSCF) +SDC.  The figure 1 illustrates the entire system, the exploded view is shown in (a) and the assembled system is shown in (b).  In order to confirm the feasibility of the combustion design, a thermal transpiration system was constructed using a glass microfiber filter as the transpiration membrane.  Perforated brass sheet metal was used as the thermal guard.  The combustor was a cube of side 3 cm.  Testing proved that the device was capable of combusting 15 ml/min of propane under stoichiometric conditions.  Experiments were then conducted to decrease the operating temperature of the SOFC.  In order to fabricate cells which would satisfy requirements, gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) was used as the electrolyte material.  Ni+GDC was the anode and lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) was used as the cathode.  In order to get favorable results, a number of sintering temperatures were used to determine the optimal sintering temperature.  Best results were obtained when the sintering temperature was 1350 &deg;C.   Additional work was done in order to decrease operational temperature and maintain performance. Again GDC was utilized as the electrolyte material. Ni+GDC was the anode and LSCF was used as the cathode. The main focus was on an altered manufacturing technique.

The Ni+GDC anode powder is pressed into a pellet and then a new electrolyte layer is sprayed onto the pellet. This is believed to increase the interface between the anode and electrolyte layers increasing performance.  Another activity that was undertaken was to reduce the ignition temperature of the system to lower the temperature required to start the self-sustaining combustion and transpiration process.  In order to achieve this, a two-stage combustion scheme was investigated for feasibility.  The idea is to use an auxiliary fuel which can be ignited at a lower temperature and then to use the thermal energy from that reaction to ignite the primary fuel (the fuel which will be used for combustion, transpiration as well as to drive the fuel cell).  A tubular design was then investigated for the SOFC, as well as the combustion chamber/ thermal transpiration chamber. A tubular design would allow for increased active surface area to volume ratio.  A tubular SOFC was successfully manufactured and integrated into a tubular combustion chamber. As shown in the figure 2, the SOFC and combustion chamber were successfully tested.   The award has allowed for fundamental work to develop a SOFC, thermal-transpiration based power system with no moving parts that can be further developed into a commercially viable product. The project has successfully resulted in a thermal transpiration based pumping combustion chamber and SOFC?s capable of lower temperature performance.
