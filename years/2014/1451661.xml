<AbstractNarration>Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a promising technology that is gaining acceptance in mainstream education as a means to engage students in real world problem solving, design, and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) topics. This technology offers unique and exciting benefits in special education classrooms allowing students, instructors, and therapists to quickly design and produce customized physical objects such as tangible learning aids or custom assistive technology. For example, instructors can 3D print objects to visualize abstract scientific concepts, or create custom grips and handles to help students access classroom technology. This technology also offers the opportunity for individuals who cannot safely operate traditional manufacturing machines to build and customize physical objects. While there are many promising opportunities for this technology to impact special education, the needs and abilities of students with disabilities and their instructors have been largely ignored in the design of existing 3D modeling tools, machine operation, and instruction. Specifically, many of the existing tools have a steep learning curve, are not accessible, or are time consuming to use. In this project, the investigators will work closely with special education instructors to evaluate existing tools and develop new ones that serve the needs of this diverse and unique population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requirements analysis will be conducted using observations and interviews; evaluation of existing design tools; and the development and testing of new tools. Researchers will observe an established technology-rich classroom, provide technical support for 3D printing, and through these activities learn the unmet needs of people with disabilities and their instructors for 3D printing in an instructional setting. Through workshops and classes, the researchers will evaluate existing tools for 3D modeling, and provide support and training in these contexts, noting the content and kinds of training that are most needed and useful. The researchers will collaborate and co-design with stakeholders to design and test new 3D design tools, which will be iteratively developed and deployed in the field, and their adoption observed. Follow-up interviews and evaluations will measure how these new tools have addressed the challenges posed, and how they are perceived by the stakeholders. Potential metrics include accuracy of design contrasted with expectations and needs; satisfaction with 3D models and printed outcomes; time savings related to the design process; and actual and perceived benefits of printed artifacts. These steps will reveal what types of support are necessary for modeling and 3D design in these contexts, and afford a better understanding of how to provide a 3D printing instructional and design environment that is accessible by people with disabilities.</AbstractNarration>

By addressing the unique needs of individuals with diverse cognitive abilities, we can support the needs of a wider population interested in learning these technical skills including children, older adults, and professionals not in technical fields.

This student group was very diverse and included 10 females and 8 underrepresented race / ethnic minorities in STEM. 42 young adults (21 with intellectual disabilities, 21 without) learned 3D printing and modeling skills and the potential to apply them towards entrepreneurial activities. 120 physical therapy graduate students learned how 3D printing could be used to produce assistive technologies.  We engaged 4 special education instructors and 11 therapists on the design and development of 3D printable assistive technologies.  We interviewed 8 special education instructors, 2 special education administrators, 3 assistive technology specialists, and 7 mainstream educators on current 3D printing practices and how best to integrate this technology into the classroom.    This research was conducted in collaboration with several local organizations who generously donated their time and resources including Kennedy Krieger Foundation, the UMBC Shriver Center, the Digital Harbor Foundation, and the University of Maryland Baltimore.  Findings from this research have been shared at many academic and non-academic events including the US Science and Engineering Festival, local and national MakerFaires, and STEM events at local museums and libraries.
