<AbstractNarration>This award supports student travel to the 7th International Conference on Multiscale Materials Modeling, October 6 - 10, 2014 in Berkeley, California. Multiscale modeling of materials has emerged as a central theme to address the complexities in the prediction of material behavior. This conference will bring together a range of scientists from around the world and from different sub disciplines to exchange ideas on this topic. The development of multi scale materials for materials is of significance for the goals of the Materials Genome Initiative. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides financial assistance for graduate students and post doctoral researchers to attend the conference by partially supporting their attendance cost. It is expected that about half of such attendees from US institutions will be supported. By providing such financial assistance this award contributes to the goal of broadening the participation in the discipline.</AbstractNarration>

The MMM conferences are dedicated to the cross-pollination of ideas by bringing together researchers from diverse areas of application and from all over the world.  The conference consists of oral presentations (plenary, invited, and contributed) and poster sessions, and time for informal networking and discussion.  There were 10 technical symposia covering a wide range of traditional and novel area of research.  Some of the symposia have arranged publications of speicial issues on scientific journals.  Intellectual Merit: The MMM 2014 conference disseminated cutting-edge research and catalyze innovation in materials modeling both on method development and on mechanical, physical, chemical, and biological applications with long term benefits for energy independence, homeland security, and human health.   Broader Impact: The conference allowed young students/researchers to interact and network with world leaders in the community, and will foster close interactions between theorists and experimentalists.  By providing support to graduate students, this award helps to ensure a healthy future of the scientific community.            Last Modified: 09/02/2015       Submitted by: Wei Cai]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
