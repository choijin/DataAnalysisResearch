<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, Dr. J. Heath Anderson and a team of Mexican colleagues will conduct the first intensive archaeological exploration of Cerro Magoni, a site in Central Mexico in imminent danger of destruction.  Cerro Magoni is located just north of Mexico City in an area called the Mezquital Valley, which is best known as the location of the site of Tula, the capital of the Toltec state (AD 950 - 1150).  The project addresses a recent resurgence in scholarly interest in the collapse and regeneration of complex societies.  This topic has been of interest to anthropological archaeologists since the 1970s and 1980s and continues to be an important focus of investigation and critical debate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research tests an emerging model for the regeneration of complex society in the Tula area in Central Mexico ca. AD 550 - 950, a time period called the Epiclassic.  From approximately 0 to 550 AD, the Tula area was integrated into the political and economic networks of Teotihuac√°n, located to the southeast in the Basin of Mexico, which was the capital of Mesoamerica's first empire and the largest urban center at the time.  Four centuries later, power and population were again centralized in the form of Tula Grande, a densely occupied city in its own right located to the northwest of the Basin, and the capital of the Toltec state. The processes involved in the regeneration of complex society in the Tula area during the intervening centuries remain unknown.  Over the past six years, ceramic analysis and new radiocarbon dates have indicated that the political landscape during this period might have been much more fractious than was previously thought.  Several centers once thought to have been occupied at different times may have in fact been contemporaneous, competing political units that ultimately coalesced into the Toltec state.  Absent from these reconstructions, however, is Cerro Magoni, which according to surface survey data was the most extensive and populous settlement in the region during the Epiclassic.  However, reliable information derived from excavation regarding the site's true span of occupation is not available.  This is critical for testing the emerging multicentric model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research provides insight through a program of topographic mapping and stratigraphic excavation. Unfortunately, real estate developers are in the process of purchasing Cerro Magoni to construct a luxury housing development on the site, which will destroy most if not all of the prehispanic remains.  The summer of 2012 may be the last opportunity to map and explore this site before its integrity is severely compromised.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will improve the production, curation, management, and sharing of archaeological data at Tula by producing a digital database to centralize and back up perishable paper records to improve organization and access.  This project also facilitates involvement of local populations in archaeological projects, providing training in archaeological laboratory analysis techniques, continuing a tradition of local involvement in archaeological projects at Tula that spans more than 70 years.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes of the Cerro Magoni Mapping and Excavation Project  In order to understand the importance of the outcomes of any archaeological research effort, it is helpful first to consider the physical remains of past societies (the 'archaeological record') as a kind of document that records the results of numerous natural experiments in human living.  Archaeology gives us the opportunity to illuminate present-day problems and de-mystify current confusions by describing and explaining the long-term trajectories of human experience, documenting both the variations among different case studies as well as identifying common threads they share.  This provides us with the contextual information that is so important to U.S. citizens' ability to comprehend the import and meaning of present-day events and to contribute meaningfully to the thoughtful public conversations about policy solutions and their judicious, successful application.  The project described in this report, the Cerro Magoni Mapping and Excavation Project, sought to gather fundamental information about a particularly troubling time period in central Mexican prehistory that occurred between AD 550 and 950, a period called the Epiclassic.  Central Mexico during this time was being rocked by political and social upheaval, as the region's earliest empire began falling apart.  As the regional influence of this empire, centered on its capital city of Teotihuacan in the Basin of Mexico (just northeast of present-day Mexico City), declined, the political power it once wielded abroad began to retract, resulting in local power struggles among elite factions to establish and amplify their zones of control and economic well-being.  The hostilities that almost certainly resulted from these processes no doubt caused population movement, as people were dislocated from their ancestral homes by war and attracted by better opportunities elsewhere.  In some cases, this process also involved profound changes to environmental conditions, such as drought, that likely made a very bad situation even worse.  The present project focused on the investigation of the processes described above in the Tula region, located just to the north of the Basin of Mexico.  Having once been integrated into Teotihuacan's political and economic sphere, after Teotihuacan's collapse it appears that new populations entered the region, distinctive in the kinds of pottery, construction techniques, and other cultural traits they possessed.  For about 35 years, researchers worked to reconstruct the cultural patterns of this period of time (i.e., the Epiclassic), although more scholarly attention in the Tula region was lavished on the later development of the Toltec state, the grand civilization the Aztecs described to Spanish friars and conquistadores, whose capital was located in the area.  As a result, our understanding of the fractious Epiclassic in the Tula region remained the same for quite some time.  This understanding included the idea that new, in-migrating populations, perhaps from regions to the northwest, quickly established a centralized political capital after no more than about a century of perching small, autonomous communities on hilltops.  This political capital would eventually become the capital of the Toltec state, which subsequently expanded its influence beyond its local region.  As new data emerged that suggested the transition to the centralized political system of the Toltec state was a much longer one, possibly involving centuries of strife and antagonism between communities, the Cerro Magoni Mapping and Excavation Projecto was conceived in order to test this hypothesis.  Excavation and topographic mapping was undertaken on Cerro Magoni to document the scale of its public architecture (widely recognized as a reliable measure of political prominence and power) and to determine the date and duriation of its occupation.  As a result, we now know that the traditional reconstruction of events is l...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
