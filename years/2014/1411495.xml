<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program is funding the research of Kenton H. Whitmire of Rice University to develop new ways to make advanced metallic substances with potentially useful magnetic properties. The work is focusing on materials made from metals such as iron or manganese. When these metals are combined with a substance such as phosphorus, the two can come together in many different forms. Iron combined with phosphorus, for example, can form in at least five ways. All of these resulting substances are different, but they all are semiconductors, some of which display unusual behavior. One of these is called "magnetocaloric". This means their magnetic state varies with temperature. Substances like this could be used to produce an electronic refrigerator, in other words, a solid-state device that does not require the use of refrigerant gases. This work is, thus, having a broad impact: on the production of new and potentially important materials that will find a wide variety of uses in industry, and through the training of the next generation of scientists in advanced techniques for preparing specialized materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is developing new ways to prepare advanced materials that are difficult or impossible to synthesize by conventional means. In order to achieve this goal, new molecular precursors combining one or more transition metals (M) with the group 15 elements (E) are being prepared. The resulting E-M compositions have important magnetic, electronic and/or superconducting properties. This project is geared to overcoming the synthetic challenges of preparing advanced materials of binary, ternary and higher transition metal/main group element compositions. The approach considers single source precursors based on transition metal carbonyl compounds containing one or more transition metals as well as phosphorus and/or arsenic. The molecular precursors are prepared using sophisticated organometallic techniques to achieve the desired E/M compositions. These compounds are characterized by a variety of methods including single crystal X-ray diffraction, multinuclear and variable temperature nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry among others. The conversion of these precursors to the desired materials is examined by thermal decomposition methods. The resulting materials, prepared either as nanoparticles or thin films, are analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, powder and film X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and other electronic and magnetic measurement techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project aims to produce advanced materials for a variety of important industrial applications via the controlled decomposition of designer single-source precursor molecules. The project has involved three primary goals: (1) <strong>Synthesis of new precursors</strong>: This effort is focused on new main group element (E) and transition metal (M)&nbsp; cluster compounds that possess E:M ratios not already present in the literature but that would be expected to decompose to E<sub>x</sub>M<sub>y</sub> solid state materials with known important properties. (2) <strong>Production of thin films</strong>: The precursors reported in (1) are converted to phase pure materials. (3) <strong>Catalytic testing</strong>: We have partnered with the research group of Professor Jiming Bao at the University of Houston to test the thin film materials made in this project towards the water splitting reaction, which has tremendous application in the energy industry for the production of hydrogren as a fuel source.</p> <p>A summary of significant results from these three aims follows:</p> <p><strong>Aim 1</strong>:&nbsp; A number of new compounds have been prepared and characterized that fall into five broad classifications based on elemental composition, with compounds containing (1) iron and phosphorus, (2) iron, manganese and phosphorus, (3) iron and arsenic, (4) iron, manganese and arsenic, and (5) iron, manganese, phosphorus and arsenic. The latter composition is a particularly important goal because compounds containing Fe, Mn, P and As have been shown to have a very high magnetocaloric effect, which is important in the production of magnetic refrigeration devices and energy production. Twelve of these compounds have been reported in three publications chemical journals (<em>J. Organomet. Chem. </em><strong>2017</strong>, Ahead of Print;<em> Organometallics </em><strong>2016,</strong> <em>35</em>, 471-483; <em>Inorg. Chem. </em><strong>2016,</strong> <em>55</em>, 6679-6684). Several additional compounds have been prepared and their synthesis and characterization is being finished and will soon be published.</p> <p><strong>Aim 2</strong>: In preparing new film materials, we have targeted preparation of new phase pure materials, in particular thin films, that have not been previously reported, especially those that possess more than one type of transition metal or main group element. One study built on our production of pure Fe<sub>3</sub>P films in the previous NSF grant by codecomposition of the Fe-P precursor with a suitable Co-P or Fe-Te precursors to prepare Fe<sub>3-x</sub>Co<sub>x</sub>P or Fe<sub>3</sub>P<sub>1-x</sub>Te<sub>x</sub>, respectively. This work on has been published (<em><em>Chem. Mater </em></em><strong>2016,</strong><em> <em>28</em>, </em>7088-71). An different approach is to build the different elements into the same precursor and this project was also successful, leading for the first time to phase pure films of FeMnP in a metastable crystalline form (<em>Chem. - Eur. J. </em><strong>2017,</strong> <em>23</em>, 5565-5572). In work that is being written up for publication, we have prepared phase pure films of FeP and Fe<sub>2</sub>P. Our current efforts are extending these studies to produce films that contain Co or Ni in addition to Fe and/or Mn. Of particular significance is our ability to produce these films on a wide variety of substrates, including semiconductors, which has led to a particularly noteworthy application as described in Aim 3. One paper has also appeared that reports the completion of a project started under the prior NSF grant in which we have shown that we can coat Fe<sub>2</sub>P nanoparticles with a gold shell to produce photonic materials in collaboration with the research group of Professor Naomi Halas (<em>RSC Adv. </em><strong>2017,</strong> <em>7</em>, 25848-25854).</p> <p><strong>Aim 3</strong>: In collaboration with the research group of Professor Jiming Bao at the University of Houston, we have examined the catalytic activity of our films towards the water splitting reaction that produces H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>. FeMnP films have been deposited on TiO<sub>2</sub>, the first time a metal phosphide film has been prepared on a semiconductor. This achievement has allowed us to perform the photo-electrocatalytic production of oxygen evolution reaction using sunlight (<em>ACS Nano </em><strong>2017,</strong> <em>11</em>, 4051-4059). This report was featured on the Science360.gov website as a "top story"<em></em>. In related work, we deposited phase pure FeMnP films on nickel foam and graphene-coated nickel foam. That material has proven highly efficient at electrocatalysis for the total water splitting reaction (<em>Nano Energy </em><strong>2017,</strong> <em>39</em>, 444-453). This report was also picked up by Science360.gov and the DOE website as a "University Research Highlight). These successes have been particularly gratifying. In more recent work, we have examined the water splitting catalytic activity of Fe<sub>3</sub>P, Fe<sub>2</sub>P an FeP thin films. Fe<sub>3</sub>P is the most active of these and a manuscript describing this work is in preparation. Heterometallic phosphide compounds have proven particularly effective for water splitting catalysis and are being actively studied.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/01/2017<br>      Modified by: Kenton&nbsp;H&nbsp;Whitmire</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1411495/1411495_10321043_1502224012127_ForPressReleasev3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1411495/1411495_10321043_1502224012127_ForPressReleasev3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Photo-eletrocatalytic water splitting catalyzed by FeMnP films"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1411495/1411495_10321043_1502224012127_ForPressReleasev3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Photo-eletrocatalytic water splitting catalyzed by FeMnP films"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">FeMnP films deposited on titanium dioxide catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction of the water splitting process under irradiation.
