<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award supports the procurement of a large-scale structural testing system that is necessary to test full-scale specimens and verify the performance as well as the efficiency of various rehabilitation techniques for civil infrastructure. The evaluation and rehabilitation of America's aging infrastructure is a serious issue that is costing the country billions of dollars per year.  For this reason, research investigating economical rehabilitation techniques that can be applied easily, employed in a timely manner and that offer superior durability is of the utmost importance.  Experimental testing is required to verify and validate the quality of these rehabilitation techniques and materials before they are implemented.  The overall research vision for this project is the development of innovative, cost-effective and sustainable solutions for the renewal and rehabilitation of civil infrastructure in America and around the world.  Results of this research will benefit above and below grade structures including buildings, bridges and pavements and will help in maintaining public safety and confidence in the nation?s infrastructure.  In addition, it will also serve to enhance the education of engineering students by providing significant advancement in learning through the integration of teaching and research at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Durability is a key issue when it comes to investigating and evaluating the success or failure of the structural design of a new or rehabilitated structure.  The use of advanced and sustainable materials is being proposed as alternative solutions to ensure the durability of these structures.  The performance of these new and restorative materials will be evaluated by the research team through structural testing of a wide-variety of large-scale specimens under different loading combinations in conjunction with microstructural analysis of the materials.  This will allow the research team to evaluate the aforementioned materials under real service conditions and aid in understanding their failure mechanisms.  Additional topics that will be researched include: development of "smart" rehabilitated concrete and steel structures, performance of innovative and sustainable materials for use in new construction and structural rehabilitation, development of sustainable pavements infrastructure, investigation of time-dependent properties of soils and performance of engineered wood products.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The UMD Civil Engineering undergraduate program began in the fall of 2008 and along with the MS program that was started in 2011 has continued to expand with every new class of freshmen. A significant number of the students currently enrolled in the undergraduate program have indicated interest in the area of structures areas and 6 of 18 current graduate students are pursuing a MS degree with a focus on structures.  The LEED Gold Swenson Civil Engineering building was completed in 2010 and is outfitted with a state of the art strong floor, reaction wall and testing frame, but has lacked an actual structural testing system.  The structural testing system acquired through the NSF MRI grant has filled a major void in the research capabilities at the University of Minnesota Duluth in the rehabilitation of reinforced concrete structures, innovative and sustainable infrastructure materials, pavements and geomechanics. Results of this research will benefit above and below grade structures including buildings, bridges and pavements and will help in maintaining public safety and confidence in the nation?s infrastructure.   In addition, the acquisition of this equipment also serves to enhance the education of engineering students by providing significant advancement of learning through the integration of teaching and research at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. This is critical for the recruitment and retention of top faculty and students in the program and sets the groundwork for the advancement of interdepartmental and interdisciplinary research collaboration.   Intellectual Merit  Provides the capability for structural testing of large-scale specimens in a wide variety of configurations and with a large range in loading capacities for both research and education. Supports innovative research projects through the department of Civil Engineering as well as anticipated use in interdisciplinary projects with the sciences and industry collaborators. Provides the opportunity for collaboration with local industry for research and teaching integration with current projects. Fosters the dissemination of both teaching and research work through publications and conferences. Includes a team of primary researchers that has significant knowledge about the equipment so that implementation of the proposed work can begin immediately if awarded.   Broader Impacts  Supports research focused on improving the longevity, quality and sustainability of global infrastructure. Provides significant advancement of learning through an integration of teaching and research at both the undergraduate and graduate level. Supports efforts in the recruitment of women and underrepresented groups in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) fields through community awareness of the importance of Civil Engineering (and all STEM fields) to the public and K-12 students.
