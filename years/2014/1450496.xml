<AbstractNarration>Kathryn Hughes and Katherine Bailey Mathae of the National Academy of Sciences are supported in an award from the Division of Chemistry to support the Young Observer Program for the 2015 Congress and General Assembly of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). The objectives of the IUPAC Young Observer Program include providing networking and mentoring opportunities that foster interactions of the participants with leading scientists in their field, helping to nurture a future generation of chemistry leaders, providing opportunities for sharing research in a global forum from across the chemical sciences, and fostering international collaborations between U.S. chemists and their international peers. The Young Observer program will enable those who might not otherwise be able to attend the Congress and General Assembly to do so, encouraging the participation of a strong pool of U.S. chemistry talent at these meetings and in IUPAC activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximately 12 early-to-mid career scientists (under the age of 45) will attend the 45th IUPAC Congress and 48th IUPAC General Assembly.  The Young Observers will obtain travel grants as well as associated mentoring, networking and career development opportunities. The IUPAC Young Observer program has been in operation since 1977 and has introduced approximately 200 scientists to the international issues and progress in the field of chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2015, the U.S. National Committee for the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) selected and sent 12 mid-career chemists to participate in the Young Observer program at the IUPAC General Assembly, held in Busan, South Korea.  Established by the U.S. National Committee in 1977 to foster interactions with internationally acclaimed scientists in various fields, the IUPAC Young Observer Program strives to introduce the work of IUPAC to a new generation of distinguished researchers and to provide them with an opportunity to address international scientific policy issues. IUPAC and other national members also support Young Observers from other countries.  The U.S. Young Observers are under the age of 45, from industry, academia, and national laboratories. To date, the program has supported over 200 scientists, many of whom have continued to serve on IUPAC activities and contribute at the international level.  The primary objective of the program is to introduce participants to how the international union operates and what its projects and priorities are. As such, Young Observers are expected to attend the meetings of at least one IUPAC Division or Committee, with most attending two or more as schedule allowed. Observers are also invited to participate in the IUPAC Council meeting. U.S. Young Observers are matched with a member of the U.S. delegation to the IUPAC Council who serves as their mentor before and during the General Assembly. The mentoring relationship may continue if the Young Observer pursues involvement in IUPAC activities. Although a presentation at the coinciding IUPAC scientific congress is encouraged, it is not a requirement of the program.   Intellectual Merit  One outcome of the 2015 program was the growth of networking opportunities for the participants. In responding to a survey, all Young Observers reported at least some growth in their network to develop potential collaborations, especially internationally. The comments of one respondent emphasize the importance of this international networking:   "It is critical that investigators with complementary skills identify one another and work together to create something greater than the sum of the parts. In the U.S., we are very U.S.-centric in terms of identifying collaborators and establishing collaborations. The ability to attend international conferences and meet new potential collaborators who may be better suited for these projects than U.S. counterparts has the enabling capability of enhancing the worldwide scientific enterprise as well as ensuring the best team of scientists are working together to maximize the outcomes."   Another outcome is the increased potential of participants in serving as leaders in their chemistry community. A major activity at the General Assembly in which all Young Observers are required to participate is the World Chemistry Leadership Meeting. The 2015 theme was "IUPACÆs role in achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goals." In a workshop held the day before the Leadership Meeting, the Young Observers were tasked with formulating IUPAC projects that could fulfill the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Ideas were presented during the Leadership Meeting to be used by IUPAC in the development of its IUPAC-UN SDG Working Group, in which Young Observers were encouraged to participate.   In relation to the primary objective noted above, a major outcome of the program is the increased knowledge of the union and continued participation of the Young Observers in the union and its activities.  As such, it can be noted that in the survey, respondents indicated an increase in their familiarity with the union from before to after the General Assembly.  In addition, most of the participants indicated their intention to continue to be involved in IUPAC, with many stating they would develop and submit projects for the IUPAC project system or serve on an IUPAC task group, division, or committee.
