<AbstractNarration>Wireless technologies have percolated into people's daily life for personal communication, mobile Internet surfing, global positioning, digital media broadcasting, and smart home automation. These technologies are deployed in environments ranging from well-controlled laboratories and residential houses to highly dynamic urban surroundings. This work aims at improving a range of wireless technologies so that information can be broadcast more reliably, quickly and cost-efficiently in highly crowded WiFi, Bluetooth and LTE environments. Research has shown that uncoordinated wireless coexistence in overlapping channels leads to severe inefficiency in spectrum utilization. Although a few coexistence designs have been done recently to deal with cross-technology interference (CTI), those studies focus primarily on improving spectrum utilization in unicast communication. Unlike in one-to-one unicast communication, network topological features in one-to-many broadcast communication significantly impact broadcast spectrum efficiency. With the increasing demand for broadcast support, the field is facing an urgent need to investigate broadcast spectrum efficiency in the context of wireless coexistence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project conducts a systematic cross-layer study of broadcast under CTI, contributing novel designs across physical, data link, and network layers. The research topics include: 1) conducting extensive measurement studies to collect traces regarding cross-technology interference patterns in a wide range of environments; 2) building synthetic models to generalize instances of measure traces into a set of parameterized models that precisely characterize features of cross-technology interference; 3) empirically and theoretically modeling how uncontrolled CTI affects multiple wireless links simultaneously and proposing mitigation methods through network topology management; 4) delivering a spatial, temporal, and spectral CTI mapping device that exposures CTI information as a service to surrounding wireless ISM devices, so that these devices can seek white space opportunities in spatial, temporal and spectral domains for effective broadcast, and 5) supporting cross-technology broadcast by embedding side-channel information through cross-technology modulation. The broader impact of this work is amplified by (i) improving curriculum development with enhanced course projects; (ii) disseminating research results through high-profile tutorials and open-source sites; (iii) raising interest in technology among K-12 students and under-represented minority groups through open houses; and (iv) supporting talented female and minority PhD students to successfully accomplish their doctoral studies.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Project Outcomes Report<br /> <br /> This project investigates spectrum efficient broadcast under wireless coexistence in the shared&nbsp;spectrum. The research improves short/medium-range wireless technologies in ISM bands such as Wi-Fi Flexible Multicast Service, ZigBee, and Bluetooth and supports efficient wireless query dissemination, time synchronization, and code updating. It also helps to understand how to push LTE into the unlicensed spectrum (mostly 5G ISM bands) for better data rates through&nbsp;unlicensed&nbsp;carrier aggregation. With less wireless interference, we improve user experience in a few emerging applications such as live-event broadcast, mobile TV, radio broadcasting, managed software update, and public emergency alerts, making wireless access more efficient and reliable. &nbsp;Moreover, our work has led to a new frontier research direction, i.e., how to&nbsp;effectively&nbsp;support direct communication among different technologies under wireless coexistence. Our preliminary research result has won the best paper award in MobiCom 2017.<br /><br /> Technologies Innovation:<br /> <br /> During the project, our extensive empirical measurements have shown that the packet receptions of wireless communication appear spatial and temporal dynamics under the interference of coexisted&nbsp;heterogeneous&nbsp;technologies. We inspect into these spatial and temporal dynamics and propose interference/communication models to accurately capture the expected number of transmissions for a sender to reliably deliver packets to the receiver(s).<br /> <br /> These interference/communication models have broad impacts on the performance of a wide range of network protocols such as broadcast/multicast, opportunistic routing and network coding in throughput, energy consumption, latency, and reliability.<br /> <br /> In broadcast scenarios, a transmitter needs to deliver packets to all receivers in a network. We propose CorLayer, a transparent supporting layer for energy-efficient reliable broadcast that carefully blacklists&nbsp;certain&nbsp;wireless links based on the expected broadcast transmissions measured by our interference/communication models. CorLayer helps upper-layer broadcast protocols reduce about half of inefficient broadcast (re)transmissions. Those&nbsp;reduced&nbsp;transmissions&nbsp;significantly save the energy consumption as well as the latency for broadcasting.<br /> <br /> In opportunistic routing, a transmitter maintains a set of nodes as forwarders. This strategy significantly improves the communication reliability since if one forwarder fails to deliver a message, other forwarders can take over the delivery task. Our interference/communication models help opportunistic routing decide the most efficient forwarder set to maximize the throughput while guaranteeing reliability.<br /> <br /> <br /> Network coding is an emerging technology which can achieve the throughput upper bound in theoretical analysis. The performance of network coding in real-world scenarios, however, varies dramatically. It&nbsp;is reported&nbsp;that network coding brings negligible improvements but the extra coding overhead in some situations. Our work answers the community&rsquo;s concern &ndash; &ldquo;whether and when should we use network coding?&rdquo; We apply the interference/communication models on network coding and quantify the coding benefits. Our design helps network developer decide which scenario is suitable to&nbsp;apply&nbsp;network coding (i.e., when coding&nbsp;benefits&nbsp;outperform coding overhead) and how to maximize the coding benefits if network coding is&nbsp;applied.<br /> <br /> In addition to interference/communication modeling and their applications, we also improve spectrum efficiency through explicit coordination among coexisted&nbsp;heterogeneous&nbsp;technologies. We designed FreeBee, which breaks the communication barrier among&nbsp;heterogeneous&nbsp;technologies and enables direct unicast and broadcast among three popular wireless technologies: WiFi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth. The direct communication capability makes Freebee become a fundamental building block for global coordination among wireless devices with&nbsp;heterogeneous&nbsp;technologies.<br /> <br /> &nbsp;<br /> <br /> Most importantly, our study under this award opens a new cutting-edge direction, i.e., cross-technology communication under wireless coexistence, which&nbsp;is defined&nbsp;as direct communication (i.e., message/data exchange) among&nbsp;heterogeneous&nbsp;wireless technologies (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, etc.). Our work along this direction established the first cross-technology communication mechanism in the physical layer. This work won the best paper award in MobiCom 2017.<br /> <br /> <br /> According to the Google Scholar, our research has collectively gathered over 21,000 citations (h-index 63), a number that grows 1,600 annually in recent years.
