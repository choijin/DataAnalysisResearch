<AbstractNarration>Our nation's aging infrastructure presents a significant engineering and public policy challenge, particularly given that projected financial resources will not be adequate to fund the requisite structural system repairs and replacements to stem this infrastructure deterioration. The inevitable result is that buildings, bridges, roads, tunnels and other structural systems will frequently remain in service past their initial design lifetimes and design loads. Consequently, novel cost-effective solutions must be pursued to ensure the structural integrity of such systems, particularly when subjected to natural hazards such as earthquakes and strong winds. Structural systems equipped with smart damping systems, whose properties can be adapted to their changing environments, are one promising solution. This award supports fundamental research to enable design methods to incorporate dissipative and nonlinear nature of controllable dampers yielding smart damper designs with increasing performance at reduced cost. This will benefit the U.S. society by making controllable dampers a realistic approach for addressing the dilemma of aging infrastructure. The research involves disciplines of structural mechanics, control theory and computational science. This multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional project will help broaden participation by students from groups traditionally underrepresented in engineering research and will positively impact engineering education at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hybrid Model Predictive Control can affect a significant advancement in controllable damping capabilities to reduce structural response and improve structural safety.  The damper design will incorporate the physical dissipative limitations of the dampers through the use of hybrid system models to capture the on-off switching and to model predictive control for nonlinear or constrained dynamical systems. While the promise of this approach for controllable damping design has been established, several barriers must be overcome before wider implementation is possible. Using a set of bridge and building testbed structural systems and several models of controllable damping devices, this project will investigate learning-based methods and parallel computing techniques. The result will reduce the often prohibitive computational expense of repeatedly solving the high-order mixed integer-quadratic programming problems that arise from application to realistic structure models. Critical numerical and laboratory experiments will validate the efficacy of these nonlinear controllable damping approaches and establish that the resulting designs are robust to uncertainties and errors in the structural model, sensor noise and hardware limitations that challenge implementation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This project investigated new approaches for commanding controllable damping devices and evaluated these strategies in simulation, real-time hybrid experiments, and shake table experiments, demonstrating that the strategies proposed by the project team are superior to the conventional approach.  Controllable damping devices dissipate energy in vibrating structures, shaken by earthquakes or strong winds or other hazards, using sensors to determine the optimal forces to best dissipate that energy and reduce both the structure deformations (which otherwise can cause damage) and structure accelerations (which can damage structure contents or injure structure occupants).  Because these devices are inherently nonlinear, optimal strategies are difficult to design.  Several such strategies were developed as a part of this project: hybrid model predictive control (hMPC), neural network and linear approximations of hMPC, and optimal clipped linear control (OCLC).  hMPC should provide the best performance but requires computationally intensive calculations to achieve; OCLC provides performance that is superior to the conventional clipped linear quadratic (CLQR) control, is simpler to implement than hMPC, but requires some knowledge of the excitation (which can be overcome by evaluating simulations of different excitation scenarios). These controllable damping strategies were evaluated using several testbed structures -- including models of conventional buildings, base-isolated buildings, and an elevated highway bridge deck -- subjected to both random base excitations and historical earthquake ground motions, using performance metrics based on structural deformation, structure acceleration, and damper forces.  These evaluations were performed using computer simulations, including exploring the use of Chebfun (a software framework for numerical computation with near-symbolic accuracy but as fast as traditional numerical methods), real-time hybrid experiments (in which the damper is tested physically but coupled with a virtual numerical model of the structure); and shake table experiments (physical damper installed in a physical structure). The results of these studies have demonstrated the clear performance improvements that hMPC and OCLC can provide relative to the conventional CLQR, reducing structural deformation (i.e., less damage to the structure during an earthquake) and structural acceleration (less damage to structure contents and/or injury to occupants) more effectively than CLQR. Additionally, this project contributed to the development of novel approaches for evaluating the suitability of mathematical models of a structure and its components based on measured responses, and the propagation of uncertainties through such systems. The results of the studies funded by this project have been documented in four papers published in archival technical journals and eight additional journal papers that are in preparation, 24 presentations at national and international conferences (6 in Y1, 5 in Y2, 2 in Y3, 5 in Y4, 6 in Y5), and several undergraduate research symposia posters. Three doctoral students, one postdoctoral researcher, one master's student and three undergraduate students were partially supported on this project, and were trained in research methodologies and in effective presentation of their research results in both written and oral form.
