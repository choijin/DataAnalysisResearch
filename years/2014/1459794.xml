<AbstractNarration>Santorini is an active arc volcano associated with the Mediterranean subduction zone, which accomodates tectonic convergence between Africa and Europe. Santorini recently experienced geologic unrest and this study will document the current distribution of subsurface magma. Because the volcanic system is semi submerged Santorini is an ideal site for detailed imaging using marine instrumentation. Onshore-only studies cannot achieve broad enough aperture or dense enough coverag to allow mapping of magma throughout the crust. By determining the physical properties of the crust, this international team from the U.S., U.K., and Greece, seek to understand how magma at different depths crystallizes and what that might imply about both a basic research question- how does crust that eventually makes up continents form, and a geohazard question- does the current distribution of magma indicate a likelihood of sustained volcano inflation that might precede a major eruption? A US student will gain seismic data acquisition experience and training in state-of-the-art processing methods, while also learning to work within an international research team.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Seismic imaging of the crust at Santorini volcano is designed to constrain the distribution of subseafloor magma and any variation in extent of apparent degree of crystallization with depth. This site is viewed as representative of silicic arc volcanoes worldwide, so results could be representative of other arc volcanoes. Ocean bottom seismometers, and land seismometers will be deployed for a few-week field experiment. Active source signals will be recorded by these instruments as well as by a towed, multi-channel streamer. Tracklines laid out along a north-east trending, 10 x 50 mile swath, with Santorini at the center, will be image the lower crustal structure with unprecedented resolution. Data analysis emphasizes complementary seismic approaches: (1) Dense 3D isotropic and anisotropic travel time tomography  (2) Full waveform inversion tomography and waveform modeling to obtain higher resolution and more accurate elastic properties and their spatial variability.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Models of how magma accumulates beneath volcanoes need better constraints on the geometry, crystal content, and the distribution of magmas at all depths throughout the crust. The PROTEUS study collected a state-of-the-art marine seismic dataset at Santorini volcano in the Hellenic volcanic arc of Greece to determine the depth, geometry and melt content of magma reservoirs beneath the volcano. We applied travel time tomography methods to this data to generate images of the crustal compressional wave velocity structure.&nbsp;</p> <p>We generated new high-resolution geomorphologic maps of the seafloor that reveal how faulting, volcanism, and seafloor landslides shape the region.&nbsp; We find that the earthquake, volcanic, and tsunami activity of the Santorini-Amorgos region are a consequence of focused northwest-southeast extension as resulting from breakup of the breakup and rollback of the Hellenic slab. Our seismic velocity images of the area delineate the metamorphic horsts and sedimentary basins of the regions.&nbsp; These results reveal the pre-existing faults that developed during the tectonic evolution of the Aegean Sea. These structures control where the volcanoes of the Christiana-Santorini-Kolumbo volcanic group formed and their NE-SW alignment.</p> <p>Volcanic calderas are surface depressions formed by roof collapse following evacuation of magma from an underlying reservoir.&nbsp; We found that as the Minoan, or Late Bronze Age, catastrophic Plinean eruption at Satorini took place, first a limited area of the northern caldera floor underwent chaotic collapse that was followed by coherent down-drop that formed the present-day wider topographic caldera.&nbsp; We also postulated that the resulting structures control magma recharging of the volcano between catastrophic eruptions.</p> <p>Despite multidisciplinary evidence for crustal magma accumulation below Santorini volcano, Greece, the structure and melt content of the shallow magmatic system remain poorly determined. Our seismic velocity models identify a pronounced low-velocity anomaly (?21%) from 2.8 km to 5 km depth localized below the northern caldera basin. This anomaly is consistent with the storage depth of erupted magmas and with the depth of a recent magmatic inflation episode. Further evidence for a shallow magma body is marked seismic attenuation and pronounced ray bending. We find that within this magma body a range of melt contents (4%?13% to fully molten) are allowable. We also find a thin mush region (2%?7% to 3%?10% melt) that extends from the main magma body toward the northeast. This structure is parallel to the tectono-magmatic lineaments in the area. The geometries of melt and mush show that crustal extension and edifice loading control the geometry of magma accumulation. These findings also mean that the shallow crust allows considerable melt to be short within just 4,000 yr of a catastrophic, caldera-forming eruption.</p> <p>Santorini provides millions of dollars to the Greek economy annually, and any renewed volcanism and/or seismicity could have a substantial economic impact. To assist with Greek volcanic hazard monitoring we helped repair a permanent seismic monitoring station on Santorini.&nbsp; Our Greek collaborators Profs. Paraskevi Nomikou and Costas Papazachos have also helped inform disaster management planning interfaced with the Greek public and civil authorities including the major of Santorini and presentations to the Institute for the Study and Monitoring of the Santorini Volcano. To transfer our results to the general public, we have produced two YouTube animations and the project results have been the topic of four Greek newspaper articles and three articles published by the University of Oregon.
