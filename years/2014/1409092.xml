<AbstractNarration>SES-1409092&lt;br/&gt;Alford Young, Jr. &lt;br/&gt;Jessica Wiederspan&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the United States, scholars have long argued that the primary way in which individuals collectively explain the process of economic stratification is through the ideology of the American Dream, or the belief that all people have a reasonable chance to achieve economic success based on their own hard work and effort. Yet research suggests that individuals born to parents in the bottom or the top of the income distribution are likely to remain in those positions as adults, placing into serious question whether all Americans have a reasonable chance to achieve economic success. Despite this contradiction, it is unclear how individuals reconcile broader cultural messages about meritocracy with their own experiences and observations in order to construct a worldview that is generally consistent with, or in opposition to, the ideology of the American Dream. Through in-depth interviews with 80 individuals in two Midwestern cities, the investigators will generate a qualitative dataset uniquely capable of addressing the question of how worldviews about economic opportunity are formed. My specific research questions are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.How do individuals explain the process of economic stratification in the United States?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.Under what circumstances do individuals' worldviews tend to reproduce the dominant ideology of individualism, and under what conditions do they tend to challenge it? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.Are there trends in why certain cultural schemas or personal experiences and observations seem to be more salient than others in the development of individuals' worldviews on economic stratification? What mechanisms and processes seem most prominent in the development of these views? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studying the dominant way in which the people in a society collectively explain the process of economic stratification can help us understand how and why particular social arrangements are reproduced, especially if those arrangements appear to disadvantage many individuals.  This research can also provide insight into the potential that exists for social transformation and help us to make sense of individuals? behavior as economic and civic actors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The issue of what individuals think about economic stratification has been the subject of national surveys (such as a series conducted by the Pew Research Center's Economic Mobility Project in 2009 and 2011) and stories by media outlets such as National Public Radio. Yet because there is no compelling account of why people believe what they do, as well as the mechanisms that lead people to reject or reproduce this dominant ideology, this project has the ability to fill a gap in the public knowledge on this issue and appeal widely outside of academic circles. In addition, the Director of Economic Development for one of the cities in which interviews will be concerned has expressed interest in this research, as it has the potential to provide insight into the types of economic challenges faced by families in the area. The results will also be offered to officials in the second city.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   In my dissertation, titled I shed light on how economic inequality and insecurity in the U.S. can grow significantly without pushback from many of the individuals it directly affects. To do this, I draw upon in-depth interviews with 60 white, working and middle class parents from two midwestern cities to show how the ideology of the American Dream (the belief that the economic system in the United States is largely fair because everyone has the opportunity to get ahead through hard work) persists as an explanation for economic stratification, even among those who say they are struggling economically. I found that nearly 75% of my participants simultaneously affirmed the ideology of the American Dream and said they felt economically insecure or were concerned about their own economic circumstances. A majority of these individuals had experienced at least one event that I call a "potential grievance," such as a layoff, reductions in their wages and/or benefits, or bankruptcy as a result of a subprime mortgage or health crisis. When faced with these "potential grievances," my participants could have questioned the fairness of the economic system - and yet this was rarely the case. Previous researchers have suggested that a lack of access to a coherent counter-narrative of stratification likely prevents many individuals from challenging the ideology of the American Dream. While I agree that this is true, the vast majority of my participants did not actually appear to view their economic circumstances as unjust in the first place, and thus were not seeking an alternative narrative to help make sense of them. I observed three mechanisms that appeared to mitigate the impact of these potential grievances among my participants.  First, the majority of participants believed their economic hardships were temporary. Many were engaged in what I call mobility projects, or specific actions intended to change their economic circumstances such as going back to school, looking for a new job, or even declaring bankruptcy to "start over" financially. Others expressed "mobility expectations," meaning that even though they were not engaged in a tangible mobility project, they still provided clear reasons for why they believed their economic circumstances were not permanent, such as a promotion at work they expected in the future.   Second, the severity of many of my respondents? economic hardships were buffered by what I call "invisible insecurity." Because of the inexpensive cost of many consumer goods (like tablets or big screen TVs, for example), the easy availability of credit, the ability to borrow against one?s 401k and home equity, and in some cases, generous parents or in-laws, many of my participants were living what they viewed as a materially comfortable day-to-day life even while they reported significant debt or lacked savings for retirement or a rainy day. Debt or a lack of savings are generally less visible than other kinds of insecurity, such as a living in a run-down home or a lack of food. In addition, a number of my participants were buffered from the harsh repercussions of a job loss or a costly home repair by parental loans or gifts - or anticipated that their parents would be there if such an emergency occurred in the future.  Finally, many participants "localized the blame," meaning they explained their current economic circumstances as a result of either their own shortcomings (such as not finishing college or not sticking to a budget) or the actions of someone they know personally (for example, an overspending partner or a stingy boss). As a result, they viewed their circumstances as unfortunate and upsetting, but not unjust.  In addition to identifying these mechanisms, my dissertation explores the commonalities that exist among the minority of participants in my sample who challenged the dominant discourse and highlights specific ways in which policymakers and advocates who are pushing for a reduction in economic inequality might reframe their message to better resonate with the American public.   Although I have not yet disseminated the findings from this project, my theoretical framework and rich, detailed data have the potential to impact how sociologists understand the reproduction of economic inequality in the contemporary United States. In addition, the issue of what individuals think about economic stratification, inequality, and the American Dream has been the subject of national surveys (such as a series conducted by the Pew Research Center?s Economic Mobility Project in 2009 and 2011) and stories by media outlets such as National Public Radio and the New York Times. Yet because there are few accounts of the mechanisms that lead people to reproduce or challenge this dominant ideology, my project has the ability to fill a gap in the public knowledge on this issue and appeal widely outside of academic circles.
