<AbstractNarration>This Postdoctoral Research Fellowship supports a series of field and laboratory experiments to demonstrate the use of atmospheric carbonyl sulfide (COS) as an independent proxy for terrestrial gross primary production. Gross primary production is the total amount of carbon dioxide "fixed" by land plants per unit time through the photosynthetic reduction of carbon dioxide into organic compounds. It is an important parameter for describing carbon-climate feedbacks, assessing ecosystem-based carbon dioxide capture and storage projects, and as an important input parameter in models of ecosystem carbon exchange. This investigator is actively involved in education and outreach to promote literacy in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To use COS exchange as an approximation of carbon uptake on an ecosystem scale, soil exchange rates of COS need to be characterized to distinguish COS plant consumption from COS uptake in soils. The investigator is developing a novel application of the isotope pool dilution technique (using 13COS) to enable measurements of soil COS consumption and production, thereby untangling factors that control net COS exchange. She will conduct controlled laboratory experiments to assess the role of environmental variables such as temperature, UV light, and enzyme activities in soils on the variations in COS exchange. Field measurements will be made at a variety of sites, including at a montane gradient in southern California that is a designated FLUXNET site and at a chaparral and a desert site that is already instrumented with eddy flux towers and continuously monitored environmental variables. FLUXNET is a regional network in which each participating site uses eddy covariance methods to measure the exchanges of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will take place under the guidance of senior scientists at the University of California Merced and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The atmosphere and the Earth?s surface are constantly exchanging gases. Some of these gases expose otherwise covert happenings in the land and air.  The ability to measure trace-trace compounds, gases a million times rarer than CO2, has opened up a new toolbox for exploring processes that are important to climate and air quality.  The trace-trace gas carbonyl sulfide (COS) can help us understand how land carbon uptake changes over regional and daily time scales.  While supported by this fellowship, I led a workshop with over 40 participants that synthesized our understanding of COS and designated the most important questions left to be answered.  The resulting open-access article can be found at this link: https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-3625-2018. I also founded a professional organization of researchers with bi-annual meetings to foster collaboration between disciplines and over 4 continents (website: cosanova.org).  These efforts provided clarity to the community of scientists attempting to use COS for ecosystem research and promote a more efficient use of resources in furthering carbon cycle research.  In terrestrial ecosystems, CO2 is taken up by photosynthesis and produced through plant and soil microbe respiration.  We can only measure the net effect of CO2 production and consumption. COS is taken up in plant leaves at the same time as CO2 and at a known ratio.  Measuring COS uptake over a region lets us know how much CO2 uptake is occurring.  Continuous measurements reveal how photosynthesis changes dynamically with climate.  Comparing our new, standalone map of carbon uptake to those generated by our best models will challenge and advance our conceptions about terrestrial carbon balance.  A complication arises when COS interacts with soils.  Generally, the amount of COS consumed in soils is less than 5% of the amount destroyed by plants; however, when agricultural soils are hot and dry, the thermo- and photo-degradation of soil organic matter can yield emissions that are 25% of uptake.  Under these circumstances, using COS observations to infer carbon uptake would yield estimates that are too low.  Through this project, I acquired soils from several different ecosystems and demonstrated with laboratory studies that most all soils probably produce COS when hot and dry.  I was able to generate separate estimates of soil COS production and consumption and develop an empirical model based on soil temperature and moisture.  This study is published in an open access journal and can be found at this link: https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-3711-2016. The model framework was then applied in regional modeling studies (e.g. Hilton et al. 2017, link: https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate3272) and has been implemented in the Simple Biosphere land surface model at Colorado State.  After this initial experiment, I refined our understanding by collaborating on several field and laboratory studies.  During a field campaign at the Wind River Experimental Forest I used an automatic soil chamber I re-designed to observe soil COS fluxes for several months in 2015.  This information aided multiple research articles (e.g. Rastogi, et al., 2018, link: https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2018-85) and Rastogi?s PhD dissertation at Oregon State University.  The most interesting discovery from this activity was the strange dynamics of ground cover when the soil was frozen but the air temperate oscillated near freezing temperatures.  High COS uptake occurs when water condenses on mosses and lichen during the fluctuations from freezing to non-freezing atmospheric conditions.
