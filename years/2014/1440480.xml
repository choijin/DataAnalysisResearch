<AbstractNarration>The goal of the Doctoral Consortium in Pervasive Health Care is to support the doctoral students through constructive remarks and feedback on their research from prominent researchers and through interaction with other students. Student participants will be from a broad range of disciplines and approaches that inform pervasive computing, including biomedical informatics, computer science, information science, engineering, clinical sciences, law, and related fields. The student participants should be well into their dissertation research and will be expected to give short presentations of their work during the Consortium. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Consortium will be held in conjunction with the 8th International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare in Oldenburg, Germany.  PervasiveHealth is a premier international forum with specific focus on technologies and human factors related to the use of ubiquitous computing in healthcare and wellbeing.  The participants will be mentored by faculty members and provide a longer term supportive mentoring network to help new researchers navigate the challenges of interdisciplinary research. The DC will take place on the weekend prior to the PervasiveHealth conference. This will allow students to also participate in the overall conference as well.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Pervasive Healthcare Doctoral Consortium 2015     There is a growing interest in the design, development, and adoption of health information technologies (HIT) in the United States. Researchers in pervasive computing, ubiquitous computing, and human computer interaction have worked in parallel with researchers in the biomedical informatics field, however the Pervasive Computing conference is one of the first conferences that merges all three fields and brings researchers together to learn and collaborate in a conference setting (Dey &amp; Estrin 2010).  One issue that is of particular importance to researchers in all three areas is the need to design and deploy cutting edge systems that address real-world problems while ensuring they seamlessly integrate into organizational and social contexts. The emphasis on bringing Ph.D. students together from all three research areas engenders a sense of community and understanding that we all have to collaborate and work together to design socio-technical systems.  The goal of the DC was three-fold &ndash; (1) we supported and provided feedback to the doctoral student participants through constructive remarks on their research from prominent researchers; (2) we provided students with external mentoring about disseminating findings in other fields and the job search process; and (3) we helped create a cohort for students by providing them with opportunities to network with each other and others at the conference. We recruited student participants from a broad range of disciplines and approaches that inform pervasive computing.  The Consortium was held in conjunction with the 8th International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare in Oldenburg, Germany (http://pervasivehealth.org/2014/show/home). PervasiveHealth is a premier international forum with specific focus on technologies and human factors related to the use of ubiquitous computing in healthcare and wellbeing. PervasiveHealth is held annually each spring and rotates between the Americas and Europe. Researchers who are interested in health informatics &ndash; from a technical or sociotechnical standpoint usually attend PervasiveHealth. One of the primary reasons to hold the DC at PervasiveHealth is to introduce students who may be from other disciplines (i.e., social science, engineering, biomedical informatics) to the PervasiveHealth community. Similarly, we hope that by bringing a new generation of scholars from different disciplines into the pervasive healthcare community, we can broaden the communityÆs understanding of what other research disciplines can offer pervasive computing in healthcare.  The Intellectual Merit of this Doctoral Consortium is to:  Provide a forum for students engaged in inter- and multi-disciplinary scholarship focusing on organizational, technical, social, and biomedical issues surrounding health-related technologies  Provide a forum for expert and peer critique of studentsÆ doctoral work with the goal of improving their dissertation. Provide students with external mentoring to learn about interdisciplinary dissemination and future career trajectories.   The Broader Impact of this Consortium will be to:  Bring together people who might not otherwise engage with one another (i.e., students, ┐faculty from different disciplines);  Help people engage in discourse, behaviors, and processes associated with inter- ┐disciplinary research in fields involving biomedical informatics;  Expose participants to different scientific disciplinary research approaches and questions;  Create a supportive mentoring network for young researchers;  Help develop the next generation of scientists and educators in fields related to the ┐development and use of technology in health related fields.    DOCTORAL STUDENT PARTICIPATION  Eight PhD students from around the world participated in the doctoral consortium (U. of Ulster (2 participants), University of Twente (2 participants), U. of Bologna, U. of St. An...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
