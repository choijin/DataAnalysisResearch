<AbstractNarration>Sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder that interrupts a person?s breathing during sleep and may contribute to other medical issues such as cardiovascular disease, memory problems, cognitive impairment, and motor vehicle crashes. Currently, to diagnose this disorder an individual must sleep like a marionette in foreign surroundings. Patients attempt to replicate their sleep patterns in a clinical setting; which includes sleeping in a clinic on a hospital bed while attached to machinery by many wires in order to detect vital signs. This is an uncomfortable situation for the patient and the tests results are not gained in the patient's usual sleep environment. In addition to the uncomfortable experience, long-term vital signs monitoring is expensive. In addition to sleep apnea, another problem this team wants to solve is the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) that is the third leading cause of infant mortality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team has developed the iMotion radar technology that provides a non-contact and cost-effective way to monitor human vital signs, identify gestures, monitor structural health, and sense the surroundings of automobiles. Based on novel sensing hardware and algorithms devised in existing NSF project, the team will develop a portable biomedical radar sensor to interface with smart phones, so that the public can easily use this noninvasive technology to monitor sleep. This may result in tremendous commercial impacts on radar-based health monitoring in both developing and developed countries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Before starting this project, the team believed that Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) was a major concern of parents, who would buy a product that could provide peace of mind, and the team believed our non-contact vital sign detection technology could help reduce SIDS. Therefore, the major objective of our team "yearONE" was to complete the I-Corps curriculum and conduct more than 100 customer interviews to validate our assumptions, based on which we will further develop a business model canvas and decide whether to "GO" or "NO GO" to start-up a business.     In this project, the team has completed the I-Corps curriculum, interviewed more than 100 customers, and developed a business model for yearONE. Based on the learning from the I-Corps curriculum and our customer interviews, we found that our original assumptions were correct:  Parents are concerned about SIDS (vital signs) Currents solutions are inadequate (expensive, and inconvenient)       We concluded that our product has a market fit. But we also learned that our original understanding of the market and market insights were incomplete. To be more specific, we found the following market insights:  Our market size is based on the parents expecting a baby  The price of our product matters to parents  At the beginning, getting shelf space at stores would be difficult  Brand recognition is important  How parents make their buying decisions Besides telling the parents whether the baby is alive, vital signs data is valuable       Finally, we have made a "GO" decision, which means we have formed a start up company yearONE that runs full time. In the near future, the company will:  Develop a minimum viable product (MVP) Obtain product endorsements through influencers  Secure funding by submitting SBIR/STTR proposals Participate in Kinetic Startup Accelerator program to obtain private investor funding Validate the path to market and the revenue model Continue to grow key partners      If the start up company is successful, it may make the non-contact cost-effective baby-monitoring technology widely used by parents. The commercialization of the non-contact baby monitoring technology may significantly reduce the occurrence of sudden infant death.
