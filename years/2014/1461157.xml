<AbstractNarration>BROADER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The federal government has forecasted that over the next decade the U.S. economy will need approximately one million more technical professionals than are being produced at the current rate. Increasing the retention of science and engineering majors from 40% to 50% alone would generate three-quarters of the targeted one million additional STEM degrees. The Transfer-to-Excellence Research Experiences for Undergraduates (TTE REU) program of the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) supports retention in STEM fields by offering hands-on research opportunities in nanotechnology, biotechnology, and robotics to increase the confidence and persistence of community college students in their pursuit of science and engineering education and ultimately technical careers. The program's three research areas have been chosen because they are economically-salient, offer many exciting research opportunities, and will resonate with community college students. The nine-week program brings 10 students per year from California Community Colleges (CCC), the largest community college system in the U.S., to UC Berkeley, where engineering faculty will host students in their world-class research laboratories and mentor them in their own research projects. TTE REU participants will also be trained in research protocol, laboratory safety, scientific ethics, and science communications. The program also provides students with transfer advising, and academic and professional development activities to better prepare them to complete a B.S. degree, pursue graduate studies, and succeed in a technical career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Transfer-to-Excellence Research Experiences for Undergraduates (TTE REU) program of the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) aims to: 1) increase the number of community college students, particularly women and underrepresented minority students, who receive baccalaureate degrees in science and engineering; and 2) expand and diversify the pipeline of future graduate school students. To accomplish these objectives, the TTE REU program builds the research capacity of a diverse body of community college students through hands-on research in nanotechnology, biotechnology, and robotics and encourages them to continue their science and engineering studies and pursue STEM careers. Through generous support from the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) of the National Science Foundation, REU Site award EEC-1461157, students from California Community Colleges (CCC), the largest community college system in the U.S., will engage in leading-edge research, hosted and advised by the engineering faculty at UC Berkeley. The TTE REU program is integrated with the Center for Energy Efficient Electronics Science an NSF Science and Technology Center based at UC Berkeley. The program enables its CCC students to participate in: 1) nanotechnology research on novel nanomaterials, innovative device concepts, and improving device performance in electronics, optoelectronics and sensors; 2) biotechnology research that advances the underlying science and enhances the research tools for advanced biofuels and bio-based chemicals production; and 3) robotics research on how robots can adapt to their environment and human-in-the-loop systems such as autonomous vehicles and tele-healthcare monitoring that integrate sensing, actuation, and control. In collaboration with UC Berkeley's Transfer Alliance Project, the TTE REU program provides academic advising and enrichment programs that prepare community colleges students to be competitive transfer applicants to 4-year colleges. The individualized academic and transfer advising continues for one academic year following the completion of the TTE REU.</AbstractNarration>

This program has provided cutting-edge research opportunities for California community college students in science or engineering, with a special focus on women, underrepresented minorities, veterans, students with disabilities, and those that are first-generation college students.</span></p> <p>For nine weeks, each participant is paired with two mentors from their respective research area: a faculty member and a graduate student or postdoc. The mentors guide the student in independent research activities, at group/laboratory meetings, and through one-on-one mentoring meetings. Outside of their independent research, research interns are trained on research protocol, laboratory safety, and scientific ethics. They also participate in academic and professional development activities to prepare for transfer, baccalaureate education, graduate school, and careers in science and engineering. The REU Site collaborates with the Transfer Alliance Program (TAP), which provides individualized academic advising and enrichment programs to prepare community colleges students to be competitive applicants to four-year universities. Research interns continue to participate in the TAP program upon their return to community college.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Broader Impact</strong></p> <p>This REU targets a population of students who may lack resources or exposure to science and engineering opportunities but have the intellectual capability to pursue science and engineering degrees. In recruitment, our goal has been to attract a significant number of students from underrepresented groups. This is done through targeted recruitment outreach and through our partnership with an organization that primarily serves underrepresented populations: Mathematics Engineering Science Achievement (MESA).</p> <p>From 2015 to 2018, the REU site provided research experience, technical training, professional development opportunities, mentorship and transfer advising to 53 California community college students. These participants were: 34% female, 26.4% underrepresented ethnic/racial minority (URM), and 51% first generation college students.</p> <p>The 2015-2018 cohorts boast a 92.4% transfer rate to a four-year university to pursue a STEM degree. 83% have transferred to the University of California (UC) system, 45.3% of which transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, and 8% transferred directly into graduate programs at a&nbsp;University of California campus. Additionally, 7.5% transferred to California State University campuses and 2% transferred to a private four-year university within California.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong style="text-align: center;">Intellectual Merit</strong></p> <p>The focus of this REU Site was to increase scientific and engineering knowledge and skills of California community college students through hands-on research in nanotechnology, robotics, and biotechnology. The program has hosted hosted 33 participants from 22 different community colleges. This accounts for 19.3% of all community colleges statewide. Each student worked independently on research projects supervised by a faculty member and graduate student or postdoc mentor. Collectively, the 33 independent projects of the REU program have been advised by 16 faculty mentors and 29 graduate student or post-doc mentors. Importantly, most of the faculty mentors have returned each year because they enjoy hosting these students.</p> <p><strong>Comprehensive Evaluation: </strong>The REU is evaluated by external evaluator. Research interns and their mentors are surveyed before, during, and after their participation and participate in an exit interview. All measures (self-reported and observed) indicate positive and formative experiences for the research interns and their mentors.</p> <p><strong>Publications and Presentations:</strong> This REU has served as a model that has been replicated at other baccalaureate universities wishing to provide more opportunity to community college students. During the course of the grant, program faculty and staff have authored five publications on the best practices and evaluation results for the REU Site. One was published in the Community College Journal of Research and Practice and the remaining four have been in the Proceedings of the American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference and Exposition.</p> <p>Research interns are also encouraged to share their research findings and are given the option to apply for funding to present at conferences.&nbsp;Of the 2015-2018 cohorts, 14 research interns have participants have presented their research at the Annual Conference for the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science. Additionally, participants have presented their research at the National Council on Undergraduate Research REU symposium (4 students), National Society of Black Engineers (1 student), and the National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers (1 student).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/19/2019<br>      Modified by: Jeffrey&nbsp;Bokor</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461157/1461157_10353446_1568847385641_IMG_3736--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461157/1461157_10353446_1568847385641_IMG_3736--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2017 Cohort Group Photo"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461157/1461157_10353446_1568847385641_IMG_3736--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2017 Cohort Group Photo"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2017 Cohort Group Photo</div> <div class="imageCredit">Center for Energy Efficient Electronics Sciences</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jeffrey&nbsp;Bokor</div> <div class="imageTitle">2017 Cohort Group Photo</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461157/1461157_10353446_1568847485303_DemographicData--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461157/1461157_10353446_1568847485303_DemographicData--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Demographic Data"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461157/1461157_10353446_1568847485303_DemographicData--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Demographic Data"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Demographic Data for 2015-2019 program participants</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nicole McIntyre</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jeffrey&nbsp;Bokor</div> <div class="imageTitle">Demographic Data</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461157/1461157_10353446_1568847556024_TransferInstititution--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461157/1461157_10353446_1568847556024_TransferInstititution--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Transfer Data"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461157/1461157_10353446_1568847556024_TransferInstititution--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Transfer Data"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Transfer institution data for 2015-2018 program participants</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nicole McIntyre</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jeffrey&nbsp;Bokor</div> <div class="imageTitle">Transfer Data</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461157/1461157_10353446_1568847617429_EvaluationData1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461157/1461157_10353446_1568847617429_EvaluationData1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Evaluation Data"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461157/1461157_10353446_1568847617429_EvaluationData1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Evaluation Data"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Evaluation data from pre-program and post-program surveys of 2015-2018 participants</div> <div class="imageCredit">Catherine Amelink & Nicole McIntyre</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jeffrey&nbsp;Bokor</div> <div class="imageTitle">Evaluation Data</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461157/1461157_10353446_1568847686682_EvaluationData2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461157/1461157_10353446_1568847686682_EvaluationData2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Evaluation Data_2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461157/1461157_10353446_1568847686682_EvaluationData2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Evaluation Data_2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Evaluation data from pre-program and post-program surveys of 2015-2018 participants</div> <div class="imageCredit">Catherine Amelink & Nicole McIntyre</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jeffrey&nbsp;Bokor</div> <div class="imageTitle">Evaluation Data_2</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
