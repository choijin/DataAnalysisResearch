<AbstractNarration>This CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site award funds a new REU Site at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.   Each summer, undergraduate students from across the nation will work on challenging research problems related to human computer interaction (HCI) and privacy. Students will work with faculty mentors to use tools and techniques to solve problems that are timely and important.  The students will investigate threats against human-action modalities, such as using cameras to spy on touch input or other common everyday interactions with technologies pervasive in our society. This site should help develop computing professionals who can build future computing systems and applications that are secure and trustworthy and that we can all use with confidence. This REU experience provides students with the foundations and inspiration to pursue computing careers and research in areas that are rapidly evolving and impacting all of our citizens.  This project is co-funded by the Cyber Corps (R): Scholarship for Service Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will use partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and with non-research universities to recruit undergraduate students from groups traditionally under-represented in computer science. The site includes a significant research component combined with professional development opportunities for the participating undergraduate students.  New HCI technologies create new venues of threats to user privacy and security.  Students will investigate defense related approaches to mitigate these threats using techniques such as a secure finger mouse and other countermeasures. The resulting research may contribute to the body of research related to sustaining secure and trustworthy cyberspace. The ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of a diverse scientific workforce with expertise in areas critical to national security in the evolving global society of the future.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Summary</strong>: This REU site offered research opportunities in Modern Human Computer Interaction (HCI) Security (Sec) and Privacy. The overall goal of this REU Site program was to support active undergraduate research on novel HCI security and privacy research topics in addition to encouraging REU students to pursue the study of computer science at the graduate level and prepare them for careers in related fields. This REU program reached 21 REU student participants. This site also sought to prepare students for the national information assurance workforce so they can become the next generation of cybersecurity specialists. Through this project, REU students investigated threats against human-action and computer sensing modalities, and defense for human-action and computer sensing modalities. In addition, the inclusion of underrepresented undergraduates (i.e., African American, Hispanic and female students) was a priority for this REU site. This REU site recruited at least half of its undergraduate participants from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups for each year. This REU site recruited at least half of its undergraduate participants from outside of UMass Lowell. Students in this REU program received support from a variety of individuals with various levels of research experience; specifically, faculty advisors, project staff, other REU students, and graduate student mentors. Overall, students were satisfied with the interactions they had with their faculty advisors, project staff, and other REU students. During the mid-term and final presentations, students received one-on-one support on the research project and their presentation skills from the principal investigator. The REU students were encouraged to pursue the study of computer science at the graduate level. In addition, students had access to various types of computer software during the program. This REU program prepared students for careers in related fields by developing their technical and professional skills.</p> <p><strong>Lessons</strong>: Lessons are also learned from the REU site project. 1. Since a research problem is often an open-end problem, students may need intense help at the beginning. Otherwise, they may lose interest in the graduate study. 2. Tracking students who were not involved with the host school in some way after the REU was difficult and multiple permanent email addresses in addition to school email addresses may be preferred. 3. Students prefer a lump-sum payment with a format such as fellowship and would like to take care of the tax and other issues themselves.</p> <p><strong>Participants' Demographics</strong>:</p> <p>Females: 9 (43%)</p> <p>Minority: 6 (29%)</p> <p><strong>Publications</strong> (1 journal paper, 5 conference papers including a best student paper, 1 poster; one journal paper under submission):</p> <p>1.
