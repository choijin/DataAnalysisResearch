<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Steven Stevenson of the Department of Chemistry at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW) will study the preparation of metallic nitride clusters entrapped within larger, higher fullerene cages (HMNFs).  These unique molecules have significant potential applications in energy (e.g., photovoltaics), medicine (e.g., pharmaceuticals, MRI contrast agents), and optoelectronics.  However, they are difficult to obtain in large quantity.   Professor Stevenson aims to improve the preparation of these molecules by improving the reaction yield and by simplifying the product isolation procedure.  His product isolation procedure will also reduce significantly the amount of waste solvents generated.  The project promotes the inclusion of underrepresented groups of students, high school students and early undergraduate (e.g., freshman, sophomore) students in research.  Efforts will also be made to attract non-chemistry major students, as they have few opportunities for chemical research.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has three specific objectives.  In the 1st objective, new molecules will be selectively created inside a plasma reactor.  The interior of the reactor will possess a chemically harsh environment by incorporating oxidizing agents into the plasma zone, in order to suppress the formation of contaminant species.  The 2nd objective is the integrated SAFA (the Stir and Filter Approach)-Lewis acid approach for the efficient non-chromatographic purification of HMNFs.  In the 3rd objective, collaborative activities with four Ph.D.-granting institutions will serve to evaluate the properties of HMNFs prepared.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since the discovery of metallic nitride clusters trapped in C80 fullerene cages, little work is published for metallofullerenes having cages either smaller or larger than C80 (e.g., M3N@C78, M3N@C84, M3N@C88, M3N@C112).  This work responded to this literature void.  We sought the discovery, purification, and characterization of these more rare species.  To do seminal research on these uncommon metallofullerenes required us to invent a novel purification approach that would allow for macroscopic quantities.  Our new 2-stage chemical method was successful.  We disseminated our new approach at conferences, in journal publications, and as an invited speaker to multiple domestic and foreign institutions.  An outcome of the project’s new separation approach led to our isolation and characterization of rare-earth metallic nitride metallofullerenes (e.g., Ho3N@C78, Gd3N@C88, Gd3N@92, Gd3N@C112, Er3N@C88, Er3N@C92, Lu3N@C84, to name a few).  Another outcome was the selection as multiple journal covers.  Our proposed activities for broad impacts also had successful outcomes.  The PI fostered the inclusion of students who otherwise may not have had opportunities for undergraduate research given their early level of study.  For example, the PI included several high school, freshman, and sophomore-level undergraduate Chemistry students, many of whom had only taken General Chemistry.  Underrepresented groups were also included in the PI’s research group, which is mostly female.  The PI's research students disseminated their findings at conferences ranging from regional to national/international meetings. Professional development occurred with not only students' research skills, but also with their experience of writing abstracts, titles, and presenting their work to others.  Starting undergraduate research at such an early age helped them prepare a CV for their desired goal of applying and being accepted into graduate school.  The PI presented research outcomes in his lecture classes and the department's new student orientation course.  Outcomes for broad impacts extended beyond the students at the PI’s institution.  The PI’s sample dissemination network permitted the sending of our purified samples to domestic and foreign universities for the inclusion of their students, as well.  For example, our proposed sample-sharing plan had the positive outcome of involving external faculty and students in Russia, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, China, Japan, California, Florida, Texas, and Virginia.  Not only were the PI’s samples shared globally, but the research discoveries were also disseminated globally by publishing in highly-esteemed, peer-reviewed journals.  Two of our project’s publications were journal covers, thereby increasing the visibility and outcomes from this NSF work.
