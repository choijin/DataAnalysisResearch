<AbstractNarration>Future galaxy surveys will produce so much data that astronomers will no longer be able to rely on their previous methods of classifying them in order to extract the science of galaxy formation and evolution through cosmic history.  Although "crowd-sourced" galaxy classifications tap into a vast resource of volunteer labor, even major efforts like the Galaxy Zoo (GZ) will not be able to keep up.  This project will build on the GZ database, extending methods to other epochs in the Universe, and simultaneously use the results of the citizen science work together with machine learning to develop new automated classification tools.  Using the proven research value of involving the public and the broader community, and with a new generation of intelligent computer methods, this study will build on the best of both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While crowd-sourced galaxy classifications have proven their worth on a decade of data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), there remain two major challenges to making them a standard component of the data processing pipelines for the next generation of surveys.  The first is proving the utility of the method at high redshifts, where more galaxies have irregular or clumpy morphologies.  The second acknowledges that even crowdsourcing does not have the capacity for the data volume and rates that are to come, requiring new more sophisticated machine classification algorithms.  This project will develop catalogs for high-redshift crowd-sourced data and for simulated galaxies, and develop a new automated classification tool that extends to higher redshifts with a training pipeline adaptable to multiple galaxy surveys.  It includes three science projects: (a) directly constrain galaxy size and mass growth rates; (b) measure any relationship between bar-dominated disks and fueling of active galactic nuclei, and (c) quantify the demographics and evolution of disk sub-structures.  Efforts to automate morphological classifications using parametric and non-parametric techniques have been reasonably successful for SDSS, but did not extend to deriving the necessary detailed structural parameters.  The GZ crowd-sourcing project has been successful beyond expectations, providing scientifically viable parameters from volunteer work and leading to over a hundred peer-reviewed papers.  This study will extend both of these approaches in preparation for much larger future surveys, which expect to produce as much data per night as ten years of SDSS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high-level catalogs to be produced, and the new classification algorithms to be used, are to be released publically, and will be a valuable resource for the community.  Along with informal guided-inquiry projects, GZ will be implemented into undergraduate astronomy courses.  Students involved in this work will get well-defined PhD projects and acquire technical skills valuable in their future professional careers.</AbstractNarration>

Hence the intellectual merit of the Eyes on the Future project was to carry out research to optimize science output for next generation surveys with joint crowdsourced and automated classification techniques.   Led by the University of Minnesota, and including collaborators from the Universities of Oxford, Portsmouth and Harvard, the goals of the project were four-fold: (1) the development and publication of catalogs based on the Zooniverse citizen science projects within the Galaxy Zoo framework: Hubble (GZH), CANDELS, Illustris and UKIDSS; (2) the development, implementation and analysis of the Galaxy Zoo: Illustris project which classified galaxies produced by state-of-the-art numerical simulations; (3) the development, implementation and analysis of Galaxy Zoo: Express, the simulation of a process to combine human and machine classifications in near-real time; and (4) science exploitation of the above projects.

Scientific results by the team based on the development of the catalogs include papers published showing (a) that there is a small, yet statistically significant, correlation between barred galaxies and those with active galactic nuclei suggesting that bars do play a role in the fueling of an active black hole; (b) that spiral structure, measured through the GZ data and including parameters such as pitch angle and arm number, has no effect on the relationship between star formation rate and mass; (c) that comparing the implied morphological characteristics for the Illustris dataset with those that are observed in the real Universe exhibit an apparent overabundance of simulated galaxies for which volunteers discern discrete features in the galaxy image.
