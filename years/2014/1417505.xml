<AbstractNarration>This award funds part of the research activity of Professor Savvas Koushiappas at Brown University. The main goal of this award is to unite theoretical studies of the physics of dark matter with current and future experimental efforts. The experimentally motivated theoretical projects use observations of high energy photons and other energetic particles such as positrons and neutrinos (into which dark matter might decay or annihilate) in order to tackle fundamental questions about the nature of dark matter, the origin of astrophysical backgrounds, the astrophysical effects of cosmology and most importantly the interplay and connections among these different topics. The primary goal is the interpretation of dark matter indirect detection search data in the context of dark matter properties and the implications for accelerator studies. A secondary goal is the understanding and improvement of systematic uncertainties that arise from astrophysical processes and the cosmological context. The outcome of this work will help understand the confidence at which theoretical dark matter interpretations  can be ruled out from null searches, and to establish the confidence to which dark matter's physical properties can be measured in future experimental efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any dark matter experimental technique is ultimately linked to the details of the interplay between particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology. For example direct detection experiments depend on the local density and velocity distribution of dark matter, indirect detection experiments depend on the square of the dark matter density along a line of sight, and each of these techniques depends on the cross section of interactions and the mass of the dark matter particle, both of which are probed in accelerator searches.  It is therefore imperative that theoretical interpretations of experimental results in the context of particle physics must take into account this amalgamation of information. This research will bridge the gap between these disciplines, making the connection between astrophysics, cosmology and particle physics possible by understanding the uncertainties and connections between different disciplines.  These goals will be achieved by sophisticated theoretical modeling, and new and existing statistical and analysis tools.  In addition, the broader impact pertains to the synergy between indirect detection, direct detection and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) searches, thus connecting the laboratory to the sky, a necessary link that must be in place for any convincing dark matter interpretation of any signal.    Furthermore, graduate and undergraduate education at the PI's institution will benefit from the exposure to cosmology, particle  physics and computing, as well as the development and implementation of new computational and analysis tools. And finally, the proposed outreach activities of the PI will allow the public and students within Providence to engage in science-related activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The composition of the Universe is one of the fundamental questions of physics. We know the universe is made up of electrons and protons (the periodic table of elements) and light. But detailed observations in the last 80 years led to a most interesting fact, that is the universe has an additional component that "feels" gravity but cannot be "seen" with light, this is what we call dark matter.  This award was focused on trying to understand some of the properties of dark matter. More specifically, this research led to five main results regarding dark matter:  1) Set the strongest constraints on the annihilation cross section of the dark matter particle. These results required a very large effort on two areas. First, developing the statistical formalism so that it is optimized in the search of a signal and second, understanding the theoretical systematics that enter in the interpretation of experimental data.    2) Reticulum II is a newly discovered dwarf galaxy that was found in the first data release of the Dark Energy Survey.
