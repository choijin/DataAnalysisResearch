<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program, Jonathan L. Sessler of The University of Texas is carrying out research aimed at creating new systems that can communicate chemically. Living systems are unique in their ability to communicate by purely chemical means and a wide array of new technologies could become possible if we were able to mimic this behavior. Chemical communication in living systems can occur over short distances, which is what happens when brain cells communicate by the release and capture of neurotransmitter molecules. Or, the communication can take place over large distances, such as when insects, or even some mammals, communicate by releasing pheromones. Although these processes are well known in the world of biology, it has not yet been possible to reproduce this type of communication in an artificial system. In this work, the investigators are doing just that, using sophisticated laboratory methods they have developed to accomplish molecular design and construction in a controlled fashion. This work will likely impact the development of possible new information systems. New approaches to artificial intelligence and wireless communication may become possible as a result of this fundamental research. The work is having a further broad impact through the training of the next generation of scientists in cutting-edge laboratory techniques that will prepare the students involved in this research for work in a wide variety of technologically challenging areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the use of electron rich and electron poor receptors whose features can be modulated via changes in pH, redox potential, and substrate binding. Particular emphasis is being placed on tetrathiafulvalene calixpyrrole receptors and various electron deficient substrates, including fullerene derivatives. Conformational switching, as engendered by anion binding to a calixpyrrole, for instance, is used to induce changes in equilibrium. These perturbations, in turn, serve to release small chemical species that can act as triggers for the modulation of other receptor systems, such as those built from oligopyrroles. A range of techniques, including standard spectroscopies, photochemistry, color-based reactions, and solid state crystallography is being used to characterize the systems involved in this project and the changes in their features due to induced perturbations in equilibrium behavior.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The systems prepared during the entire life of this award focused on multisite macrocyclic systems that displayed environmentally responsive self-assembly behavior and systems exhibiting novel aromaticity&nbsp;properties. One of the goals of this project was to use synthetic chemistry to explore how multi-component systems interact via shared equilibrium partners. This challenge was met by the synthesis and study&nbsp;of a variety of macrocycles. We were able to demonstrate that t<span style="font-size: 12px;">he environmentally&nbsp;responsive tetrathiafulvalene-annulated calix[4]pyrrole (SPr-TTF-C4P) and phenyl&nbsp;C61 butyric acid (PBA) were used to construct a supramolecular oligomeric material in which self-assembly of the heteroditopic monomers was induced by conformational switching under acid-base conditions or through the application of electrochemical stimuli. We complemented this work by preparing a linked ditopic guest that displayed a fluorescent signal in the presence of electron deficient nitroaromatic explosives.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 12px;">Six different self-assembly constructs with&nbsp;bispyridine-substituted calix[4]pyrrole were achieved under controlled equilibria. Addition of AgBF<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;produced an infinite helical coordination polymer that easily disassembles&nbsp;in the presence of tetrabutylammonium chloride salt. Capsule-like assemblies were achieved by the addition of terephthalate anions. The clamshell complex was perturbed by the presence of an excess of therephthalate anions. The presence of AgBF<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;led to the formation of capsule-like complexes linked by the pyridine coordination of Ag(I) cations encapsulating a&nbsp;therephthalate anion. Both, the silver cation and the therephtahalate anion were found to be replaced by proton atoms and tirfluoroacetate&nbsp;as the concentration of trifluoroacetic acid increased.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 12px;">We explored the use of self-assembly in aqueous media of bola-type supra-amphiphiles. In this case, higher order morphologies that included multilamellar vesicles and micelles displayed a dependency on&nbsp;the pH conditions in solution, as well as the presence of metabolites such as ATP, which may be used to recognize, encapsulate, and release small molecules in water.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 12px;">Another system studied during this award was the construction of environmentally-controlled systems based on the tetracationic macrocycle, 'Texas-sized molecular box.' We showed that two different assemblies (i.e., capsule-like or isomeric linear anionic guest) formed in the presence of isomeric amidobenzene sulphonate anion. The morphology of such assemblies depended on the host-guest ratio and the isomeric anion (e.g., isomeric bent or isomeric linear anion guest) involved. Manipulation of the pH modulated the association and disassociation in solution, which could be repeated through several cycles. The carboxylic acid functionalization of the 'Texas-sized molecular box' (TxSB-CO<sub>2</sub>H) allowed the formation of two different aggregates in solution and in&nbsp;the solid-state. Self-aggregation in an extended array of dimers was observed at high concentrations of TxSB-CO<sub>2</sub>H in acidic conditions. However, under basic conditions (TxSB-CO<sub>2</sub><sup>?</sup>) a cup-like dimer in a head-to-tail arrangement, which exhibited environmentally responsive properties upon changes in temperature, pH, and concentration. &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 12px;">The second goal of this project was to contribute to the understanding of aromatic effects and how they might affect the behavior of chemical and biological systems. Under this award, some expanded porphyrins and porphycenes were synthesized including the expanded rosarin (P3P6), [24]dinaphthorubyrin, hexadecaphyrin, and an expanded porphycene.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 12px;">An expanded rosarin (P3P6) containing a bigger cavity adopted a bowl-like conformation capable of accommodating&nbsp;largely&nbsp;convex guests such as C60. The P3P6 complexation of C60 led to two different arrangements in the solid state and in solution. The zig-zag and linear packing conformations corresponded to the 1:1 and 2:1 stoichiometry&nbsp;complexes. A combination of&nbsp;&pi;-&pi; and intermolecular CH-&pi; interactions between the host and the guest governed the zig-zag conformation, whereas the 2:1 linear complex was stabilized by the encapsulation of the guest by two receptors favoring a greater&nbsp;&pi; surface overlap.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 12px;">A systematic investigation of the structural, electronic, and redox properties of the expanded porphyrin [24]dinaphthorosarin revealed that the macrocycle was susceptible to reduction in acidic conditions. The corresponding 25- and 26-&pi; species were achieved upon protonation. This characteristic stands in contrast to other hexapyrrolic expanded porphyrins such as [24]amethyrin and [26]dinaphthorubyrin in which poor proton-dependency is observed.</span></p> <p>The expanded porphyrin, hexadecaphyrin obtained from the acid-catalyzed&nbsp;condensation of a linear hexapyrrolic precursor with a bipyrrole aldehyde displayed weakly H?ckel antiaromatic properties. The bimetallic cobalt(II) complexes prepared underwent thermodynamically driven conversion at higher temperatures. We believe that these type of systems can be used as tunable thermal sensors.&nbsp;</p> <p>Although several expanded porphyrins have been reported before, no&nbsp;investigation about the synthesis of expanded porphycenes has been done. The 26 &pi;-electron expanded porphycene bearing a bridging phenylene ring exhibited H?ckel-type aromaticity, wherein the&nbsp;&pi;-conjugation pathway was found to possess a clear and definite clockwise current.</p> <p>Thus, we demonstrated that during this now-completed project, we successfully developed novel macrocyclic systems capable of self-assembly. The aggregates obtained reacted under environmental stimuli that can be easily modulated. We also prepared and studied the electronic properties of several expanded porphyrins&nbsp;that demonstrate&nbsp;the so-called 3D aromaticity. We thus feel great progress was made under the aegis of this award.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/25/2018<br>      Modified by: Jonathan&nbsp;L&nbsp;Sessler</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402004/1402004_10326567_1540223503521_10.1021-jacs.7b13024Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402004/1402004_10326567_1540223503521_10.1021-jacs.7b13024Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="expanded porphyrin"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402004/1402004_10326567_1540223503521_10.1021-jacs.7b13024Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="expanded porphyrin"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Expanded porphyrin</div> <div class="imageCredit">Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jonathan&nbsp;L&nbsp;Sessler</div> <div class="imageTitle">expanded porphyrin</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402004/1402004_10326567_1540303701022_10.1021-jacs.6b03159Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402004/1402004_10326567_1540303701022_10.1021-jacs.6b03159Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Bola-type C4P"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402004/1402004_10326567_1540303701022_10.1021-jacs.6b03159Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Bola-type C4P"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Bola-type C4P assembly</div> <div class="imageCredit">Copyright 2016 American Chemical Society</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jonathan&nbsp;L&nbsp;Sessler</div> <div class="imageTitle">Bola-type C4P</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402004/1402004_10326567_1540303786399_10.1021-jacs.7b00735Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402004/1402004_10326567_1540303786399_10.1021-jacs.7b00735Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="expanded rosarin"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402004/1402004_10326567_1540303786399_10.1021-jacs.7b00735Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="expanded rosarin"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">expanded rosarin C60</div> <div class="imageCredit">Copyright 2017 American Chemical Society</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jonathan&nbsp;L&nbsp;Sessler</div> <div class="imageTitle">expanded rosarin</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402004/1402004_10326567_1540478853612_Anguera_et_al-2018-Angewandte_Chemie_International_Edition--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402004/1402004_10326567_1540478853612_Anguera_et_al-2018-Angewandte_Chemie_International_Edition--rgov-800width.jpg" title="expanded porphycene"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402004/1402004_10326567_1540478853612_Anguera_et_al-2018-Angewandte_Chemie_International_Edition--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="expanded porphycene"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">expanded porphycene cover</div> <div class="imageCredit">Copyright 2018 Wiley-VCH</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jonathan&nbsp;L&nbsp;Sessler</div> <div class="imageTitle">expanded porphycene</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402004/1402004_10326567_1540478943970_B-hring_et_al-2016-Chemistry_-_A_European_Journal--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402004/1402004_10326567_1540478943970_B-hring_et_al-2016-Chemistry_-_A_European_Journal--rgov-800width.jpg" title="TTF-C4P"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1402004/1402004_10326567_1540478943970_B-hring_et_al-2016-Chemistry_-_A_European_Journal--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="TTF-C4P"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">TTF-C4P cover</div> <div class="imageCredit">Copyright 2016 Wiley-VCH</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jonathan&nbsp;L&nbsp;Sessler</div> <div class="imageTitle">TTF-C4P</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
