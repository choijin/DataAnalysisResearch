<AbstractNarration>This award supports graduate student travel to the 14th Workshop on the Physics of Dusty Plasmas to be held at Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama in May 2015. The field of dusty plasmas constitutes a fully developed interdisciplinary field with direct connections to astrophysics, nanoscience, fluid mechanics and colloidal physics through experimental, theoretical and computational studies. This workshop will bring together researchers from around to the world to (1) provide a review of recent advances in the field of dusty plasmas, (2) help to define new and existing research questions and challenges and (3) help to strengthen the interaction between dusty plasma researchers and facilitate interactions between the field of dusty plasmas and other related research disciplines.  The involvement of graduate students will contribute to the formation of the next generation of scientists working in this area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A "complex" or "dusty" plasma is a four-component plasma system that consisting of the usual combination of ions, electrons and neutral atoms with the addition of small (nano- to micro-meter sized) solid charged particles (i.e., the "dust" component).  These dusty plasma systems occur naturally in a myriad of space and astrophysical environments (e.g., star-formation regions, planetary atmospheres and rings, comets, interplanetary and interstellar media).  Additionally, many man-made plasmas and plasma applications are affected by the presence of charged dust particles (e.g.  nanoparticle formation during the fabrication of microelectronics or the potentially deleterious effects on safety and plasma performance of dust generation in fusion experiments).  Since 1986, there has been a series of US-based workshops (Workshop on the Physics of Dusty Plasmas) that have (1) provided a review of recent advances in the field of dusty plasmas, (2) helped to define new and existing research questions and challenges and (3) helped to strengthen the interaction between dusty plasma researchers and facilitated interactions between the field of dusty plasmas and other related research disciplines (colloidal physics, nanoscience, etc.).  This award provided financial support for 15 students (3 undergraduate and 12 graduate) and 1 junior scientist to attend the 14th of these workshops in Auburn, AL from May 26 &ndash; 29, 2015.  Their participation exposed them to cutting-edge research in the field of dusty plasmas, provided them an opportunity to present their research and to network with leading scientist in the field and contributed (1) directly to their research and education and (2) supporting workforce development in the STEM fields.
