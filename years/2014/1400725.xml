<AbstractNarration>Creating career and technical education pathways to develop our middle skills workforce requires creative strategies in the middle and high school years. The TECH-Lane project is expanding the STEM student pipeline by recruiting and assisting motivated but underrepresented, at-risk 8th grade and early college high school students.  The project accelerates students from high school, through college and into the semiconductor/nanotechnology workplace.  Using partnerships between educational institutions (high school, 2-year and 4-year colleges) and regional high technology industries, TECH-Lane is creating curriculum focused on innovative and transformative instruction using project-based learning (PBL) and integration of career and technical education.  Replicable, accelerated early college high school courses in Electrical Technology, a one week summer STEM camp curriculum for 8th grade students and professional development workshops for high school STEM faculty in the design, delivery and incorporation of PBL are being developed.  The intellectual merit of the project lies in the focused impact on workforce preparation in an area of national importance. Technical early college high schools are being established across the U.S. to answer the nationwide need for a well-trained high technology workforce.  Project based learning models have been shown to be highly effective in replicating real-world workplace problems and teaching students to think critically and creatively to solve them.  TECH-Lane is aligning with these initiatives by providing accelerated pathways for students and PBL training for their high school STEM teachers.  The TECH-Lane curriculum, disseminated widely through a detailed monograph and a project website, allows the early college high school/community college community across the nation to duplicate this model and assist in filling the need for high-tech workers ready for the 21st century workplace. Dissemination efforts and the ability to replicate the proposed program are among the significant broader impacts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The TECH-Lane project?s overarching goal is to create pathways for high school and community college students to earn a two-year technical degree in high-demand fields.     A partnership in rural Central New York was formed that included a community college (Fulton-Montgomery Community College), a career and technical center (Hamilton Fulton Montgomery Career and Technical Center), and a new regional high school (P-TECH in Johnstown, NY).  This partnership also included strong support from local employers with demand for middle-level technical skills.     The primary impacts and outcomes contain both intellectual merit (IM) and broader impacts (BI):     Created an education pathway with P-TECH:  Twenty-six high school students attended college      classes at FMCC to earn the first year of their two-year Electrical      Technology AAS degree.  Four      students in the first cohort are on track to complete their degree this      spring with no college debt.  (IM) Provided activities for twenty P-TECH students by collaborating      with NSF ATE NEATEC (Grant #1700606) including workshops and academic      enrichment activities at SUNY-Polytechnic Institute.  (IM and BI)      Re-aligned the Engineering Technology pathway:  Our previous NSF ATE TEPP project (Grant #1003122)      created the Engineering Technology pathway, and this project re-aligned it      so students attend the CTC part of each school day in 11th and      12th grades to earn the first year of their two-year FMCC Electrical      Technology AAS degree.  Twenty-nine      students have entered this program.       (IM) Students then attend FMCC for one year full time and      graduate with a two-year, in-demand career entry just one year out of high      school.  Two students in the first      cohort have completed this, with five on track to complete this      spring.  This early entrance to the      workforce is strongly supported by industry with summer internships.  (BI) Received New York State Education Department approval for      a graduating student to replace a Regents exam, add a technical endorsement,      and (with qualifying grades on other exams) earn the distinction of an      Advanced Regents Diploma with Technical Endorsement.  One has earned this this so far.  (IM)      Provided workshops for students and provided professional development for local teachers:  (IM)  Created workshops for students in areas of nanotechnology,      automation, and methods of manufacturing.       (IM) Delivered these workshops to over 300 students of      varying ages in a variety of settings, such as summer programs, weekend      workshops, etc.  We used these      workshops to reach non-traditional and underrepresented students and inform      them about middle-level skill career opportunities and pathways to careers.  (BI) Provided professional development by holding over      twelve workshops and providing kits for over forty area educators to use      these workshops to promote these fields with their students.  (IM and BI)      Created On-Site Insight, a series of very successful week-long summer camps:  (BI)  Each cohort went on four factory tours and learned      about manufacturing processes. Afternoons were spent working on projects related to the      site visits. Students changed perceptions of technician roles and      education pathways to get there. In the five sessions over four years, fifty-one      students attended.  Twenty were      female.  (BI)      Incorporated PBL in coursework:  (IM)  We learned of the challenges and struggled to implement      well-designed modules. Challenges were in time management (during class time)      and in ensuring that fundamentals were covered. Implementation came in labs by designing realistic, challenging      modules.      Strengthened partnerships with industry through annual meetings with an advisory council.  (IM)  This advisory council has received input from ten      people internal to our partner organizations, eight people at other      education institutions, and twelve employees at six local employers.  (IM) Although we collaborated with eleven employers on this      project, this formalized our relationships as advisors with key employers.  (BI) Through tours and non-credit classes we have the good      fortune to have been on-site at over twenty employers during the span of      this project.  (BI)      What next?  We have two-year AAS program(s) well-aligned with      industry needs and two high school feeder programs. We are now at the point of ?We have built it and they      are not coming.? While the national issue with the middle level skills      gap is common knowledge, our initial research and experience has shown      that there is poor understanding of technician roles among high school      students, their parents, and HS faculty and staff:    While people can identify middle level skilled roles       in the trades, they cannot identify the array of technician-level roles. When people see or think of technician-level roles in       manufacturing they think the pathway to reach them is through       engineering. People do not understand the roles of, or ratio of careers       for technicians vs. engineers. Therefore, few high school students are selecting our       pathways.   Our current efforts to change these perceptions, so      students can make well-informed decisions on pathways, is to partner with      SUNY-Poly?s NSF ATE SEMI Certification project (Grant #1939219) as part of      the outreach to provide engaging tabletop automation units that can be used      at and loaned to high schools.
