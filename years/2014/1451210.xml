<AbstractNarration>This award addresses fundamental questions about the impact of lightning discharges on the lower ionosphere (60-90 km). Lightning discharges are among the most powerful sources of electrostatic fields and electromagnetic radiation and are known to create significant disturbances in the lower ionosphere. Specifically, two well documented perturbations stem either from direct heating, known as Early/Fast (E/F) events, or from induced bombardment by energetic particles from the radiation belts, known as lightning-induced electron precipitation (LEP). The low ambient electron density of the lower ionosphere precludes direct measurement by standard radar techniques, hence observations of E/F and LEP events are made using remote sensing with Very Low Frequency (VLF, 3-30 kHz) waves from powerful communication transmitters. VLF signals reflect from the lower ionosphere and are perturbed in amplitude and phase when an ionospheric disturbance occurs along the path, thus allowing a form of continuous observation. Efforts to diagnose and understand the physics of disturbances have yielded largely qualitative results to date. This project will bring together two experts in ionospheric and magnetospheric processes to realize the full potential of VLF remote sensing. This project will enhance efforts to forecast navigation and communication outages due to lightning-induced disturbances. Early-career PIs at each institution will lead the project, which will also contribute to the support of several graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unambiguous determination of the physics of ionospheric disturbances from VLF signal perturbations has been lacking due to the complex nature of VLF signal propagation and also the variability of lightning discharges. In this effort, the challenges to quantifying lightning-ionosphere coupling with VLF remote sensing by introducing the following innovations: &lt;br/&gt;1. Strategic observations of ocean-based lightning and overlapping VLF transmitter paths. &lt;br/&gt;2. Novel polarization and scattered field analysis from amplitude and phase in two channels.&lt;br/&gt;3. Quantifying the role of the lightning source spectrum in the ionospheric disturbance.&lt;br/&gt;4. Improvement of numerical codes for trans-ionospheric propagation and raytracing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was focused on identifying and quantifying perturbations to the upper atmosphere, known as the ionosphere, from thunderstorm lightning discharges.  In particular the project sought to improve remote sensing capabilities of the lower part of the ionosphere, known as the D-region, which is very challenging to measure directly. The task was undertaken by making observations and performing simulations.  A key outcome was the development of novel approaches  to ionospheric remote sensing using extremely low frequency (ELF) and very low frequency (VLF) electromagnetic waves.  The overlapping VLF propagation path geometry was an innovation of this program and found to be a powerful tool.  The main advantage over past work is that the redundancy of the overlapping propagation paths makes the inferred ionospheric changes less sensitive to the choice of the ambient conditions.  Past work would typically involve an arbitrary choice of the ambient conditions thus severely limiting the certainty of any conclusions made about perturbations.  For large lightning induced perturbations the overlapping propagation path technique works very effectively in that unique changes of ionospheric height and steepness as well as an ambient profile can be derived from a global error minimization of observed vs. modeled parameters.  The second technique of sensing the lower ionosphere was a novel ELF group velocity technique.  The speed of lightning wave propagation in the ELF band is sensitive to the upper atmosphere state.  This technique provides a novel way to uniquely assess the steepness of the D region ionospheric electron density.  The use of both the VLF overlapping path approach and the ELF lightning technique together provides a way to accurately characterize a wide range perturbations.    This project supported the MS theses of three University of Colorado Denver graduate students in the Department of Engineering.  All three students started their careers as engineers in the aerospace industry or have continued to work on fundamental research.
