<AbstractNarration>GameSec is a leading research conference focused on analytical models based on information, communication, optimization, decision, and control theories that are applied to diverse security topics. At the same time, the connection between theoretical models and real world security problems are emphasized to establish the important feedback loop between theory and practice. The conference helps to promote a "science of security" with a theoretical foundation that helps us understand security risk in a principled way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides travel support to allow more students to attend the 2014 conference. Preferences for travel support are based on the credentials of the students, with a focus on attracting women and underrepresented minority students to support their participation in this event.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security (GameSec), established in 2010, aims to bring together researchers who aim to establish a theoretical foundation for making resource allocation decisions that balance available capabilities and perceived security risks in a principled manner. The 2014 edition of GameSec was held in Los Angeles, California on November 6-7.   The conference presents a valuable opportunity for researchers to share their results and learn about the state of the art in the application of decision and game theory in security. It offers PhD and MS research students a unique platform to learn the recent advances in this area and encourage them to take initiatives in research and produce more results. Therefore, we offer travel support to students to attend the conference. A total of $5,000 has been awarded to support 8 students after a rigorous process of application and selection.   All of the students had a research interest and background in security or applied game theory and decision science. Six of the eight students are presenters and authors of the accepted papers at GameSec, while the other two students are aspiring students who aim to submit work to the conference in the future. This support allows us to attract more students to attend the conference, and increase the number of next-generation security engineers and scientists.
