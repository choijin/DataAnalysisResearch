<AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The Cretaceous period (145 to 66 myr ago) is characterized by an interval when the Earth experienced unusually warm temperatures and high carbon dioxide levels.  To understand how the Earth might behave during greenhouse conditions it is imperative to study these unique times in the Earth's past. In an effort to examine this time period, the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program launched a project entitled 'Continental Scientific Drilling Project of Cretaceous Songliao Basin: Continuous High-resolution Terrestrial Archives and Greenhouse Climate Change,'. This project will provide ~10 km of nearly continuous core through the entire Cretaceous that is preserved as ancient lake sediments in northeast China. PIs will take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity to study the Cretaceous hothouse by collecting isotopic and sedimentologic data specifically focusing on intervals (e.g. ~93 myr ago) in the Cretaceous when the Earth experienced extreme warmth and the oceans became anoxic.  They have assembled a team of scientists (Stanford Univ., Univ. of Wisconsin, and Northwestern Univ.) with unique and complimentary skill sets to address the problem of how Earth's mid-latitudes behave during extreme warmth.  PIs are particularly interested in examining the links and feedbacks between the Earth's hydrologic and carbon cycles and time-scales that these cycles are operative over. Their study will provide one of the most detailed and constrained isotopic data sets for a terrestrial setting. These data will provide the basis for their modeling studies that will give quantitative bounds on the temperature and precipitation changes associated with hyperthermal events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: This one-year study focuses on the Cretaceous terrestrial record of climate change in the Songliao Basin of northeastern China, a long-lived, internally drained rift basin. PIs understanding of the terrestrial responses to global climate change are informed in part, by paleoclimate studies of times when the Earth experienced greenhouse and hothouse conditions.  They have a unique opportunity to address questions concerning the links and feedbacks between global warming, the carbon cycle and the hydrologic cycle in a terrestrial setting through the examination of core material collected in ICDP coring of the Cretaceous Songliao Basin.  Their initial studies of the Upper Cretaceous core (SK-I) from this basin show that the carbon isotopic values of ostracods reflect the global perturbations of the carbon cycle as observed in marine records (Chamberlain et al., 2013).  With the collection of the new drill core from SK-II (May 2014), PIs are positioned to extend this record through the Lower Cretaceous.  In their study of the Cretaceous drill-core they will address two related hypotheses, which are: 1) SK-II core will record the temperature history of the Lower Cretaceous observed in marine settings, particularly the hyperthermals and their carbon isotopic changes; and 2) the Songliao drill core contains carbon isotopic evidence for the Ocean Anoxic Event (OAE) 2 at the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary, and this boundary will record evidence for the increased chemical and physical weathering that may be responsible for OAE 2. To test these two related hypotheses will require oxygen, carbon and strontium isotopic and trace/REE element studies set within a rigorous sedimentologic and geochronologic framework. The latter will be supported by field investigations of volcanic and sedimentary rocks exposed near the basin margins. Driven by their earlier studies, PIs recognize that the isotopic values record both global climate changes and regional basin evolution. Unraveling these basin responses is not trivial, thus they have assembled scientists with unique yet complimentary expertise involving sedimentology, geochemistry, and modeling.  Since this is a one-year study PIs will focus on existing core material (SK-I) and the upper portion of planned core (SK-II) that span the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary and OAE 2.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this study was to investigate how climate changed during an exceptionally warm time in Earth's history (the Cretaceous). The Cretaceous period lasted from 135 to 65 million years ago during the last interval before the extinction of the dinosaurs.  During this time, the climate warmed and cooled, but was punctuated with times of very high carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere and hot temperatures.  Much of what we currently know about this "hot house" Earth is gleaned from marine records with scant information from terrestrial settings.  Recently, the Chinese and international community set forth to collect a high resolution drill core from an ancient lake called the Songliao Basin located in northeast China.  This core offers unprecedented opportunity to understand climate interactions in this "hot house" Earth.  Our study took advantage of this unique opportunity through the collection of climate proxies from this drill core.  Specifically, we focused on two goals. For Goal 1, we used stable isotopes of oxygen and carbon from ancient lake and soil sediments to construct a climate record for the Late Cretaceous (from ~100 to 65 million years ago). For Goal 2, we focused on key intervals called the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary (~91.2 million years ago) and the other called the Coniacian-Santonian boundary (~86.3 million years ago).   These boundaries are marked by massive deposition of oil rich shales in the ocean that were deposited when the ocean became poor in dissolved oxygen and are called "Ocean Anoxic Events".  Thus, our goal was to determine the drivers behind how hot-house climate affects the ocean/atmosphere system &ndash; with strong relevance to our future climate system.  The key findings are as follows:  Addressing Goal 1:  1) We created the first high resolution climate record from a terrestrial setting that spans the Late Cretaceous.  We did this by collecting carbon and oxygen isotope records from fossil arthropod shells (ostracods) that lived in this ancient lake.  The isotope values record times of extreme warmth and cold that mimic the marine record.  Thus, we showed that this unique core could be used for our and future climate studies.  2) We developed a new lake model that allowed us to place quantitative constraints on the degree of temperature change and how climate affects hydrologic balance (i.e.; precipitation and evaporation).  3) We constructed a climate profile for the latest Cretaceous (from the Campanian to the Maastrichtian - 76 to 65 million years ago).  We did this by collecting carbon and oxygen isotopes of carbonate minerals formed in fossil soils along the ancient lake shore.  With these data, we showed that even during times of extreme warmth there are rapid climate changes when the Earth cooled enough to form glaciers at the Earth?s poles.  Addressing Goal 2:  1) We used carbon and oxygen isotope records of ostracods across the Coniacian-Santonian boundary (OAE3) and the later part of the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary (OAE2) to show that both of these boundaries show large temperature increases followed by slow cooling events. 2) We tested the hypothesis that the oxygen anoxia was a result of increased chemical weathering on continents that in turn fertilized the oceans (through the addition of key limiting elements for life &ndash; like phosphorous) causing them to become anoxic.  In this lake setting, however, we found no evidence of this effect.  This finding was a surprise.  3) Since the "weathering hypothesis" was based on one record of lithium isotopes from a marine setting we decided to further test this hypothesis by collecting lithium isotopes from near shore marine deposits located in the ancient seaway that bisected the North America continent in the Cretaceous.  Our data showed a conflicting lithium isotope record that further did not confirm the "weathering hypothesis".  Thus, in our view, we need to rethink why oceans went anoxic during these extreme warming events.  There are a number of broader impacts that come from this research.  The educational impacts are: 1) the NSF funds were used to fund one Ph.D. minority student from Stanford; 2) we helped fund one Chinese visitor to Stanford &ndash; who as partly a result of this research was hired to be a new tenure track faculty at the prestigious China University of Geosciences (Beijing); 3) we developed long-term collaborations with Chinese colleagues. The intellectual and societal impacts are as follows: 1) we have an excellent idea of how highly populated northeast Asia might respond to global warming that is likely to occur in the future; 2) we have eliminated, or at least modified, one of the key hypothesis to how a warming Earth affects ocean anoxia; and 3) we have forged new pathways in understanding ocean anoxia that form oil rich shales.  These shales are now a key focus of the petroleum industry &ndash; and our study is, thus, highly relevant to understanding key energy resources.
