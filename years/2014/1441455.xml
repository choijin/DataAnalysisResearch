<AbstractNarration>This project will support a one-day workshop to be held in Washington, DC built about policy relevant themes identified in consultation with representatives of the Interagency Working Group (IWG) on Science of Science Policy established by the National Science and Technology Council Committee on Science?s Subcommittee on Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences.   The worskhops furthers attainment of two salient objectives of the National Science Foundation?s Science of Science and innovation Policy (SciSIP) Program by (1) contributing to an understanding of the means by which federal government support of research and development fosters scientific and technological change, and in turn the attainment of desired societal outcomes; and (2) building a community of practice between academic researchers and federal government officials and others such that the academic research community addresses policy relevant questions and that the policy/practitioner community finds that answers produced by SciSIP-supported research are accessible, relevant, timely, and convincing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;Anecdotally, findings from SciSIP-funded research have demonstrable relevance to several science policy issues currently being addressed by several Federal agencies. The workshop will examine the evidence to date and accelerate the dissemination of these findings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As one of its core objectives, the Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) Program has sought to build a community of practice among the academic researchers &ndash; quite diverse by discipline - whose work it supports as well as between these communities and the science and innovation practitioners and policy makers in the Executive and Legislative branches of the Federal government. Towards this end, it has supported two previous workshops organized under grants to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)   and one organized under the auspices of the National Research Council.  The AAAS-SciSIP 2014 workshop organized under this award, number 1441455, titled "Workshop on Assessing the Research Outputs and Policy Import of the National Science FoundationÆs Science of Science and innovation Policy (SciSIP) Program," built on the findings of these previous workshops but differed significantly in content and format from them. It was premised on the proposition that after six rounds of program solicitations and roughly one hundred and fifty awards, SciSIP had advanced sufficiently to allow both of a distillation of its substantive contributions to pre-existing bodies of knowledge and for an assessment of the import of these contributions to current and emerging national science and policy issues. Adding to NSFÆs interest in the workshop was the expressed interest of the Interagency Working Group (IWG) of the National Science and Technology Council Committee on Science in learning more about SciSIPÆs progress to date and in having one-on-one opportunities to interact with SciSIP-funded researchers.  The workshopÆs thematic sessions were selected in consultation with the NSF Program Officer for SciSIP, with additional guidance provided by members of the IWG. Three themes were selected: STEM Labor Market Dynamics; New Methods and Theories; and Assessing the Impacts of Federal Investments in Science and Innovation.  The workshop presentations attested to the technical merit of the research being supported by SciSIP. Equally important, as attested to by the comments of the IWG participants in each session, findings from SciSIP-supported research had clearly discernible connections to one or more national policy issues. As an example, research findings on the increased frequency with which American research output took the form of collaborations with international authors and on the aging of the U.S. scientific workshop were seen by representatives of Federal agencies as providing both data and a strategic context that will assist them in shaping near-term and long-term labor force policies.  Our project demonstrated the continuing value of these community-building and connection-forming workshops, as reflected by the fact that the NSF SciSIP program issued a call in 2015 for proposals for such workshops to help set the SciSIP programÆs overall agenda.
