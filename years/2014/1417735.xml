<AbstractNarration>The use of active learning strategies has long been advocated in the sciences, but high school science instruction remains highly didactic across the country.  This project addresses this longstanding concern by examining the potential of two research-based and college-tested learning strategies in high school classrooms:  Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) and Peer Instruction.   The POGIL strategy was developed initially for chemistry classes, and Peer Instruction was developed within physics classes.  These two learning strategies will be adapted for implementation in biology classes, with the goal of determining which strategy shows the most promise for increasing student achievement and attitudes toward science.  The project will also study the influence of these instructional strategies on teacher beliefs about active learning and the contributions of these beliefs on student success in biology.  Creation of the professional development model and materials for this project bring together high school biology teachers, university biology faculty, and science education specialists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will conduct design and development research to iteratively develop the instructional materials through a collaboration of high school teachers and college faculty members experienced in using the instructional approaches being compared.  Adaptation of the learning strategies for use in biology was chosen because biology is the science course most often taught across schools in the country, and it is required for graduation in the state where this project is being conducted.  To compare the outcomes of the two instructional approaches, 42 teacher pairs will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: POGIL, Peer Instruction, or traditional instruction.  Outcomes of the instructional approaches will be measured in terms of conceptual gains among teachers and students, attitudes toward science, personal agency beliefs, and instructional implementation fidelity.</AbstractNarration>
