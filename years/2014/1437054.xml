<AbstractNarration>Coral reefs provide crucial services for people and are becoming increasingly threatened by climate change. But many important questions about coral reefs remain unanswered, such as how their incredibly high biodiversity has developed and is maintained. It is well known that reef-forming corals consist of many different groups of bacteria and algae that live in the tissues of corals, but the function of most of these microbes remain unknown. One of the reported microbial functions is the process called nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation is better known as a very important process on land. For example, alfalfa in agricultural fields has microbes associated with its roots that can capture nitrogen from the air and replace nitrogen lost from soils in water. The nitrogen cycle in the oceans is less well known, especially in tropical waters where nitrogen levels are low, although nitrogen in coral reef systems is known to derive mainly from nitrogen fixation. Recently nitrogen-fixing bacteria have been discovered in the tissues of corals, which begs the overarching question of this project: how important is the contribution of this fixed nitrogen to corals and to the surrounding environment? This research will integrate with an educational program that fosters critical thinking and cooperative learning among participants by involving undergraduate students who will work closely with the scientists. Students from underrepresented backgrounds will be recruited; the undergraduates will become part of an existing undergraduate research opportunities program where they receive mentoring, financial support, and intensive writing support while conducting original research projects of their own. Also a new program will be developed with the university's veterans office to attract and transition veterans into science fields across campus. Finally, outreach activities will be organized at local public high schools, and some public environmental education lectures about the ecology and biology of coral reefs are planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significant gaps in understanding exist about the role of prokaryotes in the physiology, biochemistry and ecology of reef-forming corals. This project will assess how different prokaryotic communities affect the biogeochemistry of nitrogen, specifically nitrogen fixation, within the coral holobiont and how nitrogen fixation contributes to the dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) content of excreted mucus. The introduction of "new nitrogen" though nitrogen fixation and release of DON could have significant impacts on the biogeochemistry of nitrogen in the adjacent benthic communities surrounding corals. High throughput sequencing tools will be used to quantify the taxonomic and functional diversity of these symbioses in corals from the Pacific and Caribbean, as well as the taxonomic diversity of nifH genes in the tissues of corals. Rates of nitrogen fixation on several coral species from Australia, Hawaii and Curacao will be measured, along with the translocation of fixed nitrogen to all compartments of the coral holobiont, and the contribution of "new nitrogen" to the DON of mucus released to the environment determined. The results will increase our understanding of the taxonomic and functional biodiversity of symbiotic prokaryotes in corals. This project will also help guide future studies on the biogeochemical cycling of coral-derived nitrogen on coral reefs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Coral reefs provide crucial ecosystem services that are becoming increasingly threatened by climate change.  Many important questions about coral reef biology remain unresolved and the ?paradox of the coral reef? as it relates to the observation of high productivity in oligotrophic waters is still not fully resolved.  It is now well established that the corals harbor many functional groups of bacteria that are associated within the tissues of corals, and the function of these bacteria from an organismal and ecosystem perspective remains largely unknown.  One of the reported functions for these symbiotic bacteria is nutrient cycling, and in particular nitrogen, within the coral.  The nitrogen cycle in the oceans is mediated principally by bacterial transformations of organic and inorganic sources of nitrogen or by inputs of new nitrogen from terrestrial, or atmospheric sources.  In coral reef systems new nitrogen is obtained principally from nitrogen fixation which is then made available to other reef organisms through the release of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). With the recent discoveries about the presence of nitrogen fixing bacteria in the tissues of corals it begs the question; how important is the contribution of new nitrogen from corals to the surrounding water column and nearby benthic environments?  In particular, what are the contributions of nitrogen fixation in corals to the DON content of released mucus?  In this project we experimentally assessed how different symbiotic bacterial communities affect the availability of nitrogen, specifically through nitrogen fixation, within the coral and how nitrogen fixation contributes to the DON content of excreted mucus. Using sophisticated genetic sequencing approaches we quantified the taxonomic and functional diversity of these symbioses in corals from the Pacific and Caribbean as well as the taxonomic diversity of the nitrogen fixation gene, nifH, in the tissues of corals.  Additionally, we measured the rates of nitrogen fixation in corals from Australia, Hawaii and Curacao and the amount of translocated nitrogen to the different tissues of the coral as well as the contribution of DON released to the environment.  The data showed that in all locations corals fixed nitrogen and utilized it to support their metabolism as well as releasing it to the environment for other members of the coral reef to utilize.  Additionally, we observed evidence that many corals not only have a core microbiome of symbiotic bacteria but that that microbiome also contained bacteria that consistently fixed nitrogen whether corals were found in the Pacific or the Caribbean, suggesting that the association with nitrogen fixing bacteria precedes the separation of the Caribbean and Pacific oceans.
