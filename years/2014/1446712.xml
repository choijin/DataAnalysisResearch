<AbstractNarration>This project addresses the foundational problem of knowledge within cyber-physical systems (CPS), i.e., systems that combine aspects such as communication, computation, and physics. A single system observes its environment through sensors and interacts through actuators. Neither is perfect. Thus, the CPS's internal view of the world is blurry and its actions are imprecise. CPS are still analyzed with methods that do not distinguish between truth in the world and an internal view thereof, resulting in a mismatch between the behavior of theoretical models and their real-world counterparts. How could they be trusted to perform safety-critical tasks? This project addresses this critical insufficiency by developing methods to reason about knowledge and learning in CPS. The project pursues the development of new logical principles for verifying knowledge-aware CPS. This project investigates how to make the mismatch between the world and the partial perception through sensors explicit and how to achieve provably correct control in theory as well as practice despite this mismatch. By investigating changing knowledge in a changing world, this project contributes to a fundamental feature without which CPS can never be truly safe and efficient at the same time. The project's broader significance and importance are a result of the widespread attention that CPS gain in many safety-critical areas, such as in aviation and automotive industries. One reason for safety gaps in such CPS is that formal verification techniques are still largely knowledge-agnostic, and verifiable solutions overly pessimistic. This project addresses these issues and provides tools that allow for incorporating knowledge about the environment's intentions into the models to derive provably correct, but justifiably optimistic, and thus efficient, behavior. By their logical nature, these techniques are applicable to a wide range of CPS and, thus, contribute significantly to numerous applications. Results obtained within this project will be demonstrated in CPS models and laboratory robot scenarios, and will be shared in courses and with industrial partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical approach that this project pursues develops a new modeling language, logic, and proof calculus for verifying knowledge-aware CPS. The knowledge paradigm used allows CPS controllers to seamlessly acquire knowledge about the world but also about other agents in the system, i.e., other controllers. Knowledge is the key to interactions between different agents. This project investigates how an explicit model of world perception and agent intentions - and knowledge of these perceptions and intentions - allows CPS agents to act, based on more efficient, but still provably safe control in multi-agent scenarios. The methods will be implemented in the verification tool KeYmaera and demonstrated in formal verification on different case study applications such as car scenarios.</AbstractNarration>

By investigating changing knowledge in a changing world, this project contributes to a fundamental feature without which CPS can never be truly safe and efficient at the same time. The project's broader significance and importance are a result of the widespread attention that CPS gain in many safety-critical areas, such as in aviation and automotive industries. One reason for safety gaps in such CPSs is that analysis techniques are largely knowledge-agnostic. This project addresses these issues with logic that incorporates knowledge and belief about the environment into models to derive correctly justifiable behavior. By their logical nature, these techniques are applicable to a wide range of CPS and, thus, contribute significantly to foundational techniques for numerous applications.<br />Due to the limits of perception and interaction with the environment, both knowledge and belief play a fundamental role in cyber-physical systems. This project exploits modal logic capabilities of distinguishing truth in reality from possible truth and certain truth, epistemically, while using dynamic logic to understand how truth changes over time by CPS actions.&nbsp;<br />This project resulted in Dynamic Doxastic Differential Dynamic Logic (d4L), which provides a new modeling language, new logic, and new proof calculus for analyzing knowledge-aware CPS. The easiest d4L example is a speed sensor reading, after which we do not know the true speed, but merely know that the true speed is within a margin of error around the measured speed. If the sensor may be faulty, e.g., an aircraft's Pitot tube freezes over, then only belief remains instead of knowledge, because one is no longer certain that the belief is true. The d4L operations are ontologically neutral and can also be used to describe beliefs about uncertainty coming from other sources. Examples include a pilot's uncertainty about the mode or implementation of an aircraft controller, or an aircraft controller's uncertainty about the pilot's intent, or about the intended flight path of another aircraft. Each of those sources of uncertainty may require nontrivial changes in a CPS to make them safe despite that uncertainty. Rather than ad-hoc solutions for each, d4L provides one common language to express beliefs held and belief acquisition via learning, as well as reasoning about beliefs, change of beliefs, and how both relate to the change of ground truth.<br />d4L allows CPS controllers to explicitly acquire knowledge about the world since knowledge is the key to interactions between different agents. This led to the discovery of the paradigm of belief-triggered CPS, realizing that accurate controllers can only act based on their belief about the world, as opposed to the true state of the world, because real CPS can merely observe the environment in imperfect ways and indirectly conclude partial information about the physical reality from the resulting beliefs. Belief-triggered control yields first-principles checks on the proper design of CPS controllers.<br />The understanding obtained from this project led to collision-free controllers for mobile ground robot obstacle navigation despite the epistemic uncertainty arising from bounded sensor errors, detectable sensor faults, and bounded actuator disturbance. It turns out that correctness proofs for different notions of safety for collision-freedom require different knowledge about agents in the environment. For example, collision-free motion in a dynamic environment requires knowledge of upper bounds on the velocity of all other moving vehicles. Likewise, moving into the path of another vehicle requires knowledge of its braking capabilities and reaction time to remain safe. Furthermore, it is only safe to focus attention exclusively on the corridor in front of a car if we know that all cars on other lanes are either parked or will not change lanes. Beyond cars, the project also studied the role of beliefs in safety proofs related to aircraft accidents.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/26/2020<br>      Modified by: Andre&nbsp;Platzer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1446712/1446712_10341752_1582747385499_BACPS-ChangingWorld--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1446712/1446712_10341752_1582747385499_BACPS-ChangingWorld--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Belief-Aware Cyber-Physical Systems study changing belief in a changing world"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1446712/1446712_10341752_1582747385499_BACPS-ChangingWorld--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Belief-Aware Cyber-Physical Systems study changing belief in a changing world"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Instead of blurring the distinction between reality and its perception, Belief-Aware Cyber-Physical Systems only act based on what they believe, causing explicit logical relationships between perceived belief and real truth and how the change of one affects a change of the other.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Joao G.
