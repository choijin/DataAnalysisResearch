<AbstractNarration>Though many physicists are engaged in outreach, the variety of activities in which they are engaged is surprisingly small. For those venturing beyond the standard public lectures and science cafes there is currently nowhere to disseminate the knowledge they gain from both the successful and failed public outreach attempts. This project will fund highly innovative outreach activities and their successes and failures will add significantly to the body of outreach knowledge. The associated Outreach Guide will disseminate these best practices to others interested in beginning their own programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the American Physical Society Outreach Program is to enable innovative outreach projects that aim to bring physics to the public outside of the classroom. These projects will not only directly affect the target audience of such projects, but will also affect the climate surrounding public outreach and engagement. Despite the benefits of public outreach there are many obstacles in the way of those interested in starting such programs. The program will help scientists surmount these barriers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The APS Outreach Mini Grants (OMG) program fostered the development of innovative outreach projects that aimed to bring physics to the general public.  The purpose of this initiative was to increase the number of physicists who take part in public engagement activities and the number of people exposed to such activities that demonstrate the wonders of physics, as well as promoting the value of public engagement as part of the career development of physicists. Since 2011, the APS OMG program dispersed nearly 40 grants of up to $10,000, reaching a combined audience of over 100,000 members of the general public.    With the combined support of NSF and APS, the OMG program delivered on its goals to foster physics outreach directly, ignite programs that will carry forward, raise the profile of outreach in the broader physics community, encourage participation of under-represented groups in physics, and disseminate best practices.  Major activities included:   Sponsoring new outreach activities through a competitive application process by requesting proposals from the physics community. Projects were awarded to bring physics to the public through non-traditional formats, such as physics-themed puppet theater shows, art installations, escape rooms, and interactive kiosks in community parks, as well as virtual formats such as videos, audience-led research, and apps.   Funding activities and resources that served underrepresented groups, such as the Rastros F&iacute;sicos (Physics Footprints) and News from the Universe programs, which created materials in English and Spanish to engage Spanish-speaking audiences.   Promoting the work of project leaders by supporting presentations at APS national meetings and hosting information and resources on the Physics Central website, including an outreach guide.     Beneficial impacts from OMG projects were wide ranging and included: (i) positive responses and  attention from the public, such as the Fermilab art installation, Art@CMS; (ii) recognition and institutionalization of projects, for example, Penny Theater was adopted by the Noyes Children’s Library Foundation, and Light at the Museum became a permanent exhibition in a new University of Waterloo science building; (iii) creation of spin-off projects, such as VyeraToolbox which lead to the creation of a popular gamified app; (iv) growing awareness of the value of public engagement, which in many cases led to greater engagement of physicists and physics organizations through access to volunteers, funds, and other resources; and (v) support for the career development of OMG project leaders, which led to promotions, job opportunities and other career-related benefits for about one-third of these individuals.
