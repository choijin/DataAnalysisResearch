<AbstractNarration>1428025&lt;br/&gt;Keen-Zebert&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant provides partial support for the acquisition of a Ge detector based gamma ray spectroscopy system that will support the full on-campus capability for optically stimulated and thermoluminescence geochronology.  The gamma ray spectrometer will be used to assess the annual dose rate of radiation experienced by mineral phases to be dated that are resultant of radioactive decay of nuclides contained within the minerals.  The equipment will allow for the complete capacity at the University of Nevada Desert Research Institute (DRI) to ascertain the burial time of mineral phases since last exposure to sunlight or temperatures in excess of 300 degrees C with application to Quaternary geoscience and archaeological investigations.  The equipment builds on the OSL/TL reader infrastructure already housed at DRI which allows for measurement of equivalent dose, or the energy accumulated in crystal lattice defects as a result of radioactive active decay of trace nuclides in the mineral that are proportional to the length of time since last exposure to sunlight or high temperatures, which releases this crystal lattice trapped energy.  OSL/TL dates are calculated based on the ratio of equivalent dose to dose rate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OSL and TL dating capabilities at DRI will support fundamental research on landscape evolution and process geomorphology in both fluvial and aeolian landscapes over a range of environments from the humid mid-continent to the Great Basin of North America, mountainous regions of India and New Zealand, and river systems in the interior of South Africa. The facility will serve outside users and their students and the PI is actively engaged in local K-12 outreach activities that teaches students about natural occurring radioactivity and its useful applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
