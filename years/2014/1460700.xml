<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Maine focuses on sensor science and engineering research which is of high interest to the consumer, national defense, and homeland security, and reflects one of the top research strengths at UMaine. Maine's sensor science and engineering research ranges from basic theoretical studies to the design, fabrication, and testing of prototype sensors for chemical and biological agents related to terrorism; peroxide based explosives; neurotoxins; E-coli; pesticides; nitric oxide (related to respiratory distress in humans); oil viscosity for the automotive industry; airborne elements such as chlorine, and mercury; fish pathogens; and ammonia/nitric oxide (for fossil fuel burning systems). Other areas of research relate to the processing and analysis of data obtained from sensors, wireless networks and their applications to biological and envinronmental research. The program will provide state-of-the art, interdisciplinary research and problem solving opportunities for REU participants. Undergraduates will utilize their new knowledge to solve real-life research problems that impact society. Society will benefit as undergraduates, as a result of their research experiences, choose to continue in graduate school to excel in technologically and scientifically challenging careers that advance such areas as homeland security, food safety, transportation, communications, and medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU program will offer a 10-week intensive summer research experience, for a total of 30 students, over a three year period.  The program will include: 1) individual research projects with faculty research mentors utilizing specialized sensor science and engineering research facilities, 2) ethics training, 3) student meetings, 4) seminars, 5) field trips, 6) student presentations, and 7) career guidance, networking opportunities, and mentorship. Recruitment will focus specifically on women and minorities and provide research experiences for students at non-PhD granting institutions. This emphasis on recruiting women and minorities will also further impact the NSF Track III Stormwater Management Research Team (SMART), which emphasizes the involvement of women and minority high school students and teachers.  The REU participants will share their research experiences with middle and high school students and teachers participating in the SMART institute and provide a further role model for these high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The REU Site: Sensor Science and Engineering at the University of Maine Electrical and Computer Engineering Department hosted a total of 38 undergraduate researchers over the four year period of the grant. Of these students, 13 were women and four were minority students. The grant covered the stipends of 30 students, and eight other students participated in the program through work study, REU supplements to other NSF grants, and other research funds. 15 of the 30 students supported by the grant were from other institutions, meeting our recruitment goal for external recruitment. Through the REU Site and its administration, we have established recruitment networks among four-year colleges and universities, with a particular emphasis on HBCU and other minority serving institutions and institutions which do not grant Ph.D.s.</p> <p>The REU fellows conducted STEM research projects on sensor materials and surfaces, sensor devices and sensing systems. The research projects covered a wide range of sensors and their applications. Examples include, but are not limited to, bulk acoustic wave (BAW) sensors for cancer biomarker detection, surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors for high temperature and pressure sensors in power plant turbines for energy generation; metal oxide gas sensors ; microfluidic systems for lab-on-a-chip; SAW based microactuators; biosensors for detection of neuropathy; radar-based sensors for remote monitoring of honey bee hives; and integration of multiple sensors for elderly care. Faculty in the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Chemistry, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Physics and Astronomy, Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, and the School of Biology and Ecology at the University of Maine mentored the REU fellows. Two high school students from Bangor High School, ME, collaborated with REU students working on honey bee hive monitoring sensors. Additionally, in 2016 and 2017, two REU students helped with the sensor  portion of the NSF funded Storm Water project which brought high school  students from across the state to campus for a week for research  experiences (NSF grant 1348266).</p> <p>The research has resulted in four conference proceedings, one journal publication and two honors theses. Two REU students, Berkay Payal (2016) and Ana Eliza Souza Cunha (2017) shared the inaugural Dr. Susan J. Hunter Presidential Research Impact Award in 2018. REU student research also contributed to the economic develop of Maine. UMaine spun off two start-up companies, Neuright and Maine Biosensors, focusing on early neuropathy detection and bee hive monitoring. Both of these research projects spanned multiple years of this REU Site and the follow up REU Site (#1851998), and a total of 5 students from this REU Site participated in the early proof-of-concept research that lead to the founding of these companies. Two patents related to these technologies filed by UMaine were in part based on REU student research. Several other REU research involved collaborations with a Maine based small company, Environetix. One student was involved in a collaborative research project with Sappi Paper.</p> <p>This REU Site has contributed to the growth of&nbsp;a&nbsp;highly skilled U.S. scientific and engineering workforce.&nbsp;The NSF-REU program has provided a valuable boost to the student's motivation toward both present and future graduate study. It has given them the opportunity to apply advanced techniques in mathematics, physics and engineering as well as demonstrating the need for further course work to provide the necessary tools for more advanced research. The program has also caused some of the students to modify their ultimate educational goals. It has further demonstrated that highly qualified undergraduate students are capable of doing high-quality advanced work.</p> <p>A number of REU participants have started their graduate studies. Examples include Jequil Hartz (2016) and David Leff (2018), who are attending UMaine for their M.S in Mechanical Engineering, and Ph.D. in Physics, respectively. Thomas Leighton (2016) earned his M.S. in Electrical Engineering in 2019, while Sean Cashman (2017) and Stewart Doe (2018) are expected to get their M.S. in Computer Engineering in 2020. As an example of a student who chose a research career, Ana Eliza Souza Cunha (2017) took a research job at Children's Hospital in Boston, MA, in order to decide if she wishes to continue as a researcher in biology or go to medical school.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/26/2020<br>      Modified by: Nuri&nbsp;Emanetoglu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460700/1460700_10397996_1582575479626_0809181212--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460700/1460700_10397996_1582575479626_0809181212--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2018 REU Student Cohort"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460700/1460700_10397996_1582575479626_0809181212--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2018 REU Student Cohort"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Front row (Left to right): Bailee Bartash, Morgen Benninghoff, Jennifer Baranker, Julia TowneBack row (left to right): Stewart Doe, Nicholas Aiken, David Leff, Maxwell McFarlane, Benjamin Waterman, Oliver Adams, Kendall Butler</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nuri Emanetoglu</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nuri&nbsp;Emanetoglu</div> <div class="imageTitle">2018 REU Student Cohort</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460700/1460700_10397996_1582556361945_0702180923--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460700/1460700_10397996_1582556361945_0702180923--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU Students at research Apiary"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460700/1460700_10397996_1582556361945_0702180923--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU Students at research Apiary"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Left to right- Research scientist Herbert Aumann, 2018 REU student Maxwell McFarlane and 2017 REU student Ana Eliza Souza Cunha at UMaine's research apiary, after inspecting the bee hives with the bee hive monitors.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nuri Emanetoglu</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nuri&nbsp;Emanetoglu</div> <div class="imageTitle">REU Students at research Apiary</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460700/1460700_10397996_1582735194674_DSCN1137--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460700/1460700_10397996_1582735194674_DSCN1137--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2017 REU Participants"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460700/1460700_10397996_1582735194674_DSCN1137--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2017 REU Participants"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Photo of REU students who participated in the 2017 REU Site: Sensor Science and Engineering</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nuri Emanetoglu</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nuri&nbsp;Emanetoglu</div> <div class="imageTitle">2017 REU Participants</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460700/1460700_10397996_1582736012031_DSCN1125--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460700/1460700_10397996_1582736012031_DSCN1125--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2016 REU Cohort"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460700/1460700_10397996_1582736012031_DSCN1125--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2016 REU Cohort"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Participants in the 2016 REU Site: Sensor Science and Engineering</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nuri Emanetoglu</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nuri&nbsp;Emanetoglu</div> <div class="imageTitle">2016 REU Cohort</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
