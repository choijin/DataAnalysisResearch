<AbstractNarration>Leaf vein traits are considered to be critical for understanding plant adaptation to the environment, responses to environmental changes, and crop performance. However, the direct linkages of vein traits to whole plant performance are not completely understood.  This project will test and extend current theory for the role of leaf veins in plant function, using the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. The project will determine the genes underlying different vein traits and how these lead to higher-level functions including water transport and growth. This work will result in discoveries of how genes determine plant function, create resources for improving plant productivity, and clarify the evolution of natural species, with critical impacts in the fields of plant physiology, ecology and genetics. Numerous undergraduate students will be integrated into the project, receiving training is scientific methodology and data analysis. The project includes the creation of a new web resource to enable K-12 students, teachers, and members of the public to conduct their own analyses to estimate how vein properties affect plant function. The work aims to advance national prosperity and welfare through applications in agriculture and ecological sustainability and education of science students and the public in plant biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leaf venation is increasingly recognized as important to plant performance, with applications from agriculture to paleobiology. This understanding is based on comparative studies across diverse plant species, which showed that major structural features of leaf venation influenced leaf gas exchange. However, the theory for the importance of vein traits has not yet been tested rigorously in a model system, such as A. thaliana. Vein mutants have been identified with leaf phenotypes showing altered vein cross-sectional anatomy, spacing, patterning and/or connectivity. The project will utilize both leaf vein mutants and natural ecotypes previously subjected to genomic sequencing in a combination of physiological experiments, modeling, and genetic analyses. Hypothesized mechanistic trait linkages and genome-wide association of traits will be measured to address two research questions: (1) How do leaf vein traits influence hydraulics, gas exchange and growth? (2) What are the genetic loci associated with leaf vein traits, and how do they determine higher-level function across A. thaliana genotypes? The project breaks new ground in the ability to model how gene sequence determines key plant traits that scale up to whole plant function. The integrative approach will provide new insights into plant physiology and genetic architecture and set the stage for numerous further analyses at the intersection of these fields. Broader Impacts work will capitalize on the great appeal of leaf venation for scientists, students and laypeople. In collaboration with undergraduate students and under-represented high school students, a crowd-sourcing website will be created, "VenationNation", to provide unique resources for researchers, citizens and students to become involved in leaf venation research.  The site will contain downloadable images of leaf vein systems and protocols to calculate and interpret vein traits with self-teaching and course curricula. This site will increase the involvement of citizens and students in science, provide resources for teaching, create pathways toward understanding of principles of plant science, and aid in the global dissemination of the research.</AbstractNarration>

This understanding is based on comparative studies across diverse plant species, which showed that major structural features of the leaf venation influenced leaf gas exchange. We tested the importance of vein traits rigorously in the model system<em> Arabidopsis thaliana</em>, using natural populations ("ecotypes") from across the extensive native range, and also mutant genotypes with altered vein traits. We combined novel physiological experiments, modeling, and genetic analyses to determine the functional consequences of variation in vein architecture across <em>Arabidopsis</em> genotypes. We clarified the mechanism by which<em> Arabidopsis</em> is vulnerable to drought stress, with its sensitive leaf tissues outside the veins. We found that across <em>Arabidopsis</em>, the leaf veins and other physiological traits (including stomatal and photosynthetic traits, wilting point, nutrient and carbon isotope composition) contribute to climate adaptation, in multiple ways, consistent with their diverse ecology. Thus, some ecotypes achieve stress tolerance by adapting in these traits, but even more importantly, many ecotypes have adapted to avoid stress by growing in the shorter growing season in cold or dry climates, with contrasting traits. Given this diversity of adaptation (i.e., both stress tolerance and stress avoidance), we observed many novel relationships in <em>Arabidopsis</em> between vein traits and other traits contributing to photosynthetic rate and growth, sometimes similar, and sometimes importantly different from those typically observed across species. For example, as previously reported across species, across <em>Arabidopsis</em> ecotypes vein traits, stomatal anatomy, wilting point and hydraulic vulnerabilility are adapted to stressful climates. However, while across species, high vein density and hydraulic conductance are related to greater photosynthetic rate and growth, across <em>Arabidopsis</em> ecotypes and vein mutants, these relationships are not observed, as rapid growth is achieved through multiple mechanisms at leaf and whole plant scale.
