<AbstractNarration>Owing to their extraordinary natural resources and ecosystem services, river-delta coastlines host hundreds of millions of people worldwide. However, the sustainability of society on delta landscapes is uncertain, due to significant human influences including: 1) reduction of sediment - the life sustaining resource for any delta system - as a result of damming and leveeing of river channels, 2) disrupting natural sediment dispersal and deposition patterns within and along river-delta coastlines, 3) accelerated sinking of low-lying deltaic landscapes due to sub-surface water and fossil fuel extraction, and 4) sea-level rise, which threatens to drown deltaic landscapes.  The overarching goal of this project is to evaluate river-delta sustainability by merging science that examines physical aspects of delta growth with socio-economic decisions.  This research will provide guidance for the sustainable use of vulnerable delta resources, while promoting best engineering practices that protect society and infrastructure from disasters including river flooding, ocean storms, and sea-level rise.  Additional broader impacts include training future scholars for the interdisciplinary field of coastal sustainability, creating an internet-based interface to promote global-citizen awareness in coastal sustainability, and developing teaching modules with complementary workshops intended for high-school courses on coastal science and sustainability for underrepresented groups in Houston and Los Angeles. This project is supported as part of the National Science Foundation's Coastal Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability program - Coastal SEES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crucial resource in building sustainable deltaic coastlines is sediment, and the key control on sediment delivery is river channel avulsions, relatively rapid displacements of river channels and the formation of new river channels. A multi-investigator, cross disciplinary team of researchers will address the following questions of fundamental importance to river-delta coastal sustainability: What are the socioeconomic consequences of altering river channel pathways on a highly utilized delta? Are current delta land loss mitigation strategies sustainable over long-range (decades to centuries) timescales? Can the location of significant future flooding events be predicted? These questions will be addressed using the Huanghe (Yellow River) delta, China as a case study. The Huanghe delta is a compelling region because it is one of the most dynamic and heavily urbanized coastal landscapes in the world. Lessons learned from the Huanghe delta will be exportable to evaluate the sustainability of delta coastlines worldwide. This project will build predictive models for coastal sustainability by bringing together the mechanics of avulsion on deltas, associated channel-shoreline interaction, socio-economic response to natural and engineered avulsions, and the resulting coupled human-natural system dynamics. U.S. researchers in cooperation with Chinese colleagues will create a template for multi-disciplinary coastal sustainability research to help guide future governance and decision making that integrates human-delta dynamics, societal objectives and uncertainty, hazard and land use engineering, coastal morphodynamics, and educational outreach. This project will evaluate whether massively anthropic coastal landscapes can be managed using engineered avulsions to minimize coastal erosion in the face of reduced sediment supply and rising sea level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project is a multidisciplinary collaborative research between Chinese and American colleagues to evaluate the dynamics of river avulsions near coastlines, the influence of avulsions on development of coastal landscape, and implications of these natural processes on the flooding risks facing affected communities.  Geophysicists on the project team evaluated the physical processes producing river avulsions using field, experimental, and modeling frameworks.  Specifically, the field study area is the deltaic Yellow River, China, one of the most active systems in the world in terms of river avulsions, and historically one of the most dangerous rivers in the world for flooding.  Their aim was to produce a mechanistic understanding of the controls on avulsion location and frequency on river deltas exportable to other global fluvial-deltaic systems.   Meanwhile, the aim of the socioeconomic members of the team was to use this understanding to inform a risk analysis of alternatives to reduce flooding damages.  We evaluated societal impacts of Yellow River avulsions, both engineered (controlled) and natural (uncontrolled), comparing benefits and costs of controlled avulsions versus other flood control methods, including floodways.  To do this, a unique optimization modeling framework was created that, for the first time, integrated sediment transport, channel aggradation, stochastic river flows, intentional channel avulsions, and construction and operation of other flood control works in a model that traded off risks of flooding damages with the cost of preventing those damages.  The physical modeling portion of the framework that was informed by the geophysical research in this project includes three parts. First, the hydraulics simulation calculates the water surface profile at each point along the river, given the flow and the riverbed elevation. There are two versions of this simulation, a standard version and an extended version. They are used under low flow and high flow (when overtopping of river banks happens) conditions respectively. Second, the sedimentation simulation calculates the aggradation or degradation of the riverbed elevation at each time step given initial bed condition and daily flow. It uses the sediment transport formula developed by project collaborators which is validated by the field data collected during the field seasons. It also simulates delta propagation using two moving boundaries (shock front modeling). In the third part, the physical simulation model is used for analysis of alternative flood risk management strategies. These strategies include the location and sizing of temporary water diversions (floodways) and the location and triggering criterion (channel flood conveyance capacity) for man-made avulsions, which create a new outlet to the sea for the Yellow River. There are three categories of costs considered in comparing different strategies, which are quantified in the economic model. The third part of this model quantifies the costs associated with expected flooding costs (using inundation information from the hydraulics function together with extreme flow distributions) and the costs of constructing and operating temporary floodways and man-made avulsions.  This optimization model has also been enhanced to account for risks of changes in long-run precipitation and streamflow.  This was done by developed a stochastic optimization framework in which near-term decisions about floodways and rules for triggering deliberate avulsions are made without knowing which of two or more scenarios of average future flood and lowflows will occur, and then after one decade, the rule can be altered to adapt to detected changes in flows.  Extensive risk analyses, in the form of robustness analyses under alternative metrics of ?robustness?, have also been undertaken, which we now describe.   The robustness analysis considers the impact of deep uncertainty in hydrological assumptions, in which changes in flow distributions could occur under a hypothesized shift towards lower average rainfall, and the rate of sea level rise is uncertain.  In general, a number of principles for framing and evaluating water resources decisions under deep long-run uncertainties have been proposed and implemented.  In our stochastic/robustness analysis, we evaluated the usefulness of three widely-recommended principles: scenario-based uncertainty definition, robustness rather than optimality as a performance measure, and modeling of adaptability, which is the flexibility to change system design or operations as conditions change in the future. The results gave insight on the effect of alternative trajectories for changes in sea level and flood probabilities over time, as well as the effect of different robustness decision criteria on the long-term performance of the system.  Depending on the risk attitudes of the decision maker, different decision approaches will give different recommendations. The analysis also showed that adaptive multi-stage optimization has a lower expected cost than a static (or ?open-loop?)  approach in which decisions over the entire time horizon are specified; further, recognizing the ability to adapt means that larger first-stage investments become optimal, at least in this case study. When faced with deep uncertainty, this study proves the usefulness of a stochastic and robustness-based approach.
