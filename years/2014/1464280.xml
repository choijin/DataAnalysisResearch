<AbstractNarration>Johns Hopkins University, Clemson University, and the University of Delaware propose to form a new NSF-supported Industrial/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled the Advanced Mammalian Biomanufacturing Innovation Center (AMBIC) to address current and future challenges faced by US bio-pharmaceuticals manufacturing. The Advanced Mammalian Biomanufacturing Innovation Center (AMBIC) will bring together leading academic, industrial, and government biotechnologists with the goal of advancing cell culture manufacturing innovation at a pre-competitive research level.  AMBIC represents a unique opportunity to address technology challenges and bottlenecks in US biopharmaceutical manufacturing by bringing together leading researchers and innovators to implement transformative products and processes that will lead to a stronger, healthier, and more competitive biopharmaceutical industry.  In this way, AMBIC will be a critical catalyst towards maintaining national excellence in biopharmaceutical production by focusing on mammalian cell culture issues.  The three thrusts of AMBIC are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;1. Genome and Cellular Engineering of Mammalian Platform with the goal of developing advanced platforms with improved production capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;2.`Omics and Systems Biology for Mammalian Cells with the task of acquiring ?omics data and implementing standards of performance for the mammalian production platform&lt;br/&gt;3.Optimizing Bioreactor Control for Improved Cellular Performance with the objective of characterizing metabolic states and implementing advanced controls. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support the planning meeting to engage partners from the biopharmaceutical industry and government to participate in AMBIC and develop a research and educational program for the center.  A planning meeting will help to identify major research challenges and to design a cutting edge research and educational program in mammalian biomanufacturing.  Furthermore, AMBIC will establish and maintain a pipeline of educated and motivated students at all levels for careers in biopharmaceutical manufacturing and development.  Collaborations with corporate partners will enable the students to work on the most pressing problems that the industry faces.  In addition, AMBIC will serve to engage and excite students from under-represented minority populations to pursue a career in life sciences, engineering, or related STEM fields. Through systems biology analysis, novel cell line development, and bioreactor optimization, AMBIC will provide innovative solutions to improve biomanufacturing efficiencies.  These advances will ultimately serve to lower overall health care costs for consumers and make biopharmaceuticals more affordable and available for a greater number of patients.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the past two decades, the biopharmaceutical industry has made significant gains through advances in manufacturing science and technology.  However, the advent of new biological insights provides opportunities to implement substantial improvements in productivity and product quality control. Moreover, as emerging biological knowledge and analytical technologies mature, consensus-based knowledge may guide and facilitate regulatory frameworks in ways previously not possible. As a result, there are numerous precompetitive research questions for the upstream biomanufacturing community to help realize a future where biological knowledge can be harnessed to efficiently, effectively, reliably, and predictably manufacture  biologics.   The outcome of this planning grant was the submission of a full proposal to National Science Foundation (NSF) to from a new Industrial-University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled Advanced Mammalian Biomanufacturing Innovation Center (AMBIC), focused on upstream biopharmaceutical manufacturing challenging on January 11, 2016. The universities involved in AMBIC include: Johns Hopkins University, Clemson University, the University of Delaware, University of Massachusetts Lowell, and the University of Maryland. There were two key meetings with industry.  The first was a Program Development Meeting held June 10, 2015 where industry was engaged to identify the three main research thrusts for AMBIC.  Next, a Planning Grant Meeting was held July 30-31, 2015 in which research projects were presented to industry and NSF representatives described the proposal selection guidelines.  Following this meeting, potential AMBIC industrial members were asked to rank 30 research proposals that included the 11 proposals presented at the Planning Grant Meeting updated to reflect industrial input, 11 poster presentations from the Planning Grant Meeting updated to reflect any industrial input, and 8 new project ideas based on industrial input from the Planning Grant Meeting.  From the ranked listed, the top three proposals for each site were selected for inclusion in the Full Proposal submission.  Broader Impacts  There is no industry-university center currently focusing on mammalian cell culture upstream development within the biopharmaceutical community or within NSF-supported I/UCRCs.  AMBIC will bring together leading academic and industrial biotechnologists focused on mammalian cell culture manufacturing at a pre-competitive research level.  Through systems biology analysis, novel cell line development, and bioreactor optimization, this group will provide transformative solutions that can improve bioprocessing efficiency and lower biomanufacturing costs.  Most importantly, these advances can ultimately serve to lower overall health care costs for consumers and make biopharmaceuticals more affordable and available for a greater number of patients.   In addition, AMBIC will establish and maintain a pipeline of educated and motivated students at all levels for careers in biopharmaceutical manufacturing and development.  Collaborations with corporate partners will enable the students to work on the most pressing problems that the industry faces.  In addition, this center will serve to engage and excite students from under-represented minority populations to pursue a career in life sciences, engineering, or related STEM fields.  An important part of the proposed activities and a committed goal of the PIs is to increase the participation of women and under-represented minorities in STEM disciplines. Each center site will build on current programs in order to engage students from all backgrounds about the exciting opportunities for helping others through STEM careers in biotechnology and biomedicine.
