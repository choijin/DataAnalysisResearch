<AbstractNarration>This investigation will produce wearable renewable power sources that will eliminate or reduce (1) waste streams associated with battery disposal/recycling in personal/wearable systems and (2) surgical procedures required for battery replacement in implantable electronics.  A strong education program, tightly coupled to research, will train students to become next-generation leaders on sustainable energy.  The education program includes 1) involvement of a large number of undergraduate students in research, which reflects the strong appeal of this research to the younger generation; 2) development of courses related to mechanics design of energy harvesting; and 3) strong outreach activities to K-12, college students, and general public.  This stretchable mechanical energy harvester is expected to serve as a compelling tool for introducing the public to the STEM fields, such as through interactive museums display.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this award is to combine the advanced engineering design principles and basic research on fundamental aspects in materials, mechanics and manufacturing to develop personal-scale sources of renewable power, which will play critical roles in the sustainable growth of personal/wearable electronics and implantable biomedical components, both of which are quickly emerging as key support technologies for the rapid, global expansion of an aging population.  The specific systems involve high performance, stretchable mechanical energy harvesters, capable of mounting on nearly any surface (e.g., glass, paper, biological tissues, textiles, automotives, building structures) in nearly any configuration (e.g. flat, curved, dynamically deformed) and at nearly any scale (e.g. micro to macro).  Studies conducted under this award will develop enabling technologies, and optimize the system to realize the specified performance goals such as high-areal coverage, large stretchability, and precise control of strains in devices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A high-performance mechanical energy harvesting (MEH) system has been developed in this project.  The MEH system consists of arrays of ultrathin, microscale (&lt; mm2) device elements that incorporate the highest performance materials available for these applications interconnected in ways that allow stretchable configurations.  It exploits two new, enabling concepts: (1) electrical (and structural) interconnects that adopt fractal designs, for optimized mechanics; and (2) elastomer substrates that involve design of surface relief microstructures, for precisely controlled strain distributions for mechanical energy harvesting.  The PI, his collaborators, and the graduate research assistants working on this project have applied fractal interconnects to stretchable and flexible electronics for biomedical applications, and to mechanics-guided deterministic 3D assembly of any materials, at any length scales from nanometer to centimeter.  They have published several high-profile publications in Nature Biomedical Engineering, Nature Communications, Nature Materials, PNAS, and Science Translational Medicine, which has attracted the wide coverage from the media.  The project has involved several graduate research assistants, including a Hispanic American student who, together with other team members for this project, have made significant progress.  This student has won the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, Ford Foundation Fellowship, and the Graduate Fellowship of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
