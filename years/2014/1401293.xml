<AbstractNarration>Research Initiation Awards (RIAs) provide support for junior faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) who are starting to build a research program, as well as for mid-career faculty who need to re-direct and re-build a research program.  It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at the researcher's home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff (UAPB)'s HBCU-UP RIA project updates scientific knowledge on the biosynthesis of the 20 genetically encoded amino acids of the standard genetic code.  The project's major objectives are to: (1) explore the current assertion that the 20 standard amino acids of the genetic code comprise a mixture of early versus late amino acids, (2) analyze the metabolic pathways at work in living organisms so as to provide clear information into ancient molecular evolution and (3) to mentor undergraduate students in biological research and support retention in the biological sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hypothesis of this project entitled "The Genetic Code of Protein Molecules" is that, the network of metabolic pathways for amino acid biosynthesis contains plausible molecular fossils.   The research investigates and determines whether any evidence exists that connects pathways of amino acid metabolism to claims for early versus late amino acids and also whether metabolic pathways found in living organisms are an accurate guide to ancient evolutionary events.  The investigation uses the following procedures:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-identification of the enzymes associated with each step of amino acid biosynthesis,&lt;br/&gt;-identification of which of these enzymes occur within all three domains of life; &lt;br/&gt;-verification of which enzymes are missing from one or more domains of life; &lt;br/&gt;-reduction/simplification sequence data sets for each step of a metabolic pathway and building phylogenies for the enzymes of each step of an amino acid biosynthetic pathway; &lt;br/&gt;-identification and elimination of examples of lateral gene transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contemporary data from databases such as KEGG, MetaCyc, EcoCyc, REACTOME, Molecular Ancestry Network (MANET), and Pathway Localization (PathLoc) databases will be used. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project contributes to disease-related research in plants and pests.  UAPB is an Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) institution.  Thus, the project will build research capacity and capability at this institution (a minority-serving institution) and within the state in computational biological sciences.  In addition, the project contributes to increasing a diverse scientific workforce for the nation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research project on genetic code commenced three and a half years ago. The research goal is to update scientific knowledge on the emergence of a standard alphabet of 20 genetically encoded amino acids. There are two specific objectives. The first objective is to explore the current assertion that the standard amino acid alphabet comprises a mixture of "early" versus "late" members; that is, some amino acids were available prebiotically and were therefore present from the start of genetic coding; others evolved later, as "inventions" of early metabolism; and analyze the metabolic pathways at work in living organisms so as to provide evidence based information into ancient molecular evolution, such as the steps by which life?s biochemical framework first emerged. The second objective is to train and mentor four students in evolutionary research. We completed  the following in those years:  Identification of the enzymes associated with each step of amino      acid biosynthesis,    Identification      of which of these enzymes occur within all three domains of life.   Verify which      enzymes are missing from one or more domains of life, Reduce/simplify      sequence data sets for each step of a metabolic pathway, Identify pathways      and build phylogenies for the amino acids and enzymes respectively, of      each step in the amino acid?s biosynthetic pathway,  Identify and      eliminate examples of lateral gene transfer.   Data analysis and evolutionary interpretation Building the phylogenetic tree    We presented results as follows:  Showed the phylogeny of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the 20 standard amino acids of the genetic code as distributed in the three domains of life. Showed taxonomic and/or evolutionary relationships of the enzymes. Produced detailed and updated pathways of biosynthesis of 20 standard amino acids of the genetic code using available data from 1975 &ndash; 2017.   We traveled to the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in summer, 2016 to conduct research at the Origin of Life laboratory, courtesy of Dr. Lazcano and Dr. Arturo (world-renowned evolutionary scientists).  The PI and two students (Annette and Makoneen) spent over three weeks at UNAM.   We identified and documented all new biosynthetic pathways of the 20 standard amino acids (1975 &ndash; 2017).

Using new data, we have completed sequence alignment and BLAST analyses of enzymes involved in the pathways. Based on available new research data, we produced new and/or updated pathways (please see Fig. 2 attached) of biosynthesis of each of the 20 standard amino acids of the genetic code. We also produced the phylogeny of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the 20 standard amino acids (Figs. 1a and 1b).   KEY OUTCOMES:  Distinctions exist between the "early" and "late" amino acids of the genetic code.  Biosynthetic steps in many of the late amino acids are longer than those in the early ones. Longer step means the involvement of many more enzymes.  Synthesis of some late amino acids is not "a one-way traffic" from early members because some late amino acids can give rise to some early amino acids through well-defined pathways, which complicates some of the key assertions of the Co-Evolutionary theory.  Contrary to the Co-evolutionary theory, there is no precursor-product relationship that connects some early and late amino acids such as Glycine (Gly), early amino acid and Threonine (Thr), late amino acid. Yet, our results show new pathways that facilitate the biosynthesis of Thr from Gly and/or vice-versa. Several other such examples exist in our new updated pathways with respect to early versus late amino acid biosyntheses.   Some enzymes are distributed in the three domains (Eukarya, Bacteria, and Archaea); some appear in two domains, while six enzymes are restricted to one domain.
