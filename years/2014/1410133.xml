<AbstractNarration>The goal of this work is to address several timely questions about the analysis and interpretation of observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, with particular emphasis on observations of CMB polarization.  CMB observations provide a snapshot of the Universe at an age of a few hundred thousand years, and the spectrum of CMB temperature variations (anisotropy) contains a wealth of information, e.g., providing strong evidence that the Universe is flat, giving measurements of the amounts of dark matter and dark energy, and supporting the theory of inflation.  Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate graduate students. This is an RUI (Research at Undergraduate Institutions) proposal in which a number of undergraduate students will be introduced to and trained in developing simulations of CMB polarization telescopes for the future.  Dr. Bunn also leads regular observing nights for the public using the campus telescope.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of the activities will be undertaken, ranging from mathematical analyses, to simulations, to pedagogical expositions,and will include studies of CMB anomalies and E/B mode decomposition.</AbstractNarration>
