<AbstractNarration>This proposal will support the 2014 Space Weather Workshop to be held in Boulder, Colorado on April 8-11, 2013. This annual workshop brings together representatives of industry, academia and government to present papers and discuss issues related to space weather. This is one of the few opportunities for the broad community interested in space weather to get together.  Emphasis at the workshop is on the impacts of space weather on technology including communications, navigation, spacecraft operations and electric power. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to bringing the three communities interested in space weather together this workshop invites both undergraduate and graduate students. This provides the students with information on research developments and on how that research is relevant to operations.  Because the emphasis of the workshop is to discuss the impacts of space weather on technology and identify the operational needs for space weather forecasting it has high societal value.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Space Weather Workshop is an annual conference that addresses the remarkable diverse impacts of space weather on todayÃ†s technology, including communications, navigations, spacecraft operations, aviation, and electric power.  The Space Weather Workshop also focuses on identifying the highest priority needs for operations services that can guide future research and identifying new high-value capabilities that can be transitioned into operations.  The 2014 Space Weather Workshop was held in Boulder, Colorado, on April 8-11, 2014. It was attended by approximately 250 representatives from research centers, the commercial space weather services sector, international organizations and several federal government agencies. The workshop promotes undergraduate and graduate exposure and participation in space weather related science by inviting a select number of students to attend the workshop each year.  Attendees of the Space Weather Workshop shared information on the following key topics related to Space Weather:  The economic effects of geomagnetic storms on electric      utilities, commercial aviation services and satellite navigation systems      such as GPS. The international coordination of space weather      activities from space weather service organizations around the globe. Advances in space weather modeling, and the emerging      needs of the operational and forecasting community. The development and implementation of spacecraft and      instruments of value for both research and operations. Recent research regarding solar cycles past and present      and long term trends in space weather.   A roundtable discussion led by a panel represented by distinguished members of the public and private sector focused on improving community visibility. The discussion highlighted some of the important events and achievements across the space weather community, discussed their current status, and examined ways to collaborate for better understanding and funding.  Keynote speakers included Dr. Conrad C. Lautenbacher, Jr., Chief Executive Officer, GeoOptices, Inc, Mr. William Murtagh, Program Coordinator, NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center, Dr. Tamara L. Dickinson, Prinicipal Assistant Director for Environment and Energy, Assistant Director for Disaster Resilience and Space Science, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Executive Office of the President.  Information about the workshop and the presentations were diseminated through the following websites:  http://legacy-www.swpc.noaa.gov/sww/index.html  The workshop is important to the Nation because it brings together the space weather community to improve knowledge about space weather impacts in several areas, including communications, navigations, spacecraft operations, aviation, and electric power.
