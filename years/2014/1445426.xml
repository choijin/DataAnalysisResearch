<AbstractNarration>The PI?s hope to build hold a weeklong symposium to help develop a long-term, collegial peer network of young polar researchers (those within 5 years of receiving their doctorates) who would benefit from mentoring and other interactions with established polar scholars through a common experience at a symposium.  Participants also will receive an introduction to communication, team-building and leadership skills, and elements of interdisciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt;They expect to develop a core cadre of approximately 30 young scientists.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed symposium would build upon, and also act as a follow on to, a similar symposium organized by the PI?s during the International Polar Year, the "IPY: Next Generation Polar Research (IPY NGPR) Symposium". &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
