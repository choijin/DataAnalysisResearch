<AbstractNarration>Collisions of neutron stars and black holes are very rare events, but the enormous energies they release in gravitational waves, infrared radiation, X-rays, and gamma-rays make them potentially detectable even when very far away.  Their gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals contain information about the properties and unknown physics of the colliding objects, but to extract this information, astronomers need theoretical models to which they can compare.  For this project, computer simulations will be carried out of systems with a black hole and neutron star orbiting each other and eventually merging.  Simulations will also explore the debris commonly produced by black hole-neutron star and neutron star-neutron star mergers:  radioactive gas ejected into the surrounding space and hot, magnetized nuclear matter swirling around a black hole.  Carrying out these simulations will involve training both graduate and undergraduate students on techniques of computer modeling in relativistic astrophysics. The resulting gravitational wave and nuclear debris data will be made available to all astronomers working to detect and characterize these events.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research fills some of the most interesting remaining gaps in the modeling of inspiral, disk, and outflow phases of black hole-neutron star binary mergers using simulations with the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC), a high-accuracy numerical relativity code that now includes magnetohydrodynamics, nuclear microphysics, and neutrino cooling.  Simulations of long inspirals are used to test and improve algorithms for detecting and identifying the gravitational wave signals from such sources.  Improvements to SpEC's treatment of flows near black hole horizons enable higher-accuracy accretion disk simulations, and these are used to study the disk dynamics, gamma ray burst, energy extraction, and late-time (tenths of a second) behavior.  The project studies outflows for a wide range of binary parameters.  The evolution of ejecta far from the post-merger black hole is tracked with smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and nuclear reaction network codes using SpEC data as input, enabling predictions of fallback, kilonova brightness, and nucleosynthesis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project is part of NSF's ongoing study of binary systems made of two very compact objects (black holes or neutron stars).  When two such objects are caught in each other's gravity, they orbit, slowly spiral closer as they give off gravitational waves, and eventually merge. The "spiral closer" part is often the most important for gravitational waves.  If at least one of the objects is a neutron star, its structure will leave a potentially detectable imprint on the gravitational wave signal. However, it is only after the merger--when two neutron stars crash or a neutron star is torn apart by the gravity of the other neutron star or black hole--that systems with neutron stars become dramatically different from two black holes merging.  Gas is flung out into space, undergoing nuclear reactions as it transforms from the exotic matter of a neutron star into the heavier elements sprinkled throughout the universe.  The gas that doesn't escape heats through shocks to billions of degress, swirling around the central mass at large fractions of the speed of light.  Turbulent motions in the debris produce some of the strongest magnetic fields in the universe. Do these violent events proceed the way we expect, given the laws of physics as we know them, laws that are poorly tested if at all in these extreme regimes?  To answer this question, we must have both observations of compact neutron star binary mergers and accompanying theoretical predictions.  Infrared and gamma ray transients powered by these events may well have already been observed, and we hope that gravitational waves will soon give us a more direct probe.  For predictions of the merger and its aftermath, only numerical simulations will do.  This was one of the NSF-funded projects that produced such simulations.  Now, a little bit about this project in particular.  We produced some high-accuracy black hole-neutron star simulations to study those imprints of the neutron star on the late inspiral waveform.  (They had to be high-accuracy because these effects are small.)  We've been using this to test the accuracy of a couple families of simplified analytic models of the sort LIGO could actually use for analyzing gravitational wave signals.  The results have been generally reassuring but are also prompting some improvements to the models.  Most of our efforts have gone into studying the post-merger dynamics.  Ongoing code improvements have allowed us to study matter ejected into space from the torn-apart neutron star with increasing accuracy.  Black hole-neutron star mergers can produce particularly copious ejecta.  We have looked at how its properties depend on the masses of the neutron star and black hole, on the spin axis of the black hole, and on the assumed properties of the neutron star matter.  For several cases, we have used the matter ejection in our 3D simulations as input for a separate nuclear reactions calculation to find what elements are produced.  This study found a subtle effects caused by the ejecta absorbing neutrinos from the central region even when fairly far away.  Neutrinos have a bigger effect on the hot gas orbiting the post-merger black hole.  Their emission is one main source of cooling.  (The flow of hot matter into the black hole is the other.)  Heating is provided by shocks as the gas into a smooth, symmetric torus, and also by turbulent effects related to the magnetic field.  We gave a great deal of attention in this project to how these effects balance each other.  The effect of magnetic fields on the heat budget is surpisingly small in the early, most energetic phase of the post-merger (the first 40 milliseconds).  Heating from turbulence is balanced by cooling from increased flow into the black hole.  This early phase, dominated by gas falling back onto the torus and the torus smoothing rather than ''classical'' accretion disk behavior, may make an important contribution to the energy release. We have also investigated binaries made of two neutron stars.  We have concentrated on low-mass systems, for which the stars merge into a hot, rapidly spinning, massive but stable single neutron star.  We have looked in particular at the neutrinos radiated by the hot gas.  This information is being used to study interesting particle physics effects in the vicinity of neutron star mergers, such as neutrino-antineutrino annihilations and neutrino flavor oscillations, that might influence gamma ray bursts or nucleosynthesis in outflows.
