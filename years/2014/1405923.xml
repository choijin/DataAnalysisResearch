<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a three year standard collaborative award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site program at the University of Dayton (UD), Central State University (CSU), and Wright State University (WSU) entitled, "Collaborative Research: Collaborative RET Site-Inspiring Next Generation High-skilled Workforce in Advanced Manufacturing and Materials", under the direction of Dr. Margaret Pinnell, Dr. Leanne Petry, and Dr. Ahsan Mian. The University of Dayton will serve as the lead institution on this collaborative Site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Site will target teachers from Ohio Region 10 districts eligible for School Improvement Support, and from partner schools (Dayton Early College Academy (DECA) and Dayton Regional STEM School (DRSS). After participation in this RET, teachers will continue their professional development through ongoing engagement with the PIs at all three institutions and the DRSC and will be prepared for leadership roles in their K-12 setting.  Participants will achieve long-term collaborative partnerships with the university research community, engineering professionals, and the DRSC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have a significant impact on the Dayton area and the engineering community nationwide by promoting engineering in K-12 STEM curriculum and recruiting teachers from high-needs and urban schools. It will also strengthen regional partnerships and collaborative relationships that support both STEM education at all levels and advanced manufacturing and materials development.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new era of manufacturing will require highly skilled STEM professionals. As such, educators need to inspire youth to pursue STEM disciplines. This collaborative RET Site will leverage and sustain a prior UD RET Site and provide a total of 54 in-service and pre-service middle and high school STEM teachers, 18 per year over three years, with an intensive and transformative six week real world research experience that is thematically centered on materials and advanced manufacturing, a regional strength and economic cluster. The Site will facilitate this immersion by placing teachers  teachers with research mentors at one of the three participating universities to work on projects that connect with regional strengths in advanced manufacturing and materials. The RET experience will be enhanced through a materials boot camp, industry and laboratory tours and extensive interaction with a wide variety of STEM professionals through the Dayton Regional Stem Center (DRSC).</AbstractNarration>

Inspiring the Next Generation of a Highly-Skilled Workforce in Advanced Manufacturing and Materials project leveraged a well-established partnership among Central State University (CSU), the University of Dayton (UD) and Wright State University (WSU), as well as regional strengths in advanced manufacturing and materials to provide a transformational professional development experience for 54 current and future teachers, and nine undergraduate Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) students. In collaboration with faculty mentors, the participants engaged in engineering research thematically centered on advanced manufacturing and materials on one of the three university campuses.&nbsp; Examples of some of these research projects include assessing the properties of 3D printed polymers, testing ceramics for cookstoves in developing countries, polymer development from natural products, dye production from natural and synthetic materials, and many more. Additionally, the teacher participants designed, piloted and published nine STEM lessons on the TeachEngineering Digital library where teachers from across the United States can freely access and use the lessons. The curriculum was designed to increase student engagement in STEM, and promote workforce development, particularly in the area of advanced manufacturing and materials. &nbsp;This collaborative professional development effort included many community building and professional development activities, engaged a large stakeholder community, including numerous industrial and Department of Defense partners in the region.&nbsp; Through this experience, the teacher participants gained a better understanding of the engineering profession and materials and advanced manufacturing, as well as increased confidence in teaching STEM subjects, and increased expectation of their students? achievement in science and mathematics. &nbsp;As such, the teachers are better equipped to encourage their students to pursue engineering careers, particularly in high need areas such as advanced manufacturing.&nbsp; The RET project leveraged and expanded existing partnerships, and developed new
