<AbstractNarration>Climate models project higher temperatures, more variability in precipitation, and more extreme weather events in the future. Under such changing environments, foundation plant species, which promote stable conditions for other species and support fundamental ecosystem processes, may benefit from microbial partners that enhance plant survival during climate extremes. However, whether microbial partners can help buffer ecosystems against climate change remains unknown. This research investigates a widespread, but poorly known, group of fungi that commonly grow in the roots of dominant forage grasses. The project determines how the benefits of these fungi vary along gradients of drought and heat stress, differ among grass species, and shift across geographic regions. This work has high promise for identifying fungi that help plants survive and grow in stressful climates. Together, this team will integrate research activities into a new high school teacher training program that focuses on underserved communities and a set of laboratory modules for middle school workshops. Results will shed new light on the functions of microbial partners in maintaining grassland and rangeland productivity, improving the ability to conserve, manage, and restore these important areas in future climates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deeper insight into the biology of root endophytes has the potential to transform understanding of how plants respond to drought and heat in the same way that studies on mycorrhizal fungi overturned paradigms about how plants acquire nutrients. This project tests whether root-associated fungi benefit dominant grassland plant species, which may moderate the loss of net primary production during droughts and heat waves. The work addresses the following questions: (1) What is the relative importance of host species identity versus geographic and climatic gradients in explaining variation in symbiont abundance and composition? (2) How strongly do host species identity and geographic origin influence the magnitude of symbiont benefits across gradients of heat and drought stress? (3) Can symbiont-mediated amelioration of stress be generalized from laboratory settings to predict outcomes in the field? Activities include field surveys along latitudinal gradients, next-generation high-throughput sequencing of root fungi, development of a large fungal culture collection, multi-factor greenhouse trials that manipulate drought and heat, and field tests that leverage existing, large, cross-site rainfall experiments. Novel aspects of this project include characterizing root-associated fungal composition along latitudinal gradients, testing the hypothesis that symbioses become more beneficial to plants under increased abiotic stress, and determining how endophytic root fungi affect plant hosts under field conditions.</AbstractNarration>

While contributing front-line data to a larger research project, high school teachers and undergraduates participated in research academy that trained teachers in contemporary instructional techniques using easily available tools in the field of microbial ecology.  Additionally, research workshops for undergraduates took place in both summer of 2018 and again in 2019 at Western New Mexico University (WNMU).  Among the projects developed by undergraduates included an assessment of soil pH on root-associated fungal colonization, and work to develop a workbook to be disseminated among high school teachers and undergraduate researchers to help calibrate some of the frequently used techniques of incipient fungal ecologists using fungi as experimental models.  During the workshops WNMU undergraduate students participated in a 9- or 10-week series of activities that allowed them to practice some of the essential research skills in the laboratory and the field.  Both initiatives yielded publishable data, primarily using microscopic techniques to visualize fungal colonization on roots of dominant grass species at over 24 sites across the central part of the United States.  The research portion of the collaborative project (led by researchers at University of New Mexico, Kansas State University and Western Illinois University) determined how benefits of these root-associated fungi vary along gradients of drought and heat stress, are host specific and fluctuate across the sampled sites.  Collectively, the results filled key knowledge gaps and suggests that fungal endophytes are useful to help grasses survive and grow in stressful environments.
