<AbstractNarration>The Asian Technology Information Program (ATIP) will organize a full-day workshop that explores the Japanese research efforts towards next-generation extreme computing at the SC14 international conference to be held in November 2014 in New Orleans. The workshop has been accepted and is a part of the SC14 workshop series. A full copy of the workshop proceedings will be available through the ATIP website at and/or the Association of Computer Machinery (ACM) Digital Library.  ATIP's workshop  contributes to improving a general understanding of Japanese research approaches towards high performance computing (HPC) at scale.  The workshop also facilitates  discussion between government agencies and HPC scientists and vendors at an international level, which could stimulate new directions of research and practical use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop brings together top scientists and graduate students from both the US and Japan (supported by Japanese government) to form connections that may lead to future research collaborations or cooperative commercialization efforts for practical HPC applications.</AbstractNarration>

The workshop entailed presentations, posters, and panel discussions by Japanese researchers from universities, government laboratories, and industry, addressing topics such as Japan's national plans for next-generation computing as well as recent achievements of the most significant hardware and software research.   Intellectual Merit  ATIPÆs workshop contributed intellectually to the international field of HPC by addressing a number of challenges that are of sufficient difficulty that it will take concerted efforts by many scientists to address them.  Inevitably, advancements in extreme computing will require international cooperation. ATIP's workshop helped start a dialogue between participants from government agencies, HPC scientists, and vendors at the international level with hopes of stimulating new directions of research and practical use in this field.  Broader Impact  ATIPÆs workshop brought together the top scientists and graduate students in the field of HPC from both the US and Asia with the aim to stimulate relationships between participants that will lead to future research collaborations and signfiicant achievements, particularly in the area of future extreme-scale computing systems and applications.
