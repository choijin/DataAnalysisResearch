<AbstractNarration>This proposal provides support for the 2014 Workshop on the Economics of Information Security (WEIS). WEIS fosters cross-disciplinary, cross-sector (i.e., academia, industry, nonprofit, and government), and cross-national discussion on information security. The focus on the economics of information security was chosen not only because of its intrinsic importance, but also because of its basis for bringing together social, computer, and information scientists and engineers to share knowledge, information and methods from their respective domains. WEIS covers issues that are core to the NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, and spans both the Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE) Directorates within the Foundation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All funds from this grant will go towards supporting undergraduate and graduate student attendance at the WEIS conference, to be held at Penn State University in University Park, Pennsylvania, on June 23-24 2014.</AbstractNarration>
