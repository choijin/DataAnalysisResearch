<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supercomputing (SC), the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis is an annual event established in 1988 by the Association for Computing Machinery and the IEEE Computer Society. In 2012, approximately 10,000 people participated in the conference. The conference attracts students and professionals from computer and computational science fields from throughout the world with a large concentration of participants from the United States. The conference has been located in a variety of U.S. locations most recently in 2013 in Denver, Colorado.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past 13 years, the SC conference series committee has reached out to people in the U.S. who have been traditionally under-represented in the main tracks of SC (African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, women, and people with disabilities), initially through the Minority Serving Institution, then the Minority Outreach and since 2007 the Broader Engagement (BE) programs. The BE program has enjoyed a successful track record at introducing High Performance Computing and related technologies to a wide audience. The program's recent focus has been to build a stronger bridge between the broader engagement program and the SC main technical track, thus strengthening the SC commitment to reaching out to underrepresented groups by promoting their full participation in main tracks of the SC conference series, advancing their professional preparation, and providing important experiences presenting research at a major conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will enable past BE participants to become more involved with the main technical track of the conference by providing training for their submission to the technical program poster session. Past Broader Engagement participants will be encouraged to submit proposals for participation in this two-day workshop. The workshop will include training and discussion on how to organize research results, on available SC resources and on successful poster submission and, consequently, a successful poster presentation. The workshop will also include working sessions in which participants will prepare draft submissions and receive feedback on their submissions. Each participant will be expected to leave the workshop with a draft poster submission that can be finalized and then submitted through the SC14 Poster Submissions application.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Background  Supercomputing (SC), the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis, is an annual event established in 1988 by the Association for Computing Machinery and the IEEE Computer Society. In 2012, approximately 10,000 people participated in the conference.  The conference attracts students and professionals from computer and computational science fields from around the world with a large concentration of participants from the United States.  The conference has been located in a variety of U.S. locations, such as New Orleans, LA, Austin, TX, and Salt Lake City, UT.   Over the past 15 years, the SC conference series committee has reached out to people in the U.S. who have been traditionally underrepresented in the main technical tracks of SC, including African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, women, and people with disabilities. This outreach initially occurred through the Minority Serving Institution, then the Minority Outreach and since 2007 the Broader Engagement (BE) programs.  The BE program has enjoyed a successful track record introducing High Performance Computing and related technologies to a wide audience.  The program?s recent focus has been to build a stronger bridge between the Broader Engagement program and the SC main technical track. Vision &amp; Overall Goal   The vision of this project was to help past Broader Engagement participants to get more involved with the main technical track of the conference by training and assisting with their submission to the technical program poster session. The training was designed to improve the overall quality of the submissions, which directly impacts acceptance rates. The training also highlighted and built upon state-of-the-art research being presented at SC conferences.   The overall goal of this project was to increase participation of Broader Engagement participants in the main technical track of future SC conference series.  Specifically, this project focused on increasing the number of BE participants who propose poster submissions, gain acceptance, and present their posters.  We aimed to demonstrate the critical nature of bringing this diverse group of participants to the SC technical conversation.  Recruitment &amp; Application Review   Past Broader Engagement participants were recruited to submit proposals for participation in this two-day workshop. The application process solicited participants that aspired to prepare and submit posters to the SC15 Technical program.   Thirty-one applications were received.  Fifty percent of the participants are female, 17 percent Black or African American, 33 percent Hispanic, and 17 percent with a disability status. Workshop Description   The workshop included discussion on available SC resources as well as training on proper organization of research results for a poster presentation, and elements of a successful poster submission and consequently a successful poster presentation. In the intense two-day session, students were pushed to fine-tune their posters and abstracts to create a more compelling presentation for the SC15 selection committees. Various members of Lawrence Berkeley National Lab came to the session to critique the posters and offer advice and feedback to the participants. Led by Dr. Tony Drummond and Dr. Mary Ann Leung, students also participated in poster blitz sessions in order to fine-tune their presentation skills.  A working dinner allowed participants to get to know each other outside of the classroom, while continuing their discussions on research and preparing presentations. Each participant left the workshop with a draft poster submission that was submitted through the SC15 Poster Submissions application. Results and Conclusions   This project fulfilled its goal by directly impacting the broadening of computing and computational science participants.  The project increased the participation in a major technical conference of people traditionally underrepresented in the field and provided important and meaningful mentoring and professional development opportunities.   One hundred percent of participants in the SC15 Poster Workshop completed surveys after the event. Responses were overwhelmingly positive with no negative marks on any question. According the participant answers many felt that the workshop helped them better organize and prepare their poster submissions for SC15. Ninety-three percent of respondents indicated that their short term and long-term scientific aspirations changed as a result of the workshop.  An important result of the workshop was that one of the participants was in-fact selected to present in the SC15 Technical Poster Session.  The funding from this grant supported the participant?s travel to SC15 to present his poster.  Additional remaining funds were used to support other workshop participants? attendance at SC15.          Last Modified: 11/02/2016       Submitted by: Maryann Leung]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
