<AbstractNarration>The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and the University of Utah (U Utah) are pursuing a Phase II renewal of the multi-institution I/UCRC for Hybrid Multicore Productivity Research (CHMPR). CHMPR, in Phase II, plans to focus on problems of national priority such as Big Data Analytics for Health IT, Climate Change, Brain and Pluripotent Cell Imaging, Material Genomics and the Human Imagination. It will conduct research to optimize the scalability, performance and productivity of applications to Interactive Digital Media and Data Intensive Parallel Computing Paradigms which are all of direct relevance to industry advisory board members on hybrid multicore clusters. CHMPR will contribute towards development of efficient hybrid multicore computational science applications. It will improve the understanding of constrained parallel processing algorithms, and provide academic researchers access to large hybrid multicore systems to address the challenges in obtaining peak performance of applications on these architectures. CHMPR will further assist in addressing these challenges by providing fundamental understanding of the numerical formulation, structure of the applications and the ability to map known single threaded algorithms from multiple processors onto the underlying hybrid multicore architectures under limitations on local processor memory, and cache. The combined computing facilities at UMBC, UCSD and U Utah respectively, will offer industry advisory board members access to university testbeds consisting of some of the most advanced and diverse computing technologies and Big Data sets in Health and Climate. There is a large demand to explore the application and scalability of such hybrid multicore architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHMPR will provide faculty and students the opportunity to gain hands-on research expertise in a wide variety of hybrid multicore applications in areas of Health, Climate Change, Biomedical Informatics, 3-D Graphic Environments and the use of Social Media for Disaster mitigation. By addressing the future needs of industry advisory board members as the computer industry evolves its hybrid multicore processor technology, the center will contribute towards US leadership in HPC. CHMPR sites will incorporate hybrid multicore computing into their core course curricula for students to address the industry applications. The students will also have the opportunity for internships with industry and the center will educate students how to take advantage of the parallelism offered by tens of thousands of multicore processors to solve a variety of applications.</AbstractNarration>
