<AbstractNarration>The team has developed a new thin-film deposition technology for high-performance materials that is low energy, scalable, and potentially low cost. They recently reported via publication the formation of complex oxide perovskites in single crystalline hetero-epitaxial form and also specifically BiFeO3 in phase-pure polycrystalline form on SiO2/Si. This is important because the new technology enables production of a simple perovskite Pb-free single-crystal functional complex oxide films with crystalline quality, nanoscale control, and physical properties comparable to those obtained using much more expensive tools and processes. This technology could also be highly enabling in that it utilizes atomic layer deposition, thereby permitting conformal growth on high surface area per unit volume structures, and therefore a three- dimensional architecture may be realized. Replacement of Pb with Bi in these film structures gives a ferroelectric polarization with a larger charge per unit area, potentially enabling enhancements in device performance (e.g. non-volatile memory, wireless communications, and capacitors for energy storage). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scaling and the roadmap is currently limited by MOCVD (and ALD) using lead zirconate titanate (PZT) because of inhomogeneities in Zr and Ti that result in nanoscale conformally-coated 3D structures that result in unacceptable variations in properties/performance. Thus, a process that uses a simple perovskite material would address this issue, particularly if it can outperform PZT. The customer need also relates to a technology that can deliver reduction in the use and waste disposal of Pb and Pb-based precursors, reduction in manufacturing cost through innovations in thin film deposition and process technology to reduce precursor waste, and an opportunity to increase the performance of existing technologies through a replacement material that has higher FE polarization (and therefore induced charge) and a process technology that is truly compatible with finer 3D nanoscale architectures to support scaling to future nodes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF Innovation-Corps (I-Corps) project supported investigation of the commercialization opportunity for new thin-film growth and processing technology arising from prior university research supported by the Division of Materials Research of the NSF.   A three-member I-Corps team participated in the Lean LaunchpadTM course as part of the 2014 Bay Area cohort.  Guided by the course instructors and using the Business Canvas model, the team proposed, assessed and validated/invalidated hypotheses regarding commercialization and market potential of the technology.  This was accomplished through a series of interview meetings with US- and internationally-based industry and other stakeholders involved in electronic device and process design, manufacturing, and technology integration.  In addition, study of the evolution of film chemical composition, atomic structure, and impurity content with annealing temperature was performed.  The results, as presented in peer-reviewed publications and technical conferences, demonstrate that films of high-quality can be obtained using lower temperatures of film growth and annealing.  Chemically complex oxide film materials have many current and potential applications, e.g., in electronics for memory, logic, sensing, medicine and health, mobile communications, and security, but require high-temperatures in their manufacturing. The technology examined in this NSF I-Corps project points to a new, more manufacturing-scalable and lower-temperature approach, with potential for breakthroughs in performance and in reduced cost. The I-Corps project activities facilitated the formation of research and development industrial partnerships expected to help advance the technology.  The project also resulted in the launch of a start-up company in 2015 to pursue development and commercialization.
