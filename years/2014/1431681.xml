<AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative project involving the American Association of Physics Teachers (Award DUE-1431638), Brigham Young University (Award DUE-1431454), the University of Maryland at College Park (Award DUE-1431681), and the University of Colorado at Boulder (Award DUE-1431779).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most new college and university STEM faculty members begin their first teaching assignments with little or no experience with methods of effective pedagogy. Consequently, both they and their students are often frustrated when the students do not seem to learn what the faculty members think they are teaching. To address this problem in physics and astronomy, the American Association of Physics Teachers, the American Astronomical Society, and the American Physical Society propose to continue a successful series of Physics and Astronomy Faculty Workshops focusing on effective pedagogy, building on what has been learned during the previous series of workshops. During the course of the new five-year project, the workshops will work with about 900 four-year college and university faculty members (about 50% of the new tenure-track hires in physics and astronomy in the United States), who collectively teach more than 100,000 students each year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three new components will be added to the program of workshops:  (1) a permanent set of Experienced Faculty Workshops aimed at more senior faculty members; (2) a series of virtual Faculty Learning Communities (FLCs), which will provide coaching and feedback for the workshop participants as they implement interactive-engagement teaching methods; and (3) a research program focusing on the most effective ways to implement the FLCs and developing a more systematic understanding of the workshops themselves. Items (2) and (3) will directly address the "implementation dip" that occurs for faculty considering the use of new pedagogy. The dip has been documented in almost all STEM faculty workshops. Although the current physics and astronomy workshops have been successful in developing knowledge about effective pedagogy and the evidence for its effectiveness, and in inspiring the participants to implement those pedagogies, the evaluations also show that the faculty members are not always persistent in implementing those pedagogies. The new project is designed to enhance the implementation of what the participants learn in the workshops and to add to the knowledge base of what constitutes effective pedagogical professional development for physics and astronomy faculty. The same methods should be broadly applicable to faculty members in other STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by four NSF programs:&lt;br/&gt;* Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE), Division of Undergraduate Education, Directorate for Education and Human Resources;&lt;br/&gt;* Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), Division of Human Resource Development, Directorate for Education and Human Resources;&lt;br/&gt;* Education and Interdisciplinary Research (EIR), Division of Physics, Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences; and&lt;br/&gt;* Education and Special Programs (ESP), Division of Astronomical Sciences, Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

This investigation bridges two important kinds of scholarly work: developing powerful explanatory theories of faculty learning and pragmatically linking these theoretical insights to the design learning environments. We developed an observational tool (known as the Real-time Professional Development Observation Tool (R-PDOT)) for documenting and visualizing the interactivity of workshops, and theoretical models for how the design of workshops impacts faculty's learning. These tools and models have offered formative feedback to change agents regarding how to support instructors in their transformation efforts. Other researchers and evaluators are using (or adapting) the R-PDOT based on scripts we have made available through GitHub (</span><a href="https://github.com/aliceolmstead/R-PDOT-files"><span>https://github.com/aliceolmstead/R-PDOT-files</span></a><span>). Our work on this project resulted in 7 invited talks, 15 contributed presentations, 1 PhD dissertation, 2 full-length journal articles in </span><span>Phys. Rev. PER </span><span>(Olmstead &amp; Turpen, 2017; Olmstead &amp; Turpen, 2016), and 3 peer-reviewed conference proceedings papers (Turpen, Little &amp; Sawtelle, 2017; Turpen, Olmstead, &amp; Jardine, 2016; Olmstead &amp; Turpen, 2015).&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Our research with the R-PDOT revealed that 2014 and early 2015 NFW faculty participants had few opportunities to engage in small group discussions or open-discussion, and that most sessions were primarily lecture-based with a significant focus on building awareness of instructional strategies. We found that faculty had limited opportunities to analyze instructional practices and make new instructional materials. In the late 2015 NFW implementations, we documented an increase in opportunities for participants to analyze instructional practices and make new instructional materials. This was largely achieved through the addition of a workshop session involving classroom video analysis and another set of sessions directed at building, implementing, and critiquing in-class conceptual questions. The R-PDOT successfully captured how these sessions had both a different focus and format than previous sessions and provided workshop leaders with a new way of seeing and reflecting on their sessions.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr"><span>In developing conjectures about workshop design, we focused on key characteristics of workshop leader's facilitation moves and faculty talk in order to provide practical insights to workshop leaders. Through our analysis of faculty talk in NFW sessions, we found that faculty can both engage in "pedagogical sense-making" (i.e., articulating plausible implications of instructional choices for student engagement) or "doing school" (i.e., simply going through the motions without seeking to understand the underlying pedagogical reasoning behind instructional strategies they engage with). We find evidence that workshop leader facilitation choices that focus exclusively on promoting the adoption of prescribed strategies, do not attend to the quality of faculty collaboration, and do not create space for reflection can lead to faculty "doing school", while facilitation choices that invite faculty to consider adaptations of instructional strategies, model desirable pedagogy, and create space for reflection can promote pedagogical sense-making. In addition to establishing robust design conjectures, we have developed (1) a detailed set of facilitation moves that illustrates how workshop facilitators can encourage pedagogical sense-making within workshops, and (2) a set of engagement markers (adapted from the literature) that workshop leaders can use to recognize when faculty may be simply "doing school" within workshops. Workshop facilitators can consider these characteristics to better understand how to promote and sustain rich discussions in sessions, and designers can consider how to create space for these rich discussions to occur within a workshop schedule more broadly.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr"><span>This project also launched a pilot investigation of faculty's ways of reasoning about equity in physics education. We argue that grappling with inequities in physics learning is a central responsibility of physics instructors, yet little is known about how faculty do this important work. In our pilot study, we interviewed NFW participants and uncovered how some faculty notice inequities in their own classrooms and listen carefully to students' experiences with injustices. We found that some faculty consistently reason within an "equity frame" where they are "prone to notice and question patterns of educational outcomes, and they are also more likely to view inequalities in the context of a history of exclusions, discrimination, and educational apartheid" (Bensimon, 2005, pg. 102). Our analyses identified the following reasoning pathways: (1) noticing as inspiring reflection and actions to shift inequitable classroom dynamics, (2) noticing as inspiring reinterpretation of self and critique of physics culture, (3) student stories inspiring faculty to link up students with institutional resources, and (4) student stories inspiring faculty to critique institutional practices. We argue that faculty's listening and noticing not only supports faculty learning, but also has the potential to impact students and the systems that students are embedded in (i.e., physics culture and institutional structures).&nbsp; The peer-reviewed conference proceedings paper (Turpen, Little, &amp; Sawtelle, 2017) sharing these research results was recognized as notable paper award by the PER Leadership Council.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/04/2019<br>      Modified by: Chandra&nbsp;Turpen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1431681/1431681_10336127_1575478020117_ScreenShot2019-12-03at12.20.50PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1431681/1431681_10336127_1575478020117_ScreenShot2019-12-03at12.20.50PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Timeline representation of type of engagement and focus of engagement over time"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1431681/1431681_10336127_1575478020117_ScreenShot2019-12-03at12.20.50PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Timeline representation of type of engagement and focus of engagement over time"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">These representations convey a timeline of events within a particular workshop session.
