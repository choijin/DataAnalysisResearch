<AbstractNarration>Optogenetics is rapidly altering how scientists reveal the basic operation of the brain circuits that are central to sensation, action, and  cognition. The vast majority of optogenetic studies to date have primarily capitalized on the genetic side of optogenetics taking advantage of the specificity of gene expression to&lt;br/&gt;control and image unique cell types and connections in the brain. However, precise spatial&lt;br/&gt;control of the illuminating light affords an additional dimension of specificity that has been underutilized, partly owing to the challenges posed by the scattering properties of brain tissue. Recent and future work in multi-photon imaging and structured illumination, combined  with alternative approaches such as micron scale, implantable illumination devices promise to open up whole new avenues of research to understand the elementary basis of neural computation, sensory coding, and neural defects in brain diseases such as autism, schizophrenia, and  epilepsy. There will a focus at this  meeting:on  advances in structured illumination, ultrafast imaging  and local implantable illumination devices, to control neural activity at brain depths beyond the limits of multi-photon microscopy. Invitees will present their recent advances, and also discuss the major outstanding challenges in this field and how to surmount these&lt;br/&gt;challenges to develop the necessary technologies that will unlock fundamental aspects of brain function and disease.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ OSA's goal for the Spatially Precise Optogenetics at Depth Incubator Meeting was to focus on the development of optical approaches that will radically improve the spatial and temporal resolution with which we can manipulate and monitor neural activity optogenetically.   Participants discussed recent advances, major outstanding challenges in this field and how to surmount these challenges to develop the necessary technologies that will unlock fundamental aspects of brain function and disease. The hosts, Hillel Adesnik, University of California, Berkeley; Shy Shoham, Technion &ndash; Israel Institute of Technology; and Laura Waller, University of California, Berkeley brought together an outstanding array of experts including physicists, neuroscientists and engineers. In attendance were over 40 engaged participants from industry, government and academia including students. The meeting was developed as part of OSAÃ†s effort to explore the role of optics in the US based BRAIN Initiative which is looking to map the brain and develop a better understanding of, and treatment for, disorders such as AlzheimerÃ†s, ParkinsonÃ†s, and autism as well as treat traumatic brain injury. We had several key figures participating including Prem Kumar (DARPA) and Chis Xu (Cornell), as well as Francesco Pavone from European Laboratory for Non-Linear Spectroscopy in Italy who is focused on the EU Human Brain Project.  The meeting also piqued the interest of the press. NPR attended parts of the meeting and interviewed a few of the attendees featured their findings in an NPR "All Things Considered" segment.  This meeting produced the fertile ground that led to an OSA special session at the 2014 Optics in Life Science Congress which has now grown into topical meeting, Optics and the Brain that will be held at the Life Sciences Congress in April 2015. Optics &amp; Photonics News (OPN), with an 18,500 circulation also feature a well-received article with results from the Spatially Precise Optogenetics at Depth Incubator Meeting.
