<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in demonstrating the commercial implementation of NBD Nanotechnologies, Inc.'s (NBD) Enhanced Condensation Coating. NBD's external surface coating sustains dropwise condensation on copper-based tubes, resulting in energy savings and increased efficiency for industrial condensers in steam power and thermal desalination plants. NBD's innovative and proprietary techniques ensure adhesion onto the substrate while not compromising the thermal resistance with the coating's sub-microscale thickness. NBD has validated the increased efficiency of its external surface condenser coating technology at a lab-scale and will carry out pilot tests to quantify the efficiency gain and technology durability at a system-level in industrial condensers, as requested by utility customers. NBD presents a technology that addresses the key commercial bottlenecks of durability, scalability and performance, which have stymied coatings in condensers, presenting a leapfrogging technology that addresses the water-energy nexus. Every 1% improvement in power plant efficiency results in $10MM revenue per plant per year, as stated by a partnering power generation company. Thus, any improvement in the efficiency of a steam condenser has significant impact that directly benefits both global energy and water sustainability efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project contributes to R&amp;D advancement focused on: large-scale chemical and coating processing, surface wettability, nano-and micro-scale heat transfer, condensation, and water and energy resource sustainability. The project's multidisciplinary nature reflects the dynamic aspects of condensation heat transfer phenomenon, which covers varying length scales (nano, micro, meso and macro scale) and time scales. Thus, the challenging nature of optimizing and sustaining enhanced condensation invites innovative and creative solutions to mitigate the water and energy resource management problems. During Phase I, the project demonstrated the proof of concept of the coating's condensation enhancement for both industrial condensers with pure steam (and trace amounts of non-condensable gases) and for HVAC/dehumidification systems where condensation occurs with higher concentrations of non-condensable gases. The objective of phase II proposal is to address and facilitate the required steps for scaling up and integrating NBD's condenser coating into industrial condensers' supply chain. NBD has identified industrial condensers as its primary entry market, where a greater increase in condenser system performance and savings in cost and fuel consumption can be reached. NBD has been establishing partnerships for pilot studies to perform larger scale experimental tests to validate its technology's performance, durability and system-level efficiency gains empirically.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NBD Nanotechnologies, Inc.  NSF SBIR Phase II   Award:  1456339  PI:  Dr. Jonathan Rosen     NBD has introduced a new family of Advanced Condensation Nanomaterials specifically designed to enhance the heat transfer coefficient of copper alloy condenser tubes with a durable, scalable coating system.     NBD has licensed the parent technology from UNLV and has internally developed and optimized a proprietary, two-step coating process that includes a novel method to covalently bond an organic hydrophobic coating to copper-based substrates resulting in strong adhesion of the polymer to the substrate.  Additional patent applications are pending.     NBD?s Advanced Condensation Nanomaterials have been shown in laboratory tests to increase the external condensation heat transfer rate by up to 150% for coated copper pipes in pure steam environments, compared to an uncoated pipe for a subcooling of 5&deg;C at 19-29inHga. The enhanced heat transfer performance has been experimentally demonstrated for at least 500hrs of operation.  (1)     NBD Nanotechnologies? NSF SBIR Phase II grant has supported our evaluation of these coatings in a fully operational steam power plant environment. Two alternative proprietary coating technologies were developed to evaluate various concentrations and application techniques (labelled "A" and "B") and have been compared to adjacent uncoated tubes in ten locations along the operating condenser tube sheet. (Figure 1)     Moving from a laboratory-based simulation to a full-scale operating power plant presented a wide range of experimental, operational, and logistical challenges.  With the full cooperation of the power plant management and operations staff, NBD was able to scale the coating process to prepare 30-foot Admiralty Brass condenser tubes, install these coated and control tubes at selected locations on the tube sheet, and instrument each study tube with multiple temperature and flow measurement sensors. (Figures 2, 3, and 4)     Data has been recorded from each tube, several times each minute, for over 12,000 hours along with data about the overall load on the power plant, water temperature, and other plant operating conditions.   We intend to continue to collect data through the end of the first half of 2018.     Preliminary analysis of the data set has confirmed our initial laboratory findings that condenser tubes coated with NBD Advanced Condensation Nanomaterials are able to enhance the heat transfer coefficient (U) by 15-30% over uncoated tubes and maintain that improvement consistently for more than 12,000 hours of power plant operation.      Based on this pioneering study, made possible by the NSF SBIR Phase II grant, NBD Nanotechnologies has entered into a commercial license to establish a full-scale industrial coating process.   NBD?s commercial partner will provide coated condenser tubes incorporating NBD Advanced Condensation Nanomaterials to power plants as part of their routine manufacturing procedures.
