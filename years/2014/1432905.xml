<AbstractNarration>ACM MobiHoc conference is the leading international conference on the theory and practice of mobile multi-hop wireless networks. It invites research contributions addressing the challenges in the area of multi-hop wireless networks, ranging from cognitive radio networks to ad hoc networks. The conference features a high-quality technical program, with an acceptance rate of around 10% out of around 250 submissions. It has a single-track session, which offers significant opportunities for individual and small groups that foster technical and social interactions among a diverse set of participants. MobiHoc is also an international conference that stimulates exchanges between various international research communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will help increase the representation and participation of United States-based students at the conference by providing 20 or more travel grants limited to a maximum of $750 each. By creating new opportunities for graduate students, especially those from under-represented groups, to attend a high-quality conference, this award will benefit the students by giving them an opportunity to interact with world-class researchers, inspire them to try new research directions, providing mentoring opportunities, as well as the chance to seek out internships and post-doctoral positions which will help the students advance in their research career.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2014 ACM MobiHoc (International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing) was held in Philadelphia, PA from August 18 to August 21, 2014. This preeminent technical conference is dedicated to addressing challenges emerging from wireless ad hoc networking and mobile computing, and is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the field.  This project provide travel funding and partially supported 17 graduate students in the United States to attend this premier conference. The travel awards provide good opportunity for graduate students, especially women and underrepresented minority students, to attend conferences, since it is an important part of their educational experience, and they often have limited travel funds.  Intellectual Merit:  The travel awards enabled 17 graduate students, in particular, two women and two underrepresented minority students, to attend the MobiHoc 2014 conferences. Participation in leading conferences is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to be exposed to leading edge work and to interact with more senior researchers. In the area of mobile computing and networking, Mobihoc is one of the few such leading conferences. The support made possible the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend.  Broader Impacts:  Attending conferences such as MobiHoc is of paramount importance for the development of graduate students. The 17 supported participants presented their work, attended panel and keynote sessions, and interacted with hundreds of others performing leading-edge research in the field of mobile computing and networking. The students received education from attending the technical sessions of MobiHoc, mentoring through the interaction with senior researchers, and networking opportunities through numerous different conference activities. The participation of these students in Mobihoc will have an important impact on their development as a junior researcher.  The grant also promotes diversity by encouraging and enabling women and other underrepresented minorities to participate. The student participants of MobiHoc 2014 will help to facilitate further adoption of the mobile computing and networking solutions presented in this conference, which in turn benefits the society with increased productivity and convenience.
