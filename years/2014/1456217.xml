<AbstractNarration>The body of a plant is made of just a few repeatedly produced structures, such as leaves and stems. However, these structures can vary tremendously in their shape both within an individual and between different species in predictable, consistent ways. This variation in shape is controlled by a combination of cell division and cell shape, which in turn must be controlled by variation in gene expression. The proposed research seeks to determine how complex shapes arise through development and the genes that control these processes. Thus this research will address the fundamental question of how organisms achieve the shapes of their bodies, which is critical to their survival. This research will also have broader impacts through the training of young scientists including undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows with outreach efforts to recruit female and underrepresented minorities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nectar spur of Aquilegia is a complex three-dimensional structure that is recently derived and highly variable among species and, thus, can serve as a powerful model for investigating the control and evolution of complex organ shape. Nectar spurs develop via an early phase of localized, oriented cell divisions that create the prepatterned spur cup, which is then followed by a period of highly anisotopic cell elongation that gives rise to the final length and shape of the spur. Among the closely related and interfertile species of Aquilegia, variation in spur length and shape is generated by changing several developmental parameters: length is primarily controlled by cell anisotropy, which is in turn controlled by the duration of cell elongation; curvature is generated by varying cell elongation between the distal vs. proximal compartments of the spur; and circumference is controlled both by changes in cell anisotropy and cell number in the radial orientation. Thus, understanding the development and evolution of Aquilegia spurs will provide insight into all of these fundamental aspects of lateral organ development, which can provide new perspectives on the evolution of lateral organs more broadly across the angiosperms. The proposed research seeks to integrate multiple lines of study drawn from the fields of developmental genetics, evolutionary genomics/genetics, and biophysics. Specifically, the project will elucidate the fundamental genetic control of petal spur development, explore the roles of hormonal signaling and biomechanical strain in controlling spur development, use QTL-based approaches to identify the genes involved in the diversification of spur shape and use comparative genomic approaches to identify selective sweeps associated with the origin of nectar spurs.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Throughout evolutionary history, organisms have evolved features that allow them to interact with their environment in novel ways. When such features lead to increased rates of speciation in a lineage, we call them key innovations. Understanding the genetic and developmental basis of key innovations is of particular interest. In this study, we have investigated how developmental dynamics, gene function, and hormone response pathways control the generation of petal nectar spurs in the columbine genus <em>Aquilegia</em>. Among other discoveries, we have identified a gene, <em>POPOVICH</em>, that is crucial to the development of these structures. While the function of <em>POPOVICH</em> orthologs in other plant taxa suggests an ancestral function of the lineage in leaf development, in <em>Aquilegia</em>, <em>POPOVICH</em> also functions to promote cell division in petals, a key cellular step in the development of nectar spurs in the genus. Once cell division has generated the early spur cup, they must be turned off to allow for cell expansion. It appears that this process is controlled independently on the different surfaces of the tubular spur, allowing one side to have more cells than the other. This leads to spur curvature, which is appropriate for bee pollinators. On many different occasions, the bee pollination that is ancestral in this genus has evolutionarily transitioned to hummingbird pollination with straight spurs. Surprisingly, straight spurs are achieved not by evening the number of cells, but by elongating the cells on the opposite side of the spur tube, thereby straightening it out. This very unexpected finding will help us understand how genetic changes were associated with the evolution of new pollinator syndromes. Once the cells have stopped dividing, they undergo a prolonged period of oriented cell elongation, pushing the spur tube to become highly elongated. This process appears to be controlled by two key plant hormones, auxin and brassinosteroid. Finally, the sugar-producing nectary at the very tip of the spur matures to allow it to function in attracting pollinators. The development of the nectary is controlled by a small family of genes called <em>STYLISH</em>. These transcription factors are only the second known regulators for nectary development in the flowering plants and could be useful in helping scientists improve crops and promote pollination. These findings have created a framework that the Kramer and Hodges labs will continue to use to investigate how the genetic program controlling petal spur development functions as well as how it first evolved and has continued to diversify to produce all the forms seen in columbines today.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/08/2021<br>      Modified by: Elena&nbsp;M&nbsp;Kramer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1456217/1456217_10378106_1617915890954_cover.art.2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1456217/1456217_10378106_1617915890954_cover.art.2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Aquilegia petal spur variation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1456217/1456217_10378106_1617915890954_cover.art.2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Aquilegia petal spur variation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Representative flowers from offspring of a cross between the spurless A. ecalcarata (which resembles the upper left) and A. sibirica (which resembles the lower right).
