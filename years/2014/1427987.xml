<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Michael Haley from the University of Oregon Eugene and colleague S. Michael Strain will acquire a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a broad band observe multinuclear broadband cryoprobe with automated tuning. These capabilities will be used for characterizing complex and/or low-solubility synthetic materials ranging from compounds designed for organic electronic applications to RNA biopolymers and "designed" nanoparticles. The spectrometer will be placed in the Center for Advanced Materials Characterization in Oregon (CAMCOR). In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research by postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Oregon Eugene and will also impact outreach activities involving K-12 programs that target schools with a predominantly minority populations as well as industrial collaborators. The resource will be available to students and collaborators at the University of Oregon Eugene, Oregon State University, Portland State University, and Lane Community College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) synthesizing Fe-phosphine complexes for use as liquid-phase absorbents in the purification of natural gas; (b) synthesizing precision engineered nanoparticles; (c) using indenofluorene and indenofluorenediones as electron-accepting scaffolds for organic electronics; (d) studying nanoscale aqueous M13 clusters and molecular probes for small molecule/ion recognition; (e) self-assembling ligands for transition metal catalysts and chemical tools for studying biological hydrogen sulfide; and (f) using Pt(II) reagents for RNA biochemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  The NSF MRI award CHE-1427987 enabled the purchase and installation of a new Bruker Avance III-HD 500 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer in the Center for Advanced Characterization of Materials (CAMCOR) shared instrument laboratory at the University of Oregon (UO), where it used by many UO students and researchers as well as by researchers in the regional commercial community.  NMR instrumentation is an almost universal requirement for nearly all modern chemistry research laboratories for characterization of structure and dynamics of molecules and mixtures. It is a basic accreditation requirement for academic programs by the American Chemical Society.  The new UO instrument features a high sensitivity "cryoprobe" that enables the advanced multinuclear characterization of samples even at low concentrations. Its multinuclear capability has permitted the observation of the natural isotopes 1H, 13C, 19F, 31P, 119Sn, 27Al, 29Si, 15N, 2H, and 11B, and many more.     Specific Projects at the UO include:  &bull; Exploration of formally anti-aromatic, fully conjugated indenofluorene scaffolds as semiconducting materials for organic electronics due to their ability to easily and reversibly accept electrons; investigation of conjugated aryl-ethynyl systems as fluorescent sensors of various biologically/environmentally relevant phenomena such the detection of certain anions or electric potential gradients; synthesis and structure-activity studies of a family of platinum compounds related to the pharmaceutical compound, cis-platin, for study of the interactions between platinum-based reagents and cellular constituents.  &bull; Development of "supramolecular" metal chelators for a variety of toxic and environmentally hazardous metals; synthesis and applications of inorganic cluster compounds; and using multiple weak interactions within supramolecular receptors for small molecule receptors to specifically target environmentally and biologically relevant substrates; and at a basic level studying the thermodynamics and physical organic chemistry of host-guest and metal-ligand complexes; supramolecular assemblies, and thin film semiconductors.  &bull; State-of-the-art organic synthesis of unique nanostructures with atomistic level control in the context of research of carbon nanotube (CNT) materials that could lead to faster electronics, better sensors for detection of disease, and more efficient energy generation and storage.   &bull; Research on molecular recognition at the interface of chemistry and biology, particularly understanding the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in biological systems where it plays important roles in diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, inflammation, neurodegeneration; the development of new tools to detect and modulate biological H2S; development of self-assembled allosteric catalysts that can lead to insights into the catalytic properties of protein enzymes and the development of novel non-protein catalysts.  &bull; Development of iron-based catalysts for small molecule activation and nitrogen binding to improve the efficiency of global scale nitrogen fixation industrial processes; flow ozonolysis of alkenes and alkynes; novel phosphine synthesis; photochemical kinetics and solvent-cage effects; and photosensitized polymer degradation.     Broader Impacts:  The new instrument was installed in July of 2015 and has since been used in the fulfillment of at least 35 different grant supported projects in ten different research groups at the UO, plus a group from the University of Montana and ten different regional private companies, including local UO spinoffs and startups.  The 138 different "hands-on" users of the new instrument at the UO have included faculty, postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate researchers.  In addition, the instrument has supported the research projects of six Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)  summer students and a high school student whose project went on to place first in the Intel International Science Fair Chemistry Division.  The instrument has also been used each term to demonstrate advanced NMR techniques to organic chemistry students from Lane Community College.  In the first 25 months of operation the spectrometer has logged over 7500 user sessions.  To date more than 40 peer-reviewed scientific publications have acknowledged the support of this instrument and the CHE-1427987 award .
