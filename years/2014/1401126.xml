<AbstractNarration>Manifolds are geometric objects that can be parametrized using the standard numerical variables of algebra and calculus. They are fundamental objects for much of modern mathematics and its applications to the other sciences, where they model physical space as well as many important data sets.  The principal investigator is planning to study properties of higher dimensional manifolds. Here "higher dimensional" means that at least five variables are needed to parametrize the manifold (think of a data set depending on five or more variables). The extra flexibility inherent in a larger number of variables means that many more tools can be brought to bear on problems. The geometry of the expanding networks that are important in communications theory and the theory of dynamical systems (i.e.,change under symmetries of a system) are particularly important tools for the project. Throughout the period of the project the principal investigator intends to mentor young scientists through their involvement in the research, and to continue to work on structural improvements to mathematical education and research in Hawaii.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most important invariants of a manifold is its fundamental group, which governs the way loops can be formed inside the manifold. Associated to fundamental groups are algebraic group rings and analytic group operator algebras. The theory of linear algebra over group rings and group operator algebras is organized by their K-theory, and  understanding the associated K-groups is a difficult problem that is fundamental to the understanding of higher dimensional manifolds via such problems as the Novikov and Borel conjectures in topological classification and the Gromov-Lawson conjecture in differential geometry. The Baum-Connes and Farrell-Jones conjectures postulate techniques for computing K-theory and anchor the current approach to the problems in manifold theory mentioned earlier. The principal investigator intends to use techniques from index theory of elliptic differential operators, operator algebras, topological dynamical systems, metric geometry of expanding networks, and representation theory to study these conjectures and related issues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A major theme of the reseach project comes from expanders, and their pathological geometric proeprties.  Expanders are highly connected networks that are cheap to construct; they are important in many apsects of data analysis and computer science. Expanders are known to have highly unusual geometry that is extremely different to picture in our usual Cartesian, or Euclidean, coordinates.  This unsual geometry leads to counterexamples to important conjectures connecting geometry (quantitative theory of shape) and topology (qualitative theory of shape), to representation theory (study of symmetry) and index theory (counting solutions to the differential equations of physics).  Much of my research work was involved with clarifying the pathologies arising from expanders, and finding the correct geometric and analytic settings in which to study them.  A second major theme was connections of operator algebras (a part of mathematics developed starting in the 1930s to address the needs of quantum mechanics) and dyanmics (the study of how systems change).  With my collaborators, I introduced new theories of dimension for such systems that quantify their complexity and introduce powerful tools for associated computations, particularly in the contexts of K-theory (a tool for measuring the twistedness of such syetsms, in some sense).   I pulbished an average of three to four papers in peer-reviewed journals on these subjects during the grant period, some alone and others in collaboration with other mathematicians both nationally and internationally.  These results were disseminated to the international research community via dozens of invited talks at research conferences in the US, and across five continents.  My research papers are all publicly available on my website and the arXiv file repository.  In addition to disseminating my own research, I gave eight lecture series at international conferences at US and international venues aimed at training the next generation of researchers.  I organzied seminars with the aim of training graduate students at my home institution, the University of Hawai?i.  I supervised theses at the Masters and Doctoral level, and mentored postdoctoral researchers; most of my mentees are now employed as mathematics educators and researchers in their own right at various levels.  At my home institution (by most measures, the most diverse in the country), I worked to reform aspects of the educational system.  I co-authored and co-implemented a major reorganization of our grauduate program with the aim of better relfecting modern research interests, better serving our students, and allowing more diversity of teaching, particularly in the applied setting.  At the undergraduate level, I co-authored new general requirements in quantitative reasoning for our students, designed to give students mathematical skills geared towards practical real-world applications, and to better support students as as they overcome the intimidation often associated with mathematics and learn to use it; I also chaired the committee charged with implementing these new requirements.
