<AbstractNarration>From birth to adulthood, the brain and nervous system continuously expand and develop to keep up with the growing body. Neurons and connections must constantly be added or changed for any animal, including humans, to gain new behaviors or retain old ones. This project is to develop and apply technology to monitor brain and behavior from birth to adulthood of the roundworm C. elegans, an important and widely studied model for neuroscience. A controlled environment will be created where individual animals are born, roam freely, and grow to adulthood while a microscope continuously scans the activity patterns of every neuron in the worm's nervous system. Because of their rapid maturation (&lt;2 days) and small nervous system (&lt;302 neurons), the technology will be used to answer fundamental questions about the developing brain. For example, how do highly conserved behavioral patterns like forward and reverse movement emerge from a nervous system that adapts to a body that grows ten-fold from birth to adult? Coordinating the parallel development of brain, body, and behavior is a problem faced by all animals. The accessibility of C. elegans will yield the first comprehensive measurements of brain and behavior development in any animal. Bringing together developmental biology, neurophysiology, and neurotechnology will train young scientists who will work at the rich interface between the physical and life sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A system will be developed-- a motorized, rotating agar-coated ball-- upon which a nematode can freely move without interruption as it feeds, grows, molts through four larval stages, and becomes an adult. Throughout the nematode's life, the system will record the activity of the entire nervous system visualized throughout its optically transparent body using a confocal microscope that achieves video-rate volumetric recording. These experiments will provide unprecedented datasets that describe the behavioral life history of an individual animal in temporal correlation with whole brain activity patterns. Comparison of these rich datasets between wild-type animals and informative mutants will allow dissection of a wide range of interconnected and shared processes in neurodevelopment, regulation, learning, and memory. For example, understanding the developmental progression of the motor circuit will be achieved by obtaining circuit-wide measurements that describe how the 20-neuron motor circuit that drives the forward and backward movements of the 0.1-mm long juvenile worm is expanded into the 80-neuron motor circuit that drives the same movements of the 1-mm long adult. These studies will illuminate system-wide changes in the nervous system as it dynamically keeps up with animal growth.</AbstractNarration>

How does the adult brain make decisions based on ongoing sensory input to achieve goals? How does it establish its function by integrating both experience and developmental programs across maturity starting at birth? Because the brains of most animals are large and relatively inaccessible, it is difficult to pursue such questions. But the small brain of <em>C. elegans</em>, an animal with only 300 neurons in total and which grows from egg to adulthood in 1-2 days, allows such approaches to whole-brain structure and function. Since the start of the BRAIN Initiative, we have pursued the technology that allow a new era of whole-brain approaches to structure and function.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Whole-brain connectomics</strong></p> <p>In collaboration with Mei Zhen (Toronto) and Jeff Lichtman (Harvard), we developed high-throughput methods in serial-section electron microscopy reconstruction of the worm brain. The worm was the first animal that allowed the mapping of its complete adult connectome, the structure and synaptic connectivity of every neuron in its brain. We used and developed high-throughput methods to map the connectome with nanometer resolution of whole animals. We used these methods to map the first developmental time course of a growing brain from birth to adulthood (Fig 1).</p> <p>Whole-brain connectomics across development revealed an abundance of plasticity and animal-to-animal variability that indicates that the adult brain must be a product of both developmental programs that allow behavior to mature from birth to adulthood as well as experience-dependent mechanisms that allow the animal to adapt and learn its behaviors to its environment on the basis of experience<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Whole-brain cellular identification</strong></p> <p>The structure of the whole-brain provides a framework for understanding how complete circuits work. To understand functional properties, one requires a way of visualizing the activity in behaving animals. To do this, we built the first volumetric imaging setups that allowed tracking whole-brain dynamics in behaving animals<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>. But we realized that this method did not easily allow us to identify every cell. Although the worm is widely-thought to have a stereotyped nervous system, this stereotypy does not extend to the spatial positions of its cell bodies! We needed a comprehensive way of discriminating every neuron based on its color. To do this, we and our collaborators turned to a "deterministic brainbow'' approach, where every neuron in the brain was encoded with its own color.&nbsp; (Figure 2)</p> <p>Our polychromatic analysis now allows us to perform whole-brain imaging in freely moving worms with single-cell resolution and comprehensive neuronal identification <a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Whole-brain functional activity <br /></strong></p> <p>Whole-brain activity will only reflect all encoded mechanisms when a freely-moving animal is engaged in an ecologically relevant task. Such behaviors are the most complex, often comprised of multiple steps that require constant sensory input and feedback to perform.

Low-dimensional structure in brain activity, at least in <em>C. elegans</em>, has been an artifact of restraining brain activity or behavioral activity in the study of simple laboratory-based behaviors.
