<AbstractNarration>This award provides funds to support the participation of young investigators in the annual meeting of the Sun Valley Workshop on Musculoskeletal Biology held in Sun Valley, Idaho, August 3-6, 2014. The Workshops have a 40 year tradition, and emphasize active interaction of junior faculty and students.  The Workshops promote interdisciplinary communication, and are unusual in that discussion time equals or exceeds time allotted for formal presentation. The goals of the Workshop are to (1) work toward a multidisciplinary basic and clinical synthesis of molecular, tissue and biomechanical processes related to the pathogenesis, prevention and treatment of bone and joint diseases; (2) provide training workshops for young investigators that help bridge the gaps between disciplines; (3) provide a forum for student training and the opportunity for junior investigators to talk with more senior scientists in a small group setting. This 2014 Workshop will address the theme of The Interaction of Bone with Other Organ Systems through sessions focused on the Regulation of Skeletal Processes by Neuropeptides, the Association Between Bone Fragility and Vascular Calcification, the Association between Skeletal Muscle and Bone Biological and Biomechanical Properties, the Interaction of Bone and the Immune System, and the Regulation of Bone Health by the Gut Microbiome. This Workshop is relevant to public health concerns because it brings a multi-disciplinary group of senior and junior scientists together to discuss the interaction of bone with other organ systems.  It provides vertically-oriented integration, from basic science to clinical pathology, to practitioners and scientists who are not completely familiar with all aspects of these diseases of societal concern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opportunities are provided for junior investigators to interact with more senior investigators. A Career Development Workshop geared toward young investigators will include sections on "How do I put together a curriculum vitae?" and a panel discussion on "The Interview Process". As an additional aspect of mentorship, pre-workshop young investigator mentors have been assigned to work with young investigators who will be giving talks. An internationally-recognized scholar, Dr. Steven Goldring, has been invited to provide a Plenary Lecture.  The summarized results of the workshop are disseminated widely through BoneKEy, the online journal of the International Bone and Mineral Society: http://www.bonekey-ibms.org/misc/Meetingsupplements.dtl. The abstracts can be accessed prior to the Workshop as well: www.ibmsonline.org/Meetings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Objective of the Sun Valley Workshop is to improve understanding across the many discipolines that study musculoskeletal biology and to provide new perspectives that lead to prevention/treatment of skeletal disease.  It helps to develop research interactions across disciplines, especially for younger scientists.  In 2014, the Workshop included sessions on The Regulation of Skeletal Processes by Neuropeptides; Association between Bone Fratiligy and Vascular Calcification; Association between Skeletal Muscle and Bone Biomechanical Properties; Bone and the Immune System; and Gut Microbiome Regulation of Bone Health.  The keynote speaker, Dr. Steven Goldring, talked about how disease helps us learn about normal function when studying bone remodeling in arthritis.  More than 20 posters were discussed at the Workshop, and a separate session was devoted to presentations from the winners of the ASBMR/Harold M. Frost Award.  The 2014 program can be found at: www.ibmsonline.org (click Meetings).  Abstracts of presentations and posters were published in BoneKEy, an online publication of the International Bone and Mineral Society (http://www.bonekey-ibms.org/misc/Meetingsupplements.dtl).  Continuing the Workshop's history of srong mentorship for young investigators, an afternoon Career Development Workshop geared toward junior investigators was offered.  Forty-one attendees engaged in an interactive discussion on how to construct a CV, and participated in a panel Discussion on the interview process.  About 25% of the attendees were graduate students, nearly half were postdoctoral fellows and about 20% were Assistant Professors.  Over the past three years, more than 65 young investigator awards had been given. Twenty-four were given in 2014; all young investigators presented their work from the poidium or in a poster setting.  Awards included 10 Alice L. Jee Memorial Travel Awards; 9 ASBMR/Harold M. Frost Awards; one award for oastoarthritis research; three awards to Under-represented minority scientists; and one young investigator Award in honor of Dr. Charles Turner.  Lunches between young investigators and more senior investigators were aranged for all Award winners.  All invited speakers were required to serve as a mentor and several senior investigators who were not speakers also were recruited as mentors.  As an additional aspect of mentorship, we appointed a  pre-workshop young investigator mentor, who worked prior to the Workshop with the young investigators on content and length of their presentations.  We are committed to the active participation of women in these Workshops.  Women have constituted about 32-37% of the participants.  In 2014, 39% of participants were women.  Three of six session chairs and 42% of the invited speakers (not including award winners) were women. Six of the nine members of the Advisory Board are women.  In 2014, 7% of the participants were under-represented minorities (4 African-American and 3 Hispanic).  One measure of the importance of the Workshop to participants is comments received about the Workshop on post-Workshop evaluation forms:  -- Great meeting.  The number one reason I go is for the opportunity to have substantitve interactions with my coleagues and the discussion.  Another major highlight is meeting and seeing the work of the new investigators.  This energizes the meeting and helps promote these up and coming individuals.  --I am the first time attendee, and I really enjoyed the workshop.  I like the small informal group setting as it gave the chance to get to know the attendees.  This workshop is an excellent venue especially for the young investigators.  I would totally recommend it.  -- I really enjoyed the meeting especially listening to the discussion.  It is a good opportunity to know and interact with people.  -- Awesome meeting!  --This meeting was an excellent example of the free-flowing discussion that the SVW has become famour for.
