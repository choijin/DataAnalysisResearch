<AbstractNarration>Power consumption is a major constraint on the operation of mobile computing devices. By reducing power consumption, it will be possible to prolong the operational time of battery operated devices. Modern computing devices integrate Central Processing Units (CPUs) and Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) on the same die to cater to the performance needs of various software applications. These software applications are usually written to execute parallel threads that make use of the CPUs and the GPUs.   Integrated CPU-GPU devices offer many advantages over discrete CPU-GPU systems, including higher performance, reduced power consumption, and finer-grained interactions between the CPU and GPU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this proposal is to explore a new paradigm for symbiotic power management that exploits the structure and semantics of parallel programming languages for CPU-GPU devices to deliver improved power management capabilities. To achieve this goal, the PI will first identify the operational phases of software applications directly from their parallel programming constructs, and then use the identified phases to devise an adaptive power management method that determines the optimal resources (e.g., frequency-voltage settings and number of cores) to meet performance targets while offering large reductions in power consumption. In synergy with the overarching goal, the PI will pursue an educational outreach program that includes: expanding on-going projects targeted for local high-school students to increase their knowledge of energy challenges in computing systems; developing courses on high-performance computing systems; involving undergraduate students in research experiences; and outreach to industry.</AbstractNarration>

In particular the project to lead to major results in four key areas:  A new power capping technique for CPU+GPU servers that is capable of coordinating the power budgets among the various CPU and GPU power domains to maximize the performance subject to the total given power caps. Compared to prior published techniques, our results improve the throughput by an average of 14.4% under power caps. A new blind power identification technique that simultaneously identifies the thermal models and the fine-grain power consumption of a CPU+CPU processor from just the measurements of the thermal sensors and the total power consumption. Our identification technique is blind as it does not require design knowledge of the thermal-power model to identify the power sources.  We show that our technique consistently improves the modeling and sensing accuracy of CPU+GPU integrated circuits We identified the challenges and opportunities in scheduling on CPU+GPU processors. In particular, we showed that the best scheduling device (i.e., CPU vs GPU) on these processors not only depends on the application kernel characteristics but also depends on the system runtime conditions such as power cap and number of available CPU cores. Accordingly, we proposed a machine learning based scheduling framework for CPU+GPU processors that makes the device selection decision to minimize runtime or energy by taking both kernel characteristics and runtime system conditions. We showed that the proposed power-aware dynamic scheduler provides up to 31% better performance than the state-of-the-art scheduling schemes. Our work is the first to leverage mobile processor with GPUs to build clusters with improved energy efficiency and performance compared to previous cluster architectures. Our cluster provides better CPU+GPU balance, which improves the performance and energy efficiency of image classification using deep neural networks, since the compressed images are decoded on the CPU and fed to the GPU for processing using the neural network.
