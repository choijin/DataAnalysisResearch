<AbstractNarration>The Boise Extravaganza in Set Theory is a longstanding annual regional conference that focuses on Set Theory and its Applications. Its twenty-first meeting will be held on the campus of the University of California, Riverside, during June 17 - 20, 2014 as a symposium of the 95th annual meeting of the Pacific Division of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS-PD). Likewise, BEST's twenty-second meeting will be held on the campus of San Francisco State University during June 16-19, 2015, as a symposium of the 96th annual meeting of the AAAS-PD. BEST provides the western region of the United States with a conference in Set Theory that emphasizes diversity. The conference actively seeks to recruit and integrate student and early career dissemination of research in Set Theory and its affiliated mathematical disciplines into the conference agenda. The conference promotes interaction between different career stages in the field by also recruiting four plenary speakers. BEST also promotes broader understanding between mathematics and the sciences through opportunities arising from integration with the annual meeting of the AAAS-PD. BEST seeks to increase participation by underrepresented groups in Set Theory and Mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Set Theory is the foundation of Mathematics, and as such, of modeling and deductive reasoning in the natural sciences. Offering BEST at the Annual Meeting of the Pacific division of the AAAS thus provides potential for significant broader impact. Mathematics has always benefited from an influx of ideas and problems in other sciences, and conversely. It benefits the natural sciences, and also Set Theory, when opportunities for such cross fertilization are nurtured and facilitated. For each of the 2014 and 2015 meeting of BEST, the conference provides travel support for up to 10 student speakers, 4 postdoc speakers, 2 pre-tenure faculty speakers and 4 invited speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site:  http://diamond.boisestate.edu/~best/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This grant supported the 21st (June 2014 University of California - Riverside), 22nd (June 2015 University of San Francisco) and 23rd (June 2016 University of San Diego) meetings of the "Boise Extravaganza in Set Theory" (BEST) as a symposium of the 95th, 96th and 97th Annual Meeting of the Pacific Division of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS-PD), respectively, providing the Western United States with a conference in Set Theory.   Set Theory is the foundation of Mathematics, and as such, of modeling and deductive reasoning in the natural sciences. Mathematics always benefits from an influx of ideas and problems from other sciences, and conversely. Hosting BEST at annual meetings of the AAAS-PD provides potential for significant broader impact as several other sciences offer symposia at this conference. At the 2014 conference BEST sponsored a public lecture by an invited speaker, exposing an audience representing several natural sciences to the development and impact of Set Theory on the broader scientific enterprise.  BEST actively recruited and integrated early career dissemination of research in Set Theory and its affiliated mathematical disciplines into the conference agenda. The conference promoted professional networking and interaction between different career stages in the field, international collaboration and participation of underrepresented groups by recruiting its plenary speakers so as to address each of these initiatives. During 2014 to 2016 the number of &middot;       speakers increased from 13 to 20 &middot;       student speakers increased from 5 to 9 &middot;       female speakers increased from 1 to 4 &middot;       post-doc and pre-tenure tenure track speakers met target numbers.  The AAASPD hosts a banquet celebrating student participation across the sciences and mathematics. At each of the three conferences at this banquet AAASPD honored some student presenters at BEST with an award of excellence for the student?s conference presentation.  The emphasis of BEST and the umbrella organization AAAS-PD on providing early career support and value regarding career development and responsible science, is likely to impact the participants' views and professional attitudes regarding training and focus on communication skills, and their mentoring practices.  The (admittedly short term) data about speakers appear to support the notion that the current format of BEST is increasing the participation of early career mathematicians, and is increasing the appreciation for effective professional communication. From the responses to a subsequent email survey, the elevated participation of students and postdocs are positively received and valued. This grant also enabled BEST to sponsor, pursuant to the goals of this project, five plenary speakers at the North American Annual meeting of the Association of Symbolic Logic that took place in March 2017 in Boise Idaho.  Of the five speakers sponsored one was pre-tenure and presented a talk on Set Theory, three were mid career, with one presenting recent applications of Set Theory in commutative algebra, one presenting on applications of logic to railway verification problems, and one presenting on set theory proper.
