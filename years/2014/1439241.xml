<AbstractNarration>The obesity epidemic among children has become a widespread problem in the United States. This trend is disturbing because overweight children tend to become overweight or obese adults with potentially life threatening chronic conditions.  By focusing on children?s physical activity, we can shift the problem from treatment to prevention.  There are numerous academic and commercial applications that aim to help individuals monitor and make proactive decisions about their physical activity; however they do not integrate well into an individual's daily life because they may require manual activity input, asynchronous visualization, and non-instinctive awareness of the application for actionable feedback. Thus, while existing devices have had some success in monitoring, inferring, and presenting activity, they do not always convey the value of physical activity in an intuitive visual abstraction. The feedback design is important in designing wearable technology for children because children are less likely to connect quantifiable measurements  - in this case with their health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In response to these issues, we design innovative wearable computing components that empower children to craft their own intuitive abstractions of wellness data for physical activity promotion.  This project builds on existing socio-technical research in health informatics by extending the nascent research subarea, wellness informatics, that studies how technology can be utilized to empower lay populations to stay well and adopt preventative health behaviors. The research objectives of this project are to: (1) Design plug-and-play wellness monitoring Health Sense systems; (2) Design a graphical programming environment to control the actions of the Health Sense systems; and (3) Understand how children use Health Sense systems. The research methodology is inspired by participatory design activities including participant observations, design workshops, and iterative evaluation of prototypes. Overall, the proposed system provides innovations in computing by creating new, wearable computing prototypes and paradigms of interaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of Health Sense include undergraduate and graduate research assistant interdisciplinary research training. The research team is introducing low socioeconomic status K-12 students to computing, electronics, and health through Health Sense workshops. Research methodology and results is being integrated into the PIs' established 1st year general engineering projects courses.  In addition, the PIs and their students are helping increase the pipeline of future scholars by developing teaching and outreach materials that are being distributed through the project website. The PIs and their students are disseminating  their research by publishing results in health informatics and traditional computing venues. Finally, the system also helps fulfill Healthy People 2020 Educational and Community-Based Programs goals.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Health Sense project developed low power small electronic systems for children to safely and efficiently create their own personal health management systems. In terms of <em>intellectual merit</em>, we iteratively developed four small electronic toolkits &ndash; from a custom-made electronics board to enhancing commodity hardware (e.g., a Lilypad Arduino) &ndash; to empower children to craft their own health sensing technologies with various inputs and outputs. We found that children did not want an output (e.g., a light) on their personal health system, instead they preferred to see the results of their health monitoring in their environment. To this end, we iteratively developed two ambient feedback presentation systems that wirelessly communicated with the personal health management toolkits. Finally, we developed a set of commodity electronic connection extensions to help children easily, safely, and efficiently create their health sensing systems.</p> <p>Children used the personal Health Sense kit to enhance prized objects, such as a sketchbook that could track how much time they spent sketching, and crafted new objects, such as a backpack accessory that could detect how long a child spent outside. Children used the ambient feedback presentation system to create a community mural where study participants could add their own electronically enhanced modules and the rest of the community could create the mural. In this overall Health Sense system, the personal health system would record data and then, when near the ambient presentation system, the personal health system would send the data wirelessly to the ambient system to impact how the ambient system presented itself. For example, a participant created a backpack accessory that recorded how much time they spent outside. The same participant also created a picture of a galaxy on the ambient motor module that was integrated into a large wall mural at their afterschool program. &nbsp;Each time the participant went to their afterschool program, the backpack accessory would send the time spent outside to the ambient display. Since the participant had programmed the system to spin faster based on the more time they spent outside, they could easily see how they were reaching their goals for spending more time outside.</p> <p>Based on how children used the personal and ambient Health Sense systems, we investigated how to make connections safer and easier to use. We found that participants created safer systems when we abstracted inputs and outputs on the hardware and utilized connection mechanisms (e.g., conductive fabric and magnets) that provided participants with insights into how to decrease short circuits. Overall, participants were able to create circuitry more efficiently and understood how the circuits worked&nbsp; by utilizing the Health Sense connections.</p> <p>In terms of <em>broader impact</em>, Health Sense has the potential to help society at-large by addressing objectives specified in Healthy People 2020. In terms of educating future scholars, Health Sense has trained 8 undergraduates, 3 graduate research assistants, first year undergraduate engineers, and Grades 1&shy;12 students. In addition, through the Girl Scout e-Textile camp, we introduced 60 middle school girls to electronics, circuits, programming, and textile design.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/20/2017<br>      Modified by: Katie&nbsp;A&nbsp;Siek</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439241/1439241_10209237_1513616244502_HealthSenseFinalArtifacts-3-smaller--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439241/1439241_10209237_1513616244502_HealthSenseFinalArtifacts-3-smaller--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Personal Health Sense Modules for Children"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1439241/1439241_10209237_1513616244502_HealthSenseFinalArtifacts-3-smaller--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Personal Health Sense Modules for Children"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Child showing how their personal Health Sense wearable system (yellow bag) communicates with the ambient display.
