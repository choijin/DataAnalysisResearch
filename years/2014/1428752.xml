<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Gretchen Hofmeister from Carleton College and colleagues David Alberg and Matthew Whited will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer with field gradient capabilities for two-dimensional and dynamic NMR experiments.  This spectrometer will allow research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students at Carleton College and St. Olaf College. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) studies of trypanothione reductase inhibitors; (b) synthesis and applications of extended linear chain (ELC) materials; (c) studies of titanium(IV) trisphenolate catalysts; (d) organocatalysis; (e) studies of metal/ligand cooperative reactivity; and (f) synthesis and structure of Mo(II) acetyl complexes.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award was used to purchase a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer with improved sensitivity, new capabilities, increased reliability, and greater efficiency than the previous instrument. The NMR instrument has been crucial for advancing the research programs of six faculty members at Carleton and St. Olaf colleges, including three women, one African-American, and one Asian. Over the course of the grant period, the instrument was used to study reagents and catalysts that are important for synthesizing pharmaceuticals and other chemicals, and for transforming CO<sub>2</sub> and other small molecules into useful feedstock. The new NMR was also used to facilitate sensor and optical device fabrication. Use of the NMR by faculty and students from both St. Olaf and Carleton prompted additional inter-college interactions; during the grant period, we held a series of summer research &ldquo;super group&rdquo; meetings that included the synthesis groups from both colleges. At Carleton, the new NMR was also key to the work of 25-35 chemistry-major gradu&shy;ates each year; courses and labs for biology, biochemistry, pre-med&shy;icine, neuro&shy;science, and other science students; and even to the local high school&rsquo;s advanced-placement chemistry class. This research and teaching with the new instrument advances Carleton&rsquo;s and St. Olaf&rsquo;s standing as national leaders in producing graduates who earn PhDs in chemistry and other STEM fields. This success is in part due to their strong emphasis on student-faculty research and research-like experiences in the curriculum, which the instrument has furthered. Carleton strives to ex&shy;tend this success to a broader group of students, by establishing cohort programs that are designed to attract and retain stu&shy;dents from groups that are under&shy;represented in the sciences, by providing first-generation or underrepre&shy;sented students funding for high-quality research experi&shy;ences, and by offering authentic science education to talented high-school students &ndash; all initiatives in which cutting-edge instrumentation like this NMR is crucial.
