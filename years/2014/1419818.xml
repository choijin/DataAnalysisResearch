<AbstractNarration>Air quality over the western United States is determined not only by local emissions, but also by the transport of pollutants from outside the region, namely, from Asian emissions that have been transported across the Pacific Ocean, and by stratospheric intrusion events that bring naturally-occurring ozone-rich air to the surface. Quantifying the contribution of the large-scale atmospheric transport to present-day air quality is of vital importance for policy makers, since the ability of an area to be in compliance with current air quality standards is partly a function of the background meteorological conditions. Furthermore, increasing greenhouse gas concentrations over the next century are expected to drive large changes in the midlatitude circulation, but the effects of these changes on pollutant transport are not well understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are (1) to gain a fundamental understanding of the dynamical mechanisms that couple synoptic variability and pollutant transport and (2) to explore how changes in synoptic variability with increased greenhouse gas concentrations may modify this transport. The two goals will be addressed using a hierarchy of models: a large-multi-model data set, a chemistry-climate model, a stratosphere-resolving atmospheric GCM and an idealized, dry dynamical core. Future pollutant emissions are largely unpredictable, but the dynamical processes that drive tropospheric transport have the potential to be understood. By decoupling emissions from the circulation, this work aims to assess the role of changing atmospheric variability in modifying tropospheric transport.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Air quality is determined not only by local emissions, but also by the transport of pollutants from elsewhere by the atmospheric winds. These same winds transport and mix moisture, dictating where the moisture will later fall as precipitation. Thus, understanding how the atmosphere moves and mixes chemical constituents and moisture is fundamental to improving air quality and predicting the surface impacts of rain and snow across the globe. This project focused on two main goals: (1) to understand the role of atmospheric winds in driving transport and (2) to explore how changes in atmospheric winds over the coming decades may drive changes in this transport. The key outcomes of the intellectual meric portion of the work are presented in 14 published, peer reviewed journal articles. Within these articles, we detail many results and highlight some of the key findings here:   The transport of moisture into the Arctic is tightly connected to the mid-latitude winds, and the bulk of the poleward moisture transport is done by extreme transport driven by breaking atmospheric waves (i.e. Rossby waves). By using our knowledge of how these atmospheric waves vary in time, we are able to predict how moisture transport into the Arctic changes on a year-by-year basis.   The variations in Arctic near-surface carbon dioxide is more largely impacted by variations in carbon dioxide transport from lower latitudes than from variations in local Arctic carbon dioxide emissions.     We have developed three novel frameworks for studying atmospheric transport and mixing of chemical constituents and moisture by linking it to variations in the large-scale circulation. This includes a study on isolating key dynamics that determine the transport of constituents between the stratosphere and the troposphere in midlatitudes.   Poleward movement of the midlatitude jet-stream (as projected to occur with climate change) reduces the ability of atmospheric waves to mix tropospheric air.   Multiple studies that resulted from this project highlight the importance of accounting for climate "noise" when studying the transport and impacts of atmospheric constituents (e.g. moisture, volcanic aerosols).       In terms of broader impacts, the project supported two PhD students and an early-career faculty member (two of which come from underrepresented groups in STEM). Over half of the 14 published articles were led by graduate students, and the award supported travel for the students to scientific conferences and allowed them to mentor undergraduate researchers, thus supporting their professional development. The project supported a PhD student to lead multiple sessions at AGU along with two leaders in the dynamics/transport field allowing the PhD student to interact with the broader community.
