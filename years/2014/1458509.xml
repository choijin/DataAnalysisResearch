<AbstractNarration>Each living cell is packed with proteins that continuously interact with each other in response to envirtonmental and other signals to control the cell's growth and eventual fate. The analysis of such interactions is crucial for understanding signal transduction pathways that drive cell differentian during development and throughout the life an an organism. These pathways are often involed in disease progression, such as cancer, so a broader impact of understanding these pathways could be the design of drugs to modulate such pathways. Moreover, such an understanding of protein protein interactions may aid the develpment of protein-based biomaterials. Current technologies exist for providing a blueprint for large protein interaction networks, but a deeper understanding requires detailed structures of the complexes formed by protein pairs or partners. Structural information is frequently difficult or even impossible to obtain by experimental tools, emphasizing the need for computational approaches. Vajda and Kozakov at Boston University have developed the web based server ClusPro for predicting the three dimensional structures of protein-protein complexes. According to the worldwide experiment CAPRI (Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions), ClusPro consistently has been the best protein-protein docking server. It has over 5000 registered users and performs around 3500 docking calculations each month. Structures generated by the server have been reported in over 350 research papers. The goal of this project is to develop the next generation of ClusPro that will be able to optimally utilize the vast amount of data accumulated in public bioinformatics databases in order to improve the reliability and accuracy of the predicted structures. Since the server is used primarily by biological and chemical scientists who may not have expertise in the use of current bioinformatics tools, the new version will provide convenient access to state-of-art methods. Integration of bioinformatics and computational biophysics approaches, in combination with experimental validation, will result in a unique and powerful research tool.  The increased availability of protein complex structures will have a major impact in many areas of biology, biochemistry, and biotechnology. All software developed will be released free of charge for academic and governmental use. In addition, the project will be used to train a new generation of graduate students, who will be able to optimally combine data from a variety of experimental and bioinformatics techniques with high performance computing. The use of the server will also be incorporated into undergraduate courses to teach aspects of bioinformatics and biophysical principles of molecular recognition.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current version of ClusPro systematically samples the conformational space of a target protein complex, and scores the structures using physics based energy functions. The major shortcoming of this approach is that it performs docking without consideration of the large body of interaction, sequence, structural, and experimental information available in public databases. Rather than simply generating and scoring docked structures of the starting proteins, the new approach will use their sequences to collect all orthologs to identify the globular domains and inter-domain regions that may contain short linear motifs (SLIMs). Domains that occur in a number of interacting protein pairs are likely to mediate the interaction, enabling the identification of the specific domains that interact with domains or SLIMs of the partner protein. Superimposing the domains from different orthologs identifies the conserved regions. Since the interface in complexes is sequentially and structurally more conserved relative to the rest of the protein, for the case of domain-domain interactions docking just the key segments generally yields near-native docked structures. Docking key segments from different orthologs and selecting consensus models improves the reliability of predicted structures. This approach substantially improves the docking of proteins that have flexible loops, and will be extended to the docking of homology models. If the interface includes a SLIM, docking structures of peptide fragments that contain the motif extends the method to proteins with interactions mediated by flexible or unstructured regions. The algorithms to be developed will be implemented in ClusPro, which will provide substantial new information on protein-protein complexes. ClustPro software can be accessed at http://cluspro.bu.edu.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Protein-protein interactions are important for understanding cellular function and organization. Since experimental structure determination for complexes can be very difficult, computational&nbsp; docking methods are important for generating complex structures from the structures of the component proteins. This grant supported the development of the protein-protein docking server ClusPro. The server performs three main steps: (1) global systematic rigid-body sampling of potential complex conformation, generating and evaluating billions of structures, (2) clustering the 1000 lowest energy structures and ranking the clusters via their population, and (3) energy minimization to remove steric clashes (Figure 1). In its default mode, the server requires only the Protein&nbsp; Data Bank codes of the two proteins to be docked (Figure 2). Due to this simplicity, ClusPro is heavily used: it has over 13,000 registered users (registration is not required), and has performed over 300,000 docking calculations so far, on the average of over 5000 per month. Docked structures generated by the server have been reported in around 600 publications. Results are particularly good for enzyme-inhibitor complexes. Figure 3 shows the docking soybean trypsin inhibitor to porcine trypsin. The docked ligand structure is shown as cyan cartoon, whereas the receptor is shown as grey surface. For comparison we also show the X-ray structure of the enzyme-inhibitor complex (PDB ID 1AVX), with the structure of the inhibitor in &nbsp;magenta.</p> <p>The quality of docking methods is continuously monitored by CAPRI (Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions), the ongoing communitywide experiment. In the CAPRI challenge, participating research groups and automated servers are given prediction targets, each being an unpublished experimentally determined structure of a protein-protein complex, and each group is expected predictions. The submitted models are evaluated by independent assessors. ClusPro has consistently been among the three best automated servers in the CAPRI challenge, in most cases performing substantially better than other servers and predictor groups.</p> <p>We added four new options to ClusPro. These options were considering pairwise interaction data as restraints; accounting for Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) data in docking; performing discrimination between biological and crystallographic dimers; and adding PeptiDock, a method of docking flexible peptides to proteins. We also made progress toward adding template-based methods (TBMs) to ClusPro, thus starting the calculations from sequences rather than structures of the component proteins. These additions are expected to substantially improve prediction results and the popularity of the server among biologists.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/25/2019<br>      Modified by: Sandor&nbsp;Vajda</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1458509/1458509_10357591_1572016674507_Fig1_scheme--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1458509/1458509_10357591_1572016674507_Fig1_scheme--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Outline of the ClusPro algorithm"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1458509/1458509_10357591_1572016674507_Fig1_scheme--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Outline of the ClusPro algorithm"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The server performs global systematic rigid-body sampling of potential complex conformation, clustering, and refinement by energy minimization.
