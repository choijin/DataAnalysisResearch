<AbstractNarration>This project, to be conducted by Biological Sciences Curriculum Study, will analyze and synthesize information about education research funding and publication patterns, to increase understanding about the state of science education research as recommended in a 2013 report by the National Research Council (NRC).  This project will examine past research studies in terms of methodology.  In addition, the project will examine how studies address outcomes related to expanding and broadening participation in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education and the STEM workforce, as well as increasing STEM literacy for all students.  The project will advance the work of the Education &amp; Human Resources (EHR) directorate in fostering research on STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Education research studies funded or published from 2001 to the present will be considered eligible for review.  Questions to be addressed will include the following.  What are the number and proportion of experimental or quasi-experimental studies that attempt to disentangle program effects from student selection effects?  What are the number and proportion of correlational, experimental, or quasi-experimental studies that attempt to address the effects of context on the teaching and learning process and what context factors are being studied?  What are the number and proportion of correlational, experimental, or quasi-experimental studies that address outcomes related to NRC strategic goals for STEM education?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics make up what is commonly known as STEM. STEM education has important implications for the United States, both in terms of our economic capacity and in terms of our ability to participate as informed citizens. There are three federal funding agencies that historically have funded the majority of STEM education research: the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Institute for Education Sciences (IES).  These three agencies have different funding goals and priorities. NSF places a strong emphasis on innovation in STEM education. IES places heavy emphasis on gathering evidence of "what works." The NIH historically placed heavy emphasis on creating instructional opportunities for students to learn about key health-related issues and to encourage young people to pursue careers in health-related fields.  In 2011, the National Research Council called for a "robust, strategic, research agenda" (p. 28) tied to federal funding to support effective K-12 STEM education. Such research would disentangle program effects from selection bias, account for contextual variables in analyses, and allow for longitudinal measures. But to what extent do the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Institute for Education Sciences (IES) support this type of research?  The NRC (2011) also identified three strategic goals for STEM education. It was the opinion of the NRC that federally funded research should strive to meet the three strategic goals:  NRC Goal 1: Expand the number of students who ultimately pursue advanced degrees and careers in STEM fields and broaden the participation of women and minorities in those fields.  NRC Goal 2: Expand the STEM-capable workforce and broaden the participation of women and minorities in that workforce.  NRC Goal 3: Increase STEM literacy for all students, including those who do not pursue STEM-related careers or additional study in the STEM disciplines (NRC, 2011, pp. 4-5).  Our research investigated the extent to which federally funded research since 2001 has attended to the strategic research agenda and addressed NRC?s three goals. We analyzed publicly available information of funded research (including published studies associated with the research grants) to identify key information about the nature of the funded research.  We identified 208 studies across the three agencies that included quantitative K-12 student outcome measures. We found that just over half the studies (110/208) attempted to disentangle program effects from student selection effects using either a quasi-experimental or experimental (i.e., comparison group) design. Sixty-nine percent (76/110) of all comparison group design studies that we identified were associated with IES grants. The distribution of studies with causal designs matches the goal of IES to uncover "what works." Furthermore, it is logical that NSF, an agency that emphasizes innovation, might have fewer causal impact studies.  We have also conducted a large-scale meta-analysis of science education research writ large (including studies NOT funded by federal agencies). We found that federally funded studies use designs that allow for strong causal claims more often than research that is not federally funded.
