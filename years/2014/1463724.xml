<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program in the Chemistry Division is supporting the research of Professor Michael Harmata at the University of Missouri-Columbia to develop (4+3)-cycloaddition chemistry.  In such cycloadditions, two molecular fragments, a four-carbon piece (the diene) and a three-carbon piece (the allylic cation)are joined in a single reaction.  The key feature is the generation of the allylic cation, which possesses a positive charge, and is paired with a partner (negatively-charged) anion that is also chiral.  Chirality is the condition of any object that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image.  For example, left and right hands are mirror images, but cannot be superimposed.  The idea is that this chirality can be used to induce chirality in the formation of the products of the (4+3)-cycloaddition reaction.  This is significant because the molecules of life, as well as many drugs are chiral and occur not as mixtures of right and left handed molecules, but as either right or left.  This is generally known as asymmetry.  The development of reactions that are asymmetric, producing only right or left handed products, is of great current interest across science and the chemical industry.  Professor Harmata will integrate the research and educational components of this project within a new outreach program for middle school students. Through a series of workshops aimed at highlighting the connections between everyday experience and chemistry advances, this program provides middle school students with a discovery-based experience that captures the creativity of the STEM fields through experiments. Professor Harmata has established partnerships with local school districts and charter schools to reach an underprivileged community, which is underrepresented in the sciences. The program promotes the pursuit of higher education in the STEM fields by providing an opportunity for middle-school students to discuss scientific observations while interacting with college students. This concept will be demonstrated through the process of dyeing, in which charged dyes will selectively dye oppositely charge fabrics.  Procedures will be developed by middle school teachers who will test and refine the ideas on 4H members during the summers and then transfer the teaching technology back to their classrooms during academic years.  Targets classrooms are particularly those that are rural or otherwise underserved in the context of exposure to STEM programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific program will consist of the generation of allylic cations from allylic alcohols using chiral phosphoric acids that have been designed to ion pair with allylic cations.  These species are anticipated to react with dienes in a diastereoselective fashion, resulting in a net enantioselectivity in the cycloadducts. This will provide new methodology for the enantioselective synthesis of seven-membered carbocyclic rings.   Some screening will also be conducted as part of the reaction development process.  Both inter- and intramolecular reactions will be examined.  Optimization protocols will be pursued in an effort to maximize enantioselectivity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This work involved the development of a new, catalytic, asymmetric (4+3)-cycloaddition reaction, the study of (4+3)-cycloaddition reactions of oxidopyridinium ions, and the electrocyclization reactions of compounds derived from 1-arylsulfonyl dienes and 1-arylsulfonyl allenes.  The term catalytic implies some chemical (a catalyst) that can promote a reaction such that small amounts of catalyst can induce the reaction of much larger quantities of compounds undergoing a reaction.  Further, this process happens faster than it would happen in the absence of said catalyst.  Most reactions in living organisms are catalyzed.  Asymmetric refers to a property known as chirality, in which an object is not superimposable on its mirror image, like right and left hands.  Methods that can make only one version of a molecule, either the "right hand" or the "left hand" are in demand, as many molecules that are chiral only perform their function as one or the other handedness.  All known living organisms use molecules that are chiral and many drugs are chiral, one "hand" being the active species for biological activity.  Cycloaddition reactions join two or more chains of atoms to make a cycle of joined atoms-a ring.  In our work, the "4+3" moniker denotes the chains put together to make of ring of their sum-7!  Such rings are ubiquitous in molecules that are of interest in biology and in drug synthesis.  Electrocyclizations are similar, but in this case the ends of a single chain are joined to make a ring.  The terms used in the preceding paragraphs are technical, but are just language unique to a particular area of science, a foreign language indeed, but not an impenetrable barrier to understanding.  In the end, we are inventing and refining tools for the construction of molecules, tools that could be used by us or others in preparing new drugs or materials with functions that are important.  In addition, our work provides fundamental information about the property of molecules and their interaction with other molecules.  Such data are important not only for the specifics goals we are achieving, but for the science in general.  Finally, academic science?s principal goal is the education of the next generation of scientists.  This is accomplished in both classroom and laboratory settings.  Students of our program have gone on to use their skills in an industrial setting, with obvious economic benefits for society, as well as the academic world, to continue the process of scientific education.  As part of our support of this, we sponsor an annual symposium known as "Organic Chemistry Day" at which participants from high school students to retirees have the opportunity to celebrate our science through lectures and a poster session.  Finally, we developed a program known as "SENSEible Science:  Dyeing to do Chemistry" in which high school teachers are introduced to the principles behind color, the molecular structure of organic dyes, and the chemical principles behind the interaction between dyes and fabrics.  A particular focus is placed on the principle that positively charged things are strongly attracted to negatively charged things, giving a chemical and physical basis to the old adage that opposites attract.  The experiments performed can find a place in the curriculum of high school chemistry courses.       Last Modified: 07/01/2019       Submitted by: Michael Harmata]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
