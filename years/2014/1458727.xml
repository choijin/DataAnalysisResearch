<AbstractNarration>Springfield Technical Community College (STCC) will award 20 scholarships a year to academically talented students pursuing degrees in STEM fields.  This project will help academically talented and financially needy students to pursue their career goals in STEM areas and will serve to facilitate a fundamental shift in the perception of STEM programs and careers, especially in underrepresented groups.  The project team will collaborate with local and regional industry on curriculum, skills, and certifications needed for employment and advancement, and will have a positive impact on Massachusetts' ability to meet the rising demands for highly skilled technical workers, especially those who hold bachelor's degrees in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A comprehensive approach to the recruiting and retention of STEM Scholars will be developed in a focused effort on eight majors at STCC. The success rate, as measured by enrollment, increased diversity of the student population, retention, graduation, and job placement will provide insight into successful methods of increasing the number and diversity of students in the STEM pipeline.  The program will be designed with proven student support strategies such as peer-mentoring, tutoring, cohort classes, and STEM faculty advising.  The project team will leverage several existing programs including a state-funded STEM Starter Academy, cohort classes, Women in STEM club, and the Innovations (STEM-related) speaker series.  Results from the project will be presented at the national Achieving the Dream Conference, through the STCC website, podcasts from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and in journals devoted to STCC education and at conferences such as the National Academic Advising Association (NACADA) and the Triangle Coalition for STEM Education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[               In 2014, with support from the   National Science Foundation (NSF) Award #1458727, the STEM Springfield   Technical Community College Scholars was started to award scholarships in   Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) programs to help academically   high achieving students who fell into the low income range.  Additionally with an aim to support   diversity and promote inclusivity the PI, co-PI and faculty chairpersons extensively   recruited and encouraged students to apply with a strong emphasis on   under-represented STEM students mainly women and people of color.     The grant was originally scheduled   to run from 2015 ? 2020.  With   additional funds left over due to the COVID-19 pandemic the PI and STCC?s   Grants Department applied for and was granted a one year extension to the   year 2021.        I am happy to report we have   exceed out initials expectations of offering the scholarships to our target   population.  Over the past 6 years we   have awarded 88 students with scholarships with most students receiving   $2,750 per semester.  Of those 88 awardees/students:  34 were women 54 were   men 13   identified as Asian 24   identified as African-American 2   identified as Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 32   identified as Hispanic 28   identified as White 84   graduated with a STEM related Associates Degree 3   transferred to a 4 year school before earning their Associates Degree 1   separated from the college with a Leave of Absence and did not return      Of   the 84 graduates from STCC all of who transferred to a 4 year school and/or   entered the workforce upon degree completion.  Some of awardees have shared by receiving   the scholarship it allowed them to work less and focus more on studies   allowing them to maintain GPAs above 3.0.    In fact the average GPA over the 6 years and 12 semesters was 3.54.  We   wish to share the points below are things we found to work well:  -The   PI and Co-PI reviewed each scholars midterm grades and final grades and sent   individual emails to the scholars with words of congratulations for those who   were excelling and words of encouragement to those that needed some   intervention. For those that needed assistance/mentoring the PI and Co-PI   made arrangements to meet with them and remind them of the tutoring services   that were available.  -   The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is dedicated to investing in Science,   Technology, Engineering &amp; Mathematics (STEM) research, education, and job   and workforce development to meet the critical need for employees in these   fields. STCC has developed the STEM Starter Academy (SSA) in response to the   Commonwealth?s charge. SSA provides programs for a range of students   including high school students, STCC students, and STCC STEM majors. More   information can be found at: https://www.stcc.edu/explore/stem/starter-academy/.   Due the synergies between this grant and   STCC?s SSA we strongly encouraged the SSA students to apply for the   scholarship. Therefore we created a pathway of STEM centric scholars from   high school to STCC and onto 4 years schools.  -Being   the only Technical Community College in the Massachusetts Community College   system the campus holds several STEM related guest lectures, fairs and visits   to STEM related organizations in the Western Massachusetts area each year.   The PI and co-PI encouraged the awardees   to attend these events and help promote a sense of community and to build   career connections with industry representatives.     One   challenge that we encountered for the duration of the grant was the   identification of student mentors for the awardees.  This was an issue due to the busy schedules   of the candidates and lack of interest.     Furthermore, many of the STCC with STEM scholars graduated and/or   transferred to a 4 year institutions and coming back to the STCC campus to   mentor proved impossible to do during the semester.     This   NSF funded grant has been very helpful to our awarded students by helping   them financially to earn a STEM related degree and helping to diversify the students   within STEM.   I do hope in the future   STCC can secure another NSF scholarship funding to build upon our initial   successes.
