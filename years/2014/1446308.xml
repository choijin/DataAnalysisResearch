<AbstractNarration>This award supports an interdisciplinary team of researchers investigating the long term sustainability of rural farming in the far northern regions of Iceland, Myvatn.  The project will use social documentary, archaeological, and natural science data to investigate the unique and detailed record of grass growth and hay yield during the period AD ca. 1700 to 1950 in the Myvatn district.  One of the of the key questions for the research team is what were the varying social and environmental factors that influenced the success or failure of the hay crop and grazing? In addition, the project will analyze the sustainability of the production and use of these resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team has chosen the Myvatn area, named for the ever-present midges (Tanytarsus gracilentus) that are a key element in the local ecology. The midges provide food for numerous water birds, fish, and are in such large numbers that their corpses add nutrients to the soil. Myvatn region has been farmed continuously for many centuries and this farming is hypothesized to have been supported by a complex, interlinked system of biological (midges, fish, waterfowl) and geological (volcanism) processes coupled with the social, cultural, and economic systems. These numerous interlinked factors represent a unique record of a human ecodynamic system in the North. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iceland has a long and diverse written record of farming and the project will draw on numerous published and unpublished historical documents, which have previously been unexamined. These documents including farmer's diaries, local governmental tax and yield records and hay inspection reports, parish records, and a unique farmers' "newspaper" dating to the 19th century.  These records are the legacy documents of one Myvatn farming family and will form the backbone of the archival research. This unique written record, complemented by data from the archaeological record, will add critical social and economic data to the rich environmental data of the Myvan ecosystem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reason the research team is so interested in grass and hay production is that until very recently grass was Iceland's only viable crop.  As such, the early Icelandic economy focused primarily on animal husbandry. The successful harvesting of hay was the most important annual task of rural Icelanders, a task that can be traced to the time of Viking settlement both in form and function. Hay was critical to the economy and the long-term sustainability of Icelandic social systems because quite literally if there was not enough hay to sustain the winter feeding of the livestock they could die and this would lead to famine, migration, and even death among the rural population.   By examining the sustainable harvest and use of grass crops in Myvatn the research team will be able to better understand the complex human ecodynamic systems in the north as they undergoes both environmental and social change.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The settlement and subsequent history of Iceland provides a unique opportunity to study how the human and social dynamics of a specific culture have developed and changed over time. This project has centered on the Lake Myvatn area of northeastern Iceland, a region of considerable volcanic activity. In spite of severe erosion problems, the Myvatn economy has been largely sustainable since the time when Iceland was first settled in the late ninth century. Until the early part of the twentieth century, the inhabitants of the region lived almost entirely on the proceeds of the land by farming, fishing for trout, and collecting the eggs of wild birds. In recent times, tourism has become an extremely important part of the economy. This brings needed revenue but raises conservation issues in what is a very fragile ecosystem. The attractiveness of the area lies in its unique landscape characterised by many curious lava formations, and the lake itself, which together create an area of outstanding natural beauty. In addition to this it has an ecosystem that is unparalleled in Iceland. In the Myvatn area most resources are directly connected to water. The complex food web and biogeochemistry of the lake has created unique wildlife resources on which people depended, and adjacent wetlands produced the most important sources of hay for the animal husbandry practiced in the area. In the past, because of its North Atlantic location, marginal for agriculture, grass was the only viable crop in Iceland, and the economy focused primarily on the keeping of sheep and cattle until comparatively recent times. This meant that the success or failure of the grass crop, coupled with winter rangeland grazing, was the one aspect of the economy on which all else rested. If there was not enough hay to feed the livestock over the winter, then they could die, and the human population could also suffer with famine and related difficulties.</p> <p>The primary goal of this project was to establish what were the varying factors that influenced the success or failure of the grass growth and hay crop and grazing, and the sustainability of the use of these resources. A particularly important part of the project was to examine resource-management decisions and to consider to what extent local farmers focused on the long-term sustainability of grazing resources. In this regard, a specific goal was to gather information on aspects such as: numbers of livestock; the amount of hay gathered each season; the size and productivity of hay fields; the importance of winter foraging by sheep; the dependence on outlying hay fields; and the supplementary harvesting of wetland sedges and grasses. Some of the data analyses performed were quantitative. Thus, it was possible to compare, for example, climate data (such as temperature, precipitation and sea-ice incidence) with grass growth and hay yield in order to produce statistical analyses of climate impacts. Clearly, climate and weather played a significant role in the success or failure of the grass crop and hay harvest. Variable weather during the growing season with alternating frosts and thaws could have an adverse affect, as could unusually cold weather.</p> <p>An important project activity was the collecting of data from a variety of archival and library sources. Manuscript and data resources have been gathered from archives and libraries in Iceland in Reykjavik, Husavik, and Akureyri, and in Copenhagen and Aarhus in Denmark. A significant contribution to the project has come from private data sources in the ownership of the family of one the principal investigators. By supplementing these written accounts with the rich archaeological record for the area, it has been possible to obtain a far clearer picture regarding farm productivity, land-use impacts, and sustainable practices. Using diffferent types of social and natural science data has thus provided far more insight into the human ecodynamics of the region than a single discipline could provide. The records show that the same families lived in the area for generations. For long-term survival in the community people needed to be invested in using their most vital natural resources as sustainably as possible. In conclusion it would appear that there has been over a millennium of apparent sustainable use and management of water and wetland-related resources. It is hoped that this situation will continue into the future in spite of modern pressures to exploit the region through increasing tourism and the potential demands of industry. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/29/2016<br>      Modified by: Astrid&nbsp;Ogilvie</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1446308/1446308_10322579_1477759872084_Chap5Fig12--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1446308/1446308_10322579_1477759872084_Chap5Fig12--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Chap 5 Fig 12"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1446308/1446308_10322579_1477759872084_Chap5Fig12--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Chap 5 Fig 12"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This photo shows areas of erosion, fertile fields, and Lake Mývatn in the background.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Astrid Ogilvie</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Astrid&nbsp;Ogilvie</div> <div class="imageTitle">Chap 5 Fig 12</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1446308/1446308_10322579_1477760084782_Chap5Fig18--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1446308/1446308_10322579_1477760084782_Chap5Fig18--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Chap 5 Fig 18"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1446308/1446308_10322579_1477760084782_Chap5Fig18--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Chap 5 Fig 18"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Geothermal area in the Mývatn region with Bjarnaflag power station in the distance.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Astrid Ogilvie</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Astrid&nbsp;Ogilvie</div> <div class="imageTitle">Chap 5 Fig 18</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1446308/1446308_10322579_1477760357113_Chap5Fig13--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1446308/1446308_10322579_1477760357113_Chap5Fig13--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Chap 5 Fig 13"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1446308/1446308_10322579_1477760357113_Chap5Fig13--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Chap 5 Fig 13"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dairy cows enjoying the water at Lake Grænavatn, a small lake to the south of Lake Myvatn.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Astrid Ogilvie</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Astrid&nbsp;Ogilvie</div> <div class="imageTitle">Chap 5 Fig 13</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
