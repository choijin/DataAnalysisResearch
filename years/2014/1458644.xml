<AbstractNarration>This project will award scholarships to 26 students, in three cohorts, in the following STEM disciplines: Biology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics. In its selection, the college will take heightened interest in academically-promising underrepresented minority and first-generation students with financial need. By carefully targeting recruitment efforts and providing mentoring during the first two years at college, the project will create a constructive environment to nurture students in order to increase retention and persistence in their chosen STEM majors. The project will increase the number of talented STEM majors with the potential to contribute to the advancement of knowledge in a broad range of scientific endeavors, and will train a diverse group of students for eventual employment in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to successfully retain students, the project will include a recruitment plan that integrates individualized outreach to students identified in collaboration with Community Based Organizations, enrollment in an exclusive First-Year Seminar taught by STEM faculty, STEM Faculty Liaisons in each of the science departments serving as academic advisors, mentors, and facilitators, and a variety of on- and off-campus learning activities. The project's objectives during the Scholars' first year are: (1) to prepare and support the S-STEM Scholars for a successful undergraduate career, (2) to provide continuing practice for the skills necessary for STEM, and (3) to build and nurture a sense of community among the S-STEM Scholar cohorts. During their sophomore year, each S-STEM Scholar will continue to be closely mentored by their STEM Faculty Liaison advisor, who will support and encourage their participation in various STEM opportunities including faculty-student research, peer-mentoring, colloquia, preferential residence in Gettysburg College's Science House as well as work-related internship opportunities with institutional industry partners. Assessment of the efficacy of these different activities will help contribute to expanding the knowledge base regarding the circumstances under which scholarship projects of this type are successful.</AbstractNarration>
