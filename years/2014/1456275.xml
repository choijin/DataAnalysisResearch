<AbstractNarration>Computation in all its definitions (Computer Science, Computing, Computational Thinking, etc.) is becoming increasingly significant in STEM and non-STEM disciplines.  Historically, Mathematics has been the discipline seen as required by all other disciplines.  Computer Science faculty are wrestling with determining whether there is a single approach to infusing computation in other disciplines or whether there are many approaches. Coupled with the increased computational ability of students in other disciplines, it is known that interdisciplinary courses are more appealing to underrepresented groups.  Ideally, the Computer Science community would be provided with a set of validated approaches to interdisciplinary education. In order to reach this goal, the community must investigate the educational value of various approaches.  This workshop seeks to begin cataloging experiences to attain that goal.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this collaborative proposal a number of PIs from different college level institutions (research university, technology focused university, four-year engineering college, and four-year liberal arts college) will cooperate on holding a workshop where a number of different approaches to cross-disciplinary education will be investigated.  This workshop will gather a number of faculty who have attempted such courses. The outcome will be a report that outlines approaches to computational interdisciplinary courses.  This report will be made widely available.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Computer science (CS) is playing an increasingly significant role in many other disciplines, reaching beyond the traditional sciences to fields such as sociology, history, education, and economics. Currently, towards addressing the need to prepare students to make cross-disciplinary advances, most universities and colleges implement several alternatives: a student completes (1) courses in CS that include or focus on projects from discipline X, (2) a major in CS and a minor (or several courses) in discipline X, or (3) 1-2 courses in CS+X taught by a CS teacher with some knowledge of field X, or a teacher in X with some knowledge of CS. The courses are not truly interdisciplinary, as delivering an interdisciplinary experience requires a co-taught course, including a faculty member from CS and one from another discipline.  While the co-teaching model is attractive, there are many obstacles to successfully employing it.  In order to better understand these difficulties and to collect best practices for such courses, the PIs ran a facilitated workshop at Olin College of Engineering from October 2-3, 2015, which brought together 24 faculty within and outside Computer Science for activities focused on various aspects of teaching interdisciplinary courses. Faculty represented a range of different disciplines in addition to Computer Science such as Music, Biology, Chemistry, Law, and Art.  In order to better characterize how to teach interdisciplinary CS+X courses, we asked each attendee to describe their course through two lenses: the student experience and the faculty experience.  The aggregation of these descriptions into a map of the design space of these courses was created via post hoc analysis of these descriptions by the workshop organizers.  With the data collected, we published a paper as a report of the findings from the collective experience and discussions at the workshop.  The paper was presented at the Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges &mdash; Northeastern Region (CCSCNE 2017).
