<AbstractNarration>Manufacturing and service enterprises consume a significant portion of energy; consequently, they impact the environment and sustainability of our societies. There have been a number of initiatives to improve energy efficiencies of homes and commercial buildings. However, over the last five decades energy productivity in industrial enterprises has not kept pace with the remarkable strides that have been made in improving labor and material productivity. At present, and in the foreseeable future, there are significant opportunities to improve energy productivity in these enterprises by reducing energy waste, using better technologies and techniques for designing and managing their operations. This workshop will provide a critical role in defining a roadmap for research and innovation into improving energy-efficiency of all aspects of manufacturing and service enterprise operations, by bringing together researchers in academia, government, and industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be organized around sessions focused on the following topics: building operations, logistics operations, grid operations, and factory operations. Leading researchers from academia, government and industry will be invited to contribute via keynote addresses and by serving as panelists. In order to ensure significant participation, poster presentations are solicited as well. In addition, breakout sessions will serve to obtain input from participants on short-term and long-term research needs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Workshop: Energy Aware Operations in Manufacturing and Service Enterprises  Manufacturing and service enterprises consume a significant portion of energy; consequently, they impact the environment and sustainability of our societies. There have been a number of initiatives to improve energy efficiencies of homes and commercial buildings. However, over the last five decades energy productivity in industrial enterprises has not kept pace with the remarkable strides that have been made in improving labor and material productivity. At present, and in the foreseeable future, there are significant opportunities to improve energy productivity in these enterprises by reducing energy waste, using better technologies and techniques for designing and managing their operations. This would also include operations of entire energy supply chains including the grid through which energy is transmitted/transported and distributed. It is quite plausible that energy productivity will become an important competitive dimension for industrial enterprises, which can be viewed as a natural evolution towards leaner, cleaner and greener systems. Moreover, increasing customer demand for green products and services, coupled with regulatory pressures are driving the needs for quantum advances in the science and engineering of energy efficient enterprises. Therefore, it is critical for researchers in academia, government and industry to make all aspects of manufacturing and service enterprise operations, including the grids that power their operations, much more energy-efficient.     In September 2014, with support provided by the National Science Foundation, the Pennsylvania State University Marcus Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering hosted a one and a half day workshop focused on identifying future directions and research needs based on current practices and extant research. The workshop was organized around sessions focused on the following four topics: building operations, logistics operations, grid operations, and factory operations. In each of the above topics, leaders from academia, government and industry were invited to contribute through Keynote addresses and by serving as panelists. Each topic had a breakout session for getting input from participants on short-term and long-term research needs as well as to identify university/industry collaborations.     Based on the anticipated future needs, the research directions for future were identified as follows:  For all the three main end-consumers of energy covered in the workshop, i.e,. buildings, logistics and factories, there is a compelling need for models to drive engineering of their operations by leveraging sensing, communication, information, and control technologies.  Future research direction should target end-to-end energy supply chains e.g., models spanning extraction, refinement, generation, distribution, and consumption. This poses several challenges in terms of developing analysis and optimization techniques that can scale to accommodate the size and heterogeneity of the resulting models. Energy generation as well as its distribution are likely to be highly dispersed with resulting systems being operated in a distributed manner. This opens up new questions on how best to engineer and optimize such systems to operate with intelligent consumers. Providing each of the above as-a-service could offer innovative pathways to translate them to practice in a variety of vertical segments such as energy consumer enterprises, researchers, educators, policy makers, and regulators.
