<AbstractNarration>The University of Florida, in collaboration with Clemson University, University of Alabama, Auburn University, Carnegie Mellon University, Rice University, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Winston-Salem State University, propose to extend the work of multiple NSF BPC Alliances (A4RC, ARTSI, EL Alliance) and Demonstration Projects (AARCS) that utilized different strategies toward broadening the participation of African-Americans in computing sciences. Although these previous alliances and demonstration projects differed with respect to implementation strategies, they all had a strong emphasis on mentoring. As such, the newly combined Institute for African-American Mentoring in Computing Sciences (iAAMCS, pronounced "i am cs") will serve as a national resource and emphasize mentoring as the primary strategy for increasing the participation of African-Americans in computing, specifically at the Ph.D. level and beyond. The overarching goal of the iAAMCS is to increase the number of African-Americans obtaining computing sciences doctoral degrees leading to an increase in the number of African-American researchers in the academy, government, and industry. Toward this goal, the iAAMCS Alliance will (1) increase the number of African-American Ph.D. graduates who enter the workforce with a research focus; (2) retain and advance African-American Ph.D. students, faculty and researchers in computing; and (3) develop future African-American leaders with computing expertise in the academy, government, and industry. The iAAMCS will be evaluated by a prestigious advisory committee consisting of experts from computing as well as an external peer evaluation conducted by the new Center for the Evaluation of the Research Pipeline (CERP).</AbstractNarration>

Add more diverse researchers into the advanced technology workforce. Increase the number of African-Americans receiving Ph.D. degrees in computing sciences.   Through working to meet these goals, iAAMCS was able to accomplish many great achievements.

These findings were published in a paper titled "The iAAMCS Ecosystem Retaining Blacks/African-Americans in CS PhD Programs", which was recognized with a Best Paper Award at RESPECT 2020.              Three organizations were involved as partners: BDPA, CMD-IT, and The National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT). These organizations offered nonprofit support in the ways of facilities, conference support, financial support, and recruitment help.              Throughout the project, a number of valuable findings have been acquired:  There is a general void for educational and professional development opportunities for African-Americans in, or who want to be in, computing. With some exception, computing departments struggle to diversify their applicant pool for PhD programs and faculty positions.  While there may be a growing interest to mentoring African-American computing students, there is a lack of awareness of how to best do it. Higher education institutions, governmental agencies (i.e., local, state, and federal), and corporate entities are equally excited to partner with an organization like iAAMCS. iAAMCS is viewed as a trusted and committed organization for those in need of programmatic services as either a participant or a beneficiary. Programs through iAAMCS (National Society for Blacks in Computing Conference, Distinguished Fellowship Writing Workshop, Distributed Research Experiences for Undergraduates, Collaborative Research Experiences for Undergraduates, Future Faculty and Research Scientist Mentoring Program, Distinguished Lecture Series, and the Morehouse-Spelman Virtual Mentoring Program) have all shown high satisfaction rates among participants, and high potential that participants would apply for graduate school in computing. iAAMCS is a touch-point for 90% of African-Americans in computing PhD programs. A committed organization focused on African-Americans in computing can outpace the growth of computing programs across the United States. The programming of iAAMCS is well received by participants.               Overall, the finding that iAAMCS has a significant impact on the retention of Black/African-American CS PhD students will likely impact the recruitment, retention, and graduation of these students. The growth in visibility of iAAMCS as a national resource for faculty searches has had a 2,929% positive change. Furthermore, the participation and enrollment in computing science programs has had a 272% positive growth through the iAAMCS.
