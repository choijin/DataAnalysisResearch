<AbstractNarration>The project will contribute to academic research into the  connections between science and art with the intent to make an original contribution to the growing body of research that explores the use of scientific data in art. Specifically, the artist will use data gathered by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory to inform a range of works, including data-based sound installations.</AbstractNarration>
