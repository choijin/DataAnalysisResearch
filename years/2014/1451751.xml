<AbstractNarration>Successful communication requires not just choosing the correct words and grammar, but also emphasizing the right words, pausing in appropriate locations, and using appropriate intonation and rhythm.  This aspect of language is called prosody and it can convey important information about the syntactic structure of a sentence, which words in the conversation are given and new, and which aspects of the sentence are important.  Understanding the rules for how prosody is used is important for building artificial speech systems that produce and understand natural language, designing interventions for individuals with speech disorders, and creating curriculum for language learners.  A challenge for the field is the fact that the acoustic cues that signal which words are emphasized and where prosodic boundaries occur are highly variable, changing across both speakers and contexts.  This variability is pervasive, yet researchers know very little about how the brain accommodates it.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The special theme of this conference is understanding how speakers navigate pervasive variability in how prosody is realized in natural speech. Prosodic information varies significantly due to physiological and language-internal factors, dialect, idiosyncratic speaker preferences, and speech context. As a result, prosodic features lack acoustic cues that are constant across contexts. Nonetheless, human language users can readily use prosodic information in conversation. This puzzle constitutes one of the fundamental issues in prosody research. New approaches to these problems have recently emerged both in linguistic research on prosody and neighboring fields such as speech perception and recognition. The goal of this conference is to bring prosody researchers together with researchers in neighboring fields to discuss problems in prosodic variability.  With invited speakers and participants from theoretical linguistics, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, phonetics, phonology, language acquisition and computer science, this meeting attempts to provide a holistic picture of prosodic variability and a venue for discussions that may lead to solving this core question in prosody research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Language is typically studied in terms of the words and sentences we choose, but there are other aspects of language that are equally important.  How we say an utterance can be just as important in conveying meaning as what we say.  This aspect of language, which includes the intonation, stress, and rhythym of language, is called prosody.   This workshop focused on the question of how listeners cope with variability in the prosodic signal.  Prosody is typically signaled by phonetic features such as speech rate, pitch, and loudness, but cues to a speaker's prosody can vary depending on many different factors, including dialect, speaker differences, and even noisy environments.   Seven researchers who study language from perspectives in psychology, linguistics, and computer science presented work that directly addressed questions of prosodic variability.  Ths workshop not only provided a venue for interdisiciplinary discussions on an important topic in language processing, it also provided training opportunities for students in state of the art methods in language and speech research.  Ultimately, the work and collaborations that come out of this confernece have the potential to improve teaching prosody in second language contexts, better understanding and treating atypical prosody use in populations with language disorders, and improving prosodic production and comprehension in artificial language systems.
