<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the Triangle Lectures in Combinatorics (http://www.math.ncsu.edu/TLC).  These are one-day (Saturday) conferences, held once a semester.  Each conference brings four outstanding mathematicians from around the country to give talks about significant and exciting developments in combinatorics. The Triangle Lectures in Combinatorics workshops play numerous roles: they enhance the national infrastructure for research and education by creating and strengthening a regional network of interacting researchers; facilitate the dissemination of cutting-edge research ideas, methods and results among researchers in the Southeastern United States; promote the teaching and training of graduate students by exposing them to the perspectives of leading researchers; increase awareness and understanding of combinatorics, on the part of faculty and students in the Southeast; support the development of young faculty at various schools and help them build local support and research networks; broaden participation of underrepresented groups, particularly women; and foster research interactions among participants, leading to new research results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics is a growing and important area of mathematics.  The focus of combinatorics is the structure of discrete (as opposed to continuous) sets of objects.  Combinatorics is critical to many areas of mathematics, and plays a key role in computational, scientific, and engineering applications.  The states of North Carolina, Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky, and Tennessee have significant research strength in combinatorics and adjacent areas.  In particular, there are remarkably many tenure-track researchers, senior researchers, postdoctoral scholars, and graduate students in combinatorics and related fields at various colleges and universities within driving distance of the Research Triangle region of North Carolina (Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill).  A relatively large proportion of these researchers are from underrepresented groups.  The lecture series provides valuable opportunities for interactions among these researchers.</AbstractNarration>

By providing four high-quality talks in one day, the conferences make it practical for researchers who might otherwise be quite isolated to interact with other researchers from across the Southeast.  Four conferences were supported by the grant.  Details on these conferences are given below.  Fourteenth meeting:  Saturday November 19, 2016 at NCSU Speakers: Bruno Benedetti (U. Miami), Maria Chudnovsky (Princeton),  Jeffery Lagarias (U. Michigan), Josephine Yu (Georgia Tech). Organizing Committee: Ricky Liu (NCSU), Seth Sullivant (NCSU), and Cynthia Vinzant (NCSU)  Thirteenth meeting: Saturday February 27, 2016 at UNC Greensboro Speakers:  Penny Haxell (U. Waterloo), Jeff Kahn (Rutgers), Greta Panova (U. Penn), Peter Winkler (Dartmouth). Organizing Committee: Clifford Smyth, chair (UNC Greensboro), David Galvin (Notre Dame), and Patricia Hersh (NCSU).  Twelfth meeting: Saturday October 3, 2015 at Duke Speakers:  Yuliy Baryshnikov (UIUC),  Susan Holmes (Stanford), Dana Randall (Georgia Tech), and John Shareshian (Washington University in St. Louis).

Organizing Committee: Lindsay Piechnik (chair, High Point), Ed Allen (Wake Forest), Sarah Mason (Wake Forest), Seth Sullivant (NCSU), and Laurie Zack (High Point)       Intellectual merit: The conferences:   Provide "activation energy" to overcome the inertia which otherwise prevents researchers from driving for several hours to interact with colleagues; Help combinatorialists from across the Southeast learn about some of the most significant and most exciting developments in combinatorics, thereby providing enrichment and appropriate targeting to the research efforts of the community; Introduce graduate, postdoctoral students, and tenure track faculty at small colleges to top research within geographic reach; Facilitate supportive interaction between the broader research community and tenure-track and recently tenured combinatorialists who may otherwise be isolated.      Broader impacts: The conferences:    Enhance the national infrastructure for research and education by creating and strengthening a regional network of interacting researchers;    Facilitate the dissemination of cutting-edge research ideas, methods and results among researchers in the Southeastern United States;    Promote the teaching and training of graduate students by exposing them to the perspectives of leading researchers;    Increase awareness and understanding of combinatorics, on the part of faculty and students in the Southeast;    Support the development of young faculty at small colleges and Ph.D. granting institutions to help them build local support and research networks;    Broaden participation of underrepresented groups, particularly women;    Foster research interactions among participants, leading to new research results.
