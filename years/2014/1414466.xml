<AbstractNarration>The Center for Chemistry at the Space-Time Limit (CaSTL) focuses on the development of novel science that can be used to observe and record motions of molecules at the atomic and chemical bond level. This set of new tools, collectively known as the chemiscope, will reveal new insights by visualizing the motions of atoms within molecules as they vibrate, form new bonds or catalyze chemical reactions. The investigators are paying special attention to the details of the process by which solar energy is converted to chemical forms of energy, hoping to catch this crucial energy conversion event in the act, in real time. The work is having a broader impact through the development of new technologies for visualizing chemical events on a very fine scale, and also through the dissemination of their results in a variety of public media. The work is furthering innovation through the invention of new scientific tools that are being moved toward commercial development.  In addition to directly contributing to the educational development of students involved in the center's research, CaSTL organizes and participates in a variety of formal and informal science education activities, targeting audiences with varying educational backgrounds. Examples include summer schools for the broader chemistry community, the California State Summer School for Math and Science (COSMOS) aimed at high school students, and a variety of informal science education activities, such as an afterschool program at the Boys and Girls Club.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During this funding period, CaSTL will continue development of an all-optical version of a working chemiscope, along with versions that combine optics with scan probe microscopes, and the ultimate observation of molecular motions and transformations on a femtosecond-Angstrom spatiotemporal scale. The group is moving toward application of this tool to specific chemical problems, in particular plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis. The excitation of collective electrons, the formation of hot electrons, their thermalization and scattering on interfaces, injection of electrons or holes into catalytic molecular centers and the subsequent breaking and making of bonds are targeted for capturing in space-time. Through time-resolved photoelectron emission microscopy (tr-PEEM) and 2-photon photoemission (tr-2PP) on catalytic metal clusters and hetero-structures, they are working to fully characterize the space-time dynamics initiated on the metal side upon excitation of plasmons. The complete time course of the photocatalyzed molecular transformation on the surface side is made possible using space-time-resolved surface-enhanced nonlinear coherent spectroscopy. Theoretical investigations are being used to guide the development and refinement of capabilities of this unique toolset. A complete understanding of photo-physics and chemistry ranging from small molecules implicated in catalysis to engineered mesoscale structures for devices is envisioned as a result of the center's work.</AbstractNarration>

The required &Aring;-scale resolution in optical microscopy is attained using a plasmonic lens to focus light and chemical identity is established by the color of the scattered light. This ability to "see" inside molecules is accomplished through tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) in the atomistic near-field (ANF), illustrated in Figure 1. The development has opened up the pico-scale in optical microscopy (picoscopy), which beside chemically selective imaging (chemiscope), contains dynamical information that may be extracted either from the spectral domain (hyperspectral imaging) or through real-time measurements (molecular videography). The latter is accomplished through plasmon mediated coherent Raman scattering, and has been employed to follow the isomerization reaction of a single molecule in real-space and real-time, with joint &Aring;-fs resolution, realizing the founding vision of the Center on Chemistry at the Space-Time Limit. These are a sampling of methods and paradigms developed to see chemistry in action, an atom-at-a-time.</p> <p>Seeing is a primer toward control and manipulation &shy;&ndash; atomistic resolution allows atomistic engineering. With access to the electro-mechanical inner workings of molecules, the ultimate limit in miniaturization is attained by the invention of single-molecule devices: A diatomic CO molecule attached to a silver tip is emblematic of a complete device that combines sensor, transducer and readout, which has been deployed to map out the electrostatic potential energy surfaces of molecules, as illustrated in Figure 2. A single-molecule multi-throw conductance switch; a rectifying antenna to convert light into direct current; and the directional intramolecular photo-current in a polyatomic serving as a single-molecule diode, as the building block of opto-electronic logic circuits, are demonstrated examples.&nbsp;In effect, the picoscale in optics and photonics has been translated in CaSTL to the picoscale in devices and electronics, heralding the post-nano era of picoscience.</p> <p>The &Aring;-limit in optical microscopy also establishes the atomic limit in confinement of the photon. Unlike the diffraction limit in free space, the confinement of electromagnetic fields guided by surface plasmons is only limited by the dimensions of the guiding structure.

The interconversion of light to matter has profound implications by connecting physics and chemistry and unifying photonics and electronics under the umbrella of quantum plasmonics. In this regard, generation of novel quasi particles that carry spin texture that mimics magnetic matter, as in Figure 3, is another fundamental aspect of space-time resolved imaging and control of matter on the nano-femto scale.
