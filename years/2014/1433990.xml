<AbstractNarration>Males often use conspicuous signals to attract females but, in doing so, they may also attract the unwanted attention of parasites. How does one species come to have the ability to eavesdrop on the signals of other species? This project will address this question integrating multiple levels of analysis (behavioral, acoustical, biomechanical, and physiological) in laboratory and field experiments to comprehensively investigate eavesdropping behavior in of midges that home-in on the calls of singing frogs. This investigation will characterize the midge's ear and relate the midge's hearing ability to its evolutionary origins. This project will ultimately determine the sensory and behavioral adaptations driven the ecology and evolution of eavesdropping in frog-biting midges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project will address a long-standing biological mystery by exploring the origins of eavesdropping of between animal species. By examining an evolutionary innovations in insect hearing, this study will have implications for microphone design, bioacoustics and the co-evolution of sexual and exploitive communication. In addition, the midge-frog system has parallels to the mosquito-human relationship, which enlarges the evolutionary scope of the questions addressed here. Overall, understanding the mechanisms underlying the evolution and sensory ecology of eavesdropping will increase our understanding of exploitation in animal communication systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Training of undergraduate and graduate students in cutting edge techniques in animal communication and neuroethology will be an important component of this project. Additional educational activities will include workshops at elementary schools about frog calling behavior and eavesdroppers to generate interest and enthusiasm about animal behavior and science in general.</AbstractNarration>

We also developed and implemented outreach activities highlighting biodiversity and the worldwide decline of amphibians with emphasis on animal behavior. Our outreach efforts reached over 5,000 people during five years mainly in the United States (Indiana) but also in Panama. We also created two complete lesson plans in which we support implementation by teachers at their classrooms. Both lesson plans meet several of the requirements of the Science Indiana Core Academic Curriculum Standards. The first lesson plan targets middle school (6-8 grades) and includes a three-day interactive plan about Wetlands and Anurans in which students spend time with experts in the field and work on an interactive project with an artist. We implemented this lesson plan with raving reviews from teachers. In addition, in collaboration with a teacher supported by this grant, we developed, implemented and published a lesson plan for high school to help students obtain a deeper understanding of the nature of science. The teacher and students participating in this lesson provided positive feedback and we hope additional teachers will use this lesson plan as it has been published at journal for teachers&rsquo; activities.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/25/2020<br>      Modified by: Ximena&nbsp;Bernal</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1433990/1433990_10235734_1598365805170_IntellectualMeritforall_Eavesdroppingflies--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1433990/1433990_10235734_1598365805170_IntellectualMeritforall_Eavesdroppingflies--rgov-800width.jpg" title="IM for general public"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1433990/1433990_10235734_1598365805170_IntellectualMeritforall_Eavesdroppingflies--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="IM for general public"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Overview of the main findings of work funded by this grant</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ximena Bernal</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ximena&nbsp;Bernal</div> <div class="imageTitle">IM for general public</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1433990/1433990_10235734_1598365921251_Broaderimpactsforall_Eavesdroppingflies--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1433990/1433990_10235734_1598365921251_Broaderimpactsforall_Eavesdroppingflies--rgov-800width.jpg" title="BI for general public"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1433990/1433990_10235734_1598365921251_Broaderimpactsforall_Eavesdroppingflies--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="BI for general public"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Overview of the broader impact of the work funded by this grant.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ximena Bernal</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ximena&nbsp;Bernal</div> <div class="imageTitle">BI for general public</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
