<AbstractNarration>As cities grow larger and more species of animals make their homes in urban habitats, it becomes increasingly important to understand the effects of city life on animal health.  Parasite infections can have significant impacts on animal survival and physiology, and urban habitats may change parasite infections in several ways.  For example, urban habitats may change both the stressors that animals experience and their immune resistance to parasites.  However, little is known about parasites in urban vs non-urban populations of vertebrate animals, including how they affect animal health and whether urban animals have different levels of stress hormones or immunity to parasites. This research will provide critical knowledge about the parasites that birds must withstand in order to survive in urban areas, which will inform future conservation efforts in urban habitats. This work will also help protect human health, since urban birds are potential reservoirs of human diseases; for example, urban birds are more likely to be infected with West Nile Virus than non-urban birds. Understanding what parasites urban birds are infected by, and what physiological states are associated with these infections, can help us better prevent disease spread from birds to humans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to better understand the effects of urbanization on parasitism and host physiology, the researchers will study a songbird, the Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis), from multiple cities and non-urban habitats across California.  Previous research has found considerable variation in phenotype and parasitism between an urban and neighboring non-urban population of juncos. In a non-urban population, there was higher prevalence of parasites that require vectors for transmission. In the neighboring urban population, there was greater prevalence and intensity of directly and environmentally transmitted parasites, including an intestinal parasite, coccidia (Isospora sp.). Urban hosts also differed in endocrine physiology from non-urban birds. This project will combine extensive field surveys and aviary experiments to test 1) whether urbanization consistently results in these same patterns for environmentally transmitted versus vector-borne parasites; and 2) whether the observed difference in coccidia infection intensity between the urban and non-urban populations is due to traits of the host (relating to stress response and immune function) or traits of the parasite. By combining approaches from disease ecology and eco-immunology, this project will address the critical links among habitat characteristics, parasitism, and host phenotypes.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Urban environments make up an increasing proportion of the earth&rsquo;s surface. Species that can thrive in urban habitats are likely to persist, despite worldwide declines in biodiversity. However, the ecology of urban species is still relatively poorly understood. Here, we investigate the challenges and opportunities of living in urban habitats from two perspectives: stress physiology and disease ecology. We focus on populations of a common songbird, the dark-eyed junco (<em>Junco hyemalis</em>), which has recently colonized urban habitats across parts of its range. To study the stress physiology and disease ecology of these birds, we combined a large-scale field survey and an aviary experiment. Broadly, we hypothesized that glucocorticoid hormone response to acute stress would be reduced in urban environments, because of habituation to the high frequency of anthropogenic disturbances. We also hypothesized that incidence of infection with different taxa of parasites could depend on the mode of disease transmission. Specifically, directly-transmitted parasites might increase in urban areas due to increased host density, while vector-borne parasites might decrease in urban areas due to destruction of vector habitat. In the field survey, we found that urbanization alone did not predict glucocorticoid stress response. However, the most recently-colonized urban populations did exhibit an attenuated stress response. Incidence of infection by several parasites was lower in urban juncos, but these differences (among taxa of parasite) were not predicted by parasite transmission mode. In the aviary experiment, we manipulated frequency of disturbance for captive juncos to understand the causal impacts of disturbance itself. We found that frequently disturbed birds exhibited an attenuated glucocorticoid response to acute stress. From an immunological perspective, these birds also displayed an altered cytokine response to acute stress. These results show that glucocorticoid phenotype and cytokine profile are flexible in adult juncos, which could enable faster adaptation to urban habitats. Overall, we conclude that urban juncos experience difference parasite pressures than non-urban juncos, some urban populations have attenuated glucocorticoid stress response, and high-disturbance environments can cause adult juncos to attenuate their glucocorticoid stress response. These results improve our understanding of parasitism and physiology of urban animals, which can inform future urban planning and conservation efforts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/30/2018<br>      Modified by: Rachel&nbsp;Hanauer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
