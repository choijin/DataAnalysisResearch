<AbstractNarration>Recent reports have drawn attention to the challenges the computer science education community is facing producing diverse and qualified graduates to satisfy current and projected workforce needs.  This two-day workshop brings together leaders in the computing science education community to discuss the current state of computer science education, identify challenges faced by computer science educators, and identify innovative approaches to address these challenges.  Participants come from a diverse range of schools including research universities, small liberal arts colleges and community colleges. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The result is a report that summarizes the challenges and approaches identified at the workshop. The publication adds to the current body of knowledge in computer science education by providing focus and direction to research efforts over the next five years. The report will be disseminated via the Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) mailing list that reaches over 5,000 educators across the country.  It will additionally be presented and discussed at the annual SIGCSE and regional computer science education conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Traditional computer science education focuses primarily on disciplinary  knowledge. The community has kept up-to-date with innovation and advancements,  and has been remarkably successful in maintaining the technical pertinence of  relevant curricula and has been effective in educating software professionals. With  the ever-increasing integration of technology in all aspects of people's daily lives,  moving forward, efforts associated with computing education must demonstrate  and establish the wide-ranging relevance of our discipline and help impart the  essence of computing knowledge to the general public. In the immediate term, we  should focus on the diversification of our curriculum and on the needs of current  and future students. It is critical to assess the needs of students in other disciplines  with regard to computing so that they can be provided with the knowledge and tools  they need to be successful and thrive in the workforce and contribute to society.   The goal of this work is to foster novel, transformative approaches to solve long-standing issues in computer science education and to provide a roadmap for accompishing this important task.   But how to accomplish this? Our approach has been to organize a workshop with computer science education thought leaders, bringing them together to discuss these issues and having them discuss and debate from a wide variety of points of view. Their ideas have been melded together into the final report.             Last Modified: 06/13/2016       Submitted by: Andrew Bernat]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
