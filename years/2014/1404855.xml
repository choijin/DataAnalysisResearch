<AbstractNarration>Twenty two community college oceanography faculty will be supported to attend a workshop and participate in a session at a 2014 joint conference of the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO), The Oceanography Society (TOS) and the Oceans Section of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The workshop will focus on teaching ocean sciences at Two Year Colleges (2YC) and the conference is a bi-annual, joint meeting that brings together a large percentage of the national and international oceanographic science community.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Community colleges are a critical part of our educational system, and serve almost half (or approximately 8.2 million) of all U.S. undergraduate students (National Science Foundation, 2012). Further, these programs serve a substantial portion of minority students, with 32% of students enrolled in community colleges being an ethnic minority and 61% being female (American Association of Community Colleges, 2012). Yet, community college faculties rarely have access to professional development funds that allow for national conference attendance and the critical interactions that lead to higher quality instruction (Geo2YC Workshop, 2010). Community college oceanography faculty face some startling challenges in their classrooms, including lack of access to current scientific research, lack of equipment, and an extremely large range in student interest and abilities in one course section. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to encourage teaching of ocean sciences at 2YC and the development of connections between 2YC faculty and ocean scientists, a workshop on teaching oceanography will be held prior to the conference and a session on "Undergraduate ocean science education in the 21st century: an exploration of successful practices" will be held during the conference. This effort also contributes to the development of educational communities that will make use of Ocean Observing Initiative data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ocean 2YC: Expanding the Community of Oceanography Faculty at Two Year Colleges  Building on the success of the 2013 meeting, this project brought together twenty-six two year college faculty to the 2014 Ocean Sciences meeting. This assembly was an important step in continuing to build the Ocean Science 2YC community.  While in Honolulu, members of the Ocean2YC group participated in a workshop focusing on Oceanography teaching resources and practices in two-year colleges. The workhsop explored successful models for teaching oceanography topics to non-majors.  Topics discussed included: using on-line data, the role of visualizations, in-class lecture demos, interactive activities, active learning, and research opportunities for 2YC students.  Faculty also participated in discussions and interactive gallery walks to share their own ideas on challenges specific to 2YCs and ideas for overcoming them. Several participants also presented their own successful projects and strategies.  All participants were invited to contribute to a "share fair" of resources.  During the Ocean Sciences conference, we sponsored a special session on Undergraduate ocean science education in the 21st century: an exploration of successful practices that included 16 oral and 21 poster presentations.  Two year college faculty took full advantage of the Ocean Sciences Conference, attending daily plenary sessions, a workshop on writing NSF science education proposals, sessions on effectively communicating science, and special sessions on a range of ocean research and education topics.   Participants of the workshop and Ocean Sciences Conference found the experience to be very beneficial.  IN a post-meeting evaluation and survey, several particapants expreseed that the most valuable aspect of this meeting was the collaboration and networking that it afforded as well as re-connecting with current research in oceanography. Multiple respondants also highlighted the need for these "face to face" meetings to reduce the feeling of isolation from being in single-faculty or very small departments and that they felt re-energized about teaching at the 2YC level and excited to try some new ideas with their students.
