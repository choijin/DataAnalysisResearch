<AbstractNarration>Capsule robots are pill-sized devices that leverage extreme miniaturization to operate in environments that are out of reach for larger robots. In medicine, capsule robots can enter the human body through natural orifices or small incisions, and perform endoscopy and surgery while minimizing the invasiveness of the procedure. If successful, this research will have an impact on millions of Americans by enabling painless colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening, allowing pediatric patients to benefit from minimally invasive surgery, and improving the current complication rate in radical prostatectomy. In this project, research in capsule robotics is being integrated with education and outreach by involving three tiers of students, from high school to graduate level. Students will have the opportunity to experiment with a capsule robot educational toolkit and will get first-hand exposure to this new technology. Visits to middle and high schools are being organized to convey the excitement for engineering and robotics, encouraging young minds to engage in STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to characterize fundamental principles at the intersection of robotics, magnetism, and control which will enable intelligent capsule robots to amplify the diagnostic and interventional capabilities of gastroenterologists and surgeons.  Through this project, the science and application of capsule robot architectures, real-time control, and teleoperation of magnetic pill-size devices will be advanced. Further, computationally efficient approximations of the magnetic field and models for capsule-tissue interaction, combined with miniature wireless electronics, will enable proprioceptive sensing techniques that can be effectively adopted in clinical settings. For the first time in magnetically manipulated capsule robots, environmental awareness and proprioceptive sensing will be leveraged to explore the full spectrum of human-robot interaction. This research will advance medical science as well by enabling new diagnostic and therapeutic procedures targeting organs deep inside the human body.</AbstractNarration>

Capsule robots are pill-size devices that leverage extreme miniaturization to operate in environments that are out of reach for larger robots. In medicine, capsule robots can enter the human body through natural orifices or small incisions, and perform endoscopy and surgery while minimizing the invasiveness of the procedure. A main clinical focus of research is improving the procedure required for colon rectal cancer screening, i.e. colonoscopy. While colonoscopy is challenging and takes specific training, case volume, and time to master, prior studies show that actuating a colonoscope using magnetic fields is more difficult owing to the lack of direct physical coupling between actuation-unit and the driven device as well as the high-gradient, non-linear nature, and unintuitive shaping of magnetic fields. In recent years, our group has developed two real-time localization approaches that are compatible with -- and can improve -- magnetic colonoscopy. While these function well under constrained conditions, we have found two challenges through our experiments: (1) performance is closely tied to initial conditions, meaning that the capsule has to be carefully initialized to a known orientation before operation, which is not ideal for a clinical setting and (2) owing to the magnetic field of the external magnet being identical around the central radius of any cylindrical magnet, if the capsule is in such (singular) locations, the accuracy of the localization system degrades significantly. This is because the magnetic field vector, which is an input to the localization algorithm, is indistinguishable when moving radially along a circle of any radius around the center of the external magnet. If the capsule is either driven in configurations where it does not enter this singular region, as we have done in the past, or workarounds are used, such as assuming a fixed z-position of the capsule, then this issue may be avoided; however, this is not a practical solution for a product that we wish to translate into clinical use. Therefore, to overcome these challenges, we have developed a new localization system. The system is augmented with an electromagnetic coil that is mounted on the external permanent magnet such their dipole moments are orthogonal. Since magnetic fields follow the principle of superposition, simply creating another static magnetic field using the coil would only rotate the existing region of singularity instead of eliminating it. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between the field of the permanent magnet and the coil. To this end, a time-varying magnetic field is generated by the coil that is weak enough to not physically affect the motion of the capsule but strong enough to be detected by its sensors. This achievement allowed us to secure additional funding to support first-in-human trials for our robotic colonoscopy platform. </span><strong></strong><em></em></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/19/2019<br>      Modified by: Pietro&nbsp;Valdastri</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1453129/1453129_10348307_1552988390298_2447-MARK_WEBSTER_photography(2)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1453129/1453129_10348307_1552988390298_2447-MARK_WEBSTER_photography(2)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The STORM Lab robotic colonoscopy platform"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1453129/1453129_10348307_1552988390298_2447-MARK_WEBSTER_photography(2)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The STORM Lab robotic colonoscopy platform"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The STORM Lab robotic colonoscopy platform</div> <div class="imageCredit">University of Leeds</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Pietro&nbsp;Valdastri</div> <div class="imageTitle">The STORM Lab robotic colonoscopy platform</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
