<AbstractNarration>Fronts form barriers that limit the exchange of nutrients and organisms between different water masses in the ocean. This study will investigate if wave breaking can intensify mixing at fronts between an expanding fresh water river plume and the ambient salt water offshore.  The work will also contribute to the general understanding of wave-breaking and near-surface turbulence, which influence a myriad processes in the ocean. The project will support one graduate student and several outreach efforts which include maintaining a research blog and producing a video segment which will be hosted by the Applied Physics Laboratory/University of Washington website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use a novel wave-turbulence measurement platform to quantify the transformation of wave energy as it passes through a river plume front and interior, as well as the impact of wave-breaking turbulence on the dynamics and mixing of the plume. The overarching hypothesis is that plume velocity gradients can intensify wave breaking, converting wave energy to turbulence, and significantly increasing plume mixing in systems where the wave scales match the vertical plume scale. The plan is to test this hypothesis by pursuing the following three specific objectives using new and existing field data: 1) quantify the loss of wave energy via breaking at fronts and within river plumes, 2) quantify the generation of near-surface turbulence during wave breaking and the vertical structure of this turbulence, and 3) assess the impact of wave breaking turbulence on mixing in river plumes. Measurements of waves, near-surface turbulence, and buoyancy flux will be done in the moderate-sized Fraser River plume (British Columbia, Canada) and the smaller-sized Elwha River plume (Washington, USA) under a range of wave conditions. Results from these measurements will be compared with existing wave and turbulence data from the much larger Columbia River plume to determine how wave-turbulence dynamics are influenced by frontal strength in different systems. The impact of this process on mixing will be assessed using drifter-based salt budgets as well as analysis of more than a decade of ferry transect data through the Fraser River plume</AbstractNarration>

This research project investigated the processes by which surface waves influence the fate of river discharge in the coastal ocean. We focus specifically on processes that influence the rate that river water mixes with coastal ocean water, since that determines the concentrations of river-borne matter, and the transport pathways of river water.

Winds from the north, which opposed the northward tendency of the plume, caused the plume to flow into the receiving waters as a narrower, deeper and faster plume, relative to low wind conditions when the plume spread widely to the north. Since the rate that the plume mixes with ambient coastal water depends on the spreading rate, this tendency was a primary control on the location and intensity of plume mixing. We found that mixing due to wave breaking turbulence was secondary in the Fraser River plume.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Small river outflows that directly enter the surf zone, where waves break near the shore, are a common feature of the world's coastlines. Breaking waves release their energy and momentum in the surf zone, causing it to be energetic and turbulent, yet retentive, as surf zone cross-shore exchange is small on average. Thus, river water and river-borne material may become trapped in the surf zone. Trapped fresh river water is subject to energetic alongshore circulation and turbulence, and may be transported away from the river mouth, undergoing wave-driven mixing.</p> <p><br />We used observations from the Quinault River (see Figure), which flows into an energetic surf zone on Quinault Indian Nation land north of Grays Harbor, WA, to investigate the interaction between river and wave forcing in the surf zone. By synthesizing data from moorings, drifters, and Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) video, we developed a conceptual model of this interaction based on river forcing, wave forcing, and the bathymetry near the river mouth.

Second, at high tide during low wave forcing, bathymetric effects can allow the river water to bypass wave forcing. In this case minimal wave breaking occurs in the channel and river water escapes onto the shelf. Based on the discharge, wave, and tidal conditions, we used the conceptual model to predict the fate of water from the Quinault River over a year, showing that approximately 70% of the annual river discharge is initially trapped in the surf zone upon exiting the river mouth.

When river discharge was high, the surf zone was filled with freshwater and there was very little mixing.
