<AbstractNarration>The evolutionary relationships among species of animals, plants, fungi and microbes is a large, complex, branching network that biologists call the Tree of Life. Obtaining the complete Tree of Life for all living things is a grand challenge in science, on the same intellectual scale as investigating the nature of matter or the origin of the universe: it is fundamental to understanding our world, central to human sustainability, and critical as a framework for future discovery. Scientists have made major progress toward this challenge by combining biology with computer science and successfully generating large genealogies of thousands and even millions of species. These large phylogenetic trees are now available to researchers in many branches of biology -- from genomics to ecology -- and have great promise for applied science in medicine, agriculture, industry, and climate-change mitigation. It is critical that scientists develop a future vision for this area of scientific exploration and make clear the central role of phylogenetics in the strategic integration of biodiversity science across US academic, corporate and government institutions. To achieve this vision, this project has developed a three-year program of catalysis meetings and workshops to bring together and enlarge the Tree of Life community. By uniting a wide range of biologists, computational experts, and representatives from corporate entities, foundations, and government agencies, the meeting series will generate a mechanism for scientific input into the strategic vision of biodiversity science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops series will impact many areas of research involving biodiversity and evolution by addressing three over-arching goals: (1) identifying challenges and progress in generating, storing and visualizing the genealogy of life, (2) integrating large data layers with the tree of life, and (3) developing a clear plan and compelling vision for the future of phylogenetic biology. The workshops and catalysis meetings will include students and early-career scientists, as well as educators and members of key corporate, government and non-profit organizations, with the aim to create new, lasting partnerships that bridge across interest groups. Tangible products of the meetings will include educational materials, publications that highlight broader uses of Tree of Life as well as advances in software that will be open source and available to a wide audience. At completion of the workshop series the participants will produce a white paper discussing ideas and challenges for long-term sustainability of biodiversity data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant developed the FuturePhy Project, a three-year program of conferences, workshops and coding hackathons focused on the Tree of Life, the branching network refecting how all living things are related to one another.  The project brought groups of scientists together to promote novel, integrative data analyses and visualization, interdisciplinary syntheses of phylogenetic sciences, and cross-cutting uses of phylogenetics to develop and address new research questions and applications.  This conference series addressed a grand challenge in biology: to generate and fully exploit large, densely sampled phylogenetic trees, and to integrate these trees with rich data sources from biodiversity, biogeography, genomics, development, morphology, ecology and related fields. This synthesis holds the promise to answer major questions in biology, promote effective discovery, conservation, and management of biodiversity resources, and provide a solid foundation for outreach and education. Our aim was to bring together diverse groups of researchers, computational scientists, data visualization experts, and leaders of major phylogenetic initiatives in a series of catalysis meetings, hackathons, and workshops to help provide the evolutionary framework for research and discovery across the life sciences.  Our primary aims and accomplishments were:  Aim 1: Assess progress and organize the community to address remaining challenges in generating, storing, serving and visualizing the genealogy of life.  A series of workshops examined the state of the art of phylogenetics and tree information in a wide range of living things. We succeeded in identifying the state of the tree of life (its richness and resolution) across many animal, plant and microbe groups, and assessed the critical need for new ways to store, serve and visualize trees. Tree visualization was identified as a central tool needed in the future, that could help a wide range of basic and applied sciences, from biodiversity and ecology to agriculture and medicine.   Aim 2: Facilitate data integration with evolutionary trees. Major important questions in ecology, evolution, biodiversity and conservation can be answered by analyzing large data sets in the context of densely sampled and well resolved phylogenetic trees. Our group meetings identified a set of critically important data layers, needing to be assembled and analyzed in the future, to truly realize the power of tree visualization of biological data. These data sources include various traits in the areas of genomics, morphology, function, physiology, development, behavior, symbiosis, coevolution, biogeography and ecology.  Aim 3: Catalyze the future of phylogenetic biology.  We set out to address the question: what benefits and insights will be gained by having a relatively "complete" tree of life that is easy to explore and to link with major data streams? All of our conference participants agreed that such a framework will empower us to answer major biological questions, to foster discovery across the life sciences, and to use the tree as a lens for interpreting the natural world in teaching and outreach.
