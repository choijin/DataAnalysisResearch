<AbstractNarration>A question of current practical concern is how in developing countries integration is achieved between urban and rural sectors of society. For a state to function effectively, mechanisms for efficient social, economic and political linkage must exist. The central goal of this project is to examine how such an urban-rural system emerged. Archaeology is particularly relevant for such a study because it permits processes to be traced over extended periods of time. The fundamental goal of this research is to better understand the phenomenon of low-density urbanism.  With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Lauren Ristvet (University of Pennsylvania), Dr. Hilary Gopnik (Emory University), Dr. Emily Hammer (University of Chicago), and their colleagues will investigate a large, dispersed settlement (ca. 490 ha) dating to the Middle Iron Age (MIA, ca. 800-600 BC) that surrounded the fortress site of Oðlanqala. Researching the relationships between local communities and fortress-based polities in Naxçývan, Azerbaijan can provide an alternative to models of urbanism that focus on high-density cities. Given current concerns about low density urbanism ("sprawl") an investigation of this phenomenon is critical to addressing long term questions of urban form and sustainability. This project has the potential to transform current debates on low-density urbanism, the role of pastoralists in political complexity, and fortress-based polities. The rare opportunity to compare data collected from the careful excavation of a fortress with evidence from excavation and survey of an associated settlement will move the discussion of urbanism from considerations of size and density to an evaluation of how specific economic and social strategies shaped unique political forms. The broad range of evidence considered will contribute to our understanding of the myriad ways that local communities position themselves in relation to dominant powers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous work at Oðlanqala has recast scholarly understanding of the MIA, by revealing a fortress with a hybrid Urartian-local cultural assemblage that led to a reevaluation of the nature of imperial power in the region. Three years of further research will clarify the nature of urbanism in the Iron Age South Caucasus through survey and excavation of the settlement surrounding this fortress.  Researchers will evaluate four models of settlement dynamics that consider the intersection of social variables including population density, spatial segmentation, planning, investment in fortifications, economic integration, and mobility.  A pedestrian survey and magnetometry will analyze settlement layout, density, and land-use patterns to determine how the settlement interacted with its hinterland. Horizontal excavation will study the patterning of activities to evaluate the relationship between households, subsistence pursuits, and political authority. Three emerging scholars will collaborate on stable isotope analysis of the archaeobotanical, faunal, and human remains recovered from excavation, providing insights into agropastoral practices, human and animal mobility, seasonality of occupation, and food provisioning. Finally, stylistic, petrographic, and chemical analyses of ceramics will shed light on production and exchange between the fortress and the settlement. All datasets will be integrated into a 3D GIS recording system being developed specifically for this project, which can be used for future research in a range of disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    With NSF support, the Naxcivan Archaeological Project (NAP), conducted extensive surveys and excavations in Azerbaijan to investigate how local communities of farmers and herders came together to create the earliest states in the Caucasus from ca. 2000 BCE-200 CE.  Understanding how states govern&mdash;how they form, how they incorporate people beyond the ruling class, how they interact with their neighbors, and how they succeed or fail&mdash;is an important research question for archaeologists, political scientists, sociologists, and cultural anthropologists.  The project had hypothesized that the Middle Iron Age (MIA, ca. 800-600 BCE) saw the emergence of a new type of urbanism, characterized by discontinuous settlement, urban fields, and scattered production areas around the large fortress Oglanqala, which looked quite different from the densely-packed cities known from elsewhere in Western Asia (especially Mesopotamia).  To confirm this, we expected to find evidence of dispersed houses in the walled area surrounding Oglanqala in excavation and survey and evidence that some of the people living in these houses were partly nomadic.     Four seasons of excavation at two areas within the Oglanqala-Qizqala settlement and four seasons of survey of the river valleys in northwestern Naxcivan revealed a more complicated picture over a much longer time-span and larger area.  Excavation near Qizqala found extensive Middle Bronze Age (MBA) to Iron Age (IA, ca. 2150-800 BCE) architecture below Medieval levels, including the remains of three buildings (probably houses) and a fortification wall.  Near this settlement area, NAP excavated several MBA burial mounds.  Extensive stable isotope analysis of the human and faunal remains found here allowed NAP to reconstruct what people ate, where they came from, where they traveled, and which seasons animals grazed or were provided fodder.  This analysis showed that people buried closer to the settlement had lived most of their lives in the valley, except for spending a few months with their herds in higher places.  Some people buried further from the settlement, however, had traveled longer distances&mdash;including a family who had probably immigrated from Northwest Iran and returned there for several years with their child who was born in the valley, before moving back.  This challenges traditional models that argue that the period was dominated by mobile pastoralist campsites and burials rather than settled villages. It would appear that in Nax&ccedil;ivan, the MBA was characterized instead by highland fortresses and lowland fortified settlements with ritual and domestic areas.      Survey and additional excavation showed that this pattern of fortress polities&mdash;political capitals that were both defensive and religious centers&mdash;persisted for nearly two millennia and was widespread in this region.  Four seasons of survey investigated all of the known MBA to IA fortresses and settlements in northwestern Naxcivan and their surroundings.  Pedestrian survey, geophysical prospection, and auguring combined to show that the pattern revealed near Oglanqala was not anomalous.  Rather, other nearby river valleys showed similar patterns of fortresses, settlements, and cemeteries dating from the MBA to the IA.  Excavations on top of Oglanqala exposed part of a large villa dating from the first centuries CE.  Even during this late period, the fortified outpost at Oglanqal combined military and religious functions, while most ordinary people probably lived in spread-out settlements on the valley floor as they do today.  Archaeometric studies of pottery, obsidian, and metal indicate that theses fortress polities were involved in a complex network of exchange with their neighbors, particularly to the west and south, during this entire period.      During its research, NAP developed and incorporated a number of innovative survey, excavation, and analytical techniques&mdash;many of which were developed by young scholars as part of their training.  Both excavation and survey used UAV or drones to collect site information and serve as the basis of 3-D reconstructions of the excavation and the landscape.  The survey also employed recently declassified satellite imagery (HEXAGON and CORONA) and handheld GPS.  NAP archaeologists undertook isotope analysis of faunal and skeletal remains, using sequential sampling to produce detailed patterns of seasonal mobility and subsistence strategies over individual lifespans.       We are proudest of the work we have done training students and young scholars in the US and Azerbaijan.  NAP partnered with Penn to identify and train young undergraduates from under-represented minorities in field research, providing opportunities to expand representation in archaeology.  NAP has encouraged student research at every level.  This work has formed the basis for two completed PhD dissertations, two other PhD dissertations in progress, two MA theses, and four undergraduate research projects, contributing to the training of American, Azerbaijani, Turkish, and Australian students.  Within Azerbaijan we have been recognized as providing important resources for training female students.  Before NAP started, few Azerbaijani women were allowed to pursue field archaeology. Our female-led project has made archaeology into a viable pursuit for young women in Naxcivan and has increased the status and visibility of female archaeologists.
