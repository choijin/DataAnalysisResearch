<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2014. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Michael A. Grillo is "Natural Variation for Specificity Mediated by Signaling Interactions in the Legume-rhizobium Mutualism: A Population Genomic Approach in Medicago truncatula". The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Katy Heath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives include genomics, plant-microbe interactions, quantitative and evolutionary genetics, association mapping, and population genomics. Broader impacts include promoting Medicago and legumes as a teaching tool in high school biology classes in the Chicago area that serve underrepresented groups in the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mutualism between legumes (Fabaceae) and rhizobia (nitrogen-fixing bacteria) is one of the most economically and ecologically important interactions on the planet. A striking feature of this mutualism is the high level of variation for partner specificity, yet the mechanisms that control and maintain such specificity remain poorly understood.  This research aims to elucidate the genetic basis of specificity between the model legume, Medicago truncatula, and its primary symbiont, Sinorhizobium meliloti, through an integrative population genomic approach that addresses the following questions: 1) Which signaling genes demonstrate a genomic signature of selection that suggests a role in partner choice, 2) What are the effects of natural allelic variation at signaling genes on partner choice, and 3) What genes control incompatible interactions between Medicago and Sinorhizobium? This line of research will provide a comprehensive examination of natural variation underlying symbiotic signaling in Medicago interactions with its mutualist rhizobia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mutualisms, mutually beneficial tight-knit coevolutionary interactions between two organisms, are ubiquitous in nature and are critical for a broad range of biological functions.  The mutualism between legumes (Fabaceae) and nitrogen-fixing bacteria (termed rhizobia) is one of the most economically and ecologically important interactions on the planet.  The legume family is the third most diverse plant family (over 19,500 species) and is the second most important crop family behind the cereals (i.e. grasses).  A striking feature of this symbiosis is the high level of variation maintained for important mutualism traits including partner choice (i.e. which strains of rhizobia that a plant associates with) and partner quality (i.e. the amount of nitrogen that a plant receives from a particular strain of rhizobia).  With this fellowship, Dr. Grillo, examined the mechanisms that underlie this phenotypic variation at the genomic level.  This understanding is critical for plant breeding efforts to enhance legume crops and for understanding the forces that shape mutualisms in nature.   Here, Dr. Grillo examined natural genetic variation in the model legume, Medicago truncatula.  He conducted a population genomic analysis of 192 accessions of Medicago collected from the native range of the plant in Europe.  He first characterized the population genetic structure of these plants and identified considerable structure (e.g. plants belonging to distinct genetic populations) maintained locally (i.e. plants collected from the same field).  This structure within a given geographic locality could account for some of the variation in plant traits that is observed on such spatial scales.  Next, he conducted genomic outlier scans to identify genes that are presumably under selection in nature and identified 70 such outliers.  A benefit of using a model system, such as Medicago, is that he was able to determine the function of these outlier genes from available genomic information.  Interestingly, only one symbiosis related gene (DMI1) was an outlier.  Lastly, Dr. Grillo conducted a series of genetic mapping (i.e. genome wide assocaitation studies, GWAS) experiments to identify genetic loci controlling partner choice.  These experiments confirmed the role of the symbiosis outlier (DMI1) as a locus controlling partner choice  ?  a new phenotypic function associated with this important regulator of symbiosis.   Throughout the course of the fellowship Dr. Grillo trained undergraduate students and mentored undergraduate projects on mapping the genetic basis of partner choice and exploring the broader microbiome of legumes.  Additionally, he worked with students in a Chicago area high school on inquiry projects using legume-rhizobium interactions.
