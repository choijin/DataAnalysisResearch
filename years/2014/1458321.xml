<AbstractNarration>Northern Arizona University Yuma branch campus (NAU-Yuma) has received an NSF Scholarships for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) award for their project entitled Supporting Educational Endeavors for Degrees in Science (SEEDS).  The school, a federally designated Hispanic Serving Institution, was founded in 1988 and is the only STEM bachelor degree granting institution directly serving southwestern Arizona and is a transfer institution by design.   SEEDS will identify and recruit 30 promising, underrepresented, and financially-needy students seeking to study Biology and Environmental Sciences into NAU-Yuma.  The project will actively recruit STEM-oriented students from the region, including graduates of nearby 2-year community colleges in Yuma and Imperial, California. Students enrolled through SEEDS will benefit from extended student services including: tutoring in organic chemistry, biochemistry, and writing; comprehensive advising; a cohort-based learning environment; learning outside the classroom; and preparation for relevant post-graduate pursuits such as graduate school or STEM-based employment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SEEDS scholars will complete upper division coursework, obtaining baccalaureate degrees, and will be competitively prepared for relevant employment or graduate school. The project's four objectives are to broaden opportunities for university access to underrepresented and financially needy students, to enhance high quality, comprehensive STEM learning, to increase student success, retention, and graduation through student services, and to improve student advancement to relevant employment or graduate school.  Career placement services will include institutional support for placement in internships and/or STEM research experiences, paid travel to a job fair, and use of career advising services.  SEEDS assessment and evaluation will be comprehensive and ongoing and will be designed to improve student support.  The project external evaluator will use both formative and summative evaluations to assess student progress to degree, participation in project activities, and graduation rates.   Particular emphasis will be placed on the surveys to assess and improve the elements of the program that include the design and delivery of academic content, resources that enhance student learning, and services that promote success after graduation.  The data gathered will inform the larger undergraduate STEM education enterprise's  understanding of the resources needed by students to overcome barriers faced in the transfer from a two-year institution to a four-year school and and of the type of academic and co-curricular support that will enable them to complete a B.S. and be prepared for the STEM workforce or graduate school.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of Project SEEDS was to identify and recruit  academically promising underrepresented and financially needy community  college transfer students seeking to study Biological and Natural  Resource Sciences at Northern Arizona University - Yuma (NAU-Yuma) branch campus (a transfer institution by design).   Southwestern  Arizona and southern California Imperial US-Mexico border regions have  some of the largest rates of unemployment in the nation (24.4 and 26.4%,  August 2016, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics). As a result of being  rural and having a large agricultural industry much of the labor force  consists of migrant farm workers whose families have steep financial  barriers to higher education.  Given the enormous financial hurdles  students in the area face the scholarship money from Project SEEDS is  the main recruitment tool to reach our underrepresented student  population.  In Project SEEDS, our goal was to recruit and  scholarship 30 graduates from reagional community colleges Arizona  Western College (AWC), with which we share a campus and facilities with,  and Imperial Valley College (IVC) in nearby Imperial, California, both  of which are designated as HSIs. As a transfer university and the only  baccalaureate institution in the region, NAU-Yuma has the infrastructure  in place to support the continued educational aspirations of  financially needy and also underrepresented individuals in pursuit of a  STEM bachelor degree.   Due to having a smaller average classroom  size (~10 to 15 students) our program naturally fostered a cohort model  of academic support that has been shown to be successful for community  college transfers.  Leveraging this with scholarhips we provided  students in the program individual science faculty mentorship and  advisement, career development, internship and scientific research  experiences, and exposure to graduate school opportunities.  Over the course of five years we financially supported 35 students with 94% being from underrepresented groups in STEM (74% female, 77% Hispanic, and 9% disabled).   Of those 30 graduated within 2 years of transferring to NAU-Yuma, 4  students took approximately 3 years, and 1 did not graduate because they  were admitted into dental school.  While in the SEEDS program  students participated in weekly professional development seminars that  focused on developing and revising resumes, personal statements, and  cover letters in STEM in addition to creating multiple career plan  options.  While in the program 74% participated in local interships that  involved 15 different STEM agencies or businesses in the community.   Additionally 14% of our students participated in paid summer research  experiences and close to 40% in science research at NAU-Yuma  As  a result of this a majority of our graduates sought and obtained direct  employment after graduation (67%) in the Yuma and Imperial Valley  regions in STEM associated fields such as technicians at clinical labortories and government agencies as well as science high science teachers.   Fieldtrips  to graduate programs such as at Northern Arizona University in  Flagstaff and the University of Arizona in Tucson exposed students to  science careers they were not familiar with in their region and cultural  upbringing.  Since then we had 5 (17%) students enroll in  science graduate programs (1 masters and 4 doctorate) upon graduation  when previously we had had only 1 in a span of 10 years.  The remaining 25% entered professional graduate programs in health related careers.  The  results of this program cannot stress enough the importance of  financial as well as academic, peer, and professional support that are  needed for community college transfer students.  Emphasis placed in  these areas can have significant impacts on their success in obtaining  bachelor degrees and careers in STEM.
