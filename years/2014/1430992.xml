<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from it enabling (i) faster and more productive computer software and (ii) a significant improvement in the ability to counter cyber threats. Many enterprises, such as financial firms and online retailers, operate software platforms that are central to their business. Even a few minutes of reduced platform performance can lead to financial losses in the millions of dollars. The first project outcome will enable enterprises to automatically detect and rapidly resolve such performance problems, leading to more efficient information systems, more satisfied consumers and more profitable companies. The second outcome will boost the defenses of our nation's computers against cyber-attacks. President Obama recently cited cyber threats as one of our most serious economic and national security challenges. Losses from theft of intellectual property are estimated to cost American companies around $250 Billion annually. The company's malware analysis technology will detect some of the most advanced attacks that defeat today's defenses, leading to safer consumer and enterprise data, and reducing financial losses. Overall the company's technology enhances the technical understanding of binary code, an important class of software employed in a range of enterprise software and most modern cyber-attacks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a software tool called a binary rewriter that can understand and modify binary code. Although software applications are developed in human-readable programming languages, a large fraction is translated to binary code to be executed on hardware. Binary code is difficult to understand and modify. In addition, modern sophisticated techniques such as packing - employed by malware writers - further complicate this task. The intellectual merit of the project is based around the development of a novel binary rewriting mechanism that fulfills critical requirements that cannot be simultaneously achieved by any existing rewriting tool. The new rewriting mechanism will be able to reliably rewrite every binary program, including programs containing sophisticated techniques such as packing, without compromising the critical requirement for low run-time and memory overhead. It will also provide a novel mechanism for (i) monitoring the performance of enterprise applications as part of an advanced performance monitoring framework; and (ii) detecting, and therefore providing a means to stop, infection from evasive malware, a sophisticated class of malware that deliberately hides its malicious behavior.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview:  Cybercrime costs the US economy billions of dollars and poses a direct threat to our national infrastructure and financial institutions. Malicious software, also known as malware, is the instrument by which most of these attacks are carried out by cyber criminals. The losses from theft of intellectual property alone cost American companies around $250 Billion per year. Despite the best detection tools today, less than 60% of cyber-attacks today are stopped.  This project has developed technologies for use in advanced malware detection, so that malware can be stopped in computer systems. SecondWrite?s product is a cloud SaaS product that is a next-generation sandbox-based security solution. It detects advanced malware including anti-analysis malware, targeted attacks and zero-day evasions that defeat other solutions. We have developed unique technologies that during this project that break new ground in defeating even the most sophisticated malware in existence.  Intellectual merit:  During this project, we have developed technology that identifies hidden paths in malware and forcibly executes them, achieving complete code coverage. In addition, it can detect sophisticated anti-analysis malware that cannot be detected by other solutions, using deep program introspection. A machine-learning based classifier leverages analysis results to accurately detect malware with low false positives.  Broader impact:  A major outcome of the proposed innovation is a dramatic improvement in the speed, efficiency and efficacy in countering cyber threats through a game-changing set of techniques. Our malware analysis product will detect some of the most advanced attacks that defeat today?s defenses, leading to safer consumer and enterprise data, and lower financial losses. Our product will lead to faster recovery after attack, by quickly assessing the damage and identifying the weaknesses in the system that need to be plugged.
