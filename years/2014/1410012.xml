<AbstractNarration>The investigators in the collaborative proposal will make measurements of nearby dwarf galaxies and compare them with theoretical simulations to constrain the nature of Dark Matter in the universe.  Broader impacts of the work include training of graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher, and engagement of  under-represented groups toward careers in science.  Visualizations of dark matter simulations will be created for public outreach.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program aims to measure chemical and dynamical structure of stars within the Milky Way's dwarf spheroidal satellites and compare the measurements to simulations, in order to infer the spatial distribution of dark matter in the least luminous galaxies. They will compare observational results directly to the first suite of cosmological/ hydrodynamical simulations that resolve actual observables - stellar positions, velocities, metallicities, and ages.  The generation of mock observational catalogs from simulations will allow dark matter and galaxy formation models to be compared to data strictly in terms of observables.  The wider ranging impact of this project is to test the standard cold dark matter cosmological model.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The final period of his proposal focused on studying the properties of galaxies in what is considered the best non standard dark matter (DM)  candidate, the so called 'Self Interacting Dark Matter' (SIDM). In this report we describe the outcome of this research.  The standard model of cosmology, LCDM (L denoting dark energy and CDM cold dark matter), is the simplest model which accounts for large-scale structure including the cosmic microwave background, the abundance of light elements, the accelerating expansion of the universe and the distribution andabundance of galaxies. However, simulations of LCDM cosmology have highlighted problems at galactic scales: the excess of DM at the center of small galaxies, and the predicted overabundance of galacticsatellites. Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) may be the solution to these problems. In order to constrain the large parameter space of SIDM models, full simulations including baryonic (ordinarymatter) physics and large (O(10 cm2/g)) SIDM cross-sections were used.     Our work was published as"A rumble in the dark: signatures of self-interacting dark matter in supermassive black hole dynamics and galaxy density profiles"      2017MNRAS.469.2845D     SMBHs are found as far as &tilde;9 kpc away from the centre of their host SIDM galaxy. This difference is due to the increased dynamical friction time-scale caused by the lower DM density in SIDM galaxies compared to CDM, resulting in core stalling.      Overall, this project highlighted the importance of simulating in a full hydrodynamical context different DM models combined to the SMBH physics to study their influence on galaxy formation.
