<AbstractNarration>This U.S.-Czech International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project provides graduate and undergraduate students from North Carolina State University (NCSU) and nearby U.S. universities, North Carolina A&amp;T and Shaw, with early career international research experience at the Czech Academy of Sciences' Institute of Physics, in Prague.  The goal is to contribute to a diverse and globally-engaged science and engineering workforce by providing eighteen U.S. student participants, six annually, with the opportunity to pursue mentored research on wide bandgap materials, i.e., nitride and oxide semiconductors materials.  At the Czech partners' institute, each participant will gain hands-on experience with advanced characterization techniques.  Overall, the research objectives of this IRES project are to study the fundamental and growth related properties of novel wide bandgap semiconductor materials, to identify current technology challenges, and investigate approaches for problem solving.  Such materials are of interest because they exhibit promise for future use in devices that would be capable of operating at high power and high frequency, and in harsh atmospheric conditions or biocompatible environments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the direction of Principal Investigator Tania Paskova and her Czech counterparts, participant research activities span materials science, surface science, semiconductor physics, and chemistry.  The intent is to work cooperatively to increase our fundamental understanding of the inherent electrical, optical and surface properties of wide bandgap materials as well as their modifications, following a variety of chemical treatments to examine their potential and limitations for energy and biosensing applications.  The new knowledge and improved understanding of the surface properties, polarity, and doping effects in wide bandgap materials with different crystallographic alignments are expected to contribute to future applications, including power electronics, optoelectronics, and chemical and biological sensors. The early career international research experience will expose the U.S. students to current technology challenges and increase their awareness of the importance of novel materials for areas essential to our future quality of life.</AbstractNarration>
