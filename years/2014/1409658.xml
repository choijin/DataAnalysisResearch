<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Summary:&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for theoretical studies of responsive liquid crystal polymers, a form of plastic that spontaneously changes shape under heating or cooling. Rod-shaped liquid crystal molecules bonded to the polymer's main chains are disordered in orientation at high temperature but align at low temperature, inducing the polymer chains to extend in a parallel direction, and as a result the material stretches when cooled. Some materials containing light-sensitive dyes also change shape in response to illumination. A sample prepared with a non-uniform imposed pattern of local molecular orientation, a process known as blueprinting, shows complex shape evolution as the induced stress/strain is not uniform. The blueprinted pattern thus encodes a complex trajectory of movement from an initial state, e.g. a flat thin film, to a final state that is folded, curved, or twisted, a form of programmed auto-origami. Computer simulation studies of this process will explore the mathematical relationship between blueprinted structures and the resulting shape change. These materials have potential application in robotics, light-driven mechanical devices, touch displays, biomedical devices, and switchable surface textures. Related studies will examine shape change, pattern formation, and phase behavior in lipid membranes and liquid crystals. Outreach efforts, including research internships for 60+ high school students and annual science fair for six school districts, attract students to STEM careers and aim to improve the diversity of the STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary:&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical/computational research and education in soft matter physics. It combines computer simulation and fundamental theory to investigate mechanisms of microstructural/shape evolution and pattern formation in soft matter. The proposed theory/modeling studies of orientationally ordered lipid membranes and nematic solids are united by themes of differential geometry, curvature, topological defects, complex ordering and response, topology, and self-assembly. The principal problems to be investigated are: (1) Auto-origami: nematic solids as programmable, stimuli-responsive materials; (2) Lipid membranes: coupling of topological defects and curvature; (3) Phase transitions in liquid-crystal elastomers: kinetic evolution of polydomain structures; (4) Flexoelectricity in liquid crystals: formation of complex modulated phases. In all of these cases, the PI's will collaborate with experimental scientists to compare predictions with experiments on physical and biological systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is connected to fundamental problems in self-assembly, nonlinear elasticity, topological defects, and differential geometry.  Potential applications of outcome of this research could include soft actuators, shape control of lipid vesicles for drug delivery, self-assembly of vesicles for photonic crystals, and new liquid-crystal display technologies and switchable surface textures.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Soft polymer materials that contract like a muscle in response to a stimulus are of strong interest for applications in robotics and biomedical devices. &nbsp;Liquid crystal polymers change shape in response to stimuli such as heating or illumination. These materials can be "programmed" to undergo complex actuation by patterning the orientation of their rod-shaped liquid crystal molecules when the polymer is cross-linked. Under stimulus, the material contracts along the direction parallel to the local molecular orientation and expands in the two orthogonal directions. By forming the polymer between glass substrates coated with anchoring layers that align adjacent liquid crystal molecules to any desired pattern of orientation, spatial variation can be imposed, encoding the trajectory of a complex shape change when the material is exposed to a stimulus. The <strong>intellectual merit</strong> of this DMR-Materials Theory-funded project is the development of new theoretical understanding of how these materials can be programmed and how they actuate in response to stimulus; and the development of a GPU-based nonlinear finite element simulation that models the dynamics of their actuation.</p> <p>One exciting project was the study of a liquid crystal polymer film that mechanically undulates when illuminated. This fascinating material was used to make a small robot that crawls autonomously, powered only by incident ultraviolet light. Surprisingly, the robot crawled either toward or away from the light source depending on which side of the polymer film was face up; one surface had molecules oriented parallel to the ribbon's long axis, while the other had molecules oriented perpendicular to the surface. Simulation studies revealed the mechanism that makes this robot go "walking on sunshine," a photomechanical feedback loop driven by self-shadowing, and explained the mystery of its motion reversal. Other projects included modeling studies of liquid crystal polymer thin films that spontaneously fold under stimulus, a form of auto-origami&nbsp;; and liquid crystal polymers with topological defects that deform into complex, curved shapes.</p> <p>Topological defects played a key role in other projects as well. Much of the theoretical research in this project involves using the principles of topology to design the microstructure of liquid crystals and other soft materials. Topology shows that only certain structures and certain defects are compatible with a smooth, continuous variation of the molecular orientation. For that reason, these localized distortions are locked into the material.&nbsp; They cannot appear or disappear, but rather move as effective particles.&nbsp; The <strong>intellectual merit</strong> of this research involves making the connection between abstract mathematics and the structure of real materials, while the <strong>broader impact</strong> arises from practical applications of the materials.</p> <p>One example involves designing the pattern of molecular orientation on the surface of a liquid crystal, in order to control the molecular orientation everywhere in the interior. The pattern of molecular orientation on the surface is governed by topology in two dimensions (2D), while the interior is governed by topology in three dimensions (3D). The influence of the surface on the interior is complex, because topology is different in 2D versus 3D. Mathematical modeling shows how to take advantage of this difference to design 2D point defects on the surface that induce a 3D defect arch in the interior. When an electric field is applied, the 3D molecular orientation is forced into 2D, and hence the arch is expelled from the interior, meaning that it must stretch until it reaches the opposite surface. These theoretical predictions have now been confirmed experimentally.</p> <p>Another example involves ?skyrmions,? which are localized distortions where the molecular orientation is tied up in a knot that cannot disappear by simple relaxation to equilibrium. Mathematical modeling determines the phase diagram, which predicts when skyrmions are stable or metastable, depending on the chirality of the liquid crystals and the anisotropy of their environment. Further calculations show how skyrmions move dynamically, with drag forces acting on these effective particles. In particular, skyrmion motion can be induced by rotation of the average molecular orientation in the background, in agreement with experiments.
