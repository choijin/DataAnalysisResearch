<AbstractNarration>Human impacts on the natural world are of growing and increasingly urgent concern. Utilizing information about the causes and conditions of ecosystem health, this study contributes to the broader scientific understanding of degraded marine ecosystems. Such understanding in turn benefits decision-makers and the general public in identifying conservation and management priorities. This project will investigate the claim that jellyfish excel and multiply rapidly in degraded (or less pristine) marine conditions, using data from Japan as a case study. The study will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Shin-Ichi Uye, an expert on jellyfish at Hiroshima University. The Sea of Japan is an especially useful location for analysis because there is a robust dataset on jellyfish occurrences, combined with an ecosystem that has been significantly impacted by human activity.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;In this study, the term "jellyfish" refers to species within the phylum Cnidaria that have a free swimming (medusa) stage in their life history. A framework for defining marine ecosystem degradation has been recently advanced. This study will overlay human impact data with jellyfish location data. The datasets will be compared and analyzed for correlation. Information is lacking about the role of jellyfish in either healthy functioning or degraded ecosystems. This study aims to answer the question of whether occurrences of jellyfish, especially in large numbers, are correlated with degraded systems. The hypothesis is that jellyfish abundance and occurrence patterns in Japanese seas will be strongly correlated with a degraded marine environment. This project will advance knowledge of jellyfish dynamics and their role in the ecosystems they inhabit, and also inform the process of measuring and understanding ecosystem degradation. The outcomes will contribute to the ability to employ science, conservation and management in the ocean. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Human impact on the natural world is of growing concern.  Whether or not a recent increase in jellyfish blooms is related to anthropogenic factors is a matter of urgent debate.  Understanding of the causes and consequences of jellyfish blooms is of benefit and concern to decision-makers and the general public, for identifying conservation and management priorities.  This project investigated the environmental changes in East Asian Marginal Seas in the past 20 years, and asked whether those changes could have contributed to documented increase in jellyfish blooms in the region.  The study was conducted in conjunction with Dr. Shin-Ichi Uye, an expert on jellyfish at Hiroshima University.          The East Asian Marginal Seas are the semi-enclosed marine waters off the coasts of China, Korea, and Japan. These waters share some ecological and oceanographic features:  they are all relatively shallow, largely coastal connected ecosystems.  The bodies of water included in the East Asian Marginal Seas are the East China Sea, the Yellow Sea, the Bohai Sea, the Sea of Japan and the Seto Inland Sea of Japan.  The study focused on one species of jellyfish in particular:  the giant jellyfish (Nemopilema nomurai).   This species has bloomed (exploded in population, seasonally) more often in the past 20 years than all other times in recorded history put together.  The blooms have ravaged fisheries throughout Korea and Japan, and have become a major concern for all of the countries in the region.  The same time period has seen dramatic changes in East Asian Marginal Seas.  The East China Sea in particular has experienced changes in nutrients, increased marine built structures, and changes in fishing practices.  The East China Sea is also the presumed site of the young life stage of the giant jellyfish, and changes in this environment hugely affect the population of jellyfish each year.  While it isnÆt entirely clear how variations in the marine environment affect jellyfish populations, we have concluded that environmental degradation in the East China Sea has occurred at the same time as the dramatic changes in giant jellyfish populations.  In particular, eutrophication and nutrient loading has increased in the East China Sea, contributing to larger and more frequent seasonal hypoxia (low oxygen) events.  Hypoxic zones are also sometimes referred to as "dead zones" when low enough oxygen levels result in large fish kills.  It is possible that the giant jellyfish are able to survive periods of low oxygen more successfully than fish and other susceptible species.      This project has advanced our knowledge of jellyfish dynamics and their role in the ecosystems they inhabit, and has also informed the process of measuring and understanding marine ecosystem degradation.  The result of the project was important insight and identification of new questions regarding the giant jellyfish and East Asian Marginal Seas.      The EAPSI Fellowship was an unparalleled research and personal development opportunity.  The findings from the project are an important step toward understanding jellyfish bloom dynamics in Japan and in East Asian Marginal Seas.  The fellowship achieved its stated goals by allowing the Fellow and the host researchers to create lasting, meaningful collaboration relationships.  Partnership with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science also made the experience possible.  These connections between American and Asian scientific partners will serve the entire science community through future collaborations and free exchange of ideas.
