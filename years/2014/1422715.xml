<AbstractNarration>Modern information networks are composed of heterogeneous nodes and links, whose capacities and capabilities change unexpectedly due to mobility, failures, maintenance, and adversarial attacks.  User demands and critical infrastructure needs, however, require that basic primitives including access to information and services be always efficient and reliable.  This project studies the design of highly robust networked systems that are resilient to extreme failures and rapid dynamics, and provide optimal performance under a wide spectrum of scenarios with varying levels of predictability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this project will be on two problem domains, which together address adversarial network dynamics and stochastic network failures.  The first component is a comprehensive theory of information spreading in dynamic networks.  The PI will develop an algorithmic toolkit for dynamic networks, including local gossip-style protocols, network coding, random walks, and other diffusion processes.  The second component of the project concerns failure-aware network algorithms that provide high availability in the presence of unexpected and correlated failures.  The PI will study failure-aware placement of critical resources, and develop flow and cut algorithms under stochastic failures using techniques from chance-constrained optimization.  Algorithms tolerant to adversarial and stochastic uncertainty will play a critical role in large-scale heterogeneous information networks of the future.  Broader impacts include student training and curriculum development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to develop solutions for computer networks in scenarios where there is significant uncertainty in the operating environment.  This uncertainty may manifest as lack of information about the inputs (e.g., network traffic, computational tasks), adversarial threats (e.g., denial-of-service attacks), or accidental failures (e.g., dynamic changes in networks, communication errors).  Developing algorithms that work in such uncertain scenarios is challenging.  In this project, we have addressed these challenges in three different ways.  First, we have developed new algorithms for allocating resources in datacenter networks which ensure that critical data processing tasks get completed even under threats to the underlying infrastructure. These results offer new techniques for allocating datacenter resources in the presence of complex failure patterns.  Second, we have shown that if the communication links within a distributed system are controlled by an adversary even partially, it is necessary to develop randomized, as opposed to deterministic, methods for exchanging information to ensure timely sharing of data.  These results also highlight the power of simple local gossip-style protocols that enable fast sharing of information.  Finally, we have studied various communication paradigms (e.g., streaming from a single location to multiple network locations) and have shown how to build network structures that support these paradigms on a given communication infrastructure in a cost-effective manner.  The mathematical problems underlying the design of such network structures are known to be computationally intractable, and we have shown how to overcome such challenges using new techniques.  The results from our project will have the following broader impacts: improved allocation of resources in datacenters    that handle virtually all of our Internet needs (e.g., email, web services, e-commerce, computing needs of small businesses); new techniques for sharing information in networks    under adversarial or natural threats (e.g., ad hoc networks in disaster recovery, military communications); cost-effective methods for realizing important communication paradigms in communication networks.
