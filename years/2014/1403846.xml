<AbstractNarration>Proposal: 1403846&lt;br/&gt;PI: May-Newman, Karen D.&lt;br/&gt;Title: Senior Design Projects to develop Assistive Technology at San Diego State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Significance &amp; Importance&lt;br/&gt;The senior design project course is the capstone experience for SDSU engineering students and allows them to explore areas of specialization such as biomedical or rehabilitation. The goal of the proposed effort is to sponsor 7-10 senior projects each year that focus on developing Assistive Technology (AT) solutions to allow physically challenged individuals to safely and independently overcome neural or motor deficits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;These projects will leverage SDSU's partnership in the ERC/SNE and develop the students' expertise in a newly emerging area. By teaming the undergraduate engineers with clinicians, therapists, as well as the users with disabilities, the proposed multidisciplinary approach is expected to yield robust, suitable, and effective designs. The proposed efforts in senior projects will synchronize with the educational and outreach efforts to promote learning in SNE for the next generation of SDSU engineering graduates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merits of the project include: &lt;br/&gt;- Educate our students to create a design solution including design concept, implementation and testing under a unique set of circumstances, and involving the end-user &lt;br/&gt;- Give our students the experience of solving real-world problems in a team environment &lt;br/&gt;- Develop assistive technology that improves the quality of life for specific individuals with disabilities in terms of their recreational, vocational, educational, and daily living options. &lt;br/&gt;- Fabrication, delivery, and implementation of assistive devices that can meet the needs of specific individuals with disabilities. &lt;br/&gt;- Instill into the students a sense of the critical role that end users play when developing new products; ultimately enabling them to create more value for products they design in their careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this project include: &lt;br/&gt;- Expanded vocational, educational, and daily living task independence for persons with limited mobility such as the elderly, people with arthritis, and those with significant sensory or motor limitations. &lt;br/&gt;- Fuller integration and participation in school, social, and employment settings for individuals with disabilities. &lt;br/&gt;- Heightened awareness in the community at large and increased participation for disabled individuals through the products, modifications, and work done by the design teams.</AbstractNarration>
