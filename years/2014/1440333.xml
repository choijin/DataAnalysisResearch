<AbstractNarration>The project offers a unique and transformative approach to integrate existing and emerging long-tail model and data resources. Many challenges hinder the seamless integration of models with data. These challenges compel scientists to perform the integration process manually. The primary challenges are a consequence of the knowledge latency between model and data resources and others are derived from inadequate adoption and exploitation of information technologies. Knowledge latency challenges increase exponentially when a user aims to integrate long-tail data (data collected by individual researchers or small research groups) and long-tail models (models developed by individuals or small modeling communities).The goal of this research is to develop a framework rooted in semantic techniques and approaches to support ?long-tail? models and data integration. The vision is to develop a decentralized knowledge-based platform that can be easily adopted across geoscience communities comprising of individual and small group researchers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project offers a unique and transformative approach to integrate existing and emerging long-tail model and data resources. The project will develop a knowledge framework to close the loop from models? queries back to data sources by first investigating the required concepts architecture for integrating two leading examples of long-tail resources in geoscience: Community Surface Dynamic Modeling System (CSDMS) and Sustainable Environment Actionable Data (SEAD). The project will also develop a context-based data model that provides an explicit interpretation of a metadata attribute. The researchers will capture the metadata concepts and semantic from various geo-informatics systems and provide tools for ensuring conceptual integration between the resources. Next, the project will develop a knowledge discovery tool that allows automated coupling of a model and data coming from different contributors. Finally, the project will provide a prototype physical implementation of the knowledge framework in CSDMS modeling framework to demonstrate how it can advance the seamless discovery, selection, and integration between models and data, and how to achieve dynamic reusability of resources across multiple Earth Science long-tail resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Geoscientists now have access to a wide variety of data sets and computational models to help them understand, predict and suggest mitigation strategies for problems of societal interest (e.g. environmental hazards, resource management and climate change).  Unfortunately, the extreme heterogeneity within this vast set of digital resources makes it challenging to use them together as part of a scientific workflow.  Data sets store information in an endless variety of formats and numerical models are written in many different computer languages, following different patterns and protocols.  In addition, every data set and computer model has its own internal vocabulary (i.e. names or labels) for referring to its input and/or output variables.  As a result, it is difficult to know, even for an expert, whether a variable stored or computed in a given digital resource is equivalent to one needed by another resource.  Experts can typically figure this out through a lengthy process that may involve examining the equations that are used, being familiar with domain jargon, reading documentation such as source code, manuals and papers or talking to the developer of the data set or model.  However, this approach is very time-consuming, frustrating and inefficient.  The only way to automate this "semantic mediation" task is by mapping these internal variable names to variable names and concepts in a standardized vocabulary or ontology that can be utilized by a machine (that is, accessed via function calls in a computer program). This process of mapping internal variable names to standardized names is known as "semantic annotation" or "semantic enrichment" and once the task has been completed, it is possible to automate the task of "semantic mediation" or "semantic alignment" every time that resource is selected for use in a workflow.  This supports "data flow" by allowing values of variables to be correctly passed between the coupled resources.  Note that coupling resources in a workflow is often referred to as "integration", in contrast to the mathematical meaning of the term.  The goal of the EarthCube GeoSemantics project was to develop a set of tools, implemented as human and machine-accessible web services, to simplify the integration of digital resources (i.e. data sets and computer models) into scientific workflows.  Several key "resource alignment" challenges were addressed, including (1) how to semantically annotate a digital resource using controlled vocabularies or ontologies, (2) how to describe the input requirements of a model, (3) how to automatically find suitable input data for a given model online, and (4) how to easily deploy a computer model as a web service.  In addition, the project aimed to support "long-tail geoscientists" by developing integration tools that could be easily adopted across geoscience communities comprised of individuals and small groups of researchers.
