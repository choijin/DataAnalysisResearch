<AbstractNarration>The project will convene a community workshop for the purposes of motivating and accelerating progress on the integration of hydrometeorological-hydroclimatic-ecohydrological process understanding for improving predictive capabilities, sustainability and resilience to environmental change. The goal is to lay out a framework for identifying and addressing key challenges in hydrometeorological-hydroclimatic-ecohydrological understanding and predictions and formulate consensus scientific, observational and modeling challenges. The primary outcome of this workshop will be a community White Paper that articulates the challenges and opportunities facing integrated hydrological-atmospheric research.</AbstractNarration>

The workshop was held to motivate and accelerate progress on the integration of hydrometeorological-hydroclimatic-ecohydrological process understanding for improving predictive capabilities, sustainability and resilience to environmental change. Advertisement was done through a Townhall Meeting at the Fall AGU meeting (December 2014), national scientific magazines and through list serves and personal communication. The workshop included 60 researchers, faculty, and students primarily from academia and federal agencies. The goal was to provide scientific community input to NSF program managers as they formulate joint funding opportunities for research. The three day event included plenary sessions with keynote speakers as well as extensive panel and community discussion and writing. Based on the original proposal to NSF, the sessions were organized around three main topics, including: 1) Scientific Process Challenges, 2) Observational Challenges, and 3) Modeling Challenges.
