<AbstractNarration>The rapidly changing nature of disasters and the staggering pace of communication technology innovation have an inevitable influence on how practitioners communicate across the life cycle of disasters and how the public seeks information and makes decisions on whether or not to adhere to these risk communication messages.  With these changes, disaster communications scholarship must also adapt and progress.  This has led to a growing need for cross-disciplinary communication-focused scholars to inform one another's research, the outcomes of which are likely to yield highly applied results that can change the face of disaster, crisis, and risk communications as we now know it. By bringing together scholars and practitioners to discuss emerging theory, breakthrough methods, and vital research questions, we have the potential to transform the future of risk communication scholarship and practice.  Such outcomes include developing a public, online research repository on disaster and crisis communication; publishing an invited comment in the Natural Hazards Observer and articles in peer reviewed academic journals; and identifying and developing a research agenda on disaster communications to advance the future of public warnings and crisis communication for the nation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This grant provides funding to hold a workshop, which will bring together the nation's leading scholars and experts in risk, crisis, and disaster communications, to identify gaps and intersections in theoretical orientations, methods and innovations, and prioritize research needs for the future.  Over the course of two days, scholars will identify and discuss the cutting edge theoretical questions within their disciplines that contribute to knowledge about social and behavioral responses to disaster warnings and crisis and risk communication; the cutting edge methods used to conduct data collection and analysis; and the primary scientific research questions on warnings, risk, and crisis communications in disaster that are likely to yield practical insights that will reduce losses and increase human security in disaster.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The rapidly changing nature of disasters and the staggering pace of communication technology innovation have an inevitable influence on how practitioners communicate across disastersÆ life cycles, and how the public seeks information and makes decisions as they prepare for and response to imminent threats. Social science research on warnings, risk, and crisis communication, has established models for how the public receives warnings, interprets information, and makes protective action decisions. Although much past research remains relevant, it exists largely in disciplinary silos in the fields of sociology, communication, and psychology. As disaster communication adapts to the creation and implementation of new communication technologies, disciplinary-focused scholars must become more aware of existing theories to better inform one anotherÆs research and address compelling research questions. Without such cross-disciplinary awareness, it is likely that communication-oriented research across the disaster lifecycle will continue to conduct strongly empiricist and descriptive studies, producing piecemeal studies that generate incremental knowledge or replicating results produced time and again. In addition, a need exists for stimulating new research designs for practical and applied insights, addressing emergency managersÆ and crisis communicatorsÆ most pressing questions.  To address these and other issues, the University of KentuckyÆs College of Communication and Information held a two-day, invitation-only workshop, bringing together leading risk, crisis, and disaster communication scholars and experts, representing varied theoretical and methodological approaches to address the following:  (1)  What are the cutting edge theoretical questions within your discipline that contribute to our knowledge about social and behavioral responses to disaster, crisis, and risk communication?  (2)  What are the cutting edge methods used to conduct data collection and analysis in response to the theoretically driven questions that inform your research?  (3)  What are the primary scientific research questions on disaster, risk, and crisis communications that are likely to yield practical insights, and will reduce losses and increase human security in disaster?  (4)  What would we do differently if we were to throw it all out and start over again? What would we ask? What would emerge?  (5) How do we look around the corner as we communicate about unexpected risks, unanticipated behavior, and unintended consequences?  The workshop, titled "Disaster Communication: Redesigned," was held in Lexington, KY on November 10 and 11, 2014.

Workshop speakers and participants called for an integrated, interdisciplinary approach that would facilitate a shift in siloed scholarship to develop a base of knowledge that can transform communication practices.
