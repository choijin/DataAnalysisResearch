<AbstractNarration>This award funds a series of workshops that will be hosted by the University of Minnesota in collaboration with the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. The workshops bring together junior and senior researchers to concentrate on theoretical issues in macroeconomics and dynamic economic modeling.  Young researchers use the workshops as an opportunity to get feedback on preliminary research and also form new collaborations.  The research presented focuses on fundamental questions facing macroeconomic policy makers, including the design of the tax system, monetary policy, and the role of social insurance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each summer's topics are chosen by an organizing committee coordinated by the Principal Investigators.  Topics may include debt and international lending, heterogeneity and inequality, labor market behavior, health and social insurance, financial markets, technology and firm dynamics, development and financial inteagration, monetary policy, fiscal policy, long run growth, and macroeconomic consequences of contracting frictions.</AbstractNarration>
