<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project, in which a new device and approach to weaning patients from mechanical ventilation is proposed, is a reduction in public health care expenditure and a reduction in morbidity for the half a million patients who have difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation each year in the US. This project promises to improve our scientific understanding of the role of the expiratory muscles in weaning failure patients and improve our technical understanding of non-invasive respiratory sensors for online triggering of external systems. These patients suffer from an array of clinical complications and cost the US health care system $16 billion annually. The majority of these costs are borne by Medicare and Medicaid whose reimbursement policies provide an incentive to reduce weaning time in this patient group. Given the severe health consequences of prolonged mechanical ventilation, the large and expanding number of treatable patients, and the favorable reimbursement landscape, we reason that the device that will be developed in this proposal will positively benefit society and will be commercially valuable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop a non-invasive electrical stimulator that automatically applies stimulation to the respiratory muscles in synchrony with a patient?s voluntary breathing pattern. Based on previous research it is expected that this device will reduce the load placed on the respiratory muscles while at the same time training them. Since the imbalance between the strength of the respiratory muscles and the mechanical load they face is a major factor contributing to weaning difficulty, it is hypothesized that the proposed device will reduce the time, and improve the probability, to wean from mechanical ventilation. In this phase one proposal the device stimulation trigger will be developed and tested and combined with a commercially available stimulator, the clinical effect of the developed device on breathing when used acutely will be established, and the feasibility of using the developed device in mechanically ventilated patients will be determined. The successful completion of this phase one proposal will be followed by phase two in which both the development of a stimulator with integrated trigger and a fully powered clinical trial will be completed, ultimately allowing the device to be submitted for FDA clearance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  Breathing machines known as mechanical ventilators are used to save the lives of critically ill patients when they are unable to breathe for themselves.  Unfortunately, critical illness, as well as  the use of mechanical ventilators themselves, can dramatically weaken the breathing muscles.  As a result, many patients who have recovered from their original critical illness can have difficulty breathing for themselves.  These patients require prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation that can last several weeks or more. Unfortunately, prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk that a patient will die in the hospital and increases the risk of a patient developing further breathing complications (e.g. pneumonia).  In addition, caring for patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation is very expensive for the health care system.  The overall goal of this STTR project is to tackle this important problem by developing a new device called VentFree. VentFree includes a breathing sensor and applies stimulation to the patientÆs abdominal muscles (Figure 1) in synchrony with the patientÆs exhalation. We have shown that this technique assists a patientÆs breathing volumes and reduces the effort it takes for the patient to breathe. In addition, it is expected to strengthen the breathing muscles, reduce the time that a patient needs a breathing machine, and reduce the time he or she spends in hospital. Phase I and IB of this proposal aimed to establish the technical, clinical and commercial feasibility of the project.   Intellectual Merit   In Aim 1 of our Phase I proposal and Aim 1 of our Phase IB proposal, we successfully developed a fully functional VentFree prototype with the following key features:  An airflow sensor which is suitable for long term monitoring of mechanically ventilated patients. A stimulation algorithm that adjusts for changes in a userÆs breathing pattern and accurately applies stimulation during exhalation without interfering with a userÆs inhalation. Easy to use and portable The ability to record device usage data and display it on a PC for later analysis.   In Aim 2 of our Phase IB proposal we developed and tested a custom airflow sensor which will be easier and less expensive to manufacture than the commercially available airflow sensor used in our current prototype.    In Aim 2 of our Phase I proposal we demonstrated that VentFree correctly applied stimulation during exhalation and was well tolerated and safe in healthy subjects and in non-ventilated patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) &ndash; a patient group who frequently requires mechanical ventilation. In addition, we demonstrated that VentFree successfully caused the abdominal muscles to contract, which led to an increase in the participants breathing volumes without increasing the effort of breathing. Finally, we determined the best combination of stimulation settings to use for VentFree.  Aim 3 of our Phase I proposal built upon the result of Aim 2 and demonstrated that VentFree is safe and well tolerated in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. In addition, this aim showed that VentFree was effective at increasing breathing volumes in this patient group.  Collectively the results of this phase of the project have demonstrated the feasibility of the VentFree approach and have laid a solid scientific foundation for a future Phase 2 proposal.  Broader Impact  Each year, over half a million patients in the US with critical illness have difficulty coming off of mechanical ventilation. Moreover, the number of these patients is increasing five times as quickly as the number of hospital admissions and is expected to double over the next ten years. As mentioned above, prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation can lead to a number of clinical complications that have a major impact on patientsÆ quality of life and survival. Furthermore, prolonged mechanical ventilation has a substantial economic...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
