<AbstractNarration>This award supports fundamental research on the mechanics of atomically-layered materials. When one folds atomically-layered materials, only a few atoms thick, unprecedented nanoscale material properties can manifest. For example, the lateral compression of graphene, a multi-layered material of carbon atoms, leads to patterns of sharp ridges. Along the ridges of these atomic-scale crinkles a strip with the width of a few atoms is electrically charged. The strip of charges attracts oppositely charged molecules. The controlled deformation of such a graphene crinkle network potentially regulates adsorption of biomolecules and, consequently, the adhesion of biological cells to solid surfaces in real time. The research results would enable various applications for atomic-scale materials engineering in nanotechnology, and molecular engineering in biomedical technology. This includes but is not limited to bio-adhesion control for cancer treatment and molecular manipulation techniques for genetic engineering. Further, the results would have impact on nano- and micro- metrology, and environmental filter and sensor technology. The scientific tool, the atomic lattice interferometer, will enable observation of the behavior of advanced nanostructures, not only for scientific research, but also for education in both life and physical science and technology. An outreach program will be developed in the Institute of Molecular and Nanoscale Innovation at Brown University. This program will educate students from underrespresented groups in STEM through summer internship programs, introduce them to real world problems with an industrial seed project. The PI will develop new course materials on the mechanics of folding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continuum/ab-initio and experimental hybrid analyses of atomic-layer crinkle structures and associated flexoelectric characteristics in graphene or graphene-analogous materials will provide a fundamental understanding of the mechanical behavior, as well as of the electronic states of a deformation jump like a crinkle ridge. The PI's laboratory experimentally observed such crinkle networks for the first time by using a newly invented atomic lattice interferometer. This novel interferometer opens up unique experimental capabilities of measuring atomic-scale surface deformations over a wide field of view. The resultant understanding of the electro-mechanical behavior will establish a systematic framework for regulating molecular adsorption and cellular adhesion for biomechanics research. In addition, many important multi-scale modeling and experimental capabilities, such as high performance computing and testing of atomic-scale structures, will be advanced. Furthermore, mathematically difficult and historically unsolved bifurcation problems of ruga (wrinkle, crease, fold, ridge and crinkle) mechanics will be unraveled.</AbstractNarration>

Atomic level manipulation and imaging of a single molecule, reading functional information off its structure, have been elusive. Here, we discover a new electrically charged nanostructure in graphene, named ?flexoelectric crinkle?, that can be used to manipulate and image individual molecules, based on the theory of electromechanical deformation at the nanoscale. A newly invented atomic lattice interferometry made it possible to discover the graphene crinkle. The AFM-based "graphene atomic lattice interferometry" (G-ALI) resolves the molecular structure and its interaction state with other molecules. The graphene crinkle and the atomic lattice interferometry enable us to develop"graphene moleculography," a novelmolecular-informationnanotechnology, to observe and manipulate physical and/or chemical phenomena using only small number of molecules. The graphene moleculography is expected to be a usefulmolecular-information nanotechnology for molecular diagnostics and genomics/epi-genomics studies.  Intellectual Merit:  Here, we present a general thermodynamic framework of flexoelectric constitutive laws for multilayered graphene (MLG), and apply these laws to explain the role of crinkles in peculiar molecular adsorption characteristics of HOPG surfaces. We also report an experimental characterization of the new subcritical graphene nanostructure, graphene crinkle. The crinkles have sawtooth-shaped profiles with their faces perfectly flat and the tips of the peaks and valleys highly curved within a width of approximately one nanometer. We also found that concavity or convexity of crinkle tips, i.e. parity of the crinkle, can be controlled. Due to the flexoelectric coupling, the concave tip at the crinkle valley is positively charged, and the convex tip at the crinkle peak negatively charged. In addition, we demonstrate that the charges at the crinkle tips can attract macromolecules in adsorption experiments. We show linearly- aligned adsorption of C60 along crinkle valleys on an HOPG surface. In another experiment, we exhibit period-doubled adsorption of lambda DNA on an HOPG surface, possibly caused by ion kinetics involved in the DNA adsorption along the crinkle valleys.   Broad Impacts:The new discovery of flexoeletric graphene crinkles and invention of the atomic lattice interferometry will havebroad impactson other branches of science and technology beyond mechanics of materials, including nano- and micro- metrology, molecular biomedical technology,environmentalfilter and sensor technology,and renewable energy technology. The invention of the atomic lattice interferometry will provide tools for observing the behavior of advanced nanostructures not only for scientific research, but also for education in both life and physical science and technology. Under this project, a number of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs were trained as new generation STEM manpower in U.S. In addition, international REU students from France were invited to be trained in this project through summer internship programs.
