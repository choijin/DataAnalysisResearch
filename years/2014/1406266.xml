<AbstractNarration>With rapid advances in information and technology, big data are now routinely collected in many frontiers of scientific research and technological developments. Various advanced techniques are needed to address the challenges such as computation, noise accumulation, and spurious correlations prominently featured in big data. New theoretical challenges arise in order to address probabilistic problems in high-dimensional statistics. This collaborative research project intends to combine the strength and expertise on probability and statistics of both investigators to address a number of emerging and challenging issues in high-dimensional data analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will focus on primarily two types of problems: (i) high-dimensional statistics on spheres and (ii) behaviors of eigenvalues of random matrices and zeroes of polynomials. The two topics are innately related since high-dimensional data are often expressed in terms of matrices. The project would create new theories and methods for high-dimensional statistics, interact and apply them to several different disciplines including mathematics, statistical physics, information theory, and computer science. The project also involves training of top notch mathematical scientists and engineers and to disseminate the research results and products broadly via the online media, conferences and seminar presentations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project develops theory and methods for statistical inferences based on the analysis of big data, answering the questions such as if discoveries by statistical machine learning algorithms are spurious.  To address these issues and control false discoveries, we leverage the recent developments in probability theory to develop statistical foundation for these inference problems.  We also develop diagnostic tools to validate the fundamental assumption on exogeneity in high-dimensional statistical inference and give new directions and paradigm for feature selection in analysis of high-dimensional data.  At the same time, we advance high-dimensional probability theory that are motivated by statistical machine learning problems.  In particular, we develop new theory and methods for understanding random matrices and structures of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  These can be directly applied to extract latent economic factors, market factors, and biological factors that influence  economics, finance, and bioinformatic studies.   This project also contributes significantly to the graduate and undergraduate education and postdoctoral fellow training. It enables us to train a top-notch new generation of statisticians and data scientists. Tens of Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows have been trained and benefitted from this research project.  They contribute significantly to the working force in STEM areas.  Some research results are simplified and taught in the classroom.  Tens of undergraduate theses have been supervised with the benefit from our research.  Software developed can also be modified and used by other graduate students and researchers.
