<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2014 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Tobias L. Johnson is "Random Combinatorial Structures and Stein's Method." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Southern California, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Larry Goldstein.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>During this fellowship, I conducted research in discrete probability with two main focuses.

For the simplest variation we consider, imagine an infinite d-ary tree (the root has d children, each of which has d children, and so on). Place a particle at each site of this tree, and imagine that initially they are all asleep. Then, the particle at the root wakes up and starts walking around randomly. When it lands on another particle, it also wakes up and starts walking around, waking up more particles in turn. Serguei Popov asked a simple question about this process in the early 2000s: will all particles wake up eventually? Of course, there are infinitely many particles, so at no time will all of them be woken. But for any particular particle, will it be woken up eventually? This question remained entirely open until my collaborators Christopher Hoffman and Matthew Junge and I showed that in fact, the answer depends on d: On a binary tree (d=2), all particles eventually wake with probability 1. On the other hand, when d is 5 or higher, some particles remain asleep forever. (The cases d=3,4 remain open.) We have since proved much more about the process on trees, which opens the door to understanding it on a more general class of networks. We hope that a deeper understanding of the properties of these basic random interacting systems will lead to a better sense of how to apply them as models and a better understanding of the behavior of more complex real-life systems.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/04/2018<br>      Modified by: Tobias&nbsp;L&nbsp;Johnson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
