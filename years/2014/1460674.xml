<AbstractNarration>BROADER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will provide undergraduates STEM research experience at the interface of engineering and medicine, aiming to help medical diagnosis and procedures, development of prosthetics, and contribute to technologies that are likely to become a part of the "future of medicine."  This program addresses a vital national need to improve the delivery of healthcare by developing new tests and medical devices that enhance the ability of doctors to plan and perform procedures. By recruiting from and partnering with minority student societies and programs, minority-serving institutions and community colleges, the investigators will help develop a pipeline of qualified, diverse individuals who will contribute to the STEM workforce, particularly in the multi- and interdisciplinary subjects encountered in biomedical research, healthcare delivery, and basic biological and life sciences.  The participants will be well trained in communications and research ethics, which are essential for success in today's biotechnology and bioscience work and market place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During a ten-week summer session, undergraduate participants from institutions nationwide will engage in exciting and challenging research projects in a wide range of engineering disciplines, e.g. electrical, mechanical and biomedical, computer science, and physics.  Each participant will be matched with a current research project in the Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics (LCSR) and will be a part of a collegial research team, including a faculty project supervisor and a graduate student mentor. These research projects relate to medical image registration and fusion, image enhancement and segmentation or the development of new robotic devices to support surgeons in the operating room or to aid patients with disabilities. Participants will receive instruction on technical communication, oral presentation skills, and research ethics and will deliver a final research report and presentation.  Additional activities will include tours and trips to other labs at JHU Hospital (JHU/H) and the Applied Physics Laboratory, the opportunity to perform laparoscopic procedures at the JHU/H Minimally Invasive Surgical Training Center, and industry tours of local robotics, biotechnology and engineering companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is multidisciplinary and offers each participant the ability to conduct research in a variety of fields and develop strong teamwork collaboration skills.  Each faculty mentor provides a project description for projects that may be created specifically for the program or designed to carry out a facet of an on-going research.  Because the Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics has close ties with the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, participants can experience the cutting-edge research that is designed to aid medical diagnosis, interventions, and prosthesis, and contribute to technologies that are likely to become a part of the "future of medicine." The investigators plan to leverage on-going research activities and training and mentoring experience, and aim this REU in CS&amp;MR program at broader topics that include more biological inspired and biologically targeted computational sensing, imaging, and robotics systems.  An external assessment expert will conduct annual formative and summative evaluations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For the Summer of 2018, two hundred and forty-eight (248) applications were received by the program from student applicants from across the country. Thirteen (13) REU students participated in the 2018 core CSMR REU program. This is typical of the volume of applicants to and selectivity of the program.   The participants were from different universities/community college across the country. In addition to the core group, there were two undergraduate students who participated in the program but were supported through other REU supplement grants.  The recruitment process for the 2018 CSMR REU Program began in the fall of 2017. Program information was distributed to various mailing lists. Several universities across the country received the promotional flyer about the program. The advertising was also sent to alumni from this program and they were requested to promote the program in their respective undergraduate universities. Additionally, the program manager attended information sessions at Howard and Baltimore Community Colleges. The program manager was available to respond to any queries from prospective applicants.   The program had 6 male and 7 female participants in 2018. Five of the participants were from community colleges, one in California and four in Maryland.  The applicant and participant groups are also diverse, composed more than 50% women or URM.  At the time of this report preparation we are aware of several publications and conference papers with REU participants in this program as either first authors or co-authors.   Internal and External evaluation of the program continues to show that students score of their knowledge of engineering increase significantly by the end of the program.  Their desire to continue to graduate school or seek other advanced degrees also increase significantly by the end of the program.  Lastly, their experience in the program is highly ranked positively, with scores up to 4.8/5.               Last Modified: 07/25/2019       Submitted by: Ralph Etienne-Cummings]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
