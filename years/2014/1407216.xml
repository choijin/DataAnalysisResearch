<AbstractNarration>The goals of this project are to modernize and integrate the undergraduate and graduate curricula in the three Departments of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science so as to better prepare undergraduate students to study and work effectively in the information age, and to foster research collaboration among faculty and undergraduate students across disciplinary lines within and beyond the quantitative sciences. The prospective new degree in Data Science will be crowned by a capstone course that will contain research projects involving scientifically important problems and use the latest Big Data techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The holders of the new degree will be capable to work on problems at the frontiers of science that require the integration of large-scale simulation of partial differential equations and other mathematical constructs, data capture and statistical analysis, and high performance computing to provide accurate, reliable, and useful forecasts and descriptions.</AbstractNarration>
