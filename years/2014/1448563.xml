<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will establish the ability to measure key properties in the MEMS fabrication process to help MEMS foundries and designers build more accurate sensors while shortening the design cycle and will establish that electrically probed self-calibration has the potential to replace the current costly and cumbersome physical calibration approach. Calibration of MEMS devices currently comprises over 20% of the manufacturing cost structure and has been steadily increasing over time. In higher performance devices, it can be 80% of the manufacturing cost. Successful demonstration of self-calibration methods, with accuracy equal to, or greater than, traditional physical calibration methods will not only enable the industry to eliminate this rapidly-growing cost driver, but could also enable a new era of performance-on-demand MEMS devices by that dynamically alter the device?s effective parameters and properties using electrical signals to adjust the values measured in the self-calibration process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project centers on the development of an electronic means to calibrate MEMS devices.  This mew method will deliver equal or greater accuracy as compared with traditional costly, cumbersome physical means that are constraining the MEMS industry. The research will take measurements on many "self-calibrating" MEMS devices fabricated across multiple MEMS processes, from multiple foundries and multiple runs to provide a robust data set to provide new process information using self-calibration and also to establish comparative results (both technical and economics) results with traditional calibration approaches. If successful, this could usher in a completely new paradigm in MEMS design and production by relaxing the physical calibration constraints and potentially enabling an entirely new class of performance on demand MEMS devices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Challenges  Issues stemming from process variations have bottlenecked the rate of advancements in the performance of MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems). These issues affect manufacturing costs, measurement standards, international commerce, validation of theories, rates of discoveries, engineering model development, and ultimately the rate of innovations for micro/nanoscale technologies.  R&amp;D objectives  Our research objectives for Phase I/IB were to investigate the feasibility of our IP for greatly improving the performance capabilities of MEMS through design, metrology, and control. Our design technology addresses the challenges by reducing the variation of desired performance of MEMS by optimizing the design parameters to be least-sensitive to process variations. The grant enabled us to develop and launch this technology within a commercial online CAD for MEMS tool.

Our performance control technology addresses the challenges by enabling MEMS to re-define their performance specifications on-demand by either increasing or decreasing their effective mass, damping, and or stiffness. Performance-control with self-calibration counters process variations.  Computer Aided Design  We have implemented technologies into our CAD for MEMS tool that facilitate efficient exploration of design spaces, design optimization, built-in metrology, and built-in control. We have engineered the tool to be user-centric in ways that is novice-friendly and most-productive for experts.  The Sugarcube CAD for MEMS tool is now available to the public at www.sugarcube-cad.com. It is accessible over the Web using a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone. A quick video that runs through some of its features is provided here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pr0NsiSffo. Beginners are able to tweak the design parameters of ready-made MEMS by manipulating bounded sliders and simulate the new behavior.  Sugarcube has a growing library MEMS designs. Experienced users are able to create new MEMS designs by assembling a system of 3D building blocks into the structure they imagine.  Sugarcube has a growing collection of compact models. For the MEMS community, users are able to contribute by submitting their compact models or MEMS designs to the growing libraries.  Sugarcube uses common SPICE-like netlists to assemble compact models into a system to analyze behavior (static, steady-state, modal, transient).  The designs are parameterized, where the parameters of each device show up as sliders in the GUI, allowing the user to easily sweep and explore the design space.    Self-Calibration  Although our CAD technology can be used to reduce the effect of process variations on performance by as much as 60% on average, the variation can still be significant enough to require calibration to achieve the desired accuracy. Moreover, there is a strong need to close the large gap between simulation and experiment.  Our feasibility study involved us working with Solidus to design, MEMSCAP  and InvenSense to fabricate, and Solidus to test MEMS from multiple types of foundry processes; teaching Solidus how to apply our self-calibration technology to MEMS; sending the chips to Solidus for their independent electrical measurements; us extracting mechanical properties by using SolidusÆs electrical measurements; and then comparing the results of our new metrology method against SolidusÆs conventional methods.
