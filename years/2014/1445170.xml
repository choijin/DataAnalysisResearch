<AbstractNarration>Ear Nose Throat (ENTs) specialists and other healthcare professionals that diagnose and treat middle ear disease need to know if the patient has an infection, whether that infection is bacterial or viral, and determine some measure of the severity of the infection. They need to be able to make this assessment quickly because their interpretation of the middle ear health is the basis for significant interventional treatment, such as the prescription of antibiotics or decision to perform interventional surgery to minimize pain, illness, hearing loss, and delays in speech and language development. Despite the obvious importance and prevalence of this disease, the clinical gold standard for diagnosing ear infections is essentially a magnifying glass. The otoscope is a tool healthcare professionals use to evaluate middle ear health. The problem is that the otoscope only allows visualization of the surface of the eardrum, when the disease actually takes place in the middle ear.  This team has developed a handheld medical device that can not only view the surface of the eardrum, but can also see through the eardrum and into the middle ear. The proposed improved diagnostics will lead to better clinical outcomes due to better management of antibiotics and interventional surgery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology uses harmless near-infrared light to produce three-dimensional images of the eardrum and middle ear contents. This provides physicians access to a wealth of new information, such as eardrum thickness, which has shown to vary with infection severity, effusion purulence, which is a strong indicator of the degree of infection, and most importantly, the presence or absence of a bacterial biofilm, which has been linked to chronic recurrent cases of ear infection that are generally resistant to antibiotic therapy.  With 3-D information, quantitative measures and metrics can be visualized and recorded for objective diagnoses and longitudinal monitoring of therapeutic interventions. The device is used in the same way that a traditional otoscope is used, and since it can provide objective measurements, it allows a technician or nurse to obtain the same quality of diagnostic information as that of an experienced physician.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported the develoment and optimization of an optical imaging system that is capable of non-invasive, three-dimensional visualization of the eardrum and middle ear.  Based on the customer discovery through this program and project, there is a strong market for this technology for not only ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialists, but also for primary care physicians.  The original handheld probe used with this optical imaging system was capable of simultaneous surface (video) and 3-D (optical coherence tomography, OCT) imaging of the eardrum, but the surface image quality was very limited when compared to standard otoscope instruments used in healthcare, which are the current gold-standards of care.  The two major goals of this project were to 1) make changes to the optical configuration to provide simultaneous surface images that are of equal quality and field-of-view to those available in currently used otoscopes, and 2) prepare this technology for transfer toward commercialization through customer discovery interviews, defining the value proposition of our technology, and developing a business plan and technology pitch.  The intellectual merit of this project was based on the optical science, engineering, and technology we developed for our imaging instrument.  Any multimodal imaging system has inherent constraints and challenges due to the need to satisfy simultaneous requirements for each imaging path.  We combined OCT with white-light surface video imaging, all in a form factor similar to that of a standard otoscope.  The constraint that both imaging modalities must use the same objective lens, combined with the limited space due to the form factor requirements of a traditional otoscope, resulted in limitations in the quality of the surface video imaging in our current prototypes.  Physicians are used to seeing the entire ear drum and periphery in clear focus, which is not possible with a restricted depth-of-field.  We were thus able to decouple these two optical paths and optimize the optics in the surface image path to achieve surface images of equal quality to those in traditional otoscopes.  The broader impact of this project is significant.  Solving this remaining engineering challenge will now enable commercialization of our technology, which will improve the quality of care for millions of children and adults each year.  Our improved diagnostics will lead to better clinical outcomes due to better management of antibiotics and interventional surgery.  Our technology will also provide ENT specialists or primary care physicians with a better tool and new quantitative and diagnostic information to better monitor patients post-treatment, such as monitoring of middle ear health after ear tube placement procedures.  Middle ear disease affects nearly every person on the planet, and nearly 50% of children experience chronic cases of middle ear infection.  It is a significant problem that is currently addressed with very basic and outdated technologies (i.e. the otoscope, circa 1800 AD).  Another important and broad impact of this project was the inclusion of undergraduate students for its completion.  This project was ideal for training undergraduate students with practical hands-on experience in optical design and implementation.  This project was also used as an example in undergraduate lecture courses on biomedical optical imaging, and this technology development and application will continue to be highlighted and shared with K-12 and community groups through annual Engineering and Beckman Institute Open Houses where these groups can tour academic labs to see and learn more about this technology, the development process, and the broader impact it will have in this application area.  The outcomes from this project are also significant.  Through the technology transfer training offered by this project and the NSF I-CORP program, many new contacts and collaborations were established.  A start-up company (Pho...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
