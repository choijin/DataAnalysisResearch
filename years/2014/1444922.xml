<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating research discoveries associated with a new class of wideband reflectors to fill the need for new photonic components in a broad variety of applications including laser manufacturing and infrared imaging systems. This innovation is important as new fundamental physical effects will be applied to enable solutions not attainable with current competing technology. The project will result in new designs and prototype reflectors that will be tested in detail for operation in important frequency bands. The proposed reflectors will have the following unique features: high degree of parametric stability, large spectral bandwidth, compact size, and high-yield manufacturing. These features provide advantages including high efficiency, low loss, economy in fabrication, and robustness in applications. These single-layer devices can be fabricated on substrates or as membranes. They avoid the multiple interfaces and associated issues in commercial thin-film multilayer reflectors; thus, thermal expansion effects and adhesion problems are minimized. These reflectors can be applied in spectral regions for which the deposition of thin-film multilayers is impractical or impossible. Therefore, this innovation provides new solutions and is likely to compete effectively in a sizeable market space.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: (1) verification of the utility of the proposed fundamental resonance effect in this context, and (2) verification that practical prototype reflectors with high-efficiency wideband spectra can be fabricated. The proposed resonant reflectors are designed with gratings in which the grating ridges match to an identical material, thereby avoiding local reflections and phase changes. As this critical interface possesses zero refractive-index contrast, we call them "zero-contrast gratings." For simple gratings with two-part periods, we use numerical calculations to show that zero-contrast gratings provide extremely large flattop bandwidths and parametrically stable spectra; this project aims to demonstrate these devices experimentally. In summary, the main goals are to fabricate reflector prototypes operating in the ~1.2- to 12- micron spectral region; verify bandwidths of ~600-1100 nm with reflectance exceeding 99%; verify the predicted parametric stability; demonstrate polarized and unpolarized reflectors; and verify theoretical predictions of 99.99% reflectance for ~10- to 100-nm bandwidths. These devices are designed using powerful electromagnetic optimization algorithms, and they are made using standard nanofabrication methods including thin-film deposition, lithographic patterning, and etching. They are characterized by spectral analysis in the ~1- to 12- micron wavelength band. Hence, the project delivers compact, robust, polarized and unpolarized resonant reflectors that work within a broad spectral application space where classical methods fail to deliver effective solutions. In addition, personnel involved in this project, including undergraduate and graduate students, will receive entrepreneurial experiences, including business planning, by enrolling in "Engineering Entrepreneurship" that is taught by the PI on a regular basis.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Under this project, we demonstrated a new class of high-efficiency wideband reflectors or mirrors. A key property of these devices is parametric stability enabling effective manufacturing with high yield. The reflectors are materially sparse while providing high reflectance across wide spectral, or wavelength, bands. These compact elements, made with only a single partially etched film on a substrate, complement commercial thin-film multilayer reflectors in wide application spaces while possessing properties not available with thin-film technology. Our reflectors are based on principles that are completely different from the effects governing conventional technology. Use of these new physical principles enables new advances in optical component technology useful in imaging systems, laser technology, medical instrumentation, and telecommunications.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our resonant mirrors are made with periodic nanopatterns. In many applications, polarization independence is important as ordinary light, for example in vision, environmental monitoring, and astronomical imaging, is unpolarized. Two-dimensional (2D) patterning, yielding an array of nano- or microscale tiles or mesas, provides wideband polarization independence. We investigated the fundamental physics of 2D reflectors and compared with one-dimensional (1D) reflectors. There is strong correlation between the spectra of the two classes; indeed, the more complex case of 2D resonance can be fully understood in terms of 1D equivalents. The physical operation of photonic crystal slabs, a famous device class widely treated in diverse contexts, can thus be straightforwardly comprehended. Figure 1 makes this point clearly.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the project is was found that the 1D polarized reflectors provide much wider high-efficiency spectral bands than 2D reflectors. Accordingly, we invented unpolarized broadband reflectors enabled by a serial arrangement of a pair of polarized subwavelength gratings. Optimized with numerical methods, the elemental gratings used in the demonstration consisted of a partially-etched crystalline-silicon film on a quartz substrate. The resulting reflectors exhibit extremely wide spectral reflection bands in one polarization. By arranging two such reflectors sequentially with orthogonal periodicities, there results an unpolarized spectral band that exceeds those of the individual polarized bands. In our experiments, we achieved reflectance exceeding 97% under unpolarized light incidence over a 500-nm-wide wavelength band. This wideband represents a ~44% fractional band in the near-infrared spectral region--a world record for this device class. Moreover, the resonant unpolarized broadband accommodates an ultra-high-reflection band spanning ~85 nm and exceeding 99.9% in efficiency. These elemental polarization-sensitive reflectors based on one-dimensional resonant gratings have simple design, robust performance, and are straightforward to fabricate. Hence, this technology is a promising alternative to traditional multilayer thin-film reflectors especially at longer wavelengths of light where multilayer deposition may be infeasible or impractical. Figure 2 shows an example of the experimental prototype, Figure 3 depicts theoretical and experimental data side-by-side, and Figure 4 shows the measured output spectral response.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking the idea of serial 1D reflectors further, we fabricated numerous new prototypes and measured their performance in a multiple-module concatenation. The measured spectrum exhibits reflectance exceeding 98% spanning the wavelength range of 1200-2133 nm with bandwidth of 933 nm. This corresponds to a 56% fractional bandwidth relative to the center wavelength, another record device demonstrated under the project. Figure 5 shows the quantitative experimental performance achieved.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our resonant reflectors fall under the category of metamaterials--a new classification of subwavelength periodic lattices with wavelength of operation smaller than the period. Metamaterials are important as they possess properties not found in simple materials. Photonic device technology applying metamaterials supports many new and useful applications as exemplified by this project. We endeavor to clarify the fundamental physics of wideband metamaterial reflectors. In a paper under review, we show that these devices operate because of resonant leaky Bloch modes propagating in the periodic lattice. Moreover, in contrast to published literature, we demonstrate that Mie scattering in individual array particles is not a causal effect. In particular, by connecting the constituent particles by a matched sublayer and thereby destroying the Mie cavity, we find that the resonance bandwidth actually expands even though localized Mie resonances have been extinguished. This is demonstrated in Figure 6. There is no abrupt change in the reflection characteristics on addition of a sublayer to any metamaterial array consisting of discrete particles. Thus, the physics of the discrete, or Mie, and connected arrays is the same.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The project has numerous broad outcomes. Some of those are published in the 6 journal papers, 7 conference papers, and 2 patents associated with the project. In particular, the good results found may impact development of analogous devices fabricated using traditional methods involving dielectric thin films and metals. New theoretical and physical understanding of wideband resonant metamaterial reflectors will have significant impact on this field of technology and aid in its development and deployment in industry for useful applications. The project impacted development of human resources in nanotechnology and photonics by graduating engineers with hands-on fabrication experience, solid theoretical understanding, and advanced design skill sets.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/29/2017<br>      Modified by: Robert&nbsp;Magnusson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1444922/1444922_10327207_1509302566638_Niraula_OL262595_fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1444922/1444922_10327207_1509302566638_Niraula_OL262595_fig3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fabricated prototype reflectors in silicon."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1444922/1444922_10327207_1509302566638_Niraula_OL262595_fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fabricated prototype reflectors in silicon."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Fig. 2.
