<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the Board on International Scientific Organizations (BISO) of the National Academies of Science (NAS), which functions as the U.S. National Committee to the International Council for Science (ICSU) and serves as the focal point for ICSU-related activities in the United States. It manages U.S. membership in ICSU and has oversight of many of the national committees that serve as liaisons to unions, committees and programs federated under the ICSU umbrella. BISO's primary goal is to support effective U.S. participation and strong leadership in the ICSU network in response to growing needs in international science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ICSU, a non-governmental organization, plans and coordinates interdisciplinary research to address major issues in science and society; advocates for freedom in the conduct of science; promotes equitable access to scientific data and information; and facilitates science education and capacity building.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award also provides dues payment to the Pacific Science Association (PSA).  PSA is an interdisciplinary regional organization within ICSU whose goal is to advance science and technology in support of sustainable development in the Pacific region.  Based in Honolulu, Hawaii, PSA has a long history of linking scientists in the U.S. with their counterparts on the Pacific?s rim and islands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-year award will enable BISO to continue to manage U.S. participation in ICSU. The award provides costs associated with the support and management of the U.S. National Committee to ICSU and organizational activities of adhering U.S. committees representing the diverse disciplines that participate in ICSU activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) serves the U.S. national member of the International Council for Science (ICSU) and the Pacific Science Association (PSA), and the work was carried out by the NAS? Board in International Scientific Organizations (BISO).  Two of the major goals of this project were to coordinate U.S. involvement in ICSU and the Pacific Science Association, and to provide visa assistance to the U.S. and international scientific community through the International Visitors Office.  SCIENTIFIC MERIT  ICSU is a non-governmental organization created to advance, serve, and enable science throughout the world.  With both national members and scientific union members, ICSU addresses important international issues related to science.  PSA is an affiliate of ICSU and a regional non-governmental, scholarly organization that advances interdisciplinary science, technology, and sustainable development in the Pacific region.  Membership in both these organizations involves paying annual dues; actively participating in governance activities and organization initiatives; and promoting an engaged U.S. community.  Specific actions related to membership in ICSU and PSA are as follows:   In 2015, the BISO Board was restructured.  Members of the Board now include one representative from almost all of BISO?s U.S. National Committees (USNCs).  The USNCs each correspond to a specific ICSU-related scientific union.  This reorganization has helped create dialogue between committees, and has enabled increased and more informed interactions with ICSU.  Michael Clegg (University of California, Irvine) serves as both the BISO Board Chair and as ICSU?s Vice President for External Relations.  This further enhances connections between the BISO, the USNCs, and ICSU. An external review of ICSU in 2014 made several recommendations, including incorporating the social sciences into its programs and finding ways to work more closely with allied organizations, such as the International Social Science Council (ISSC) and the InterAcademy Partnership (IAP).  In the spring of 2016, ICSU and ISSC began to explore a possible merger.  ICSU members were asked for comments and advice, and after consultation with the BISO Board, comments were submitted. ICSU and ISSC held a joint Extraordinary General Assembly on October 24 in Oslo, Norway.  The major question before the delegates was whether to approve in principle a merger of ICSU and ISSC.  Approval was granted by the membership of both organizations.  Bruce Overmier (University of Minnesota) represented the United States. Also growing out of the 2014 External Review and the 2014 ICSU General Assembly was the formation of Science International (SI).  SI is a platform from which ICSU, ISSC, IAP, and TWAS, and other partners can speak together on broad science issues of societal importance.  The first statement, Open Data in a Big Data World, lays out a framework for how open data in a big data world can be achieved.  Dr. Clegg participated in a panel discussion on this topic at the 2014 ICSU General Assembly. Most of the efforts related to the Pacific Science Association were related to the 23rd Pacific Science Congress held in Taipei, Taiwan on June 13-17, 2016.  Kevin Johnson (University of Hawaii) was elected Secretary General, and Nancy Davis Lewis (East-West Center) serves as past president.  The Bishop Museum in Honolulu, Hawaii hosts the secretariat for PSA.    BROADER IMPACT  Both ICSU and PSA are complex international organizations. As already noted, ICSU is exploring a merger with the International Social Science Council (ISSC).  If successful, this will result in a more unified approach to science-related issues of societal importance.  Continued U.S. involvement with and leadership in ICSU, its programs, and its member unions leads to international collaborations with U.S. scientists, as well as enhanced U.S. awareness of international perspectives, policy, and culture.    The International Visitors Office has three major roles:  assist individual scientists and students in the sciences with visa difficulties; provide advice to organizers of large scientific meetings in the United States; and identify emerging trends.  It assisted 456 scientists and students in the sciences in 2014; 657 individuals in 2015; and 637 individuals in 2016.  The benefits from scientific collaborations and educational exchanges extend to U.S. society at large, and are both intellectual and economic.  Foreign scientists and international students bring news ideas and experiences that benefit not only collaborators, but other colleagues, students, and communities.  In addition, when these visitors return to their home countries, they carry with them a better understanding of U.S. values and culture as well as international goodwill.
