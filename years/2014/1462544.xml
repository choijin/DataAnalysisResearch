<AbstractNarration>Monsoons are prominent features of the large-scale circulation of the Earth's atmosphere, sustaining densely populated, rapidly growing and socially vulnerable regions in the tropics and subtropics.  This project seeks to improve understanding of the essential processes that are involved in monsoons and that mediate their response to climate change.  The premise of the project is that monsoons can be viewed as seasonal migrations of zones of tropical convection and their associated large-scale overturning circulations, and that the fundamental dynamics of such convectively-driven overturning can be understood in terms of angular momentum and energy balance constraints.  Under this premise the research begins by examining the behavior of seasonally migrating convection zones in simplified "aquaplanet" simulations in which the earth's surface is entirely covered by oceans and there are no land-sea contrasts. These model simulations are followed by further simulations with idealized continents, and finally results from these simulations are compared with realistic climate simulations from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project version 5 (CMIP5).  Specific issues to be addressed include the relatively sudden onset of the monsoon, the delay of monsoon onset with increasing global mean temperature found in model simulations, and the relationship between global mean temperature and the strength of the overturning circulation. Goals of the project are to 1) investigate how monsoons change in a wide range of climates, in order to place past, present and future changes in a broad context; 2) determine how monsoons change in simulations in which complexity is progressively increased; starting from aquaplanet simulations with no land-masses to simulations with idealized continental geometries; and 3) use the conceptual understanding emerging from the idealized simulations to evaluate state-of-the-art general circulation models, and better constrain future projections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has broader impacts due to the importance of monsoons for agriculture and water resources in densely populated regions of the world.  Understanding how monsoons change with changing climate is both a priority and a major challenge in climate science, and the present work may contribute both by improving our ability to interpret and evaluate projections of monsoon change from climate models, and in improving the models used for such projections.  In addition, the project will support and train a graduate student, thereby providing for the next generation of researchers in this area, and three undergraduate students will be hosted for summer research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Most of the Earth?s precipitation falls in the tropics, the latitudinal band within 30 degrees north and south of the equator. What fundamentally controls the spatial and temporal distribution of tropical precipitation, including the oceanic intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and its seasonal excursions into the summer subtropical continents in association with monsoons, remains both unknown and a major challenge for the climate sciences: Tropical and subtropical regions with increasing populations and rapidly growing economies heavily rely on rainfall and are extremely susceptible to changes under global warming.  Primary goals pursued under this award were to expose what controls fundamental aspects of oceanic and monsoonal convergence zones, and how they respond to climate changes.  For example, we aimed to elucidate how position, strength and timing of monsoon onset might be influenced by continental configuration and how they might change as the climate is warmed.  To address these fundamental questions, we used models of different complexity, starting from ocean-covered worlds (aquaplanets) to models with realistic configurations and physics.  Significant outcomes of this research included:  We showed how common energetic predictors of the position of maximal tropical precipitation that work well when considering long temporal averages break down on timescales shorter than seasonal. Importantly, changes in the efficiency of energy transport (the gross moist stability) by the Hadley and monsoonal circulations are not only nonnegligible, as commonly assumed, but are in fact of leading-order importance.  We also demonstrated how seasonally reversing circulations, such as monsoons, can exist on other planetary bodies as well and are influenced by planetary and orbital parameters, such as the planet?s rotation rate and obliquity. Interestingly, even when the summer poles become the hottest place on the planet, for instance as obliquity is increased, at Earth?s rotation, monsoonal convergence zone do not move to the poles and the associated circulations do not become global. We have used arguments provided by traditional axisymmetric theories to explain this behavior and develop super-criticality measures that more accurately predict the location of tropical precipitation.  We have finally shown that tropical regions of low thermal inertia may be necessary for the development of monsoons with rapid onset in so far as they facilitate the transition of the tropical circulation to a dynamical regime that restricts the degree to which eddy momentum fluxes influence the circulation strength and allows the cell to grow rapidly in strength and poleward extent.
