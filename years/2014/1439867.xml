<AbstractNarration>High quality teaching matters, especially for students "at risk." Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship projects attempt to address this through recruiting and retaining excellent mathematics and science teachers to work in high-need settings.  This  Fellowship Track Phase II Monitoring and Evaluation project will examine the longitudinal impact of the NebraskaNOYCE project at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln on the participants and on the professional community of Nebraska mathematics teachers.  The NebraskaNOYCE program has seen much success in its initial three and one-half years, including 100% placement and retention of Teaching Fellows (TFs) in high-need districts and excellence in the professional trajectory of Master Teaching Fellows (MTFs). This project will investigate how candidate and program factors contribute or do not contribute to TFs' and MTFs' work as professionals in high-need districts, their commitment to the teaching profession, and their commitment to placement in high-need districts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching agenda of NebraskaNOYCE Phase II is: What is the longitudinal impact of NebraskaNOYCE on recruitment and retention of TFs and MTFs, and the development of their professional practice?  The goals of NebraskaNOYCE Phase II are to understand the factors and resources that shaped the TFs' capacity for and commitment to teaching in high-need districts; the MTFs' development as master teachers and commitment to teaching mathematics in a high-need district; and the interactions between the TFs and MTFs that influenced these factors and resources. The project focuses on the impact of personal, social, and knowledge resources and factors on TFs' and MTFs' professional practice. Additionally, NebraskaNOYCE Phase II will evaluate the program's ability to recruit and retain teachers, the impact of the program on University of Nebraska-Lincoln Department of Mathematics and Department of Teaching, Learning, and Teacher Education, and the impact of the program on the school districts.  The knowledge that will be generated by this project has the potential to impact other Noyce projects' activities and research and evaluation designs, as well as preservice teacher education and inservice teacher professional development on a scale that extends beyond the Noyce community. A comprehensive dissemination plan will ensure that research produced by NebraskaNOYCE Phase II will be shared with the NSF Noyce community, the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities' (APLU) Mathematics Teacher Education Partnership (MTE-Partnership) and the broader mathematics and mathematics education communities. Nebraska's membership in the MTE-Partnership provides the team with a dissemination platform to reach educators who are working to improve secondary mathematics teacher preparation and their induction into the teaching profession. NebraskaNOYCE's 43 MTFs and TFs have all remained in their high-need schools; understanding the supports that have helped this to happen will allow this project to make policy recommendations related to preservice teacher preparation, novice teacher induction, teacher retention, and qualities of effective cooperating teachers and mentors. This project also will contribute to the sparse literature on mathematics teacher leaders related to the development and growth trajectories of MTFs as mathematics teacher leaders in high-need districts.  Data collection will include observations of teachers through the cycle of planning, teaching and reflecting, and interviews designed to address research questions associated with either preservice or master teacher participants.</AbstractNarration>

We investigated how resources developed through the NebraskaNOYCE program contributed to TFs' and MTFs' work as professionals in high-need Nebraska school districts, their commitment to the teaching profession, their development as intellectual mathematics leaders in their districts, and their commitment to teaching in a high-need school district.

We conducted staged planning interviews, asking all MTFs and TFs to plan a hypothetical algebra lesson using unfamiliar curricular materials. Our analyses of these interviews drew on a framework for curricular noticing: observing how teachers attend to materials, interpret materials, and respond to materials. Understanding how teachers use curricular materials can lead to more effective professional development to support more effective teaching and learning. This research was foundational for Dr. Males' subsequent CAREER grant (DUE-1651836), which expanded this research to pre-service teachers.</span></p> </li> <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Mathematicians' mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) and how their MKT influences course design for future mathematics teachers</span><span>.

This research supported Dr. Lai's subsequent collaborative research I-USE grant (DUE-1726744, 1726707, 1726098, 1726252, 1726723, 1726804) to create and pilot educative curricular materials for undergraduate mathematics courses for future teachers.</span></p> </li> <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Teacher leadership trajectories</span><span>. We conducted multiple interviews of all MTFs and TFs, in addition to interviews of their administrators, to better understand the leadership trajectories of MTFs and TFs. We consider teacher trajectories to be part of a complex system and were especially interested in how teachers' trajectories were influenced by a variety of factors: personal knowledge and beliefs, professional identity as a leader, school and district culture and structure, professional relationships, education policies, and participation in Noyce. The MTFs and TFs universally agreed that having a cohort of Noyce peers supported their development as leaders, particularly in their development of a leadership identity. School and district structures and culture provided (or inhibited) leadership opportunities; because of Noyce, MTFs and TFs also considered and sought statewide and national opportunities for teacher leadership. This teacher leadership research led to Dr. Smith's collaborative research Noyce Track 4 award (DUE-1758462, 1758342, 1758438, 1758452).</span></p> </li> </ol> <p dir="ltr"><span>MTFs and TFs found their Noyce participation to be transformative for their teaching practices.

It made me reflect on my teaching practices; I was much more a 'sage on the stage,' telling students what to do, but the MTF program really helped me reconsider what students should be doing in my classroom and what I should be doing as a teacher to support them. It made me think they should be a lot more hands-on, exploring, creating their mathematical understanding for themselves. My job was not necessarily to be a teller, but to be a supporter in their own journey of learning about math."</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/10/2020<br>      Modified
