<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Division of Chemistry Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program, Professor Zeev Rosenzweig of the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) directs a summer undergraduate research program in the area of chemical sensing and imaging. A diverse group of ten undergraduate students are recruited nationwide for a ten week program. The selected students engage in research under the direction of UMBC faculty who are leading efforts towards the development of next generation chemical sensing and imaging techniques for a wide range of applications. Broader impacts are evidenced by the potential impact on areas of chemical sensing and imaging in chemistry, biology, physics and various engineering disciplines. This work may lead to the development of new chemical sensing and imaging technologies. Building on the strength of providing high quality education to students from underrepresented groups in STEM, this REU program partners with the Leadership Alliance and the Interdisciplinary Consortium for Research and Educational Access in Science and Engineering (INCREASE) to pursue a nationwide plan to recruit and provides this research and education training opportunity to highly qualified students from underrepresented groups and disadvantaged populations. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Examples of REU research projects include the development of single molecule techniques to understand protein-protein interactions, the development of nanometric barcodes based on luminescent semiconductor quantum dots for multiplexed bioassays; the development of novel optochemical and electrochemical sensors and sensor arrays for the analysis of neurotransmitters and volatile organic compounds; the development of near infrared molecular probes for in-vivo imaging; and the development of standoff remote detection methods for the analysis of explosives. In addition, the individual research experiences are augmented by an extensive program of integrative activities, that include weekly technical and professional development workshops.</AbstractNarration>
