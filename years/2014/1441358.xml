<AbstractNarration>The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Cyberlearning Exploration (EXP) Projects explore the viability of new kinds of learning technologies by designing and building new kinds of learning technologies and studying their possibilities for fostering learning and challenges to using them effectively. This project's technology innovation is a haptic (force-feedback) toolkit to be used in learning science and engineering content that involves forces. The toolkit the team is developing will allow learners (K-12 and beyond) to manipulate simulations and models through touch-sensitive devices and to directly feel resulting forces. Learning and using the science of forces is quite complex, as the ways forces actually combine and have effects are not always consistent with what people experience. Understanding forces, however, is essential for pursuits as varied as engineering, rehabilitative medicine, and construction and for understanding concepts and phenomena in biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering fields. The kind of direct engagement with forces at the micro-level that the proposed toolkit will allow has potential to foster better scientific understanding across this whole set of fields. Research in the context of this technological innovation focuses on the extent to which and the conditions under which such embodied experience with phenomena fosters deeper understanding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The role of embodied experiences in learning is both an important issue in learning how to better foster learning and a newly-emerging possibility for learning technologies. In this project, the PIs examine the potential for haptic technology to expand and transform student learning. The haptic interface being developed is a mechatronic device programmed with force-displacement relationships that a user experiences through the sense of touch. The project aims to demonstrate the ways the programming and use of haptic devices as a part of lab experiences can impact learning. The PI is a mechanical engineer who is expert in materials and devices.  The co-PI is a learning scientist engaged closely with the maker movement and with helping learners learn from simulation and modeling experiences. Through an iterative, design-based research approach, new haptic devices and accompanying visual programming software are being created to enable interactive hands-on virtual laboratories for biology, chemistry, and physics, and experiments are being carried out to understand both how to use such devices well to foster learning and the affordances of haptics in learning force-related concepts and its added value in the context of learning through modeling and simulation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project examines the potential for haptic (touch feedback) technology to expand and transform student learning. A haptic interface is a mechatronic device programmed with force-displacement relationships that a user experiences through the sense of touch. This project aims to demonstrate that novel haptic devices and software, designed for learning environments, can impact education by (1) providing a new entry point into STEM fields, (2) allowing students to directly experience physical phenomena, and (3) facilitating fundamental research related to hands-on learning. The&nbsp;<strong>intellectual merit</strong>of this project is that it provides foundational results for the design and application of haptics as an educational technology. The&nbsp;<strong>broader impacts</strong>of this project include the availability of novel low-cost technology for haptics, dissemination to potential communities of practice, outreach, and involvement of students in the research to integrate education and research. Our main project outcomes are in the areas of&nbsp;<strong>haptic technology</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>haptic learning science</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>dissemination</strong>.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Haptic Technology</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>A key contribution of this research is the development of<strong>&nbsp;open-source hardware and software for haptic devices</strong>. We developed a 3-D printed haptic device, called Hapkit 3.0, to support low-cost hands-on learning. Our latest design includes features that allow students to manufacture and assemble a robust and high-fidelity haptic device. This is achieved at a materials cost of approximately US $50, which is feasible for distribution in classroom and online education settings. We also developed methods for Hapkit personalization and customization that can be achieved by K-12 students and educators. We created two new kinesthetic haptic device designs that evolved from the original Hapkit 3.0. One uses two standard Hapkits with additional components to form a Pantograph mechanism (called Graphkit), and the other uses customized Hapkit elements along with a novel kinematic design to form a serial mechanism (called Haplink). These designs are modular; after building two Hapkits, a user acquires a small number of additional parts to transform them into a two-degree-of-freedom device. In addition to software accompanying Hapkit, we collaborated with Haply.co, an open-source haptics company, to release a new haptic API (hAPI) that allows students and developers to easily experiment with haptic systems using up to four independent actuators.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Haptic Learning Science</span></strong>&nbsp;</p> <p>Embodied, physical interaction can improve learning by making abstractions concrete, while online courses and interactive lesson plans have increased education access and versatility. We proposed that haptic technology could integrate these benefits, using low-cost hardware and accessible software that enable students to creatively explore haptic environments without having to write code. To investigate haptic e-learning without user programming, we developed HandsOn, a conceptual model for exploratory, embodied STEM education software; and implemented it with a spring simulation interface and a task battery for high school students. In two studies, we confirmed that low-cost devices can render haptics adequately for this purpose and found strong qualitative impact of the spring simulation on student strategies and curiosity.</p> <p>Although the above studies (and others) showed the promise of haptic devices for supporting learning, we also sought to identify the underlying learning mechanisms. To this end, we designed a haptic-supported learning environment and analyzed four students who used it to make connections between two different mathematical representations of sine and cosine: the unit circle, and their graph on the Cartesian plane. We highlighted moments where students made connections between the representations, and identified how the haptic feedback supported these moments of insight. We use this evidence in support of a proposed theoretical and design frame-work for educational haptics. This framework captures four types of haptic representations: isolated, iconic haptic representations (haptic mirrors); isolated, symbolic haptic representations (unnamed); connected, iconic haptic representations (unnamed); and connected, symbolic haptic representations (haptic bridges). We focused the latter type &ndash; the haptic bridge &ndash; and showed how it effectively scaffolds sense-making with multiple representations.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dissemination</span></strong></p> <p>Toward the dissemination of haptic technology and the development of communities of practice, we developed or contributed to two main websites providing open-source hardware and software. The Hapkit website (<a href="http://hapkit.stanford.edu)/">http://hapkit.stanford.edu)</a>provides comprehensive instructions for building the various version of Hapkit as well as resources for additional learning. The Haply website (<a href="http://www.haply.co/dev-docs.html">http://www.haply.co/dev-docs.html</a>) describes a separately-developed haptic device (Haply), and disseminates a haptics API (hAPI) developed in collaboration under this project. In addition, we created and currently maintain a self-paced, online haptics course, which varies in size and has had over 5,000 students enrolled simultaneously (<a href="http://hapticsonline.class.stanford.edu/">http://hapticsonline.class.stanford.edu</a>). Through class board posts and wiki entries, this learning community shares tips for haptic design, control, and programming, including instructions for making the Hapkit for students in other countries with access to different hardware components. We have also disseminated this work through numerous outreach programs, presentations and demonstrations at technical workshops and conferences, scientific publications, review papers and book chapters, use in classrooms, and a novel Student Innovation Challenge to create educational haptic applications at the 2017 World Haptics Conference.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/06/2018<br>      Modified by: Allison&nbsp;M&nbsp;Okamura</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1441358/1441358_10330341_1525628519236_HapkitFamily--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1441358/1441358_10330341_1525628519236_HapkitFamily--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Hapkit Family of Haptic Devices"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1441358/1441358_10330341_1525628519236_HapkitFamily--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Hapkit Family of Haptic Devices"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Three examples of open source, modular, customizable, 3-D printed kinesthetic haptic devices.
