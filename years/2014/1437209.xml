<AbstractNarration>PI: April Gu / Chad Vecitis&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1437257 / 1437209 &lt;br/&gt;Institutions: Northeastern University / Harvard University &lt;br/&gt;Title: Collaborative Research: Mechanistic and Predictive Genotoxicity Assessment of Nanomaterials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Carbon-based nanomaterials (CNMs) may be among the most useful engineered nanomaterials for different applications, although our understanding of the toxicity and potential impact of carbon-based nanomaterials on human and ecosystems is still in its infancy. Among the various toxicity effects observed, genotoxicity (the damage to genes from chemicals) is of particular concern to human and other lives because genotoxicity from nanomaterial (nanogenotoxicity) can potentially cause cells to mutate and eventually lead to cancer. This study will demonstrate the application of a new high-throughput, rapid and effective nanogenotoxicity assay platform and a new mechanism-driven hierarchical model framework that will be tested. The results of the research will fill in the urgent knowledge gap in mechanistic understanding of the environmental and health impact of CNMs. This research has significant benefits to the environment and public health protection. The outcome from the research will aid strategies related to nanoscience and technology, as well as elucidate the environmental and health implications of nanomaterials, which will help bridge the gap between scientific research, creation of commercial products and public health protection. In terms of broader impact on the community, the synergized arrays of education outreach and public education programs will present the technology, benefits, and societal and environmental impact of nanotechnology to a wide range of audiences at many levels. For example, PI Gu had initiated the BEST (Biotechnology for the Environment, Showcase and Training) program as part of a CAREER award. With this proposal, she will be able to expand that program, as well as collaborate with additional existing programs (e.g. a RET program, NEU CONNECTIONS, etc) to promote training of students and teachers. Both PIs will also work with the Boston Museum of Science to create multimedia that disseminates research to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to perform a comprehensive and systematic genotoxicity assessment of a variety of well-characterized carbon-based nanomaterials (CNMs), using a newly developed high throughput toxicogenomics-based 3-D gene/protein expression profiling technique, with the aim to relate nanogenotoxicity with CNMs' physicochemical and structural properties and, explore prototype mechanism-driven QSAR (Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships) model. Genotoxicity of four different CNMs (SWCNT, fullerene C60, carbon black and graphene) and their variations will be evaluated by measuring the NM-induced expression alteration in genes and proteins that are indicative or essential for the known DNA damage and repair pathways, using the newly developed molecular genotoxicity assay platform and, with the extension to multiple species across different taxonomic levels (bacteria, yeast and human). Dose-response relationships and molecular genotoxicity endpoints will be determined using the molecular effect level index (MELI) recently proposed by us. To validate the proposed molecular assay and confirm the genotoxicity of CNMs tested, conventional phenotypic genotoxcity assays will be performed in parallel. An array of modern techniques will be employed to determine the purity, elemental composition, dimension, surface chemistry, aggregate size and state, zeta potential, hydrophilicity etc. of the CNMs. A prototype nanogenotoxicity QSAR model with hierarchical structures that integrates current QSAR framework with molecular bioassay information through correlative links among CNMs descriptors, DNA damage mechanism-specific molecular endpoints and phenotypic genotoxicity endpoints will be explored.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Development of methods to rationally modify CNT chemistry and morphology (primarily length).  The knowledge was initially used to produce stable CNT dispersions in water for a variety of studies including CNT alignment, antifouling membranes, and toxicity.  All three processes have been observed to be highly dependent on CNT properties.  CNT alignment on a microscale is best with short, highly functionalized CNT forming a homogeneous coating whereas on a macroscale long, lightly oxidized CNT are best as they dense fiber bundles that span the length on the area in question.  In regard to antifouling filmes/electrodes, long and pristine (unoxidized) CNT were desired to maintain conductivity where a light Nafion CNT coating was necessary to mainatin a well-dispersed CNT aqueous solution.  Both interlaced CNT electrodes and paint-based CNT electrodes greatly reduced the amount of material (and thus cost) necessary.  Novel dielectrophoretic and electrohydrodyanmic antifouling mechanisms were observed in these systems.  A number of CNT toxicity studies are nearing completion.  The toxicogenomic studies indicate that the antimicrobial mechanism is strongly dependent on CNT properties.  The more conductive the CNT, the more important ROS generation is to toxicity.  The CNT length, stiffness, and oxidation effect the specific mechanism of physical membrane perturbation.  The shorter stiffer and more oxidized tend to approach perpendicular to the cell membrane.  Whereas the longer more hydrophobic tend to phage in more parallel with both inducing cell membrane repair.  The CNT modification approaches have been adapted for graphene oxide (GO).  GO requires a lower intensity sonication (bath as opposed to probe) to reduce lateral dimension and since GO is already highly oxidized post-synthesis reduction (thermal/N2, UV/vacuum, HI) methods are used to alter surface chemistry.  Preliminary results indicate GO properties also strongly affect microbe toxicity with the goal here to develop a rational statistical approach to develop a quantitative GO structure activity relationaship as current literature results tend to be a random assortment of results.
