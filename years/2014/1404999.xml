<AbstractNarration>From June 2 through June 6, 2014, Boston University will host an international conference entitled "p-adic Variation in Number Theory." The conference will focus on the notion that automorphic forms vary in p-adic families and the multitude of applications resulting from this variation. Over the last decade, there has been enormous progress in Iwasawa theory and the study of Galois representations fueled by advances in the p-adic variation of automorphic forms (e.g. the proofs of the Main Conjecture of modular forms and the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture along with recent developments in attaching Galois representations to automorphic forms).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this conference, experts will lecture on the most recent developments and applications relating to p-adic variation to bring the participants of the conference up to date in this quickly evolving field. Many young researchers will participate. Some of the conference's lectures will be delivered by recent PhDs. In addition, funding will be provided to over 50 graduate students and recent PhDs in total, to be selected through an application process. Special attention will be given to any applications received from under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference website:  math.bu.edu/Glennfest/Glennfest.html</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    From June 2-6, 2014, Boston University hosted a research conference, "p-adic Variation in Number Theory", in honor of Glenn Stevens' 60th birthday.   With 194 registered participants, this conference was one of the largest number theory conferences in the US in 2014.    Glenn Stevens is a leading figure in algebraic number theory and arithmetic algebraic geometry, with many contributions to modular forms, elliptic curves, p-adic L-functions and Galois representations.  In addition, Steven has had a huge influence in mathematical education in his role as founder and director (for the 26th straight year) of PROMYS (Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists), an intensive summer program at Boston University for high school students which covers number theory and other topics.  Many young researchers and graduate students in number theory in the US were first introduced to the subject through PROMYS.   Honoring Glenn Stevens with a large research conference was a fitting tribute to his 60th birthday.    During the conference, there were 25 talks over the five days of the conference.  Between talks, coffee breaks were held in a large open space in which participants could congregate.  There was also a banquet held in honor of Glenn Stevens' contributions.  We were able to provide funding to 64 postdocs and graduate students for travel and/or housing.    The response to the conference was overwhelming.  The lecture hall was filled to capacity, and almost all potential speakers we contacted agreed to speak.  We heard world experts Barry Mazur and Michael Harris explain the huge impact of Stevens' work in their talks.  We also learned of the latest contributions from a variety of junior researchers, postdocs, and graduate students.  At the conference banquet, dozens of people of all ages gathered to share their stories of how Stevens affected their mathematical and personal lives.
