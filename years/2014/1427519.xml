<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this award is to support international travel for distinguished invited speakers, including young investigators and investigators from underrepresented groups from the US, to attend the Inaugural International Workshop on Multiscale Mechanobiology (IWMM) to be held in Hong Kong, May 15-18, 2014. Mechanical modulation of cell, tissue and organ functions has been long recognized as an important basic science issue and has generated global interest in the field of mechanobiology.  One of the challenges in the field of mechanobiology is the inherent nature of multi-disciplinary and multiscale hierarchies. Therefore, biologists, engineers, physical scientists, and clinicians must come together and develop new approaches and future vision for mechanobiology. In addition, the spatial and temporal scales in mechanobiology must be bridged via modern biology, quantitative molecular imaging, and large-scale computation.  The objectives of this IWMM: (1) bring together top leaders in the US, Asia, and Europe/Middle East in the relevant fields of biology, engineering, physical sciences, and medicine to exchange cutting edge research in multiscale mechanobiology; (2) expose young investigators including junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students to advanced research in multiscale mechanobiology; and (3) develop blueprints for the future of multiscale mechanobiology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several transformative broader impacts will be realized by this inaugural IWMM. The exchanges, brainstorming, and breakout sessions will be captured in a whitepaper forming the blueprint of multiscale mechanobiology for publication in primer journals and rapid open access disseminations.  In addition, an edited book on Multiscale Mechanobiology will be compiled at the end of the Workshop for publication.  Finally, the Workshop will include young investigators and prepare them for the future and opportunities of multiscale mechanobiology.  Young investigators will be intimately involved in the Workshop, providing a unique experience to observe how the future of mechanobiology will be shaped collectively.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Biomechanical factors are of fundamental and recognized importance in biology and medicine.  Diseases normally alter tissue form and function through changes in force and geometry of single cells over time. Mechanical modulation of cell, tissue, and organ functions has been long recognized as an important basic science and clinical biomedical issue that has generated global interest in the field of mechanobiology.  From the increased rate of wound healing in skin with periodic mechanical stimulation to the benefits of exercise in preventing medical problems/diseases, we know that mechanical issues are important but we have only begun to understand how mechanical factors are sensed.  Most recently, exciting discoveries such as that extracellular matrix mechanics alone can modulate and control stem cell differentiation have placed mechanobiology at the cusp of MechanoMedicine, i.e., mechanobiology is relevant to medicine and health.  The goals of this international workshop on multi-scale mechanobiology are to: (1) bring biologists, bioengineers, biophysicists together to exchange knowledge and develop a multi-scale approach in mechanobiology; (2) bring experimental and computational/modeling experts together to develop integrated strategies in multi-scale mechanobiology; (3) bring experts from Asia, North America, Europe, and other regions together to brainstorm the future global directions in multi-scale mechanobiology; and (4) expose young students/fellows to the cutting edge research in multi-scale mechanobiology.  The outcomes of this international workshop include: (1) the identification of MechanoMedicine as the new era of mechanobiology, bringing mechanics to medicine to benefit human health; (2) a series of International Symposium on MechanoMedicine held at Colombia University in the City of New York, which is open to public; (3) formation of Columbia Center for MechanoMedicine and open-to-the public Distinguished Lectures on MechanoMedicine; and (4) a multi-institution and multidisciplinary leadership team on MechanoMedicine (http://research.columbia.edu/mechanomedicine-lectures).
