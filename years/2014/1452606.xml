<AbstractNarration>This project is a community-based program that will offer workshops which will connect professional mathematicians and pre-service mathematics teachers from Diné College, with middle and high school teachers and students across the nation's largest Native American reservation. The project will create a program in this community, with the long-term goal that these extra-curricular mathematical activities will help future and present Native American teachers draw more Native Americans into mathematics and math-intensive STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data confirm that Native Americans are under-represented in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) careers and in higher education programs that would prepare students for work in STEM areas. These students have few opportunities to see mathematics beyond "school math" and therefore have limited exposure to non-routine problems, investigations, and the mathematical practices used by mathematicians and others in math-intense disciplines.  This program has a multi-faceted approach, but is rooted in the "math circles" professional development and mathematical growth model.  The project will recruit and support mathematics professionals to offer workshops at Navajo Nation schools, with the help of pre-service Mathematics teachers from Diné College and lead teachers and students in activities centered around math circle problems. Simultaneously, the pre-service teachers and mathematicians, with the help of workshop attendees, will work to produce activities which are culturally relevant to students from the Navajo Nation in grades 6-12.  These scripts will be used for after-school enrichment in the style of math circles.  The project leads will also facilitate a large annual math festival and workshop for students and teachers at Diné College and across the Navajo nation.  Evaluation of the outcomes of the project will be tri-fold, with observations by an external team of faculty, presently involved with developing culturally relevant mathematics activities, an advisory board and an internal evaluation by the pre-service teacher educator from Diné College.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The broad goal of the NNMC project is to create a sustainable program in the Navajo community that will draw more Native Americans into mathematics and math-intensive STEM fields by engaging them in multiple settings and multiple grade levels in extensive problem solving tasks guided by mathematicians from around the U.S. The Navajo Nation is physically larger than 10 of the U.S. states (including West Virginia), but has been "left behind" in STEM development. The project and the work supported by this award contributed significantly to the goal of creating a "buzz" about mathematics among the Navajo students and teachers, and to connect a network of mathematics professionals from across the United States to the people and culture known as Navajo.  In particular, the following attest to the outcomes achieved through this support:      More than 50 visits to K-12 schools in the Navajo Nation by mathematicians from institutions in CA, KS, OH, IN, MO, AZ, NM, and WA. Mathematicians worked directly with K-12 students and teachers as well as tribal community college students, university undergraduates and graduate students, and parents. Undergraduate and graduate students from multiple schools also contributed directly to these visits. The project recruited and supported mathematics festivals each year at Dine? College in Tsaile, AZ by funding visiting mathematician travel and supplies. Each year, the festivals attracted between 300 and 700 students and their parents/teachers. Over three years, this impacts more than 1200 students and parents and communicates the importance and excitement of STEM subjects, as well as the relevance of pursuing education in these subjects. The project earned a book contract through MSRI and AMS to publish a set of scripts for use by teachers of Navajo students (and others) to facilitate after-school math circles. Dine? College, the first tribally-controlled community college in the U.S., went from having no math majors to having 15 math majors. They are now teaching Calculus I, II, and III for the first time in their history. Similarly, their majors now are able to take Linear Algebra and Differential Equations for the first time. These are the subjects necessary to future success in medicine, engineering, and the mathematical and physical sciences. Din&eacute; College now has three full-time staff in mathematics to respond to this demand--double what it was at the start of this project. Support from this project ultimately led to the creation of the Alliance of Indigenous Math Circles (AIMC) using further support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York to offer a new summer camp in Farmington, NM at the Navajo Preparatory Academy, as well as the Navajo Nation's first-ever Math Teachers' Circle, fully administered and led by Navajo teachers with support from AIMC. The AIMC is now engaged with members of the Chickasaw and Choctaw tribes of Oklahoma to start similar projects there. Teachers who have had affiliation with the project through this grant have begun taking advantage of other opportunities to learn and develop in math circle leadership by attending the National Association of Math Circles training workshops in Denver, CO, and also related development opportunities in Boston and Palo Alto. The documentary film, Navajo Math Circles, has brought visibility to the project and the people behind this effort. The film aired nationally on PBS in November 2016.  The Navajo leader, Manuelito, once shared a now-famous mandate to his people, that they climb the rungs of the ladder of education so as to raise up themselves and the Din&eacute; (Navajo people). The premise of this NSF project is to offer a community of mathematics professionals to help support the ladder, to point out the rungs, and ultimately, to celebrate as Manuelito's people climb.
