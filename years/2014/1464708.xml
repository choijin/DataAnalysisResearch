<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Michael Duncan of the University of Georgia to conduct experimental studies to look at the structure and bonding in complex protonated species.  These species are commonly invoked in important reaction mechanisms, like the ever-ubiquitous proton transfer.  In these particular experiments, Professor Duncan will use the observed infrared spectra of ions tagged with Ar atoms to infer information about the structure of the protonated species, as well as the strengths of the various bonds (from the vibrational frequencies).  The graduate and undergraduate students working on this project will receive training in laser science, molecular beam methods and spectroscopy, while working on compelling chemical problems with  broad scientific impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Profesor Michael Duncan and his research group will use infrared lasers to photodissociate Ar-tagged protonated species prepared in a molecular beam.  The infrared spectrum of these tagged ions is measured by scanning the infrared laser while looking for production of the untagged ion.  Species to be studied are:  protonated carbonyls, protonated hydrocarbons (carbocations), proton-bound dimers, simple mimics of solvated species.  In a new direction, Prof. Duncan and his students will expand their work to look at photofragment imaging of some interesting protonated systems to measure the bond energies for these weakly bound systems and to explore the tag-free spectroscopy of some of the ions.  Professor Duncan will continue to collaborate with a wide range of theorists and experimentalists on these important chemical problems.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Proton transfer processes are found throughout Chemistry and Biology, occurring in acid-base chemistry, electrochemistry, enzyme catalysis, hydrogen fuel cells, photosynthesis, etc.&nbsp; In all of these situations, a molecular-level understanding of the chemistry is needed.&nbsp; However, this is difficult to obtain in the hopelessly complex environment in solution, where bonding configurations change rapidly and many solvent molecules mediate the chemistry.&nbsp; Our research program investigates individual protonated molecules, which form the basis of these processes, in the simplified environment of a molecular beam.&nbsp; The experiment produces the ions in a vacuum, uses a mass spectrometer to select and identify their composition, and infrared laser spectroscopy complemented by computational quantum chemistry to determine their structures.&nbsp; With these methods, the solvent or reaction partners can first be eliminated and then systematically re-introduced one molecule at a time to probe protonated structures and how they change with the environment.&nbsp; Protonated ions, proton-bridging structures (which are intermediates in proton transfer), and water-solvated structures are investigated at the molecular level.&nbsp; These model systems provide snapshots of molecular configurations along the proton transfer pathway and challenging benchmark systems for theory.</p> <p>These measurements are conceptually simple, but their implementation and interpretation are technically demanding.&nbsp; The isolation and selection of ions in a mass spectrometer provides their compositions, but necessitates that their concentrations are extremely low.&nbsp; Successful experiments require optimized sources to produce and cool the ions, mass spectrometer designs to preserve their concentrations, and ultra-sensitive laser methods to measure their infrared spectroscopy.&nbsp; Likewise, the spectral patterns for the exotic ions of interest are intrinsically complex, requiring state-of-the-art anharmonic theory for their interpretation.&nbsp; We use second-order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2) computations and also local mode calculations together with collaborator Prof. Anne McCoy (U. of Washington).&nbsp;
