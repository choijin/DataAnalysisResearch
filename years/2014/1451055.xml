<AbstractNarration>Large-scale structures in collisional mountain belts such as the Alps or Himalayas typically record shortening strains reflective of the collision of two continents. However, increasing evidence is emerging that some structures in these belts deform by extension (or stretching), a pattern opposite to the expectation. In some cases, the extension may be consequence of collapse of the high topography created by the collision. In this project, a research team from California Institute of Technology and Australian National University, will test if a major structure in the Alps deformed by extension. If so, the finding would shed new light on the complex processes that operate in major collisional mountain belts. The project would advance desired societal outcomes by: (1) full participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM through a high school mentoring program; (2) increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology through outreach activities; (3) development of a competitive STEM workforce through training of a graduate and an undergraduate student; and (4) increased partnerships through international collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the structural and low-temperature thermal history of the base of the Austroalpine allochthon in eastern Switzerland, representing the contact between the Adriatic microplate and various tectonostratigraphic units located along the southern margin of Europe. Published thermochronological and structural data in the region suggest that the fault may primarily be a normal fault, juxtaposing the allochthon against its structurally complex substrate, the Pennine Zone, at some point in early to mid-Tertiary time. In collaboration with the Australian National University, the research team will analyze eight transects across the southern part of the base of the allochthon in order to constrain the thermal histories of the Austroalpine and Penninic domains, and the structural transport direction(s) along and near the base. This project will constrain the cooling paths of from samples transects using (U-Th)/He and fission-track methods on apatite, zircon and where possible, titanite. The Australian National University group will constrain the cooling histories of the same samples, using white mica and potassium feldspar. This multiple-method approach across key contact zones will provide powerful new constraints on the origin and emplacement of the allochthon. A normal fault origin for the base of the allochthon (cold rocks emplaced over hot), if correct, will have first-order implications not only for the assembly of this iconic orogen, but for convergent orogens in general.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ What causes mountains to rise?  One of the most common settings for their development are places where the earth?s tectonic plates collide.  Like the jaws of a closing vice, the plates trap intervening crust between them, greatly deforming it.  One of the best known examples of this complex process is the European Alps, which formed between colliding plates now represented by Europe north of the Alps on one side (France, Britain, Germany and Poland), and Europe south of the Alps on the other, including Italy and the Adriatic Sea.  This project was aimed at understanding how the crustal mass between these "jaws" developed into mountains.  A common feature of mountain belts are large faults (including those that make earthquakes), but the role of large faults in forming the high topography of mountains chains is a controversial subject.  The traditional view is that the faults are a direct expression of the convergence of the plates, generally reflecting the highly asymmetric process of plate subduction, or the motion of one plate underneath the other to great depths in the earth (100 miles or more down).  If this were generally true, and if we could unravel the displacements on the faults, we would then have a pretty good overall measure of how the two plates moved with respect to each other.  In this project, we studied the motion of the largest faults in the Alps of eastern Switzerland using the techniques of isotope geochemistry and structural geology, and placed important new constraints on their large-scale displacement histories.  The research showed that the largest faults do not reflect relative motion between the plates, but instead accommodate the inflation of the earth?s crust by the upward movement of buoyant crustal rocks that had been subducted to great depth. This material, belonging to the northern plate, was at first anchored to the subducting plate as it went down during collision.  The formation of faults within the mountain belt mainly occurred after the two plates had completely collided with each other, when the mechanical attachment of the subducted crust to the downgoing plate was lost due to heating, allowing it to rise upward relative to its deep, relatively dense surroundings.  This "return" of crust to the surface served to greatly thicken the crust along the collisional "suture" of the two plates near the surface, causing the formation of the Alps.
