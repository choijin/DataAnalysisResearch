<AbstractNarration>Gravitational waves were predicted almost 100 years ago in Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, but they have not yet been detected due to the extreme sensitivity required. Examples of potential sources include interacting black holes, coalescing compact binary stellar systems, stellar collapses, and pulsars. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) was built to measure strains in the fabric of space-time that are produced by gravitational waves.  However, the initial version was sensitive enough to see only a short way into the Cosmos. With completion of a recent upgrade, Advanced LIGO will soon become operational with ten times the sensitivity of LIGO.  When it reaches design sensitivity, it should be able to detect gravity wave sources as far away as the Virgo cluster of galaxies and launch gravitational wave astronomy as a new window on the Universe.  Stanford has a strong, multidisciplinary program in developing the technology for detectors such as LIGO.  Participants include mechanical, electrical and control engineers, physicists and materials researchers. The program provides training for future scientists and engineers at both the undergraduate and graduate levels; it integrates basic scientific research with scientific education; and it develops and funds outreach programs that inform and educate the broader community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stanford is engaged in research and development on gravitational wave detection for the LIGO program. Improved seismic isolation and alignment system platforms will be developed to enable higher sensitivity at low frequencies where ground vibrations currently limit sensitivity. Studies of the optics will remain an active area of research to reduce noise from thermally-driven mechanical fluctuations in their amorphous optical coatings, which is now predicted to limit the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO in its most sensitive frequency band around 1000 Hz.  Investigations of the atomic structure of the amorphous coatings will focus on a better understanding of the microscopic mechanisms that cause mechanical loss, which results in excess thermal noise. The thrust of the proposed research is to reduce risk and facilitate the success of Advanced LIGO, and to enable an opening of gravitational wave astronomy.</AbstractNarration>
