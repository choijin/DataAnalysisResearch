<AbstractNarration>Earth science communities need to rely on access to large and growing amounts of curated data to make progress in research and provide adequate education. Existing infrastructures pose significant barriers to this access, especially for small to mid-size research groups and primarily undergraduate institutions: cloud services disappear when funding runs out to pay for them and therefore do not provide the long-term availability required for curated data. Similarly, in-house IT infrastructure is maintenance-intensive and requires dedicated resources for which long-term funding is often unavailable. The goal of the Big Weather Web is to make in-house IT infrastructure affordable by combining the application of three recent technologies: virtualization, federated smart storage, and big data management. Virtualization allows push-button deployment and maintenance of complex systems, smart storage provides automatic, community-wide data availability guarantees, and big data management allows for easy curation of data and its products. The combination of these three technologies allows communities to create a standard community-specific computational environment and efficiently refine it with minimal repetition of work, introducing a high degree of reproducibility in research and education. This reproducibility accelerates learning and amplifies everyone?s contribution. Due to virtualization, it can easily take advantage of cloud services whenever they become available, and it can run on in-house IT infrastructure using significantly reduced maintenance resources. The Big Weather Web will be developed in the context of numerical weather prediction with the expectation that the resulting infrastructure can be easily adapted to other data-intensive scientific communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The volume, variety, and velocity of scientific data generated is growing exponentially. Small to mid-size research groups and especially primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) do not have the resources to manage large amounts of data locally and share their data products globally at high availability. This lack of resources has a number of consequences in education and research that have been well-documented in recent EarthCube workshops: (1) data-intensive scientific results are not easily reproducible, whether in the context of research or education, (2) limited or non-existent availability of intermediate results causes a lot of unnecessary duplication of work and makes learning curves unnecessarily steep, and consequently (3) scientific communities of practice are falling behind technological innovations. This Big Weather Web project focuses on the numerical weather prediction community. Numerical weather models produce terabytes of output per day, comprising a wealth of information that can be used for research and education, but this amount of data is difficult to transfer, store, or analyze for most universities. The Big Weather Web addresses this situation with the design, implementation, and deployment of "nuclei," which are shared artifacts that enable reliable and efficient access and sharing of data, encode best practices, and are sustainably maintained and improved by the community. These nuclei use existing and well-established technologies, but the integration of these technologies will significantly reduce the resource burden mentioned above. Nucleus 1 is a large ensemble distributed over seven universities. Nucleus 2 is a common storage, linking, and cataloging methodology implemented as an appliance-like Data Investigation and Sharing Environment (DISE) that is extremely easy to maintain and that automatically ensures data availability and safety. Nucleus 3 is a versioned virtualization and container technology for easy deployment and reproducibility of computational environments. Together, these nuclei will advance discovery and understanding through sharing of data products and methods to replicate scientific results while promoting teaching, training, and learning by creating a shared environment for scientific communities of practice. These shared environments are particularly important for underrepresented groups who otherwise have limited access to knowledge that is primarily propagated by social means. Our approach is a significant step towards improving reproducibility in the complex computational environments found in many scientific communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ensembles, multiple simulations of a single event with slight variations in each simulation, are a common method in numerical weather and climate prediction to create a ?spread? of possible forecast outcomes (?members?) for a given period.  However, to create an ensemble with enough members to represent a reasonable set of event outcomes in real-time takes considerable resources which are not available to both large and small educational or research organizations.  The Big Weather Web (BWW) project was a collaborative project by which this infrastructure shortfall was overcome by multiple universities creating a community ensemble of weather forecasts and a common framework by which each institution could access all of them.  The result was an extended dataset of 49 ensemble members collectively generated by seven institutions for a year?s period, with some of the institutions, including SD Mines extending their simulations to nearly three years.  The ensemble used a common modeling framework, the National Center for Atmospheric Research Weather Research and Forecast Model (WRF).  Also part of the larger community project was to test frameworks by which to provide access to numerical weather prediction teaching tools for schools with limited technology resources, and also to test methodologies by which to publish scientific papers that include the ability to reproduce the results therein.       The community ensemble output is publicly available at on a JetStream Thematic Real-time Environmental Distributed Data Services (THREDDS) server at http://149.165.157.204/thredds/catalog/archive/catalog.html and is fully accessible using direct download, and OPeNDAP and  NetCDF Subset Services frameworks.  SD Mine?s ensembles are also kept on a THREDDS server at http://kyrill.ias.sdsmt.edu:8080/thredds/catalog/catalog.html   In addition to these broader goals, each school also had local projects that leveraged the technology, tools, and ensemble datasets created in this project.  For SD Mines, our project?s focus was on using forecast ensembles to develop further a civilian variant of a ?Confidence Index? that we had previously developed on a US Army-NATO project.  The original concept of the Confidence Index was that intrinsic weather features, e.g., frontal systems, high convective rainfall (e.g., thunderstorms) potential and other features, could be used to predict the probability of forecast error.  We were able to demonstrate this in that project, but we also were curious if we could develop the confidence index for ensembles.  Thus the BWW project was a perfect testbed for this.  The overarching idea of the Confidence Index (or ?CI?) is to plot two variables against each other: One representing a predictable risk or hazard, the other representing resulting error.  While similar work plotting variables may anticipate a traditional regression relationship, the actual relationship should be more complex.  As shown in Figure 1, the resulting form of the risk vs. error (or hazard vs. fragility in the broadest sense of the concept) forms a shape, specifically a ?wedge? where low risk should mostly result in a low predictive error and high risk can result in a high predictive error. Still, the prediction can ring true should the forecasts exhibit high skill.  One application of the Confidence Index is to anticipate workflows as a given weather event approaches.  For example, high risk scenarios may require additional ensemble members, more attention by the forecasters on a given shift, or further, more detailed model runs as we approach the time of the actual forecast.  We also believe that the framework may apply to other problem domains beyond weather and climate prediction for scenarios that involve fragility and risk.  In this project, rather than detection of weather features, is the use of the variance (?spread?) of the forecast ensembles to determine the forecast confidence.  For this project, we took the BWW ensembles and also ensembles from the National Weather Service Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), a real-time dataset that would both endure after the project?s BWW ensembles were complete, and were, available before we collated the BWW ensembles.
