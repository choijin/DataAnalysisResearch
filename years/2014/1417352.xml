<AbstractNarration>This award will provide funding for the Coordinated Theoretical-Experimental Project on QCD (CTEQ) Summer Schools for the next three years.   CTEQ is a collaboration dedicated to the effects of the strong interaction on phenomenological processes at colliders.    These effects are crucial in extracting results from most collider experiments.   For example, understanding the properties of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) requires understanding its production in proton-proton collisions, and that requires understanding how quarks, antiquarks and gluons fit inside of protons.  It is this understanding that the CTEQ Collaboration provides.   Understanding Higgs decays to quarks also depends on this knowledge.   The results of the CTEQ Collaboration are essential in both experimental and theoretical particle physics and are heavily used.   The Summer Schools operated by CTEQ are a training ground for numerous physicists to continue the Collaboration.   They are truly international - the 2014 School is in Beijing and the 2015 School is in Pittsburgh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 1000 physicists have attended the CTEQ Schools, which consist of nine days of lectures and discussion.   Each school has 50-100 students attending.    The impact on the field is profound, and many collaborations have been generated by this close interaction.   Every year, many students claim a financial hardship in attending, and receive fellowships.   This award will go to support students in attending the Schools.    The funding will fully support 10 students, or partially support many more.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The CTEQ summer schools have been an institution for training graduate students and young postdocs in the areas of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and the standard model since 1992. The summer schools have been partially supported by the National Science Foundation. During the 3 years supported by this grant, the summer schools have been held at the University of Pittsburgh, DESY (Hamburg, Germany) and then back at Pittsburgh. The normal cycling is to have the school in odd years at the University of Pittsburgh and in even years at a site outside the US. The foreign sites are chosen on the basis of proposals submitted to the CTEQ collaboration by universities/laboratories/organizations. The schools have 8 days of lectures, with a break day in between. Lectures are given by experts in the fields of QCD and the standard model. One of the key aspects of the CTEQ summer schools has always been the close contact between students and lecturers. In addition to the lectures themselves, there are nightly recitation periods, where the students are free to ask questions of the lecturers. All meals are in common, and after the recitations, there is also a 'nightcap', where beer and wine is provided (along with snacks), and the students have an opporunity to talk to the lectureres one-on-one.

Four of the students have come back to be lecturers, an indication of their favorable view of tthe summer schools.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/09/2018<br>      Modified by: Joey&nbsp;W&nbsp;Huston</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
