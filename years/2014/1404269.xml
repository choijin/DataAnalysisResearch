<AbstractNarration>Einstein's Theory of General Relativity predicts that the motion of massive astronomical bodies such as black holes or supernovae will generate tiny changes in the curvature of space called gravitational waves.  Experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) are designed to detect these waves by measuring the length difference between two paths with laser light.  The optics in these experiments are suspended in vacuum to isolate them from all forms of vibration.  With no air to conduct it away, excess surface charge can build up on the optics over time.  The motion of this charge changes the surrounding electric field, vibrating the optic and degrading the sensitivity of the experiment.  The group at Trinity University has been measuring the rate at which surface charge builds up and a method of removing the charge that does not harm the delicate reflective coatings on the optics.  Funding from this grant supports the completion of a charge removal system for delivery to the LIGO observatories and the study of the effect of different optical cleaning and handling techniques on the mobility of surface charge, and even the individual charge motions themselves.  Pursuing this research will help improve the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO and future gravitational-wave detectors, for which surface charge has been a known limiting noise source since 2006.  The funding supports undergraduate research at Trinity University, where students can gain valuable experience working locally on a scaled-down vacuum system prototype while contributing to the overall LIGO research effort.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is most sensitive to gravitational waves at signal frequencies near 100 Hz.  A limiting noise source at these frequencies is surface charge on test masses, the motion of which generates fluctuating electric fields that vibrate the masses.  The noise contribution depends on the charge magnitude and the correlation time for charge motion.  This project tackles three issues related to charging noise.  One is to finalize a deliverable discharging system and assist with its installation at the LIGO observatories.  Prototype systems using ionized nitrogen gas have been demonstrated at both MIT and Trinity University, but it still must be verified that the process does not damage the test mass reflective coating.  This is done by acquiring a test mass of known absorption, exposing it to an ionized nitrogen system, and then having its absorption retested (this process has been used in cooperation with Stanford University for previous discharging techniques).  The second is to characterize the relaxation time constant and charging/discharging rate for Advanced LIGO test masses using different cleaning and handling techniques, to determine which methods will reduce charging noise.  This requires obtaining several LIGO test mass witness samples, applying different cleaning techniques (methanol, liquinox, First Contact, etc.) to each, moving them into a vacuum system, charging with a high-voltage electrode pattern, and then using a Kelvin probe to measure the rate at which the deposited charge dissipates across the face of the test mass.  This methodology will also be applied to proposed optical coatings and substrates for third-generation interferometers in cooperation with the Optics Working Group of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration.  The third is to modify an existing atomic force microscope at Trinity University so that it can perform Kelvin probe microscopy.  This will make it possible tovisualize individual charge "hopping" across an insulating surface, with the goal of refining the Markov process model of low frequency noise contributions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2006, the motion of electrical charge on the surface of optics was found to be a limiting noise source in the LIGO gravitational-wave observatories.  Since that time, our lab has contributed to the understanding of charging noise, leading to the installation of a discharging system at the observatories in 2014.  This award, therefore, concentrated on charging-related issues that could effect future generations of gravitational-wave observatories.  The charge removal system, while effective, interrupts running for a significant time.  Our first goal was to investigate which cleaning and handling methods resulted in the slowest buildup of charge, to maximize uptime between discharging treatments.  We found that essentially all typical solvents gave the same results to within the precision of the measurement.  There was also a concern that the First Contact cleaning solution left "patches" of material behind at which excess charge collected.  While we have seen evidence of such patches, we have seen it for other solvents such as acetone, too.  These results have been communicated to the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) through direct communication within the Charging working group.  Charging noise disappears if the optical surface is either a perfect insulator or a perfect conductor.  Stanford University has been working on conductive coatings for LIGO optics, and sent three samples to our lab for testing.  We found that aluminum/zinc coatings had consistent charge decay time constants from minutes down to seconds, while zinc oxide coatings displayed substantial surface irregularities and widely varying decay times.  It should be noted that none of these optics had the proper reflective coatings yet; our system is ready to test such samples when produced.  We measure charge with a Kelvin probe, a device originally designed to measure contact potential differences in materials.  We experimented with using an atomic force microscope (AFM) as a superior charge measurement tool, one capable of measuring individual charge motion.  After much effort we abandoned this idea for several reasons:  (a) the AFM could only measure surface potentials up to +/- 10V, while potentials on insulators can easily exceed kilovolts; (b) the maximum scan range of 70 microns is not useful for examining how charge varies across a surface; (c) smooth surface scanning and continuous loop running were not supported by our AFM; and (d) each measurement of a single point required fitting a parabola of phase response, so data collection quickly grew out of hand.  Fortunately, the major outcome of this project was, with the assistance of undergraduate Hanna Rafferty, a top-to-bottom renovation of our Kelvin Probe system to a greater level of precision.  The system now has a noise floor of 50 microvolts with better than 20 micron spatial resolution.  Scanning has been sped up by nearly a factor of four and temperature drift has been eliminated.  The system is now sufficiently accurate to contribute to better noise modeling from charge motion.  We have already measured never-before-seen behaviors, such as regions of positive and negative charge migrating through each other towards the optic center and edge, respectively, over a period of ten days.  These results, as well as an advertisement of the system's promise and a call for samples, have been communicated to the LSC through an internal technical note in 2018.  Along with supporting the PI in speaking about gravitational-wave interferometry everywhere from universities and high schools to the San Antonio Boys and Girls Club, the broader impacts of the project include the development of a suite of undergraduate laboratory experiments to teach how the LIGO observatory improves upon the basic Michelson Interferometer.  Along with Dr. Antje Bergmann of the University of Karlsruhe, we developed a kit to demonstrate how a Herriott delay line works, how an optical cavity improves the interferometer response, how to lock the cavity to "resonance" (i.e., freeze its length at an integer number of laser wavelengths), and how it measures a gravitational wave using vibrations from a sound wave as a proxy.  A paper outlining these experiments has been accepted for publication in the American Journal of Physics.          Last Modified: 10/04/2018       Submitted by: Dennis W Ugolini]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
