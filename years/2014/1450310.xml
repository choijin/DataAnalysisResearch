<AbstractNarration>Advanced software plays a fundamental role for large scientific projects. The primary goal of DIANA/HEP (Data Intensive ANAlysis for High Energy Physics) is developing state-of-the-art tools for experiments that acquire, reduce, and analyze petabytes of data. Improving performance, interoperability, and collaborative tools through modifications and additions to packages broadly used by the community will allow users to more fully exploit the data being acquired at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other facilities. These experiments are addressing questions at the heart of physics: What are the underlying constituents of matter? And how do they interact? With the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, the Standard Model of particle physics is complete. It provides an excellent description of known particles and forces.  However, the most interesting questions remain open: What is the dark matter which pervades the universe? Does space-time have additional symmetries or extend beyond the 3 spatial dimensions we know? What is the mechanism stabilizing the Higgs boson mass from enormous quantum corrections? The next generation of experiments will collect exabyte-scale data samples to provide answers. Analyzing this data will require new and better tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, the project will provide the CPU and IO performance needed to reduce the iteration time so crucial to explore new ideas. It will develop software to effectively exploit emerging many- and multi-core hardware. It will establish infrastructure for a higher-level of collaborative analysis, building on the successful patterns used for the Higgs boson discovery and enabling a deeper communication between the theoretical community and the experimental community. DIANA?s products will sit in the ROOT framework, already used by the HEP community of more than 10000 particle and nuclear physicists. By improving interoperability with the larger scientific software ecosystem, DIANA will incorporate best practices and algorithms from other disciplines into HEP. Similarly, the project will make its computing insights, tools, and novel ideas related to collaborative analysis, standards for data preservation, and best practices for treating software as a research product available to the larger scientific community.  Finally, to improve the quality of the next generation of software engineers in HEP, DIANA will host an annual workshop on analysis tools and establish a fellowship program.</AbstractNarration>

The focus of the effort at NYU was mainly on advanced data analysis tools and techniques, including those that use machine learning, and tools to support analysis reproducibility and reuse. The researched was motivated by problems at the Large Hadron Collider, but efforts were made to abstract the research and software products to be relevant to a wide range of scientific disciplins. The award was highly successful and made an enormous impact on the field of particle physics and beyond.</p> <p>At NYU PI Cranmer recruited Dr. Gilles Louppe, a machine learning researcher that was a CERN fellow at the time. Louppe joined Cranmer and worked on early papers that leveraged machine learning techniques in a novel way to enable statistical inference in settings that are normally intractable. This settings is often refered to as Likelihood-free inference, but Louppe, Cranmer, Pavez, and Brehmer have promoted the use of the term Simulation-Based Inference instead. Louppe and Cranmer wrote a software package called CARL that was one of the first python tools written, documented, and distributed in what would become the new standard for the field.&nbsp;</p> <p>Louppe and Cranmer continued to put out a number of papers in a thread of exploratory machine learning research. This included establishing collaboration with well known deep learning researchers, establishing a connection between physics and natural langauge processing, one of the earliest works using graph neural networks and geometric deep learning for particle physics. Cranmer gave an invited keynote for NeurIPS 2016 (the largest machine learning conference in the world) highlighting some of this work.&nbsp;</p> <p>The NeurIPS keynote led to a collaboration with&nbsp; computer scientists and statisticians at Oxford and the scientific computing team at NERSC. The award supported Louppe, NYU graduate student Heinrich in this collaboration. The focus of this research was to demonstrate that newly developed techniques known as "probabilistic programming" could be applied to real-world scientific simulators. We developed the ppx protocol that allowed an external inference engine (python) to control a scientific simulator (written in C++). The inference engine used an enormous machine learning model that was trained on the NERSC supercomputers. This work was nominated for best paper at Supercomputing 2019, and the resulting pyprob and ppx software framework has been applied to astrophysics, COVID-19, and other simulators used in the context of public health and policy.&nbsp;</p> <p>Later Louppe became a professor of AI in Belgium and the award supported postdoc Johann Brehmer. Brehmer and Cranmer continued the exploratory machine learning work related to simulation-based inference, keeping a collaboration with Louppe and Heinrich. A major advancement was made that improved the computational efficiency the simulation based inference techniques. This work was abstracted from physics domain and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. In addition, work specialized to the problems of precision measurements at the LHC was published in a series of impactful papers highlighted by the American Physical Society and in the CERN EP newsletter, and a tool called MadMiner was developed focusing on this high-impact physics target. The tool is well documented and tutorials have been given to several hundred graduate students around the world.&nbsp;</p> <p>Many of these exploratory ML works have been impactful beyond high energy physics. For example, the work "learning to pivot with adversarial classifiers" introduced a technique to train a neural network to be robust to potential mismodelling due to systematic uncertainty. This work also found applications to algorithmic fairness (for example, to race or gender). The work connecting particle physics to natural language processing is highlighted in Stanford's on-line courses on machine learning. And the work on simulation based inference&nbsp;</p> <p>DIANA/HEP also supported impactful work in reproducibility, reuse, and open science durinng a critical time for the field. NYU graduate student Heinrich focused on these topics for his PhD dissertation. During this time the RECAST framework for reinterpreting searches for new physics at the LHC transitioned from an idea to a reality. ATLAS has now published papers using RECAST and it was highlighted in a Nature physics opinion piece called "Open is not Enough" co-authored by Cranmer, Heinrich, and several people from CERN. This led to a spinoff product called REANA that CERN now develops.&nbsp;</p> <p>DIANA/HEP also supported an education and training effort through DIANA/HEP fellows. Meghan Frate worked with Cranmer to establish Gaussian Processes as a powerful data modelling tool. This appraoch was used recently in a paper setting the strongest limits on steril neutrinos as a dark matter candidate. Matthew Feickert's fellowship on pyhf led to a tool used widely and covered on the CERN homepage and Symmetry magazine.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/16/2021<br>      Modified by: Kyle&nbsp;Cranmer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1450310/1450310_10362301_1629127256250_diana-madminer--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1450310/1450310_10362301_1629127256250_diana-madminer--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Viewpoint article"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1450310/1450310_10362301_1629127256250_diana-madminer--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Viewpoint article"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The pair of articles authored by the NYU DIANA/HEP team using machine learning to enhance the sensitivity of measurements at the LHC was selected by the American Physical Society to have a Viewpoint article highlighting the significance of the result.</div> <div class="imageCredit">American Physical Society</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kyle&nbsp;Cranmer</div> <div class="imageTitle">Viewpoint article</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1450310/1450310_10362301_1629127392709_diana-pyhf--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1450310/1450310_10362301_1629127392709_diana-pyhf--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Symmetry-pyhf"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1450310/1450310_10362301_1629127392709_diana-pyhf--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Symmetry-pyhf"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This article in symmetry magazine discusses the publication of statistical models associated to ATLAS physics papers.
