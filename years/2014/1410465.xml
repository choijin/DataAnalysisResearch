<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative recruitment and retention strategies and experiences in support of groups historically underrepresented (URM) in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  The Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance (PNW LSAMP) includes the three state region of Washington, Oregon and Idaho.  Broadening participation in STEM is critical to the region's economic vitality given the significant number of STEM related industries and research initiatives.  PNW LSAMP partners are active contributors to state and regional STEM initiatives, and the strong partnership between alliance campuses has resulted in increased pathways to college, student success in STEM majors and access to undergraduate research experiences.  Since the inception of the alliance, degrees granted to underrepresented minority (URM) students in STEM have increased 70%, far outpacing the overall increase of 21% on partner campuses.  PNW LSAMP is sustaining its foundational work and enhancing it with an emphasis on community college transfer and preparation for graduate study in STEM fields.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PNW Alliance will continue to implement best practices for engaging students in STEM including bridge programs, community-building and participation in undergraduate research.  The Alliance will strengthen its partnerships with eight community colleges to better facilitate community college student transfer to 4 year degree programs and their participation in undergraduate research.  The Alliance will expand the number of students exposed to information about STEM graduate study through an enhanced focus on graduate school preparation. Project goals include 1) increase the number of STEM bachelor degrees granted to URM students by 10% per year; 2) increase the percentage of bachelor degrees granted in STEM to URM students who transfer from community colleges to 40%, and double the number of degrees granted to URM STEM transfer students; and 3) provide workshops and services to ensure that 95% of LSAMP-affiliated students are exposed to information about graduate school preparation.  The knowledge gained through the partnership with MESA community college programs will allow PNW LSAMP to pilot and implement national models for engaging community college students in STEM as they are discovered.</AbstractNarration>

The&#8239;Alliance placed greater focus on transfer students by adding eight 2-year colleges across the tri-states. As shown in Figure 3, the Alliance did not reach the goal of 40% degrees to transfer students by Year 5, but did increase the number of bachelor&rsquo;s degrees granted to transfer students by 29%. In 2017-18, 14% of the degrees granted to URM STEM students were to transfer students from PNW LSAMP community colleges (Figure 4).&#8239;&#8239;While efforts to accomplish&#8239;goal 2&#8239;fell short, there was a slight increase in students graduating in STEM who transferred from PNW LSAMP community colleges.&#8239; This percentage is expected to grow as LSAMP presence on community college campuses becomes stronger, and as LSAMP Scholars successfully transfer and graduate from PNW LSAMP universities. &nbsp;</p> <p>Staffing transitions and communication barriers at OSU, UW and WSU were challenging. Transfer programming was strongest at PSU and BSU, where dedicated full-time community college liaisons strengthened connections between universities and community college partners.&#8239;&#8239;Partner sites with LSAMP or MESA programs provided students with a broad range of activities, services, and programs&#8239;(e.g., skill-building workshops, research,&#8239;travel to conferences&#8239;and access to LSAMP staff to assist with academic and personal concerns).&nbsp;</p> <p>Goal 3)&nbsp;Increasing graduate study opportunities for URM STEM students:&nbsp;</p> <p>Transition to Phase 2 focused on exposing 95% of URM STEM interested students to information about graduate school preparation.&nbsp; According to the 2019 student survey, 68% reported receiving information about graduate studies in STEM. This is 27% short of the Phase 2 goal, but a 4-percentage point increase from Year 2.</p> <p>This goal&nbsp;included partnering with other campus programs&nbsp;that&nbsp;focused on graduate school preparation, encouraging students to conduct and present their undergraduate research at&#8239;PNW LSAMP Conferences,&#8239;attending workshops and seminars for sophomores and juniors, and fostering student connections with faculty.</p> <p>Despite these activities, limited exposure to graduate studies, and role models may be factors that influenced this decrease.&nbsp; Increased&#8239;visibility of URM graduate students among LSAMP undergrads&#8239;will be important in Phase 3 to help URMs in STEM&#8239;understand what it means to be a graduate student and establish graduate studies as a possibility for themselves.&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The number of LSAMP students participating in research, which is essential to successful pursuit of graduate studies increased by 91% between Year 1 and Year 5 of Phase 2&nbsp;(Figure 5).&nbsp;&nbsp;PNW LSAMP Alliance&#8239;was&#8239;awarded&#8239;the&#8239;2019&#8239;Bridge to Doctorate&#8239;with Boise State University as the host institution.&#8239; The receipt of this grant will increase the Alliance&rsquo;s focus on graduate studies.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div> </div><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/19/2019<br>      Modified by: Ana Mari&nbsp;Cauce</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1410465/1410465_10337310_1576783521661_Figure1_GrowthinURMSTEMBachelorsDegrees--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1410465/1410465_10337310_1576783521661_Figure1_GrowthinURMSTEMBachelorsDegrees--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1410465/1410465_10337310_1576783521661_Figure1_GrowthinURMSTEMBachelorsDegrees--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The number of STEM degrees granted to URM students reached 1,133.

The most impactful activities included summer bridge programs, the PNW LSAMP Regional Conference, research, advising, and access to the LSAMP Center.    While degrees&#8239;granted to STEM students increased overall over the past 10 years, STEM degrees granted to URM students increased more rapidly than STEM degrees granted to non-URM students.&#8239; From 2010 to 2019, degrees granted to non-URM STEM students increased by 69%, whereas degrees granted to URM STEM students increased by 244% over that same time.&#8239;&#8239;Over the past 10 years, the Alliance also saw an&#8239;increase in URM STEM enrollment by 177% (Figure 2).  As with degrees, URM STEM enrollments outpaced growth in non-STEM enrollment.  Goal&#8239;2) Enhancing community college transfer:    The goal to increase the number of bachelor's degrees granted in STEM to URM transfer students from community colleges, from 35% to 40%, and double the number of degrees granted to URM STEM transfer students in Phase 2 was challenging. The&#8239;Alliance placed greater focus on transfer students by adding eight 2-year colleges across the tri-states. As shown in Figure 3, the Alliance did not reach the goal of 40% degrees to transfer students by Year 5, but did increase the number of bachelor’s degrees granted to transfer students by 29%. In 2017-18, 14% of the degrees granted to URM STEM students were to transfer students from PNW LSAMP community colleges (Figure 4).&#8239;&#8239;While efforts to accomplish&#8239;goal 2&#8239;fell short, there was a slight increase in students graduating in STEM who transferred from PNW LSAMP community colleges.&#8239; This percentage is expected to grow as LSAMP presence on community college campuses becomes stronger, and as LSAMP Scholars successfully transfer and graduate from PNW LSAMP universities.    Staffing transitions and communication barriers at OSU, UW and WSU were challenging. Transfer programming was strongest at PSU and BSU, where dedicated full-time community college liaisons strengthened connections between universities and community college partners.&#8239;&#8239;Partner sites with LSAMP or MESA programs provided students with a broad range of activities, services, and programs&#8239;(e.g., skill-building workshops, research,&#8239;travel to conferences&#8239;and access to LSAMP staff to assist with academic and personal concerns).   Goal 3) Increasing graduate study opportunities for URM STEM students:   Transition to Phase 2 focused on exposing 95% of URM STEM interested students to information about graduate school preparation.  According to the 2019 student survey, 68% reported receiving information about graduate studies in STEM. This is 27% short of the Phase 2 goal, but a 4-percentage point increase from Year 2.  This goal included partnering with other campus programs that focused on graduate school preparation, encouraging students to conduct and present their undergraduate research at&#8239;PNW LSAMP Conferences,&#8239;attending workshops and seminars for sophomores and juniors, and fostering student connections with faculty.  Despite these activities, limited exposure to graduate studies, and role models may be factors that influenced this decrease.  Increased&#8239;visibility of URM graduate students among LSAMP undergrads&#8239;will be important in Phase 3 to help URMs in STEM&#8239;understand what it means to be a graduate student and establish graduate studies as a possibility for themselves.&#8239;&#8239;&#8239;    The number of LSAMP students participating in research, which is essential to successful pursuit of graduate studies increased by 91% between Year 1 and Year 5 of Phase 2 (Figure 5).  PNW LSAMP Alliance&#8239;was&#8239;awarded&#8239;the&#8239;2019&#8239;Bridge to Doctorate&#8239;with Boise State University as the host institution.&#8239; The receipt of this grant will increase the Alliance’s focus on graduate studies.
