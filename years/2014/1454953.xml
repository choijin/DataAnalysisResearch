<AbstractNarration>The inaugural ACM HotWireless 2014 workshop aims to become a premier venue for publishing early-stage work on disruptive wireless technologies and systems that can enable orders of magnitude improvements in wireless performance and novel wireless applications.  The workshop features a high-quality technical program, with a combination of invited and peer-reviewed papers. It has a single-track session, which offers significant opportunities for individual and small groups that foster technical and social interactions among a diverse set of participants. Being held in conjunction with ACM MobiCom, which is the premier international conference in the area of mobile computing research, also helps boost the networking opportunities for the participants of this workshop. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will help increase the representation and participation of United States-based students at the conference by providing 5 travel grants. By creating new opportunities for graduate students, especially those from under-represented groups, to attend a high-quality workshop, this award will benefit the students by giving them an opportunity to interact with world-class researchers, inspire them to try new research directions, provide them new mentoring opportunities, and offer them the chance to seek out internships and post-doctoral positions which will help them advance in their research careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This project provided funds for three US graduate students to attend ACM HotWireless 2016, and give invited talks at the workshop. This was part of the 3rd ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Wireless, and focused on disruptive wireless technologies and systems that can enable orders of magnitude improvements in performance and novel wireless applications. The workshop was created with the vision of providing a launching pad for bold and visionary ideas, and bring together experts in hardware, physical layer, networks, and systems to address core technical challenges in these emerging wireless technologies. In particular, HotWireless provides a venue for debating future research agendas, technology trends, and application domains of wireless technology, and for presenting innovative and/or risky ideas that have potential for significant impact. To achieve this, we invited several speakers who could discuss cutting-edge topics in wireless that were not covered by the accepted papers.   The three invited speakers gave invited talks on exciting topics such as ultrawideband radio-based localization (Ultra-Wideband and Indoor Localization), LTE Wireless (CAP on Mobility Control for 4G LTE Networks), and Android permissions (No Time At All: Opportunity Cost of Android Permissions). The talks generated lively discussions and benefited the speakers as well as the audience.       Last Modified: 04/03/2017       Submitted by: Deepak K Ganesan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
