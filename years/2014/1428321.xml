<AbstractNarration>George Washington University will bring together experts from the computer science education, cybersecurity research, and education and assessment communities to identify novel, compelling, and mutually beneficial approaches to advancing cybersecurity education. The one-and-one-half-day workshop will be held February 24-25, 2014 in Arlington, VA at the George Washington University Arlington Education Center. A workshop report will synthesize the workshop discussion and outline a set of novel, compelling, and mutually beneficial research ideas for advancing cybersecurity education in the short and long terms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Cybersecurity Education Workshop was held February 24-25, 2014 at The George Washington University. The purpose of the workshop was to convene a diverse set of experts representing the computer science education, cybersecurity research, education and assessment, and industry communities in order to identify novel, compelling, and mutually beneficial approaches to advancing cybersecurity education. Workshop recommendations will help guide the evolution of cybersecurity academic programs across the broadest range of institutions.  Achieving the ideal state of undergraduate and graduate cybersecurity education requires a multi?faceted approach that includes:  Building security into the curriculum of computer science programs Taking an interdisciplinary approach program development Implementing open-ended research projects that require critical thinking, theory use, grounding with practical problems, hands?on experiences, adaptability, teamwork, and oral and written communication skills. Understanding labor market demands to support student choices and institutional decisions about courses, faculty and programs.   Six major research themes emerged from the workshop. These themes should be considered within the context of a multi?disciplinary cybersecurity education environment. The themes and their associated recommendations are:     (1) Concepts and Conceptual Understanding  Recommendation: NSF should invest in research and curriculum development to close the gap between the definition and application of core concepts within and across disciplines by supporting initiatives that 1) define the core concepts that cybersecurity graduates at all levels (entry-level to leadership) should possess; 2) build consensus around the cybersecurity knowledge that should be integrated into the broad range of disciplines that contribute to cybersecurity education; 3) examine how well the core concepts translate across disciplinary boundaries and in inter?disciplinary contexts; 4) develop key learning outcomes and measurement instruments to assess student knowledge of those concepts; and 5) encourage cybersecurity educators to collaborate with educational researchers to enable systematic investigations of educational innovation.     (2) Educational Practice and Instructional Strategies  Recommendations: NSF should invest in &ndash;  Research projects that explore methods for balancing breadth and depth in cybersecurity education across interdisciplinary environments and for supporting the continuous evolution of curricular content. Specifically, NSF should invest in research that develops methods to quickly take new knowledge from research and incorporate it into the classroom. The ability to remove outdated content is as important as the ability to add new content. As the research communityÆs understanding of topics improves, there should be a method to quickly remove obsolete content from courses. NSF should encourage the development of resources (e.g. eTextbooks, shared online resources) that support the rapidly evolving field of knowledge.   Research that examines novel approaches to faculty development in a rapidly evolving field. The research should examine faculty development strategies for both research?oriented and teaching?oriented faculty members across the spectrum of educational institutions (2-year, 4-year, undergraduate, and graduate) and should specifically address the relative impact of summer workshops, ongoing communities of practice, faculty externships in industry, social media, and mentoring. Summer workshops should focus on both cybersecurity content and educational research (and be co-led by educational research experts).     Projects that foster relationship building among faculty and computer security practitioners. These projects, such as faculty shadowing programs where faculty members leave campus and work along side practitioners, can catalyze cross?disciplinary interactions that support the development of strong...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
