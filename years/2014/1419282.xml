<AbstractNarration>Research: Recent advances in stable isotope-resolved metabolomics (SIRM) are enabling orders-of-magnitude increase in the number of observable metabolic traits (a metabolic phenotype) for a given organism or community of organisms.  Analytical experiments that take only a few minutes to perform can detect stable isotope-labeled variants of thousands of metabolites.  Thus, unique metabolic phenotypes may be observable for almost all significant biological states, biological processes, and perturbations.  Currently, the major bottleneck is the lack of data analysis that can properly organize and interpret this mountain of phenotypic data as insightful biochemical and biological information.  The research goals are to develop systems-level biochemical tools as part of an integrated data analysis pipeline that will alleviate this limitation, enabling a broad application of SIRM from the discovery of specific metabolic phenotypes representing biological states of interest to a mechanism-based understanding of a wide range of biological processes with particular metabolic phenotypes.  The major specific intellectual merits are developing:&lt;br/&gt;- Novel methods for detection and identification of metabolites that utilize the combined advantages from stable isotope labeling, chemoselective probes, ultra-high resolution/accurate MS, and NMR.  Since unidentified metabolites make up the majority of detected features in current metabolomics datasets, identification of metabolites is a key focus. &lt;br/&gt;- Key error analyses that allow: i) rigorous quantitative evaluation of detected isotopologue intensities and their errors; ii) evaluation of error propagation through subsequent analyses; and iii) development of quality control measures derived from the detected errors. &lt;br/&gt;- New algorithms for isotopic non-steady state conditions of SIRM experiments, especially deconvolution methods that will aid relative flux interpretation and metabolic flux analysis.  &lt;br/&gt;- New methods that integrate and cross-validate metabolomics with genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics via mutually-identified metabolic, gene expression, and signaling pathways.&lt;br/&gt;Education: Simultaneous trends of declining student effort and declining graduation rates in STEM disciplines do not bode well for the successful education of the next generation of scientists. A more expedient approach to improving student outcomes may be to increase the effectiveness of students? effort.  Using a design-based research approach, this project integrates multiple advanced teaching-learning methods into content-rich college science courses.  Statistical analysis of these methods shows large effect sizes for the use of scaffolded explicit revision to improve the effectiveness of student effort and indicates a path for significant refinement of these methods, which will be pursued and implemented. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will create computational tools that analyze and derive unique mechanistic information from large datasets available from cutting-edge metabolomics technologies which track atomic level changes in the production and utilization of thousands of molecules (metabolites) inside the cells of organisms.  These novel computational tools will be tested and refined in the Center for Regulatory and Environmental Analytical Metabolomics (CREAM), which provides state-of-the-art analytical services and expertise for national and international stable isotope-resolved metabolomics (SIRM) research efforts.  Once these computational tools reach production-quality, they will be disseminated to the broader scientific community for a wide variety of scientific applications involving biological processes with changes in cellular metabolism.  Also, these methods will integrate metabolomics datasets with genomics and other omics-level datasets, allowing new systems-level metabolic insights into a wide range of biological processes.  During the execution of this proposed research, significant numbers of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students from a wide variety of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, &amp; Math) disciplines will be exposed to and trained with multidisciplinary bioinformatics research projects using interdisciplinary approaches to research.  In addition, the principal investigator has developed an integrated set of advanced teaching-learning methods amenable to content-rich college science courses that have statistically significant impacts on student effort and outcomes.  These advanced teaching-learning methods focus students' efforts at correcting and learning from prior mistakes on assignments, quizzes, and exam questions via a series of explicit revision steps that span different levels of learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 21st century has brought a wealth of new data of many different types for studying life, especially the composition of life at the level of different organs and tissues, individual cells, individual biomolecules, and even the atoms that comprise these biomolecules.  Central to this study of life is understanding metabolism or the chemical processes that produce, convert, and consume the biomolecules that comprise life.  The research supported by this grant has developed new methods and computer software to analyze many types of biological data being generated, especially from high-throughput "omics" instruments.  Omics technologies systematically characterize certain molecular features of a living system.  For instance, genomics is a systematic characterization of the genetic material in a sample derived from a cell, tissue, or even a collection of organisms.  This supported research has focused on developing methods for analyzing metabolomics datasets, which is the systematic detection, quantification, classification, and identification of small biomolecules present in living systems that can include cells, tissues from organisms, or even environmental samples produced by organisms.  We have developed many new methods and associated software packages:  for the analysis of metabolomics datasets generated from high-end Fourier-transform mass spectrometers and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers; for the integration of multi-omics datasets, especially metabolomics with other omics datasets; and for the integration of data with knowledge, especially omics-level datasets with organized scientific knowledge in public knowledgebases.   Here are two examples of the types of analyses enabled by our new software.  Figure 1 represents different category of lipids with different abundances in cancer vs non-cancer tissues.  These lipids were assigned from a metabolomics dataset using a new method that derives the chemical formula just from the data itself, without having to know what the molecule is.  Therefore, we can analyze these datasets without a database of known or theoretical lipids.  This allows us to discover new molecules present in a sample, with no prior knowledge about the existence of the molecule.   Figure 2 shows the analysis of gene expression (transcriptomics) in horse connective tissue development and the integration of this data with known knowledge from the Gene Ontology and the STRING molecular interactions database.  Using software developed from this research, the data itself identifies the concept "cartilage development" and the interactions between the genes involved in "cartilage development". The more information we can derive directly from the data itself, the less biased our interpretations will be.  During the course of the supported research, we have trained over 50 students/trainees from the high school to postdoctoral level in research activities.  We have also developed multiple teaching-learning instruments, all of which have been tested within a classroom environment.  In particular, we have developed the use of explicit revision within the context of content-rich science courses.   Explicit revision, defined as the requirement to amend or alter performance after assessment for the purpose of improvement, focuses on a cycle of feedback provided to learners and subsequently interpreted and applied during revision.  While explicit revision falls under the broader definition of formative assessment, a key difference is that students are "required" to interpret and use the feedback, whereas formative assessment does not require the student to use the feedback.  We tested the use of different forms of explicit revision within college biochemistry courses at two different universities and statistically evaluated their effectiveness to improve student learning outcomes.   We have disseminated this research via 100 poster and 20 oral presentations at scientific conferences, the publication of 21 peer-reviewed articles, 2 book chapters, 4 preprints, 1 journal cover,  and multiple software packages, many of which are available on open source code repositories on GitHub (https://github.com/MoseleyBioinformaticsLab).  This includes presentation of effective teaching-learning methods at teaching-focused conferences.  In addition, a patent application was submitted to the United States Patent Office for new methods for the identification of metabolites (US20180011990A1).  Also, we have roughly 10 more manuscripts in preparation for publication at the time this outcomes report was submitted.  However, the full impact of this research will come from the use of the new data analysis methods and software by the scientific community on a wide range of future research projects.  Also, many students developed multidisciplinary research skills while working on the supported research projects, providing a strong start to their scientific research careers that includes authorship on publications.  It cannot be overstated the importance of this early exposure and development of strong multidisciplinary skills sets that span biochemical, mathematical, and computation disciplines, especially for the pursuit of an interdisciplinary research career.
