<AbstractNarration>Motion planning is a fundamental capability needed for robots to operate autonomously. This project advances the understanding of state-of-the-art methods for robot motion planning and uses results from analysis to develop increasingly more capable and practical solutions, which are relevant to important applications such as driverless cars and automated manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern sampling-based algorithms for robot motion planning asymptotically converge to optimal trajectories. In practice, however, their execution is stopped after a finite amount of computation. This project reasons about the properties of these popular methods after finite computation time instead of an asymptotic analysis.  Based on this progress, methods are developed with improved practical computational efficiency and formal probabilistic near-optimality guarantees. These techniques address a wide set of planning challenges, including problems that involve significant dynamics. This is an especially important direction, for which it is harder to apply existing solutions with near-optimality guarantees. If successful, this work will result in a paradigm shift in algorithmic motion planning and its application domains, since it provides more efficient methods with stronger formal guarantees.  This project includes outreach and educational activities to disseminate research results and integrate them into curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aimed to advance the understanding of state-of-the-artmethods for robot motion planning by both analyzing their formal properties as well as developing increasingly more capable and practical solutions, which are relevant to important applications.  In particular, the following goals were successfully pursued:  1. Practical Formal Guarantees for Efficient Motion Planning  The project resulted in a publication on the finite-time properties of the popular Probabilistic Roadmap Method (PRM) for robot motionplanning. The corresponding analysis is able to describe the error after finite computation path between the path found by the PRM and the optimum path in the same homotopic class. This is a formal guarantee that is more useful to practitioners relative to the typical asymptotic analysis.  Similarly, a conference paper was produced - with an undergraduate student as a first author - on the average case of path degradation that arises when one plans over sparse graphical representations. The average degradation is significantly smaller than the worst-case performance. There has been limited analysis of the average case in the past.  This project also considered in a conference paper and subsequent journal publication the case that there is no solution to a path planning problem and one needs to consider minimum-constraint removal paths. The focus has been on developing computationally efficient approximate solutions to this challenge.  The PI's research group further extended the analysis of sampling-based algorithms for systems with significant dynamics, which has led into a journal publication at the Intern. Journal of Robotics Research. The corresponding article describes a state-of-the-art algorithm, which achieves asymptotic optimality for the most general set of conditions. The resulting kinodynamic planner  was extended to an inform variant so that it can be effectively used to control models of field robots that exhibit significant dynamics. Furthermore, this line of work was also applied in the context of planning in belief spaces, which exhibits similar properties with planning for systems with significant dynamics (i.e.., lack of a steering function). It was shown that given an appropriate distance function, sampling-based algorithms can be effectively used for exploring belief spaces andreturning robust trajectories.  2. Apply motion planning solvers to interesting robotics challenges  The project involved the application of sampling-based motion planners in the context of higher-level robot manipulation tasks, such as object rearrangement and multi-arm manipulation.  A sequence of results and publications were achieved in the context of object rearrangement using sampling-based motion planners. New algorithms were proposed with desirable properties in terms of completeness and optimality as well as improved computational performance. This line of work resulted in two nominations for Best Student Paper award at the Robotics: Science and Systems conference (2015 and 2017 editions).  Sampling-based algorithms were also evaluated in the context of multi-arm manipulation, where it was shown that it is possible to both represent and efficiently search a graphical representation that explicitly searches the set of modes of the problem. A novel asymptotically optimal solution for multi-arm motion planning was proposed in collaboration with Dan Halperin's research group at Tel Aviv University, which was awarded the Best Paper Award at the 1st edition of the IEEE conference on Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) that took place on the University of Southern California campus in 2017.
