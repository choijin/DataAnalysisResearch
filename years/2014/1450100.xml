<AbstractNarration>This one-year project is to enable the participation of students and junior researchers from the USA at the Seventh Workshop on Solar Information Processing.  The conference will be held on August 18-21, 2014, in La Roche-en- Ardenne, Belgium. This conference is aimed at cultivating a forum, where experts from the disciplines of space physics and information science (scientific computing, statistics, signal processing, and visualization) gather to identify fundamental open questions in solar-terrestrial physics that are particularly suited to be addressed through novel cyber-enabled approaches to scientific exploration.  The conference will address issues such as: (i) coronal heating and the statistical inference on power law indices; (ii) solar dynamo and the extraction of signatures of physical processes from data; and, (iii) space weather forecasting and the necessary combination of physics-based simulations and multi-modal observations to achieve meaningful prediction.  It will also tackle the data analysis challenges brought by the upcoming Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus missions.  Coordinated exploitation of these heterogeneous datasets requires expertise at the confluence of space physics, computational imaging, time series analysis, and information processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most important aspects of the conference is to ensure a significant student participation worldwide.  As a way to foster communication between solar physics and information processing communities and in order to provide adequate training in both fields, invited speakers from both the solar physics and information processing fields will jointly address particular topics of mutual scientific interest.  A special issue in a refereed journal is also planned to ensure broad dissemination of the conference results.  This project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award provided travel support (airfare, ground transportation, housing, and registration) for U.S. students and early career scientists to attend the Seventh Solar Information Processing Workshop in Belgium.  The overarching goal of this workshop was to foster interdisciplinary communication between space physics and information processing communities in order to stress the importance of rigorous inference methods to enable quantitative analysis.  More specifically, the objectives of the conference were to provide the solar and heliospheric community with the following:   - Discussion on the solar wind characteristics including methodological issues and data analysis techniques of the solar wind turbulence properties;   - An understanding of the new data analysis challenges brought by the upcoming Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe missions;   - A discussion on current methods for space weather prediction and their possible improvements using dedicated machine learning algorithms for example;   - A review on the most recent methods in tracking of small scale elements, and a discussion on which signatures of solar dynamo effects can be retrieved from a detailed tracking of surface magnetic features;  - An introduction to Bayesian inference in the context of power law model estimation.     In addition, it provided travel support for a U.S. student to attend the International Conference on Acoustics Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP) where he presented a paper on a novel approach to geospace imaging.  The student's participation at this conference enabled him to foster interdisciplinary communication between space physics and information processing communities in order to stress the importance of rigorous inference methods to enable quantitative analysis of space science data.
