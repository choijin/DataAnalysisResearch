<AbstractNarration>Objective&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to significantly advance the field of MEMS filters by putting forward innovative solutions that tackle the issues hindering widespread deployment of MEMS filters such as high insertion loss, low power handling, and limited bandwidth. Our approach is to exploit high-coupling-factor thin-film piezoelectric materials in combination with novel impedance matching techniques to improve the performance of acoustically-coupled monolithic filters, which are fabricated on ultra-nanocrystalline diamond (UNCD) substrates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This research is expected to overcome current limitations of MEMS filters and establish lateral-mode MEMS filters as a viable candidate for emerging multi-band transceivers.  Specifically, the significance of the proposed activities is as follows: &lt;br/&gt; Finite element models are developed that can fully capture the frequency response of a piezoelectric MEMS filter. &lt;br/&gt; UNCD is utilized to scale up the frequency and improve the power handling of MEMS filters. &lt;br/&gt; Impedance matching networks are integrated with thin-film piezoelectric-on-UNCD filters.&lt;br/&gt; Novel processes for direct deposition of high-coupling-factor piezoelectric films on UNCD are developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The successful demonstration of low-loss thin-film piezoelectric-on-UNCD filters proposed in this work will have a significant impact on how future RF transceiver architectures will be designed. This proposal will provide opportunities for OSU graduate and undergraduate students (with priority given to students from under-represented groups) to work with industrial scientists and gain experience in an industrial setting at Advanced Diamond Technologies Inc. Results from the project will be disseminated through presentation in prestigious conferences and publication in high-impact journals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the life of this project several important technical goals of the proposal were accomplished while a few more unforeseen observations turned out to be worthy of reporting to our community as listed below:  1-      Direct integration of functional and high-quality sputtered piezoelectric films (i.e. aluminum nitride) on top of polished ultra-nano-crystalline diamond (UNCD)films were accomplished for the first time.   2-      Using the aforementioned structure (i.e. piezoelectric-on-UNCD), high frequency (~900MHz) bulk-lateral micro-machined resonators and filters were demonstrated with record low motional impedance.  3-      For the first time our group demonstrated 50-Ohm terminated ~900MHz bulk-lateral filters with insertion loss values acceptable to industry.     4-      Nonlinearity in silicon and UNCD based resonators were studied and UNCD films were shown to exhibit much larger energy densities at the catastrophic failure point compared to single crystalline silicon.    5-      Dependency of nonlinearity in silicon resonators on the silicon crystalline plane was demonstrated for the first time.  6-      Effect of silicon crystalline plane on acceleration sensitivity of silicon-resonator-based oscillators were also demonstrated for the first time.    7-      The concept of passive wireless resonant sensing was explored and was proven to be worthy of further investigation.   These outcomes have been published in one PhD thesis, more than 6 IEEE sponsored conference papers, and 3 journal papers (one of the journal papers supported by this project is being prepared and will be ready for submission in a month).  Using the resources available through this project one female student was supported through graduation with her PhD degree and a second female PhD student was trained to continue her PhD studies, who will be graduating in 2018. There were also 4 minority undergraduate students who were trained at different time spans during the project on conducting research in the field of acoustic devices. Morover, two summer workshops were held for future undergraduate students interested in STEM fields.                 Last Modified: 09/16/2017       Submitted by: Reza Abdolvand]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
