<AbstractNarration>Climate change will profoundly influence the distribution and abundance of species across the planet. Cold-adapted species may be especially prone to retract their range at the southern edge of their distribution as the climate warms, but our understanding of possible range shifts for this group is incomplete. Within North America, addressing these effects on these southern populations is additionally complicated by the fact that southern range limits for many cold-adapted species fall along the U.S.-Canada border. A joint U.S.-Canada research collaboration that addresses the influence of climate change on southern populations of Canada lynx will develop from this project. This project will have theoretical significance in terms of increasing our knowledge regarding what limits the geographic range of species, as well as applied conservation relevance, by providing improved predictions of response to climate change for a threatened predator. Moreover, this transboundary collaboration will increase the scope and importance of subsequent research on Canada lynx, as well as provide a model for cross-border research that can be applied to other species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Predicting the consequences of a changing climate for the distribution and abundance of species remains a key challenge in ecology. Simple models that predict how the range of a species will shift in the future based on changing climatic conditions are commonly applied, but such models are often inaccurate because they lack ecological realism. The challenge of predicting species response to climate change is particularly difficult at the southern range limits of species, where climate change impacts are poorly understood and complex. The ultimate goal of this project will be to examine the influence of climate, biotic interactions (competition and predation), and population spatial structure on southern range limits of Canada lynx.  This international collaboration will build a highly coordinated team of experts, with complementary expertise and datasets, which will allow for meaningful transboundary research and conservation. As a result, the products that emerge from the project will provide guidelines for a research strategy that will furnish new insights into the biology of southern lynx populations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The US-Canada planning meeting that was supported by NSF has resulted in substantial long-term, international collaborations between academic and land management agencies in the US and Canada. These collaborations include joint development of a manuscript related to transboundary conservation, and on-going field work that crosses international boundaries and engagement with the public and underrepresented communities on both sides of the border. The international team jointly developed a manuscript that seeks to detail the extent and scale of a major transboundary problem in species conservation &ndash; namely, that species are often protected differently in adjacent countries, and such differential protection may lead to problems in conservation of populations that fall along international boundaries. This is the first publication of its kind regarding differential protection of species across international borders, and will set the stage for other joint publications by our transboundary group. The proof-of-concept field work that was initiated as part of our NSF funding has been leveraged to develop a large collaborative project along the Washington/British Columbia border. This project combines camera-trapping and GPS collaring to understanding the distribution, movement ecology, interspecies interactions, and management of southern lynx populations. This project will address fundamental questions regarding what determines the southern limits of cold-adapted species, and how those limits may be modified by climate vs. interspecies interaction. Because this work involves land management agencies and NGOs as part of the collaborative team, the project will also help to inform harvest and management guidelines for this transboundary population of lynx, and will identify corridors of lynx movement between the threatened US lynx populations and healthier populations in Canada. Improved management of lynx is particularly important because lynx are a threatened species in the United States, and likely to be severely impacted by climate change due to their reliance on snowy conditions for persistence. Finally, our on-going field work has and will continue to involve citizen scientists in data collection to improve public knowledge of the scientific process, and engagement with First Nations communities and fur trappers to encourage participation of under-represented groups in scientific research and conservation. &nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/12/2016<br>      Modified by: Daniel&nbsp;Thornton</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
