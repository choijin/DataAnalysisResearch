<AbstractNarration>Orthosis devices (to correct disorders of limbs or spine) currently being provided to patients are very unappealing.  The devices are heavy, large mechanisms that are excessively restrictive of motion, painful, dangerous, and slow to provide results. This I-Corps team has developed fiber-reinforced elasto-fluidics orthosis devices that are lightweight, low cost, soft, and safe for human interaction. The fiber-reinforced elasto-fluidic systems are soft mechanical devices that act much like the arm of an octopus. The device can be made small enough to maintain a low profile while generating sufficient corrective force. The proposed technology also enables the remaining degrees of freedom of the body to be unrestricted. This technology provides the opportunity to develop a wide range of applications that provide solutions to existing problems, novel applications, and enhancements to existing designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the development of fiber-reinforced elasto-fluidic technology for applications and markets that it can benefit. The fiber-reinforced elasto-fluidic systems combine the high strain energy utilization and flexibility of fibers, the versatility and compressive load abilities of fluids, and the continuum nature of soft materials, exploiting the best features of each. These properties and others combine to make elasto-fluidic systems without contact friction and losses, free of joint backlash, scalable in size, safe for human interaction, resilient to impact, adaptable to external forces and constraints, low cost, and high in power density. These systems have a wide range of forces and motions, are able to be combined in parallel, form complex shapes, and eliminate the need for subsequent mechanisms for geometric or mechanical advantage. The elasto-fluidic technology developed at the University of Michigan converts fluid pressure into a wide range of forces and three-dimensional kinematic motions well beyond the scope of existing pneumatic muscles.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project investigated the commercial potential of Fiber-reinforced Elasto-fluidic Systems in the area of orthotics. This technology uses pressurized fluid such as air to create a soft, conformable, lightweight, human-safe, structure that can be used as an improved orthosis for conditions such as arm rotation contractures. The fiber-reinforced structure is able to direct the forces and motions in a wide array of patterns, thus allowing an orthosis that is easily tuned to the patients&rsquo; unique requirements. The devices are lower cost, lighter weight, and lower profile than the existing orthoses. This project determined that while the technology could provide a superior orthosis, there is not enough commercial potential to transition this technology to a viable business. This was found by interviewing over 100 experts in the orthotics industry. The number of patients using orthoses on arm rotation contractures is small, thus developing a product for this niche market would not cover the costs of the product development and customer acquisition costs.
