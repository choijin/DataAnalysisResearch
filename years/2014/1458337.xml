<AbstractNarration>Santiago Canyon College (SCC) is a community college in Southern California, with 8,978 students, of whom 44% are Hispanic, 56% are low-income, 68% place below college-level math, and 75% are first-generation college students. The Santiago Canyon College STEM Scholars Academy will enable low-income STEM majors with the greatest need and greatest potential (based on grade point average and faculty recommendation) to enter or maintain full-time enrollment, increase use of academic and support services, participate in educational and internship opportunities. Recognizing its role to address the workforce needs of STEM industries in the region and to provide access to higher education and high-wage employment for disadvantaged and underrepresented students, SCC has instituted a STEM initiative to increase the college's capacity to strengthen STEM pathways through improved outreach and college preparation, advisement, enhanced instructional programs, support services, and transfer partnerships. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this S-STEM project, SCC will award 17-28 scholarships each year to low-income STEM majors and connect recipients to the STEM support services and programs on campus to achieve the following objectives: (1) increase the number of low-income STEM majors enrolled full-time; (2) increase the number of underrepresented minority STEM majors enrolled full-time; (3) reduce work hours and/or increase participation in STEM services and resources; (4) increase the number of students who graduate or transfer with a minimum 3.0 grade point average; and (5) increase the participation of underrepresented STEM majors in internships. Because many low-income and minority college students start their higher education pathways at a community college, the results of this project are pertinent to a wide audience of community colleges serving as pathways to STEM degrees and employment. Project findings regarding the impact of financial support integrated with extensive support services to increase completion of STEM degrees, a model to help decision makers identify students with the greatest potential to benefit from scholarship and support services, and transfer and entrance into employment (especially among low-income and underrepresented students) will be used to inform community college strategic planning and guide program development. Targeted dissemination will be used to engage STEM faculty and deans, and financial aid and foundation officers to share best practices with those most likely to adopt or adapt effective practices of the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcome Report(NSF Grant #1458337)     What are some of the common factors that are facing students majoring in STEM? The student majoring in STEM needs money, time, support, &amp; drive.     At Santiago Canyon Community College(SCC), there is a number of support services for the STEM major free of charge. Some of the service, not inclusive, are the STAR Center, Supplementary Instruction, STEM Counseling, STEM Club, STEM Academy, and Project Raise.     Many students take advantage of these wonderful opportunities.      But there was a specific population of students who had financial need and students of minority classification along with a financial need that were not participating.      STEM majors were working on average 21.13 hours per week. A number of these students were also the first in their families to attend college. These students were not accustomed to the culture and the commitment required to be successful in STEM.      There is a unique time demand on a STEM major because of the corresponding lab section they are required to enroll in. For example, a typical student taking a chemistry course will spend 12 hours in class per week compared to a non-lab course would only meet for three hours each week. In addition to the extra time requirement, the academic demands of taking a lab is similar to taking a second class.     Students did not have the time &amp; energy to partake in the services created for STEM majors.     The S-STEM Scholarship funded by a grant(#1458337) by the National Science Foundation(NSF) in 2015 made it possible to reduce the gap for those students.     The objectives of the program are:  Increase the number of low-incomeSTEM majors enrolled full-time Increase the percentage of minority STEM majors enrolled full-time Reduced work hours and/or increase participation in STEM services and resources Increase participation of underrepresented STEM majors in internships Increase the number of recipients who graduate or transfer with at least 3.00 GPA      As a result of the S-STEM program, each recipient is awarded a specific amount of money based on their unique unmet need as determined by the Financial Aid Office. The scholarship recipient was able to cut back or in many cases eliminate the need to work. The recipient has more time to focus on learning and can participate in the services that are available to STEM majors at SCC. The average hours that recipients are working has dropped to 8.31 hours/week.With the reduction in hours of work, the recipient was able to dedicate more of their day towards their STEM education.      As a motivational tool, each recipient is challenged the task of maintaining a minimum GPA to make them competitive in transferring into a four year college. Each recipient is assigned a mentor(a STEM instructor or counselor). The mentoring provided the student feedback, guidance, and advocacy as they progressed though their tailored education plan created by the student and STEM counseling. This help provide the students more drive towards their goal of getting an education in the STEM field.     The program was annually evaluated by an independent third party, The Mark(formerly SmartStart). The annual reports show that the program met all its objectives since the inception.
