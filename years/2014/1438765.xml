<AbstractNarration>Project Title: GOALI: Sinter-Resistant, Self-Regenerating Platinum Group Metal Catalysts for Automotive Exhaust Treatment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advanced combustion engines being developed for meeting our transportation needs achieve improved fuel efficiency by lowering exhaust temperatures.  This puts demands on the technology for catalytic converters, since these catalysts must become active at lower temperatures.  The proposed research addresses the design of these catalysts, leading to improvements in air quality and to societal needs for energy.  Automotive exhaust catalysts lose activity during use due to precious metal sintering. This loss of performance requires a new exhaust catalyst, thereby putting pressure on prices for precious metals such as Pt and Pd.  By developing ways to slow the growth of metal particle size, demand for these precious metals is reduced, and they can be used more efficiently. This GOALI award recognizes the strategic importance of this research to the U.S., and is in support of an industry-university collaboration between Abhaya Datye of the University of New Mexico and Chang Kim and Gongshin Qi of General Motors Global R&amp;D.  The university participants will use model catalysts that allow characterization with advanced microscopy techniques which cannot be applied to actual commercial automotive catalysts. The results will be shared with the scientists at GM, and the team will attempt  to implement the findings in new technologies for exhaust emissions control. An added educational feature is that students will spend time working in the industry partner laboratories as part of this collaborative research program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research challenge being addressed here impacts the entire class of precious metal heterogeneous catalysts used for meeting the needs for energy, materials and fuels.  Three way catalysts in automotive exhaust (especially those in the close coupled position) are subjected to elevated temperatures that lead to growth of nanoparticle size and loss of activity.  The research will address Ostwald ripening of nanoparticles, investigating the key steps of atom emission and capture, by using model catalysts.  Industrial supported metal catalysts do not lend themselves to direct measurements of processes such as atom emission or capture, which are critical to understanding catalyst sintering.  This research program uses novel forms of model catalysts that can be heated to temperatures and gas atmospheres encountered in automotive exhaust.  The model catalysts allow obtaining time-lapsed electron micrographic  images of the same region of the sample, so that rates of atom transport can be inferred.  These rates, coupled with a robust physics-based model, will help improve predictions of catalyst sintering.  Methods will be developed to modify the rates of emission and novel approaches developed to capture mobile species.  Concepts developed using model catalysts will be translated to powder catalysts and tested under realistic conditions using the facilities of the industry partner. The close participation of industry and university researchers is critical for validating the concepts and models.  GM has committed significant resources in terms of people time and access to facilities, to enable this research to be successful.  The partnership will help address significant unknowns in the understanding of catalyst sintering, and will lead to advances in the synthesis of novel catalysts with improved reactivity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Advanced combustion engines being developed for meeting our transportation needs achieve higher efficiencies through lowered exhaust temperatures.  This puts demands on the technology for catalytic converters, since these catalysts must become active at lower temperatures.  This research program has addressed the design of exhaust treatment catalysts, which will lead to improvements in air quality and to meeting societal needs for clean energy.  The specific challenge addressed by this research program concerns the operation of automotive exhaust catalysts which lose activity during use, due to catalyst sintering.  Increasing the active metal loading in these catalysts can alleviate the loss of activity, but it puts pressure on prices for precious metals such as Pt and Pd.  If methods can be developed to slow the growth of metal particle size, demand for these precious metals is reduced, and they can be used more efficiently.     This research involved an industry-university collaboration between GM Global R&amp;D and the University of New Mexico.  The university participants learnt about the challenges in implementing new technologies for exhaust emissions control, and to better communicate their results to an industry audience.  Students in this program received industry internships, allowing them an opportunity to spend time working in the industry partner laboratories as part of this collaborative research program.     The specific research challenge being addressed here impacts the entire class of heterogeneous catalysts used for meeting the needs for energy, materials and fuels.  Catalysts subjected to elevated temperatures lose activity through the growth of nanoparticle size.  The mechanism that leads to the growth of nanoparticle size is called Ostwald ripening which involves the emission of mobile species such as metal atoms, and metal oxides.  The studies of atom emission conducted using model catalysts revealed that the emission of atoms during Ostwald Ripening is very rapid, and is dependent on temperature and the gas atmosphere.  The volatile oxide of Pt is responsible for emission of Pt species to the vapor phase and inter particle transport.  To control the rates of catalyst sintering, it is necessary to trap these mobile atoms.  The GOALI project demonstrated that these mobile Pt species can be trapped on oxides such as PdO leading to a self-regenerating catalyst.  This regenerative trapping process explains why Pt-Pd catalysts function better than the Pt only catalysts when operated at high temperatures in oxidizing atmospheres, such as those encountered in diesel exhaust catalysts.  Another significant outcome from this research was the discovery that the vapor phase PtO2 emitted from Pt nanoparticles can be trapped on CeO2 leading to the formation of isolated single atoms of Pt.  These Pt atoms are stable during heat treatment at 800 C in air, a temperature at which Pt sinters rapidly forming large particles.  This is a very important discovery since it suggests a new approach for synthesis of single atom catalysts.  By stabilizing isolated single atoms on the surface of a catalyst support, every atom is accessible to the gas phase, leading to the ultimate atom efficiency.     The fundamental research conducted in this program has helped lay the foundations for industrial development of self-regenerating catalysts.  The results will be useful for developing the next generation of catalysts for low temperature oxidation.  Trapping of mobile species was demonstrated as a means to slow the rates of Ostwald ripening, and could be used in future to develop sinter-resistant heterogeneous catalysts for other classes of reactions.  The project contributed to the education of one PhD student, two Master?s students and two undergraduate students, along with two post-docs and one research professor.  The partnership with General Motors Global R&amp;D provided unique opportunities for students and faculty to contribute to the solution of important challenges in the development of energy-efficient transportation technologies.
