<AbstractNarration>The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) will appoint an ad hoc committee, under the auspices of the Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate (BASC) of the National Research Council (NRC), to provide a scientific assessment of the current state of knowledge in atmospheric chemistry. The charge of this committee is to identify priorities and strategic steps forward for atmospheric chemistry research for the next decade, in the context of the current state of knowledge, ongoing research activities, and resource availability. Atmospheric chemistry research is critical for improving knowledge about the role of the atmosphere in the Earth system through a better understanding of atmospheric influences on the carbon, nitrogen, energy, and water cycles of Earth, and on air quality and climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The appointed ad hoc committee will be responsible for gathering and reviewing relevant literature, providing opportunities for input from a range of relevant stakeholders, and using its expert judgment to synthesize this information into a final consensus report. The committee and its report will be subject to all standard NAS/NRC appointment, operating, and review procedures, and to Section 15 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.) that includes requirements regarding public access and conflicts of interest that are applicable to agreements under which the NAS, using a committee, provides advice or recommendations to a Federal agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this effort include an increased awareness by scientific and policy communities and the public of the importance of atmospheric chemistry in developing an improved understanding of the Earth?s climate, air quality, and biogeochemical cycles. The primary audiences for this project include the National Science Foundation, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Office of Management and Budget, the United States Congress, and other U.S. federal agencies that support atmospheric chemistry research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The composition of Earth?s atmosphere has changed dramatically as a growing global population continues to increase energy use, expand industrial activities, and intensify agricultural activities. Emissions from these and other activities have led to many serious problems, including poor air quality in urban areas ("smog"), acid deposition ("acid rain"), stratospheric ozone depletion (including the Antarctic "ozone hole"), and climate changes resulting from increasing greenhouse gases. The field of atmospheric chemistry came into its own during the 20th century as researchers responded to those problems. Scientists had to determine what was happening in the atmosphere, identify what was driving it, and develop a sufficient understanding to inform policy choices. Many of those research efforts have been great success stories, leading to both significant improvements in environmental conditions and to a rapid maturation of the science of atmospheric chemistry. Nonetheless, significant challenges related to the evolving atmospheric composition persist. Climate change is one of the greatest environmental challenges facing society today. Air pollution remains a major threat to human health, causing one out of eight deaths globally. In turn, global change and air pollution pose a threat to future food production and global food security, among many other impacts.   At the request of the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) conducted a study to identify priorities and strategic steps forward for atmospheric chemistry research for the next decade.
