<AbstractNarration>This investigation concerns the role of common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) "fungus interconnections among plant root systems" in plant competition belowground.  CMNs are formed by generally beneficial, root-inhabiting fungi called "arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi".  Plants feed these fungi some of the sugar they produce by photosynthesis, and in return, the fungi take up and provide the plants with key mineral nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen.  Once connected to a host plant's roots, the fungi forage throughout the soil and may encounter root systems of other plant species with which they additionally associate without preference, creating a network.  The major question this raises is whether all plants connected to the network share mineral nutrients equitably or if mycorrhizal fungi disproportionately donate mineral nutrients to host plant species that provide them the most sugar.  The researchers utilize tallgrass prairie species for their research, Big Bluestem and Canada Wild Rye. Tallgrass prairie is an endangered ecosystem in North America and prairie restorations often involve sowing the study species together.  Understanding how CMNs affect interactions between these plant species might inform restoration management practices such as tillage, which can disrupt CMNs.  Besides its relevance to prairie restoration, this research will engage Miami inner-city middle school students and university undergraduates from underrepresented groups.  &lt;br/&gt;The researchers will investigate competition as mediated by CMNs between a tallgrass prairie dominant grass, Big Bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and a less common species, Canada Wild Rye (Elymus canadensis).  If Big Bluestem is able to obtain mineral nutrients disproportionately and thereby suppress the growth of Canada Wild Rye, then CMNs may contribute to Big Bluestem's dominance, influencing prairie community composition. The researchers will utilize a rotated conetainer method in the greenhouse to isolate and reveal the effects of CMNs&lt;br/&gt;by severing them. The proposed work will determine the effects of CMNs on the relative strengths&lt;br/&gt;of intra- and interspecific competition and consequent size hierarchy development. The student&lt;br/&gt;will investigate if large carbon donation to CMNs elicits high mineral nutrient transfer from&lt;br/&gt;mycorrhizal fungi by using carbon stable isotope ratios to compare carbon supplied by these&lt;br/&gt;C4 and C3 grasses to their leaf mineral nutrient contents in monoculture and mixture. Finally,&lt;br/&gt;if severing CMNs alters the fungus community on root systems, this will be investigated through DNA barcoding.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Below the surface of the soil there exists a network of fungi that interconnect neighboring root systems like miniature highways, called common mycorrhizal networks.  Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, symbiotic fungi that supply up to 90% of a host plant?s phosphorus and nitrogen requirements while receiving carbon from the plant in return, form common mycorrhizal networks.  The majority of plants in the world today associate with mycorrhizal fungi, suggesting that common mycorrhizal networks are ubiquitous.  The power of common mycorrhizal networks to influence ecological interactions lies in their ability to affect competition for mineral nutrients among interconnected plants, thereby affecting growth and community composition.  Which individuals or species benefit from CMNs and why, however, is relatively little understood.  Intellectual Merit  Through the funding provided by the NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant I investigated competition between a dominant prairie grass, Andropogon gerardii (Big Bluestem), and a subdominant, Elymus canadensis (Canadian Wild Rye) via common mycorrhizal networks.  I examined the relationship of these two species with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi through a fertilization experiment, growing them with or without arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.  I examined two characteristics:  dependence or the lowest level of soil fertility a plant can grow without mycorrhizas, and responsiveness or the change in growth when colonized by mycorrhizas.  I found A. gerardii and E. canadensis differed in dependence, but both had a maximum responsiveness at similar soil fertilities to those found in their native ranges.  In a microcosm experiment utilizing a novel rotated container method that isolates and reveals the effects of common mycorrhizal networks, I found that common mycorrhizal networks can influence competitive intraspecific (within the same species) and interspecific (between species) interactions for A. gerardii and E. canadensis.

Common mycorrhizal networks also influenced survival for both A. gerardii and E. canadensis.
