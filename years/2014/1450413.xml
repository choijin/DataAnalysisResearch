<AbstractNarration>In today's data-driven research environment, the ability to easily and reliably access compute, storage, and derived data sources is as much a necessity as the algorithms used to make the actual discoveries. The earth is not shrinking, it is digitizing, and the ability for US researchers to stay competitive in the global research community will increasingly be determined by their ability to reduce the time from theory to discovery.  Over the last 5 years, the open source commercial sector has greatly outpaced the academic research world in its growth and adoption of programming languages, infrastructure design, and interface development. Problems that were primarily academic in nature several years ago are now common in the commercial world. Terms like big data, business intelligence, remote visualization, and streaming event processing, have moved from the classroom to the board room.  However, academic projects are largely unable to take advantage of many today's most popular and widely used open source technologies within the context of their campus and shared research infrastructure. The recently completed, NSF funded, Science Gateway Institute planning project revealed just how far behind many communities are. In a survey of over 26,000 NSF-funded PIs, science gateway developers, and leaders in higher education (i.e., CIOs, CTOs, and others), over 85% of respondents said they needed help adapting existing technologies to realize the needs of their gateway. Another 80% said they needed help simply understanding what technologies were available to them. The research community doesn't just see the gap, they live it. This project seeks to quickly close the capability gap between academic and commercial infrastructure by extending and making robust the Agave Platform, an open, Science-as-a-Service cloud platform for reproducible science. Essentially, this project will allow scientists to focus their energies on their science rather than so much on the computing technologies they use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Agave Platform will build upon the success of the existing Agave Developer APIs which currently serve over 20,000 users in the plant biology community. This project includes three well-defined efforts which will synergistically evolve the current technology into a sustainable Science-as-a-Service platform for the national research community. First,it will extend the Agave Developer APIs with additional services and management interfaces to create a cohesive, self-provisioning Agave Platform which will enable Science-as-a-Service to the developer community. Second, the project team will partner with commercial and academic institutions to create a community driven Application Exchange (AX) based on Docker container technology to facilitate application transparency, portability, attribution, and reproducibility. Third, the project will consolidate existing open source contributions from projects already with the Agave ecosystem into Agave ToGo, a collection of reference science gateways in multiple languages and web frameworks. The Agave Platform will democratize access to software and infrastructure across all areas of science and engineering by modernizing the mechanisms with which the research community can utilize and access academic research infrastructure. This will bridge the gap between industrial and academic research infrastructure and allow researchers to use a new generation of open source software and technologies. The AX will enable greater interoperability and accountability in the way computational science results are published and reviewed. Through the matching investment of industrial partners, reproducibility, best practices, and rigorous scientific review will be brought to the mainstream and promoted as a fundamental aspect of the scientific process in an open, sustainable way. Agave ToGo will make custom gateways readily available to end users and developers alike. For end users, it will empower them to focus on domain science rather than computer science. For developers, it will stimulate innovation and increase the opportunity for discovery. When combined with the Agave Platform and Application Exchange, Agave ToGo will enable novice users to create scalable, reproducible, digital labs that span their office, commercial cloud, and national data centers in a matter of minutes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Agave platform project at University of Hawaii (UH) has delivered a central set of infrastructure and APIs that has been leveraged to support research.  Through the unique location and distance from the centralized Agave platform instance, network latency issue necessitated the deployment of a full Agave platform within the UH Information Technology Services (ITS) data center in Manoa.  This development has lead to a deeper understanding and customization of the Agave platform hosted at UH and expansion of the professional expertise needed to host and manage this series of microservices to support research.  Throughout the project UH worked closely with the Agave team at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) to improve the platform as well as the supporting management software and development tools.  In the end this collaboration has delivered a highly interoperable solution for creating and sharing reproducible science. This project has empowered  our researchers to focus on domain science rather than computer science to achieve better research collaborations, data product reproducibility and data sharing and dissemination.  Specifically at UH, the Agave Project has enabled the UH ITS Cyberinfrastructure team to support a diverse group of researchers, across many science domains including geophysics, geochemistry, microbiology, metagenomics, economics, humanities, hydrology, and climatology using minimal staff . Through the development of Agave powered science gateways these researchers have been able to manage their data, share, collaborate and access computational resources at UH as well as national XSEDE resources, including Jetstream and Stampede2.   The infrastructure established at UH as part of the Agave project has been leveraged to build and support project specific science gateway and decision support tools to enable not just easier access computation but also engage community stakeholders and publish research data projects to the wider research and community audiences.  In particular the Hawaii EPSCoR Ike Wai Gateway(http://ikewai.org) project has heavily leverage the Agave platform project for storing, annotating and publishing data projects.  This project drove additions to the Agave APIs to support spatially referencing data/metadata as well as sensor data (Fig 1).   Further,  this projects needs for visualization and decision support application drove creative uses of the Metadata API to support storing hundreds of thousands of data records to enable the Hawaii Groundwater Recharge Tools (Fig 2) which allows agency and water managers to do real-time scenario testing and visualization of adjustments to land-use and cover and it?s impacts on Oahu?s groundwater.  The Center for MICROBIOME Analysis through Island Knowledge &amp; Investigations (C-MAIKI) project collobarted with the UH Agave team to support microbiome data analyssis.  The UH Agave team developed the C-MAIKI Gateway (https://cmaiki.its.hawaii.edu) to leverage the Agave platform to make microbial sequence data analysis via complicated workflows easier.   To enable this the team worked with researchers to develop workflows that leverage the UH High Performance Computing infrastructure to efficiently execute these analyses.  A user interface built on top of the Agave ToGo web application delivered simple to use web forms (Fig 3) for launching these workflows and then the Agave platform handled the rest ? transferring input data, scheduling HPC jobs, archive outputs and tracking the provenance of the job execution. These workflows which we limited to a few individuals have now been made available to all the researchers C-MAIKI, allowing them more flexibility in when they can run analysis.  In addition, UH deployed a general purpose UH gateway using Agave ToGo to enable easier adoption and use of the Agave platform for the wider community as well as a user friendly interface for use in Agave trainings. As part of the Agave Project at UH has trained 123 UH researchers across 8 workshops to leverage Agave.  These workshops have brought experts in the areas of containerized, reproducible computing, data science and distributed computational workflows from TACC to share their experience and accelerate research at UH.   Overall the Agave platform has lowered barrier to access to the University of Hawaii?s computational and storage resources as well as national resources.  The infrastructure and expertise generated as part of this project will continue to be an integral part of the UH CI used to support researchers and projects.
