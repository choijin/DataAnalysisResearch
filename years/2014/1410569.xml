<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is expected to overcome a number of challenges encountered by researchers synthesizing metal alloy nanostructures.  Using a core/alloy approach, nanoparticles in the size range of 5 to 50 nm will be synthesized with stainless interfaces that are made up of iron, chromium, nickel, aluminum and titanium compositions. These nanomaterial alloys are expected to have unique phase behavior, oxidation properties, and void/defect morphologies.  The ultimate goals of this project are to; develop new "wet-chemical" synthesis strategies to prepare the nanomaterials, to understand the resulting oxidation and phase behavior, and to control that behavior in order to construct novel structures that have utility in energy and biotechnology sectors. A postdoctoral fellow and multiple graduate and undergraduate chemistry students will be supported. The fellow will gain valuable professional development, and along with the students, will gain valuable experience and training in cutting edge nanomaterial science, materials chemistry and associated instrumental techniques.  The PI will promote minority student involvement in the project, and continue his work in guiding women to professional STEM careers. The work will have a profound affect on the materials chemistry and nanoscience communities in the upstate Syracuse New York region through outreach events, enhancements to undergraduate and graduate course work and via hosting a regional workshop on nanoscience that brings together researchers with similar interests from the region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the hypothesis that alloy composition, phase behavior, and oxidation characteristics can be use to control the internal microstructure of nanomaterials. Over the years researchers have mastered the synthesis required for size and shape control of many nanostructures, and today focus is shifting towards being able to process the internal structure of these materials with great precision.  To accomplish this goal, we will prepare new nano-alloy interfaces with stainless steel like compositions that will be used as a chemical tool to control interfacial oxidation rates, which in turn will alter Kirkendall diffusion of defects and vacancies. This will allow for the preparation of nanoparticles with morphologically defined void spaces, including asymmetric ones, which can be controlled with 1-5 nm fidelity.  The goals of this project are to fabricate new non-noble metal nano alloys, to use alloy composition, phase behavior, and oxidation properties to manipulate the internal void structure, and to combine these technologies to tailor internal void symmetry and hierarchy.  Moreover, through the course of the project, a number of novel nano-alloy interfaces will be attempted, including titanium and aluminum based medical  and super-alloys. These new nanomaterials will have immediate applications ranging from the energy to biotechnology sectors, including; gas storage, heterogeneous catalysis and battery technologies, as well as medical alloy surfaces and coatings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Because of this grant, a number of fundamental discoveries, new material designs, and training programs were made possible in the area of synthetic materials nanochemistry. The grant explored new chemistries and processing approaches to prepare transition metal alloy nanoparticles that have a stainless steel like compositions and interfaces.  Oxidation and corrosion of transition metals, like; iron, nickel, and cobalt degrade properties since the oxidized form of the materials often have poorer magnetism, conductivity, and mechanical strength, etc.  By employing a ?core-alloy? approach, metallic nanoparticles or alloys were first chemically synthesized under air-free conditions where careful attention was paid as to not oxidize either precursors or final nanoparticle products. Next, alloys were formed at the nanoparticle either by the slow step-by-step addition of new metals followed by high-temperature annealing or by addition of multiple metal precursors simultaneously.  By focusing on three primary compositions, Fe/FexCr1-x, Fe/Fe1-xNix, and Fe/CrxNiy , we were able to test susceptibility of the designs to oxidation in air, in air at high temperatures, and in corrosion promoting conditions (i.e., salt-water).  Nanoparticle size, composition ratios, shell thicknesses, deposition sequence, and synthetic conditions were systematically varied to best understand the system.  The systems were analyzed via an array of state of the art equipment, such as High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy, X-ray Diffraction, and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, each of which was from an instrument acquired or supported by other NSF grants.  A major outcome of this study was the observation of a preferred composition which was shown to resist oxidation at elevated temperatures, and one that can withstand salt-spray conditions for &gt;1.5 years.  To the best of our knowledge, these stainless nanoparticles are unique in research, and thus a new research area was initiated.   In addition to systematic synthesis, characterization, and testing, this grant also supported the theoretical investigation into the alloying and atom-diffusion within or at the surfaces of these core-alloy particles. To do this, we employed a number of atom diffusion model calculations, ultimately focusing on approximating each nanoparticle as either a single metal ?grain?, or by treating the surface as multiple ?grains.? By doing so, we were able approximately scale bulk diffusion values to the nanoscale models, in which atom diffusion within or outflowing from the particle, as well as oxygen entering the nanoparticle.  This allowed for a better prediction of properties, as well as which transition metal metallic-alloys may be favorable at the nanoscale.   Finally, one additional novel aspect of this work is to use the core-alloy design, combined with the stainless interface and understanding of the diffusion to control void formation within the transforming nanoparticle.
