<AbstractNarration>This award supports exploration of genetic and species diversity in chili peppers and their close relatives in the nightshade family (Solanaceae). Chili peppers, used in chili powder, salsa, and hot sauce, are a major crop worth approximately $30 billion worldwide, and one of the most important vegetable spices in the world. Chili peppers evolved in the New World (Mexico, Central and South America), and are a well-known ingredient in Latin American cuisine. However, they are now an important component of traditional dishes in most Asian and some African and Pacific Island countries. Despite this significance, the species and genetic diversity in wild chili peppers and their relatives has not been well studied. Surprisingly, many of the wild relatives grow in wet rainforests and do not have spicy fruits. Understanding this diversity and the relationships among peppers and their relatives will provide important information on domestication and the genes controlling useful traits for chili pepper breeding and research. This award will fund field work to visit populations of wild chili peppers and their relatives, investigate their genetic diversity, and build an evolutionary tree showing their relationships. Illustrated descriptions for all the species in this group will be provided online, along with tools to help in their identification. The team of investigators who will carry out this project, located in Utah, California, Argentina, and England, are all experts on this group of plants. Along with realizing the scientific goals of this study, they will convey the excitement and discovery of botanical research to a wide audience through blogs from the field, media releases, and K-12 outreach at a children's garden at UC Davis. &lt;br/&gt;This project will advance knowledge by providing complete, detailed taxonomic and phylogenetic information on the pepper genus (Capsicum) and its sister genus (Lycianthes). Both genera lack modern, species-level treatments and robust, well-sampled phylogenies. These data are fundamental to future systematic and crop improvement work on both genera and will stimulate the examination of other biological questions such as the evolution of chili pepper pungency and key innovations such as anther pores in the Solanaceae. This project will assemble systematic information on Capsicum and Lycianthes, delimiting species, discovering new taxa, and clarifying species ranges. This is especially important in many of the wild Capsicum taxa that are narrow endemics in critically endangered ecosystems. The taxonomic component of this project will be available on-line and use the data structures and website resources created in a previously NSF-funded initiative on the genus Solanum (Solanaceae Source). All data will be freely available for re-use. The taxonomic and nomenclatural information will also be shared with aggregator institutions such as Encyclopedia of Life. Molecular data will be acquired using next-generation sequencing techniques by combining the expertise of taxonomists with that of a specialist in pepper breeding and genomics. These data will be used to produce the most densely sampled phylogenies of Capsicum and Lycianthes to date. The genomic information and data generated during this project may have broad applicability in plant phylogenetics and the improvement of other solanaceous crops. This research will solve the complex and uncertain relationship between the two genera and provide the framework for the study of evolution and domestication in one of the world?s most important vegetable spices. Eventually this work may build a better pepper.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project revolves around the evolution of the green pepper/chili pepper genus&nbsp;<em>Capsicum </em>and its close relative, the genus<em> Lycianthes. </em>The aims of the project were to produce an evolutionary tree (a phylogeny) for the two genera, to produce descriptions of the species of the two genera (with details on the height, flowers, fruits, etc. of each species), and to disseminate this information online and in written form. At UC Davis, we have produced 72 species descriptions for the <em>Lycianthes</em> of Mexico and Central America which should be posted online in 2020. This information has also been published in numerous papers over the past four years - seven have already been published and two more are being submitted for publication in March 2020, including a large paper on the <em>Lycianthes</em> of Mexico and Guatemala with an identification key. Although the UC Davis portion of this project is now finished, work on the phylogeny of the two genera is being continued by the Bohs Lab at the University of Utah, the lead Principal Investigator (P.I) for this project. As part of her part of the project, the P.I. at UC Davis, Ellen Dean, has examined thousands of herbarium specimens (dried pressed plants at Natural History Museums) of <em>Lycianthes</em>&nbsp;(examined at about 30 museums around the world) and developed a database with the label information for the specimens. This information has been used to make distribution maps for the species. The resulting web-based species descriptions and the in-prep paper on Mexican and Guatemalan taxa with identification key (53 taxa) will assist many botanists and ecologists with identification of collections of this difficult genus, both in museums and the field. It will also help better understand the evolution of green peppers and chili peppers, important crops worldwide.<br /><br /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/02/2020<br>      Modified by: Ellen&nbsp;Dean</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
