<AbstractNarration>Standard mathematics education that is embedded in symbol systems often fails to engage students, especially girls, by divorcing mathematics from real world contexts. This lack of engagement extends into truncated course taking and a potentially life-long avoidance of mathematics. This project will build on theories of learning that postulate that design experiences (i.e., embodied learning) can play a crucial role in the learning process alongside of more formalized construct learning. Specifically, the researchers will explore traditional women's crafting (knitting, crocheting, sewing, and quilting) to create models for mathematics learning using craft design and especially the process of fixing mistakes in physical contexts to teach basic mathematical concepts such as proportional reasoning, fractions, and geometry. The broader impact of this work lies in its potential to broaden participation in STEM activities and, later, careers for girls and women, highlighting both the everyday mathematics at play in traditional women's crafting communities as well as introducing middle school youth to new mathematical ideas. The goal is to design and identify tools, materials, and activities that can be leveraged in the long term to transform approaches to mathematics spanning both in- and out-of-school learning spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs plan to (1) conduct a series of cognitive and connective ethnographies of female crafting circles to theorize the connections between mathematics and traditional women's crafts; (2) develop key tools, materials (i.e., a set of new tangible manipulatives) and supporting activities with potentially high utility in teaching mathematics through design and embodied approaches to learning; and (3) field test these early prototypes with a range of youth (grades 5-9) to deepen understanding and provide the necessary foundations for the next stages of curriculum development and broader adoption. The core focus will be on highlighting new ways to engage students and educators in mathematical thinking through hands-on crafts, an approach that leverages a range of mathematical ideas to provide students with new tangible manipulatives as "objects-to-think-with" in mathematics education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project had three distinct phases. In the first we conducted observations of traditional textile, fiber, and needle crafts and their connections to mathematics. The second involved the iterative development of new learning activities for youth that leveraged core crafting activities with the goal of designing new approaches to teaching mathematics. The third phase involved following up on what was learned with an expanded set of participants.  Across these phases, we posed the following questions:  In each of our targeted crafting traditions how does mathematics manifest itself? To what extent do crafters engage mathematics in their crafting practice? What are the challenges associated with various entry points into or activities within the crafting tradition (e.g., crocheting a scarf vs. a hyperbolic sphere)? To what extent do youth engage in both the tacit and explicit aspects of the mathematics in the proposed designs? To what extent can the proposed tangible manipulative act as an object-to-think-with in mathematics? To what extent are these new manipulatives and activities seen as transformative to youth participant views of and identification with mathematics?   We focused on both adults and children; the former through extended observations and interviews of expert crafters, and the latter through a series of after school and summer workshops. While our studies of adults looked at the ways that mathematics emerged naturally through practice, our work with children focused on whether or how textile art could intentionally introduce or make use of mathematical ideas.  Our observation of and interviews with knitting experts revealed a strong emphasis on utility of creations, and the low entry bar that such a focus provides. We asked all crafters about what it means to be expert at their craft. This turned out to be a more difficult question than we anticipated, in part because of a shared sense that you always make mistakes and, as the creator of a project, you are always aware of its flaws or places that you would like to change or do differently. However, when pressed, all participants noted that expertise had to do both with the Gestalt of the finished project and with the integrity of the work. Knitters also articulated that expertise has to do with knowing how to solve a problem or accomplish a goal.  Early observations and interviews revealed that very little mathematical thinking is involved in practices that are potentially, at their core, deeply mathematical. This has to do with the ways that patterns and online resources break things down such that the individual knitter might have to do little other than follow directions.

In interviewing knitting designers, much more mathematics was described, although designers claimed that the mathematics they used was relatively "simplistic." However, such "simplistic" ideas included ratio, area, and factors and multiples. To these expert adult knitters, these mathematical ideas seemed simple and trivial. However, these ideas involve fundamental number sense and offer a different insight into these mathematical ideas that are covered, but often not explored, in middle school mathematics.  With respect to students, we found that every child we worked with was able to learn to knit and purl, although at different speeds. This is consistent with adult knitters, who, despite having years of practice, often knit at very different speeds.  Interestingly, children can encounter mathematically relevant ideas almost immediately. The instant a child can knit about two inches (usually 8-10 rows), they are ready to think about their "gauge."
