<AbstractNarration>Humans must categorize the world in order to understand it. Categories like healthy versus poisonous, valuable versus overpriced, or even apples versus oranges coordinate our thinking and guide our actions in the world. In line with their centrality in cognition, current theories of categorization and category learning are numerous and diverse. The goal of this research project is to gather together these diverse theories and subject them to direct comparison using new and innovative statistical theories, computer implementations, and experimental designs. This project aims to serve Socrate's goal of carving nature at its joints by finding out why different people, at different times, learn different kinds of categories in different ways. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has many potential scientific and practical ramifications. In particular, the techniques to be developed are directly relevant to research in the psychology of memory, judgment, and decision-making. More broadly, knowing if different category types are reliably different in the way they are learned, or if people are reliably different in the way they learn categories, will allow development of programs to help people learn difficult categories (like cancerous vs benign radiographs) more quickly and accurately.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Categorization is fundamental to human cognition.  The ability to tell friend from foe, an edible mushroom from a poisonous one, a reef knot from a figure eight, or to discriminate a fundable project from a merely interesting one all rely on this complex capacity.  Theories of categorization can seem nearly as diverse as the capacity itself, and as difficult to categorize as the stimuli in laboratory experiments.  Given categorization?s diversity, it is tempting and perhaps necessary to consider the capacity to be in fact a mixture: not one cognitive system but more than one.  This project had both methodological and empirical aims.  Methodologically, we focused on State-Trace Analysis (STA), which is a robust tool for assessing the differential influence of experimental factors on behavioral outcomes. This development led to substantial improvements in the algorithms required to use STA, the optimization of software implementing these algorithms, and the provision of this software free of charge to the research community.  Our secondary methodological aim was to connect Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling (HBM) to STA, especially via contaminant modeling; this aspect of the project remains ongoing.    Our empirical objectives centered around characterizing the complexity of categorization behavior.  We conceptualize this complexity as a mixture, within each individual, of different strategies and hypotheses.  We have consistently found that the difference in strategy mixtures between individuals is greater than the difference in strategy mixtures between tasks. That is, we have yet to find a task that shifts the nature of categorization in such a way as to suggest that there are multiple systems of category learning, rather than merely multiple styles.  However, with STA now widely available, and links to HBM forthcoming, we are continuing our survey of category learning tasks and situation for evidence of invariances indicative of distinct cognitive mechanisms.
