<AbstractNarration>This project aims to identify which portions of the glacial cover in the Antarctic Peninsula are losing mass to the ocean. This is an important issue to resolve because the Antarctic Peninsula is warming at a faster rate than any other region across the earth. Even though glaciers across the Antarctic Peninsula are small, compared to the continental ice sheet, defining how rapidly they respond to both ocean and atmospheric temperature rise is critical. It is critical because it informs us about the exact mechanisms which regulate ice flow and melting into the ocean. For instance, after the break- up of the Larsen Ice Shelf in 2002 many glaciers began to flow rapidly into the sea. Measuring how much ice was involved is difficult and depends upon accurate estimates of volume and area. One way to increase the accuracy of our estimates is to measure how fast the Earth's crust is rebounding or bouncing back, after the ice has been removed. This rebound effect can be measured with very precise techniques using instruments locked into ice free bedrock surrounding the area of interest. These instruments are monitored by a set of positioning satellites (the Global Positioning System or GPS) in a continuous fashion. Of course the movement of the Earth's bedrock relates not only to the immediate response but also the longer term rate that reflects the long vanished ice masses that once covered the entire Antarctic Peninsula?at the time of the last glaciation. These rebound measurements can, therefore, also tell us about the amount of ice which covered the Antarctic Peninsula thousands of years ago. Glacial isostatic rebound is one of the complicating factors in allowing us to understand how much the larger ice sheets are losing today, something that can be estimated by satellite techniques but only within large errors when the isostatic (rebound) correction is unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed consists of maintaining a set of six rebound stations until the year 2016, allowing for a longer time series and thus more accurate estimates of immediate elastic and longer term rebound effects. It also involves the establishment of two additional GPS stations that will focus on constraining the "bull's eye" of rebound suggested by measurements over the past two years. In addition, several more geologic data points will be collected that will help to reconstruct the position of the ice sheet margin during its recession from the full ice sheet of the last glacial maximum. These will be based upon the coring of marine sediment sequences now recognized to have been deposited along the margins of retreating ice sheets and outlets. Precise dating of the ice margin along with the new and improved rebound data will help to constrain past ice sheet configurations and refine geophysical models related to the nature of post glacial rebound. Data management will be under the auspices of the UNAVCO polar geophysical network or POLENET and will be publically available at the time of station installation. This project is a small scale extension of the ongoing LARsen Ice Shelf, Antarctica Project (LARISSA), an IPY (International Polar Year)-funded interdisciplinary study aimed at understanding earth system connections related to the Larsen Ice Shelf and the northern Antarctic Peninsula.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Science Outcomes                This project was designed to tie up some very important loose ends that test working hypotheses related to the glacial history surrounding the Larsen Ice Shelf and its preceding and peripheral ice streams in the Northern Antarctic Peninsula (NAP). The endeavors reported herein are the culmination of the LARISSA project, an NSF funded International Polar Year initiative.  The federal (NSF) funding for this work allowed us to expand the spatial and temporal coverage of:    &middot;       crustal rebound, by installing and maintaining two continuously recording Global Positioning System stations (cGPS), in addition to the six already in place, and their companion Automated Weather Stations (AWS), &middot;       large diameter sediment cores in the drainage path of two (out of six) former paleo ice streams and,  &middot;       the methods and constraints used for radiocarbon dating and reconstructing ancient ocean temperature by using selected fractions of organic matter based upon thermal stability and analyzing biological compounds which have been found to be sensitive to the water temperature in which the microorganisms (archaea) lived.   The field component of the project included two sampling intensive cruises aboard the United States? RVIB L. M. Gould and several other maintenance and decommissioning forays on the L. M. Gould and, in collaboration with the Korean Polar Research Institute (KOPRI), aboard the RVIB Aaron.  The fundamental findings of the project can be highlighted as follows:  &middot;       uplift of the earth?s crust due to reductions in the stress caused by the loss of overlying glacial mass are:    (1)    very rapid,   (2)    are spatially restricted to the Larsen Ice Shelves designated from north to south as Larsen A and Larsen B,   (3)     help define an unusually low mantle viscosity,  (4)     clearly tied to reductions in ice mass following the Larsen B breakup in 2002, and  (5)      are ongoing to the date of this report,  &middot;       warm (foehn) winds blowing eastward through the valleys (and now fjords) have caused extensive surface melting of the ice shelves where they descend along the tributary heads, including increased melting in the northern reaches of the Larsen C ice shelf, &middot;       rates of recession of the grounding line within the Hugo-Anvers Trough (a paleo ice stream on the western side of the AP) are on the order of 300 m/y, a rate which is at least three-fold higher than estimates derived for the western Ross Sea and the NW Weddell Sea, &middot;       microfacies analysis of the new sediment cores define an interval which is inferred to have been deposited deep within an ice shelf and under conditions of limited oxygenation,  &middot;       the sediment facies zone recognized as a calving bay reentrant environment does indeed exist out across the Anvers-Hugo Trough and the timing of its formation is nearly time synchronous (within the analytical error of radiocarbon dating) from the outer shelf to the inner shelf (Palmer Deep), and &middot;        a significant amount of volcanic detritus is found in the facies interval that marks the transition from sub ice shelf to open marine which because of its provenance must represent a major volcanic event, perhaps derived from the south southwest (the timing is less certain, but it must be before the age of the ice shelf break up, at around ~13 ka).
