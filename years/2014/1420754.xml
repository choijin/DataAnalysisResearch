<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Prof. Tanya Luhrmann, Ph.D. student Alexa Hagerty will investigate the practices of forensic scientists involved in humanitarian exhumation. By using semi-structured interviews, surveys and participation in the daily activities at exhumation sites, labs, storage facilities and family homes, the researcher will explore what humanitarian exhumation means to those most intimately involved: forensic teams and families of the missing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the stated aim of engaging in 'science in service of families',forensic scientists undertaking humanitarian exhumation are often shocked and dismayed to learn that family members oppose exhumation.  By undertaking ethnographic research with a forensics team that pioneered this young field and is the leader in terms of  training of other teams internationally, the co-PI will be able to advise forensic scientists on how to better achieve their aims. In addition to resulting in a dissertation, the findings will be shared with forensic scientists  at the American Academy of Forensic Sciences conference.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research centered on the relationship between families of the missing and forensic teams at exhumation sites in Argentina. In the past twenty years, exhumation of mass graves after political violence has become a normative human rights intervention. Exhumation aims to provide judicial evidence of mass atrocity and to return human remains to families of victims to enable psychological closure. The return of the dead to families is framed by international human rights organizations as an act of reparation, integral to transitional justice, political memory, and repairing the social fabric after political violence.  Despite the increasing normativity of exhumations, little scholarly attention has been devoted to the ethics and social worlds of its practice (Renshaw 2013, Crossland 2013). Recent scholarship notes that "forensic anthropology?s entry into post-conflict settings as a restorative tool is underrepresented in the existing social science literature" and calls for research to "understand the broader implications on victims, communities, local and state power structures" (Heyden 2015).  Ethnographic research has been under-utilized in examining the aftermath of violence: "In many postconflict interventions, both the individual and the collective consequences of violations remain largely unexamined. Indeed, much of the transitional justice literature is by experts speaking for victims" (Robins 2011). Qualitative research, especially that which closely traces experiences of those most intimately affected, is key to gaining a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the effects of violence on communities and how they rebuild and reweave the social fabric of their lives. This research offers a sustained analysis of one attempt at such repair: the recovery, identification, and proper burial of the dead.  The sustained ethnographic attention to exhumation as it is carried out in these specific communities, with close attention to the life experiences of victims? families illuminates the competing and collaborating expectations held by families and teams, and the wide array of social and emotional experiences that the process of exhumation evokes for all involved. Exhumation offers a generative lens to explore the possibilities and limits of reparations and the aftermath of violence and its effects on families and communities.  This project builds a bridge between two sub-fields of anthropology. It brings forensic anthropology and forensic anthropologists into conversation with social anthropology and social anthropologists.
