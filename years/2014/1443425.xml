<AbstractNarration>Since 2012, high school Advanced Placement Biology exam includes molecular evolution and suggests using open-access NCBI BLAST engine for sequence database search to illustrate principles of gene evolution and its applications in biotechnology. BLAST has many other uses in school curriculum. The goal of the proposed workshop is to give teachers, including those working at schools serving high numbers of students from categories underrepresented in STEM,  an understanding of the functionality of the sequence databases and methods of their search. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pairing the proposed workshop with ISMB 2014 will provide teachers with an opportunity to interact with researchers to discuss the science, techniques, and posters from the Bioinformatics Education Special Interest Group, which will be displayed at the conference on the day of the workshop.</AbstractNarration>

Furthermore, teachers also had the opportunity to interact with seasoned computational researchers to discuss the science, techniques, and posters from the Special Interest Group, which were displayed at the ISMB conference on the day of the workshop.  ISCB fully promotes STEM and recognizes the importance of impacting future scientists at a young age. We also acknowledge the increased competition and standards that universities and advanced academic institutions are requiring.  Providing this workshop strengthen the understanding of the BLAST tool incorporated into the Advanced Placement Biology exam.  STEM promotion goes beyond just science, educating teachers and encouraging the inclusion of a computation lesson in their curriculum advances the awareness of the computational biology scientific discipline.  A rare mix of mathematics, computer programming, and science, computational biology is a discipline that will continue to gain popularity within scientific research.  It is important to introduce this science at the high school level and we believe our hands-on tutorial allowed this introduction to take place and resonate with students encouraging them to explore the discipline in their future studies.  ISCB believes that mathematical and computational components applied to biological problems will lead to scientific discovery related to health and disease.
