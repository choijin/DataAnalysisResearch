<AbstractNarration>Topology optimization is a computational process for designing structures and materials that meet some optimality criteria, e.g. minimum weight or maximum stiffness. The technique has gained significant traction among design engineers and has been shown to identify designs where efficient use of materials resulted in unprecedented performance. The objective of this research is to develop a new topology optimization framework capable of designing structural topologies that are robust in the presence of geometric uncertainties. Accounting for dimensional uncertainties in the optimization process is of paramount importance in many engineering applications, for example in processes involving extreme miniaturization of the material architecture, where the physical realization of the optimal design is generally subjected to significant tolerances. The application of this research to state-of-the-art commercially available manufacturing technologies, including additive manufacturing, will greatly impact the development of architected cellular materials and promote technology transfer. Results of this research will be incorporated into graduate courses within the Engineering and Applied Science PhD program at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth. This project will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students at UMass Dartmouth (where many students are first generation college students), the University of California, Irvine and Johns Hopkins University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will result in a new design optimization framework capable of designing structural topologies that are robust in the presence of geometric uncertainties. A number of strategies will be explored based on novel integration of stochastic analysis and uncertainty representation and propagation methods with efficient topology optimization techniques and inverse homogenization-based material design frameworks. Stochastic topology optimization frameworks for both continuum and discrete structures will be developed where flaw-tolerance is achieved through careful incorporation of nodal and boundary uncertainties. Novel methodologies for the characterization and representation of geometric uncertainties are planned, including an experimental effort aimed at carefully measuring typical geometric flaws in architected cellular materials fabricated with state-of-the-art additive manufacturing techniques, and quantifying their impact on the statistical variations of the macroscopic mechanical properties. This experimental investigation will feed into the development of a topology optimization framework centered on flaw-tolerance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This collaborative research project developed new optimization methods capable of designing engineered materials and structures offering robust mechanical performance in the presence of uncertainties, including uncertainties in the form geometric variations that may be the consequence of manufacturing flaws.  Robust performance refers to performance metrics, such as stiffness and strength, that are relatively insensitive to fabrication flaws, typically quantified and assessed via statistics of mean value of the metric, standard deviation of the metric, and/or probability of failure.  The new design optimization methods are based on topology optimization, a systematic approach to optimizing the distribution of materials in space to form a "structure".  Depending on the length scale at which the approach is applied, this "structure" could represent the architecture of a periodic material or an engineering component appearing in (for example) an aircraft or automobile. The developed approaches integrate methods from gradient-based optimization, solid mechanics, and uncertainty quantification to design lightweight materials and ultimately components that are robust, stiff and strong. This is in contrast to the more traditional framework to development that has largely been based on trial-and-error design and experimental testing, a time-consuming and expensive approach.     Both truss-like and continuum (monolithic solid) geometric representations were considered to enable application of the design methodology to very low density cellular materials and structures, as well as more general cellular materials and components with larger load carrying requirements.   Specific advancements made during the research program included creating novel representations of geometric uncertainties and imperfections that may arise due to manufacturing flaws, new approaches to manufacturing constraints to ensure designed solutions are directly manufacturable (without requiring manual geometric repairs by designers), new methods for optimizing the nonlinear response of cellular materials to (for example) maximize energy absorption in materials, and new methods for optimizing the dynamic response of components and structures under random excitations (for example) to minimize motion under random vibrations or a seismic event.  Additionally, a subset of the developed methods were found to be applicable to the design of bandgap materials that are capable of preventing transmission of elastic or acoustic waves occurring over a range of frequencies.     New design optimization methods such as those developed herein are needed to fully leverage the potential of manufacturing technologies and enable creation of manufacturable materials and components that are robust and thus offer substantially improved stiffness-to-weight and strength-to-weight ratios.  The capability to utilize materials optimally, in a mechanically efficient, robust manner, has potential impacts in a wide range of applications from transportation to infrastructure to biomedical. It generally leads to reductions in material usage and mass, leading to material cost savings, material conservation, and reductions in operating costs and fuel usage in transportation-related applications. The research has also generated design methods to support and accelerate the growth of the additive manufacturing industry within the U.S.  The project created educational modules for undergraduate and graduate courses at Johns Hopkins University, created research opportunities for three PhD students, all of which have graduated and moved on to careers in the area of engineering design, and provided research opportunities for a high school student. STEM outreach activities focused on the generation of hands-on design activities for K-4 students, promoting advanced engineering technologies including computer-aided design optimization and additive manufacturing to these students, their parents, and their teachers.
