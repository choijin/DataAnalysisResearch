<AbstractNarration>Slope failures caused by earthquakes have had a significant impact on the design of slopes and earth retention systems in areas of strong seismicity.   For example, several massive landslides occurred within natural clay soil formations during the 1964 Alaskan earthquake that caused loss of life and significant financial loss to infrastructure and private property in Anchorage.  Consequently, design methods for seismic stability developed after this event take an overly conservative approach by assuming small values of strength that are appropriate for fully disturbed clay, resulting in designs that systematically ignore the substantial differences the behavior of the disturbed and the natural clay soil.   This over conservatism results in designs that are significantly more expensive than one which accounts for actual behavior of the natural clays.   Designs based on the results of this research will be more economical yet result in adequate margins of safety for the public.   Therefore, this research will benefit the U.S. economy and society.  The societal and educational impacts of the proposed research are broad, because its results will impact the basic science needed for predicting the occurrence of natural hazards and for developing a sustainable geotechnical design.  This research involves aspects of engineering mechanics, geotechnical engineering, earthquake engineering and engineering geology.  The multi-disciplinary facets of the research will help broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impact engineering education. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) research is a collaboration between industry and academe, which has the benefit of rapid application of research results to practice. &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;This research will develop a new approach for quantifying the strength degradation and destructuration of natural clays exposed to cyclic loading.  It will combine experimental and theoretical findings to predict the onset of seismically-induced failure in natural clay deposits. The experiments will be conducted on high quality samples of Bootlegger Cove Formation  of varying degrees of sensitivity.  Very sensitive clays in this formation triggered the catastrophic slides that took place in Anchorage during the 1964 earthquake.  Northwestern University will collaborate in this research with GeoEngineers, Inc., who will coordinate drilling and sampling of BCF specimens.  The experimental program will include monotonic and cyclic tests on intact and reconstituted samples. The experiments will elucidate the role of incremental nonlinearity, stress-paths, consolidation history and cyclic loading. The modeling activities will use this evidence to formulate an incrementally non-linear constitutive model reproducing the effect of destructuration in pore pressure build-up and cyclically generated failure.  Although several models have been proposed to cope with the complex mechanics of natural clays, such models often ignore the rich variety of possible failure modes. Engineering mechanics theories for fluid-saturated soils provide insights, but to capture the complex processes taking place during seismic shaking, these theories must be enhanced to accommodate cyclically-decaying stiffness and strength processes.  The approach will include the development of specific bifurcation criteria for assessing the cyclic strength degradation as a function of stress conditions and number of cycles.  The model will be numerically implemented in computer programs for coupled dynamic analysis of geotechnical problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Slope failures caused by earthquakes have had a significant impact on impacted infrastructure and have led to loss of life.   When designing slopes and earth retention systems in areas of strong seismicity, it commonly is assumed that the stability of clay deposits can be evaluated through the residual undrained strength that is applicable at large deformations. This conservative assumption does not explicitly account for the magnitude and duration of the seismic shaking and neglects the role of the inherent natural structure of clay, thus preventing a mechanistic and quantitative description of initiation of failure in clays.      This research developed a systematic approach for quantifying the strength degradation and destructuration of natural clays subjected to cyclic loading.  It combined experimental and theoretical findings to predict the onset of seismically-induced failure in natural clay deposits.  Both field and laboratory studies were undertaken.  The field studies were made in Lynn Ary Park at the head scarp of the devastating Turnagain Heights landslide that occurred during the Great Alaskan earthquake of 1964.  Field vane and cross-hole seismic tests were conducted at the same location that US Geologic Survey studied in the 1980s, and supplemented the USGS data.  Laboratory experiments were conducted on high quality samples of Bootlegger Cove Formation (BCF) of varying degrees of sensitivity and included monotonic, cyclic and post-cyclic tests on intact samples of BCF. The results of these experiments were used to develop a quantitative approach to defining cyclic and post-cyclic resistance of the clays.  The modeling activities used this evidence to formulate a constitutive model reproducing the effect of destructuration in pore pressure build-up and cyclically generated failure.    The societal and educational impacts of the research are broad, because its results impact the basic science needed for predicting the occurrence of natural hazards and for developing sustainable geotechnical designs in seismically active areas.  By establishing clear links between site specific soil properties of clays and the mechanism of failure during earthquake loadings, the results of this research will inspire new methods for assessing the risk of flow failures in seismic areas.
