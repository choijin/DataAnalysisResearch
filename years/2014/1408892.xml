<AbstractNarration>As a result of the extensive liquefaction damage in Christchurch, the New Zealand Earthquake Commission (EQC) is sponsoring a multi-million research study to determine the most cost-effective liquefaction mitigation strategies for repair work and subsequent reconstruction.  Based on this test program, government approved approaches will be eligible for earthquake insurance reimbursements.  Blast induced liquefaction trials will be performed to evaluate the ground improvement techniques under full-scale conditions.  In collaboration with EQC we will install instrumented test pile foundations and measure negative skin friction and pile performance following liquefaction induced settlement.  These full-scale measurements of liquefaction induced ground settlement, pile settlement and pile load distribution will provide fundamental understanding of the pile downdrag phenomenon.  The absence of field measurements has led to contradictory design recommendations which may be either unsafe or uneconomical depending on the actual pile behavior.  Because deep foundations are a common approach for supporting bridges and buildings in liquefiable sands, reliable design approaches are critical to preventing future earthquake damage.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liquefaction of loose saturated sands results in significant damage to civil infrastructure in nearly every earthquake event.  Direct and indirect economic losses resulting from liquefaction are substantial costs to society. The tremendous damage to property and the indirect economic loss resulting from the Christchurch New Zealand earthquake sequence dramatically illustrate the broad social impacts of failure to properly design for liquefaction hazards.  Large sections of the city are still uninhabited years after the earthquakes and the economy is struggling to recover.  This collaborative research study in New Zealand will provide fundamental understanding of the performance of typical deep pile foundations for bridges and high-rise structures when subjected to liquefaction.  The results from these tests will allow engineers to evaluate the accuracy of existing design procedures and develop modifications to produce better agreement with measured behavior.   These results will help engineers to design safe, yet cost effective foundation solutions.  Results from this research will benefit both New Zealand and US engineering communities and foster international collaborations.  Leveraging funding from both countries expands the scope of work beyond what either country could accomplish independently.   Considering the paucity of test data relative to liquefaction induced loads on foundations, these test results are likely to have a strong impact on design practice in seismically active areas around the world.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The design of bridges and multistory structures is often impacted by the potential for liquefaction induced downdrag settlement and downward friction.  These structures are typically supported by steel pipes or concrete piles which are driven into the ground or on drilled shafts that are constructed by drilling a deep hole and filling the hole with reinforced concrete.  The foundations are normally supported by upward or positive friction on the side of the shaft, but during an earthquake liquefaction can occur causing the soil to lose strength and behave like a liquid.  As the liquefied sand settles after the earthquake the soil around the pile moves downward causing downward friction to develop.  This downward friction increases the load on the pile and can lead to excessive settlement. Downdrag can have significant effects on the number of piles required to adequately support a bridge abutment.  Current design procedures appear to be unnecessarily conservative in this regard and lead to higher costs for bridges than would actually need to be the case.  However, there are very few case histories with measured data that can be used to guide engineers. As a result there is significant controversy regarding appropriate design approaches.  Improved design methods based on the results of this work should lead to less costly design, retrofit, and construction costs in the future which will allow the budgets for infrastructure to stretch further.  To develop well-documented case histories, we conducted a series of full-scale field tests in Christchurch, New Zealand in collaboration with an international team of researchers who were working together to determine the most cost-effective means of building foundations in liquefiable sand. By participating with this group of accomplished researchers, substantial savings to the project budget were realized and mutually beneficial relationships developed. We installed three 2 foot diameter pile foundations extending to depths of 28, 39, and 46 ft to evaluate the influence of pile depth on foundation performance. A series of explosive charges were then detonated to induce liquefaction from a depth of about 10 ft to a depth of 30 ft and pile behavior was measured.  In the initial tests, no load was applied to the foundations, but in the second set of tests we used a load frame so that each foundation had a load equal to 50% or more of design capacity.     Typically, design engineers assume that the side friction in liquefied sand is equal to zero; however, measured skin friction in the liquefied zone for all test piles was about 50% of the positive skin friction in this zone prior to liquefaction. Pile settlement decreased as the pile extended deeper into the soil profile and below the liquefied zone. For the test with the load on the test piles, the applied load coupled with the loss of side resistance after liquefaction was sufficient to induce significant downward settlement of the pile.  End-bearing resistance was largely developed with the settlement.  As a result, pile settlement exceeded ground settlement and positive skin friction re-developed in the liquefied sand.  However, in agreement with the previous test, the positive skin friction which developed in the liquefied zone was about 50% of the positive skin friction in this zone prior to liquefaction. These results, coupled with those from a similar test conducted previously on a driven steel pipe pile in Vancouver, Canada, indicate that design procedures should not assume that friction in liquefied sand is equal to zero, but should use a value equal to 50% of the friction prior to liquefaction.
