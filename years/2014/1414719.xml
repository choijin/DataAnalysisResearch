<AbstractNarration>Algal biofuels have been recognized as one of the preferred alternatives to fossil fuels. However, algal biofuels are not yet economically viable due to the high costs of cultivation and downstream processing to yield the finished product. One of the barriers in the algal biofuel pathway is the harvesting step. In this study, it is hypothesized that algal biofuel cultivation can be engineered to utilize DNA as a flocculant for energy-efficient harvesting of the biomass. During flocculation, the dispersed microalgal cells aggregate and form larger particles with higher sedimentation rate. The concept of utilizing DNA as a flocculant in micro algae must be verified and validated for variety of species. Initial experiments will be conducted to verify this hypothesis at Dr. Ji-Won Yang's laboratory at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Daejeon, South Korea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current algal biofuels research is focusing on optimizing cultivation and downstream processing. Hardly any research is addressing the issue of biomass harvesting which remains a major challenge because it entails separating microalgae from a medium of nearly identical specific gravity. The validation that DNA-based flocculation could aid in harvesting of algal biomass and the quantitative data to be generated in the proposed study can advance knowledge and understanding as no previous studies have reported on it as a means to improve the harvesting step in the algal cultivation-to-biofuel process chain. This research is expected to contribute to efforts to demonstrate the practical feasibility of algal-based systems for energy production. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.</AbstractNarration>

Civil Engineering                                       Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology     Background Information   Algal biofuels have been recognized as one of the preferred alternatives to fossil fuels.

Initial experiments will be conducted to verify this hypothesis at Dr. Ji-Won YangÃ†s laboratory at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Daejeon, South Korea.  Current research at NMSU and elsewhere is focusing on optimizing cultivation and downstream processing, hardly any research is addressing the issue of biomass harvesting which remains a major challenge because it entails separating microalgae from a medium of nearly identical specific gravity.

This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.  Objectives  Conduct bench scale tests to evaluate DNA-induced flocculation to improve the algal harvesting process.  Evaluate a dual-stage cultivation system using Ettlia YC001 and evaluate lipid induction under nitrogen deprivation conditions and harvesting efficiency.  Build a collaboration between my advisor, Prof. Nirmala Khandan of my home institution, New Mexico State University, and my host, Prof. Ji Won Yang of Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, which will lead to future projects, shared grants and more student exchange opportunities.   Results and Conclusions    Chlorella vulgaris settling study using 10ppm of DNA isolated from Ettlia sp. YC001. We hypothesized that DNA will be liberated preferentially by the most stressed cells in late stage, nutrient starved microalgae cultures. Changes in non-physiological pH of the system will create stress on the algae leading to preferential lysis of a subpopulation of algae in the culture that are the most stressed. The presence of DNA was predicted to cause flocculation in stressed algae cells. Ettlia sp. DNA was isolated and purified using a genomic DNA prep for algae protocol. The purified DNA was then added to a Chlorella culture at 10 ppm. Cultures were placed in spectrophotometer cuvettes and OD at 680nm was measured at various time points to study the sedimentation effect of DNA. However, results of Chlorella vulgaris sedimentation study using DNA as a flocculant did not show any effect on the rate of sedimentation. Based on the results of the study it was determined that DNA cannot act as a biological flocculant.    Dual-stage Cultivation System using Ettlia sp. YC001. Hypothesis: Ettlia sp. YC001 would auto-flocculate and produce lipids under stress conditions. An Ettlia sp. isolated by KRIBB naturally settles with the presence of symbiotic nitrogen fixing bacteria when cultivated in outdoor raceway ponds and sh...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
