<AbstractNarration>This award provides two years of funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "Kent State Informal Analysis Seminar," the next meeting of which will take place March 1-2, 2014, on the campus of Kent State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kent State Informal Analysis Seminar is a roughly biannual regional conference that has served the US Midwest for over forty years. The themes of the meetings vary greatly from event to event, ranging over a broad spectrum of topics that has included approximation theory, convex geometry, dynamical systems, the geometry of Banach spaces, harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, and several complex variables, to give just a sampling. The featured speakers at the March 2014 meeting will be Svetlana Jitomirskaya (mathematical physics) and Nets Katz (harmonic analysis and combinatorics), each of whom will deliver a four-hour series of  lectures. The seminar format provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF grant DMS-1400019 supported the running of four Informal Analysis Seminars during the period of January 2014--August 2016.  Each seminar was held in the format of having two plenary speakers each delivering a series of four one-hour lectures.  The emphasis of the seminar series is that modern analysis is not a narrow subject, but rather a very broad toolbox of ideas which inform a number of neighboring areas of mathematics, such as computer science, discrete geometry, probability theory, and mathematical physics.  Our seminar attracts world leading researchers in these different fields to present, in detail, aspects of the most exciting recent breakthroughs in their respective areas.  We attracted graduate students, and both junior and senior researchers, from across the US to participate in the seminar, and held a poster session in each seminar to give the opportunity for junior participants to display their work.  The complete participant lists from the conferences, as well as abstracts for the speakers, can be found on the informal analysis website http://www.math.kent.edu/~zvavitch/informal.  The seminar provided a unique opportunity for the professional development of researchers by exposing them to a wide range of new techniques that have been used to make significant advances in mathematics.  The intensive weekend seminars enabled the plenary speakers to present state of the art mathematics in detail, bringing participants to a level where they are able to actively work on exciting new lines of research in those fields.  As such, the seminars helped advance knowledge and understanding across a number of mathematical fields.  The plenary speakers in the NSF funded seminars include  March 2014:  Svetlana Jitomirskaya (UC Irvine) and Nets Katz (CalTech), March 2015:  Alexandre Eremenko (Purdue) and Grigoris Paouris (Texas A&amp;M), November 2015: Boaz Klartag (Tel Aviv) and Igor Rivin (Temple, PA, and St Andrews, UK), April 2016: Imre Barany (Alfred Renyi Institute, Hungarian Academy of Sciences), and Asaf Nachmias (Tel Aviv).   The seminars have attracted participants from University of Wisconsin, Texas A&amp;M, University of Minnesota, Delaware University, University of Texas at Austin, University of Toronto, Rochester University,  The Ohio State University, Indiana University, Case Western Reserve University, Michigan State University, University of Michigan, Bucknell University, University of Georgia, Georgia Tech University, Purdue University, University of North Carolina, Oklahoma State University, Northern Illinois University, University of Missouri, University of Pittsburgh, University of Toledo, Carnegie Mellon University, and Rutgers University.
