<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to produce and commercialize a hypoallergenic peanut. This new peanut variety will provide broad and efficient protection against peanut allergy at low cost to individuals at risk; i.e., individuals who are clinically declared to be allergic to peanut as well as those who might not be aware yet of their sensitivity to peanut. The hypoallergenic peanut is expected to: 1) Reduce the incidence of peanut allergy and save the lives of individuals who are severely allergic to peanut; 2) Eliminate emotional distress of peanut allergic individuals and their families; 3) Reduce the cost of law suits resulting from peanut allergy; and 4) Gain back the loss endured by the peanut market and improve the U.S. competitive edge in the international arena. Food allergies cost the U.S. $25 billion annually and peanut is a major contributor. This project will bring a significant solution to this problem and reduce the overall cost of food allergy.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a transgenic hypoallergenic peanut that produces a homogeneous population of hypoallergenic peanut seeds. Peanut allergy is on the increase and affects over 8% of U.S. infants and children. Currently, there is no cure for peanut allergy and epinephrine is administered as emergency treatment. RNA interference (RNAi) technology was used to down regulate the most important and potent allergens, and resulted in significant reduction in peanut allergenic potency. However, the peanut seed populations displayed variable levels of allergenic potency. This was attributed to chimerism in the transgenic plants. Friable embryogenic callus (FEC) reduces the risks of generating chimeric transgenic plants. The objectives of this Phase I project are: 1) To transform peanut FEC using Agrobacterium tumefaciens; 2) To perform molecular analyses on transgenic regenerants (T0) and determine integrity and stability of the transgene in the peanut genome; and 3) To perform molecular and immunological analyses on resulting T1 seeds to determine the level of allergenic potency. It is expected that at the end of this SBIR Phase I project, at least one transgenic peanut line with homogeneous populations of hypoallergenic seeds will be selected as commercial prototype for further analysis and mass propagation.</AbstractNarration>

Furthermore, on January 4, 2011 President Obama signed into law the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) to shift the focus from responding to contamination to preventing it and ensure the U.S. food supply is safe.  Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is the 12th most important cash crop grown in the U.S. Peanut is found in about 75% of American homes, and is considered a staple food. Americans eat more than 600 million pounds of peanuts and 700 million pounds of peanut butter each year.

This represents a 3-fold increase in diagnoses over the past 2 decades.  Currently, there is no cure for peanut allergy and management practices include assiduous avoidance and emergency treatment with epinephrine. Accidental ingestion of peanut resulting in allergic reactions and/or deaths is mostly due to its ubiquitous and undeclared and hidden presence in many foods. Because epinephrine addresses the symptoms of an allergic reaction once it has taken place, the epinephrine act, although a positive step, could bring a false sense of relief as children are still exposed to severe or fatal allergic reactions, particularly if the reactions occur outside of school facilities.  NgateGen, Inc., (NGI) is proposing to solve the peanut allergy problem using a molecular approach.   In previous work, the company successfully utilized its proprietary technology to downregulate concomitantly the genes encoding the 5 most important and potent allergens Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3/4, Ara h 6 and Ara h 7,  which resulted in a significant (2 to 25 fold) reduction in peanut allergenic potency. However, seed screening experiments performed on 4 successive generations of transgenic peanut revealed that the populations of transgenic seeds were heterogeneous with regard to the allergen content. This observation was unexpected as the level of homozygosity and the degree of allergen gene silencing were expected to increase with increasing number of generations.  Chimerism of the transgenic plants was identified as a possible cause for the variability in the transgenic seeds.     Chimerism is not acceptable for a hypoallergenic peanut trait which is highly life sensitive. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a commercial prototype of transgenic hypoallergenic peanut with (1) 100% of the seeds are uniformly and significantly devoid of the targeted 5 allergens and, (2) 100% of the progeny have stably integrated the hypoallergenic trait.

In plant genetic transformation, somatic embryogenesis is a preferred approach compared to organogenesis because in most cases, somatic embryos are of single-cell origin thus, chimeric plants are less likely to develop. When somatic embryos have multicellular origins, repetitive somatic embryogenesis is needed to reduce or eliminate chimeric events and to obtain fully transgenic embryos from the transgenic sector within repetitive embryos.     The outcomes of this SBIR Phase I project are the followings: (1) a protocol for repetitive somatic embryogenesis and plant generation was successfully established in peanut, (2) Kanamycin resistant embryogenic callus lines were produced from peanut globular stage repetitive somatic embryos using Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. (3) Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) show peanut somatic embryos have integrated the full length of the Ara h1...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
