<AbstractNarration>Magnesium alloys are the lightest of all structural metallic materials, and are becoming of increasing interest due to their combination of low-density, moderate strength and stiffness, availability and recyclability.  In particular, these properties are of direct relevance to the automobile, rail and aerospace industries that seek to replace heavier components with lighter ones, and thus minimize fuel usage. Despite the increased interest, magnesium alloys suffer from not being strong enough, and more so, that components have to be heated and shaped at very high temperatures, which is economically prohibitive for transportation manufacturers. This award supports fundamental research to acquire knowledge that will enable synergistic increases in strength and lowering of the processing temperature to ambient temperatures, thereby solving two important barriers to usage at one time.  This research will intersect at the boundaries of materials science, mechanics and manufacturing in a highly relevant way.  It will attract, educate and enable students from underrepresented groups to gain the knowledge and confidence to directly address the rigorous, evolving needs in U.S. industry and government for lightweight materials in energy efficient transportation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cast magnesium alloys have suffered from poor ambient temperature plasticity due to the lack of necessary active slip systems. This problem is compounded in wrought processed alloys wherein highly anisotropic textures limit uniform material flow. On the other hand, nanocrystalline materials with grain sizes below 100nm have exceptional and desirable properties when compared to their course-grained counterparts, including concurrent increases in strength and ductility.  Motivated by this, the goals of this project are 1) to uncover the underpinning mechanisms for ambient temperature plasticity in bulk, fully dense, nano-grained magnesium alloys using novel processing approaches and microstructure-based modeling; and 2) to exploit the subsequent knowledge to predictably design and fabricate low-temperature formable magnesium alloys. In terms of broader scientific ramifications, the development of a tractable and systematic experimental and modeling framework will represent a major advance over current semi-empirical methods for designing nano-grained alloys with tailored microstructures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The pursuit of light but strong materials has been a subject of materials science and engineering studies for over a century.  While Aluminum has recieved the most attention as a metal that could replace steel components at a fraction of the weight, a much lighter metal, Magnesium and it's alloys have been mostly overlooked.  This is mainly because of the inability to achieve high strengths, but also the expense needed to manufacture the magnesium into complex shapes at low temperatures.  More specifically, the high temperatures needed to form magnesium result in the loss of the strength properties gained in the as-wrought state.  This project aimed at validating a hypothesis that stated that if the magnesium crystals could approach very small sizes (less than one micrometer) that the materials would be simultaneously strengthened, but also gain the ability to be deformed at low temperatures.  To make these materials, we sought to harness novel powder-processing techniques on magnesium alloys (such as magnesium-yttrium) that would form nanocrystalline grains, which would then be followed by various approaches to consolidate the materials to bulk forms where the mechanical properties could be evaluated and compared to conventional materials.  This processing proved very challenging due to materials purity, difficulty in safely handling powders, and lack of full-bonding of the powders, suggesting that the powder metallurgy approach would not be suitable for further study.  Concurrenlty, the research community following our progress made the same observation which validated our fundamental hypothesis.  This fundamental discovery should fuel novel lightweight Mg research for years to come. In the process of advancing the science of magnesium processing, one graduate student was supported and trained in a full-breadth of experimental processing and characterization techniques which are forecast to prepare him well to join a 21st century workforce.  The PI also reached very broad audiences to educate them on the field of materials science and engineering, and more specifically, the project development of light metals via connection to superhero comics and movies, including Captain America's shield, Superman (Man of Steel) and Ironman.
