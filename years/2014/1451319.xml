<AbstractNarration>Proposal: 1451319&lt;br/&gt;PI: Burg, Karen&lt;br/&gt;Title: EAGER: Building a Framework to Advance Research through Undergraduate Participation: Investigating pH in 3D Tissue Test Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER award will lead to the development of methods for both constructing complex three dimensional tissues, but also deconstructing the tissues after use such that each layer of the tissue can be analyzed.  Developing new techniques for tissue construction that allow facile layer by layer deconstruction or dis-assembly of tissues will allow investigators to ask for the first time how the role of spatial gradients of chemicals, along with cell to cell contacts, impacts the survival and function of individual cells within the tissue and eventually overall tissue function.  Along with this innovative research program, the PI will also develop novel mentoring strategies for undergraduates engaged in research.  She poses some unconventional hypotheses about a fused research and mentoring methodology which she believes will lead to greater retention of diverse students in STEM fields.  With funds from this award, the PI aims to develop a scalable model of fused research and mentoring that will potentially have a high impact on undergraduate research and training, and retention of students engaged in such activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching theme of the proposed work is to quantify and evaluate the role of pH in tissue system applications. To this end, a novel, heterogeneous 3D bench-top system will be developed to model tissue engineered breast and bone. Unlike conventional 3D tissue systems, the breast model will incorporate stacked layers with "peel-able" design, in which each layer has specific characteristics. This design is also unique in that the model may be easily taken apart and analyzed. The orthopedic model will incorporate gel and a ceramic bone graft filler and will explore acidic to basic ranges of pH shift. The breast model will incorporate gel and polymeric beads and will explore neutral to acidic ranges of pH shift. Following culture of either model, the system will be deconstructed, layer by layer, and pH test liquid applied to spots across each paper. In this manner a pH map will be constructed. If successful, the stacking approach will allow, for the first time, mapping of the interior of tissue engineered systems.  At the same time the PI will build on a previous Research Experience for Minorities (REM) program to test new methods to provide critical thinking skills to undergraduates engaged in research.  She will use a scientific approach to gathering and analyzing data related to the efficacy of current undergraduate research courses and a team-based undergraduate research opportunity as the means to teach critical thinking through research. The results of this study will help provide guidance as to where limited university resources should be applied to provide wide-scale research participation by undergraduates and maximize research results while addressing the need to improve the critical thinking skills of the participants.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>There is a paucity of assays and methodologies to support real-time monitoring and assessment of 3D tissues as they are grown in a laboratory setting; hence, a novel approach was developed to engineer and assess breast and bone tissue for benchtop use.&nbsp; Unlike conventional 3D engineered tissue systems which are grown as one continuous, relatively homogenous ?block?, our engineered tissue incorporated stacked layers with ?peel-able? design, in which each layer has specific characteristics. This design is unique in that the engineered tissue is built with varying features (heterogeneities representative of tissues found in the body) and may be easily taken apart and analyzed.&nbsp; We built an orthopedic tissue model that incorporated gel with embedded ceramic bone-like particles and explored the acidic to basic ranges of pH shift that one would expect during a bone healing process.&nbsp; We also built a breast model that incorporated gel and embedded polymeric beads and explored neutral to acidic ranges of pH shift.&nbsp; Following cell culture, the tissues were successfully deconstructed, layer by layer, and assessed chemically and observed with microscopy.&nbsp; Changes in pH were monitored to determine how they might affect cell activity on a tissue substitute. A tri-culture benchtop environment, using fat, immune, and stem-like bone cells, was used to study the effect of basic and acidic conditions relevant to a bone fracture site. The stacking approach allowed, for the first time, mapping of the interior of tissue engineered systems and an intuitive, low-cost means of tissue observation and measurement that any researcher could immediately add to their tissue fabrication projects. Preliminary results from the breast tissue system indicated that a 3D stacked system can be readily de-stacked to investigate cellular behaviors within specific layers. Knowledge gained provided critical information regarding the feasibility and limitations of studying heterogeneous structures and cellular behaviors in the interior of millimeter or more thickness tissue systems. We found that the size of the cellular structure under consideration and/or the paper structure type is a limitation. With respect to the orthopedic system, we recognized that the measurement of pH shifts in a real-time biological system is not trivial and would benefit from a sensor control system. Accordingly, we conducted preliminary work on a bioreactor system with adaptive control to lay the groundwork for future studies, where pH fluctuation due to basic handling of the system must be noted.</p> <p>The research also allowed us to explore a novel fusion of research and mentoring: a program to embed early stage undergraduates in complex tissue fabrication projects in order to simultaneously ignite their enthusiasm for creative inquiry and advance the research. We correctly postulated that the inclusion of creative, early stage undergraduates (who have not been ?molded? by disciplinary boundaries) would serve to enhance the rapid development of complex, exploratory research. The fused approach defied conventional wisdom that students at this stage cannot contribute to advanced research. It also defied the conventional methods; traditionally, undergraduates are given ?deep end immersion? opportunities and given those opportunities largely at advanced stages in their academic careers.&nbsp; Hence the technical projects were conducted by novice undergraduate researchers, mentored by a faculty member-graduate student team.&nbsp; A set of learning modules was developed to provide customizable mentoring for students interested in learning how to succeed in a research setting. The online training materials (http://www.eqpoint.info/) include resources for both mentors and mentees. The modules cover various topics such as standard operating procedures, experimental design, scientific community, and scientific communication skills. Each module has a set of learning outcomes and guides both for mentors and mentees, providing a 360-degree viewpoint.&nbsp; Each module provides learning objectives that highlight skills the user should acquire upon completion of the module. The modules contain resources for mentors and mentees, including teaching plans, detailed instructions on how to complete the module, technical content, as well as supplementary material, such as external links, additional exercises or PowerPoint presentations, and additional tips. The modules provided ideas for graduate students and faculty mentors regarding effective approaches for mentoring. Various attributes of critical thinking were assessed; the work demonstrated that a structured program that intentionally combines research fundamentals and professional development can lead to a supportive and inclusive environment that alleviates feelings of ?belonging uncertainty?.&nbsp; The modules are being translated to the National Institute of Health?s National Research Mentoring Network (<a href="https://nrmnet.net/">https://nrmnet.net</a>) for widespread dissemination.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/19/2020<br>      Modified by: Karen&nbsp;J&nbsp;Burg</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1451319/1451319_10334527_1582145705950_Bonesystem1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1451319/1451319_10334527_1582145705950_Bonesystem1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Bone Repair"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1451319/1451319_10334527_1582145705950_Bonesystem1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Bone Repair"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Building user friendly, realistic 3D bone tissue systems to improve bone fracture repair options.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Karen Burg</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Karen&nbsp;J&nbsp;Burg</div> <div class="imageTitle">Bone Repair</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1451319/1451319_10334527_1582145066050_EAGERgroup--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1451319/1451319_10334527_1582145066050_EAGERgroup--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Undergraduate mentees"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1451319/1451319_10334527_1582145066050_EAGERgroup--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Undergraduate mentees"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Early-stage undergraduate researchers develop key research and critical thinking skills through a fused research-professional skills approach.
