<AbstractNarration>This project investigates how material objects, which may or may not have practical utility, come to have commercial value as commodities. To highlight the processes involved, the researcher will focus on an object whose significance has changed over time.  This will clarify which features are inherent in the object and which are added through marketing and consumer cultures. Quartz crystals mined in Brazil were once marketed to the United States for their piezoelectric properties and highly valued for their use in World War Two military radio equipment. Over the past 70 years, the quartz market has shifted from producing for the military to producing for semiprecious gemstone markets. The research asks how this transformation in meaning has come about and what causative factors and agents are involved. Findings from this research will have  relevance to multiple commodities that are traded internationally as well as to the general theoretical question of how value is created and sustained. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted by University of California, Irvine, doctoral student Josef Wieland, who is supervised by Dr. William M. Maurer. Wieland will base his study in the mineral-rich state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, the epicenter of Brazil's mining industries. This is an appropriate research setting given that this region has remained the world's largest producer of many strategic mineral resources for nearly 100 years.  The investigator's goal is to determine what factors in Brazil and the United States generate what types of economic, cultural, and social value in the commodity networks, and how these factors affect global quartz markets more broadly. To measure value transformation the researcher will track quartz as it passes from mines to consumers. He will conduct interviews with the producers, processors, wholesalers, trade show venders, and consumers who comprise the quartz commodity chain that stretches from rural Brazilian mines through international markets to North American sales points and consumers.  He also will carry out observations at different sites in the commodity chain and do archival research on the quartz industry in Brazil over the past century. By examining the extent to which local environmental policy, social history, and global demand impact mineral values, findings from this research will provide insight into the factors that create and sustain value as well as those that promote the stabilization of mineral markets. Stable access to mineral resources will likely be among the most salient national security and socio-ecological issues of the twenty-first century.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The central goal of this project is to map the production and transformation of value in a quartz crystal market spanning from mines in rural Brazil to luxury consumers in the US Southwest. The co-PI conducted 12 months of ethnographic research with quartz miners, wholesalers, and consumers along this value chain to investigate how multiple forms of economic, social, and metaphysical value come to matter in this market.  Central to this investigation of how multiple forms of value drive a market has been a specific interest in the role of the body and sensory experience.  The impacts of this research extend beyond an understanding of mineral commodities, as the co-PI creates publications and presentations that will broadly impact markets, networks, and the social and political-ecological impacts of informal mining around the world.   Preliminary data analysis suggests that in the worldÆs multibillion-dollar quartz crystal market, value is not  simply economic, value is not simply social, value is also sensorial. The intellectual merit of this project lies in three primary contributions to social theory. First, this research contributes to a growing body of literature on the sensual domains of commodities and economic markets by explaining how the senses become a primary evaluative tool, and thus driver of value. Second, this project makes a crucial intervention into studies of science and technology by explaining how the body itself becomes a technology to select and classify crystals.  Lastly, results from this research help extend theories in anthropology and the Humanities blurring the distinction between social and natural worlds.    A nuanced perspective of mineral markets continues to emerge as the co-PI analyzes the empirical and archival data that he has gathered through 12 months of research in Brazil and the US. The broader impacts of this study will make important social contributions to the understanding of global markets, commodity circulation, and the social and political-ecological impacts of informal mining.  The co-PI is presently authoring articles on the history of quartz mining in the Diamantina region, from colonialism through present for a popular mineralogy journal.  Additionally, the co-PI is developing an online blog about this research titled, "The Social Life of Stones."  By documenting the travels of Brazilian quartz crystals, this blog helps "shrink the world" and generates public discourse about the global and sometimes exploitative nature of commodity production.  This research will be made publicly accessible to intentionally spark debate about how markets transform under public scrutiny.
