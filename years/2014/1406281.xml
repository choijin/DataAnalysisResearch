<AbstractNarration>The project will concentrate on the moduli of geometric structures on manifolds. This subject arose from several threads in the 19th century: (1) symmetries of crystals, which developed into the theory of crystallographic groups; (2) conformal mapping, and the corresponding holomorphic differential equations and their monodromy groups, which led to the classical theory of uniformization; (3) classical differential geometry of surfaces, generalized to Riemannian geometry, and later to Lorentzian geometry influenced by Einstein's theory of gravitation. The notion of a geometry itself was algebraicized by Felix Klein, who interpreted a geometry as the properties invariant under a transitive action of a Lie group. The present study investigates the possible ways of putting a geometric structure on a topological manifold in terms of the fundamental group and the Lie group. The goal is to describe when a given topology (often described by a combinatorial object) can be given the given geometry. In several cases, there is a complete classification of geometric structures, and the moduli space itself enjoys both a rich geometry of its own and symmetries of its own, which lead to intricate dynamical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals and scope of this project involve flat projective and conformal structures, especially in dimension three. The recent classification of complete affine 3-manifolds leads to many questions about more general structures. In particular the proposal asked which groups which admit proper affine actions; at present the only known hyperbolic groups are free groups. The methods involve a combination of dynamical systems, algebraic group theory, topology and geometric group theory and representation theory. Other important questions include finding obstructions for a 3-manifold to admit a projective structure; at present only one such closed 3-manifold is known. Computer experiments can help in this direction, and projects in the Experimental Geometry Lab can suggest new examples of geometric structures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project "Geometric Structures and surfaces" deals with the general  problem of putting a rigid geometric structure on a manifold.  By a "geometric structure" is meant a structure defined by coordinates  in a classical geometry (such as Euclidean geometry, hyperbolic geometry,  or projective geometry, and more generally the geometry on a homogeneous space of a Lie group). The coordinate changes are locally transformations  preserving the geometry on the model space, so the geometry of the homogeneous is locally present in the manifold. For example,  the 2-dimensional sphere does not admit a Euclidean structure:  there is no metrically accurate world atlas.      Many of the publications completed in this grant period concerned  3-dimensional manifolds with the geometry of special relativity,  which are quotients of 3-dimenisional Minkowski space.  This is the analog of crystallographic groups, but in the Lorentzian setting.     The general classification problem leads to dynamical systems  given by the action of the mapping class group on character  varieties. In general this action is highly chaotic so the quotient  is intractable. The model case of the Riemann moduli space   is misleading simple --- more typical are ergodic actions on  homogeneous spaces. This leads to many interesting dynamical  questions, with techniques from several fields of mathematics  available to attack these phenomena. Furthermore interpreting  representations of groups in terms of geometric structures  provides insight into the purely algebraic problem of understanding  the space of all representations of a finitely generated group as  matrices.     Many of the tradiditonal geometries with notions of distance  (such as Euclidean, spherical and hyperbolic non-euclidean geometry)  are special cases of projective geometry, in which there is only the notion  of lines and points and their interrelationships. It was natural to conjecture  that every 3-dimensionsl manifold has a projective structure. One highlight of this  project was the construction of a simple example of a 3-dimensional that does not carry a projective structure.
