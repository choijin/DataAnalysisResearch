<AbstractNarration>This award provides funds for a 2-year Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for the PI, who will work under the mentorship of Professor Richard Seager at Columbia University. The goal of the project is to reconcile an apparent discrepancy between expected changes in hydroclimate due to global warming with paleoclimate proxy data from past climates. Global warming simulations typically suggest that water will become more scarce over the continents as temperatures rise, due to increases in evaporative demand that outpace increases in precipitation. But if drying accompanies warming then the same logic would suggest that colder climates, including ice age climates, should be wetter.  This argument is apparently in conflict with the geological evidence, which suggests that the ice ages were in fact dryer than today's climate. Moreover, there is evidence that the warm climate of the early Cenozoic (about 55 million years ago) was wetter than today's world despite the higher temperatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three avenues of research are pursued to address this discrepancy, the first of which is a careful examination of modern-day climate simulations from climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 5 (CMIP5). The premise is that the drying produced in climate change simulations from these models could be associated with biases in the present-day simulations, thus models may overestimate future drying if they are consistently biased dry in their control simulations. The second activity is a diagnostic examination of continental hydroclimate in model simulations of the last glacial maximum (LGM, roughly 20 to 25 thousand years ago), taken from the Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project version 3 (PMIP3). While changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration have been examined in detail for future climate simulations, comparable diagnoses have not been performed for LGM simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third is a reexamination of the paleo-proxy record to make sure that the evidence for LGM drying has not been misinterpreted. Much of this evidence is based on vegetation, and it is possible that the vegetation is responding to lower values of carbon dioxide (CO2) and a reduction in CO2 fertilization, rather than a reduction in available water. The PI proposes to address this possibility by looking at proxy data which is not related to vegetation, for example lake levels and evaporite deposits. If the non-vegetation proxies do not show the same aridity signal found in vegetation-based proxies (pollen, fossils, carbon isotope ratios), a role for CO2 fertilization would seem likely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has inherent broader impacts due to the profound consequences of water shortages for human well-being and natural ecosystems.  The work specifically addresses the potential for climate change to produce water shortages and the question of how well we can anticipate such shortages based on climate model simulations.  In addition, the postdoctoral research fellowship, under the mentorship of an established scientist, will help to build the career of the PI, thereby providing support for the future workforce in this scientific discipline.</AbstractNarration>

(This is due to the models' very strong representation of the controversial beneficial effects of CO2 itself on plant growth, independent of climate change.)  Should we believe these strange computer results?  In our normal experience of year-to-year variations in the climate, they do not fit in:  years with dry soil are usually also years with dry rivers and less healthy plants, which is why we call those things together a "drought".  Yet long-term CO2-powered climate change may not behave like ordinary year-to-year variations.  This NSF project aimed to test the computer results in an unusual but very useful way:  by examining the same computer models' simulation of the difference between today's mild world and the frigid peak of the last great Ice Age 21,000 years ago when CO2 was much lower, and comparing the simulated differences to what we know (from geology) actually happened to plants, rivers, lakes, etc. between the Ice Age and today.  The findings of the project were as follows.  First, we found that the computer models simulated the water-related differences between the present and the Ice Age to be very analogous to the water-related differences between the warm future and the present.  That is, they project that the present should have mostly drier topsoils and drier values of wetness-formulas than the Ice Age, but variously wetter and/or drier rivers, lakes and ground waters, and ubiquitously greener and healthier vegetation than in the Ice Age despite the drier soils etc.  Thus if these present-vs-Ice Age predictions are correct, it would lend key credence to the similar future-vs-present predictions.  And, second, we indeed found that the model predictions of present-vs-Ice Age differences in rivers/lakes and plants look qualitatively correct.  Global compilations of fossil pollen preserved from the Ice Age indeed show that today's world is almost everywhere lusher/greener than the Ice Age world (with a few localized exceptions.)  And, global compilations of geologic data on Ice Age-era shorelines of modern lakes show that lakes (and thus the rivers and ground waters feeding them) are indeed higher today than in the Ice Age where the models project they should be higher, and lower today than in the Ice Age where the models project they should be lower.  Thus, the models are actually getting the right picture, both for plants and for rivers/lakes/groundwater.  So, therefore, the future computer projections of lusher, greener vegetation than today and variously higher/lower rivers and lakes than today, simultaneous with drier topsoils and drier formula-defined "drought", now look much more believable despite initially looking strange.
