<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the National Solar Observatory (NSO). Eight students per year will be paired with scientists at NSO's two locations at Kitt Peak, near Tucson, AZ; and Sacramento Peak, near Sunspot, NM. The students will conduct extensive research into cutting-edge topics in solar physics, including helioseismology, solar-stellar connections, the dynamics of solar activity, space weather, and studies of the solar corona. They will also take advantage of the full suite of NSO's telescopes in both locations. Critically, the research experiences on offer to the students will prepare a new generation of scientists to use the upcoming Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), which is currently under construction in Maui, HI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSO REU Site is deeply committed to ensuring that its cohort has broad representation from students at Tier 1 universities, as well from undergraduates at schools with limited research opportunities in STEM. Students will also be offered the opportunity to present their work at major national and international meetings, including the American Astronomical Society and the American Geophysical Union conferences.</AbstractNarration>
