<AbstractNarration>Statistical analysis of large datasets and complex models is in tremendous demand, with applications throughout the natural and social sciences, engineering, business, and biomedicine.  A major limitation in meeting this demand lies in current computational algorithms, which fail to scale adequately to large problems and data sets.  At the same time, advances in computer processor speeds have slowed dramatically, prompting a shift in the computer hardware industry towards parallelization.  As a result, the demands on Bayesian computational algorithms are increasing rapidly as the platforms underlying them are changing.  This work explores several promising new directions for producing highly efficient and scalable algorithms, and corresponding software tools, suitable for general-purpose Bayesian calculations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work involves new directions in Bayesian computation, including (1) true parallelization of general-purpose Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers, a class of algorithms traditionally viewed as "inherently serial," (2) algorithmic and theoretical advances in "static data" particle-based sequential Monte Carlo samplers which are highly parallelizable but currently fail on many complex high-dimensional posterior distributions, and (3) new tools for empirical monitoring of convergence of Monte Carlo samplers specifically designed for complex distributions and high-dimensional problem domains.  All facets of the work are directly motivated by applications of Bayesian statistics in chemical kinetics, structural bioinformatics, and systems biology.  This work also has immediate applicability to problems in broader areas of statistical physics, computer science, and molecular simulation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Major outcomes of this project include the production of theory, algorithms, and software for complex Monte Carlo simulation in challenging statistical inference problems arising with big data and large-scale scientific models.  Software for automatically detecting lack of convergence has been produced based on newly developed algorithms and made publicly available for the scientific community.  In addition, new Monte Carlo methods have been developed specifically for problems in the study of microbial growth, an area with direct applications to food safety monitoring as well as to basic scientific questions of understanding interactions between genetic and environmental factors and gene regulation.  Specialized Monte Carlo methods were also developed for application to statistical inference for understanding the evolution of proteins at the 3D structural level, enabling comparison of proteins much further distant in evolutionary time.  Finally, new methods were developed for automatic construction of Monte Carlo algorithms for the very challenging problems of statistical model selection and calculation of free energies, required for problems such as understanding and predicting the effects of small molecule drugs. Supporting these applied areas, several new algorithms and theoretical results were obtained to advance state of the art methods for Monte Carlo simulation in general.  At least 5 PhD students were partially supported and trained in interdisciplinary statistical and computational sciences, and numerous scientific publications and public seminars were produced to disseminate these results to the broader statistical and scientific communities.
