<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial funding for the Brookings Conference on Macroeconomics and the accompanying conference volume, the Brookings Papers on Macroeconomic Activity.  The conference is designed to bring together economic scientists to focus on the scientific analysis of economic policy issues.  These issues include the changing labor market, financial institutions, global economic policy, heath care, data improvement, inequality, and long run economic growth.  The papers presented at the conference are available online to the public.  They develop empirical analysis, employ a wide range of research methods, include real world institutions, and focus on relevance to policy.  The award promotes the national interest by improving the quality of the economics used in making policy decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BPEA's work not only adds to the body of economic literature but increases the contributions of economic research to our understanding of public policy.  This is in part due to a high degree of interaction among the organizers, researchers, discussants, and attendees.  Each researcher invited to present engages in an intensive process of three rounds of review, criticism, discussion and editing.  BPEA encourages scientists to apply the best knowledge of the profession to pressing policy issues and uses policy concerns to point the profession's way toward new science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The mission of Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (BPEA) is to provide rigorous and accessible analysis of important issues in macroeconomics, broadly defined. BPEA papers are presented and discussed at conferences held twice each year, and the papers and discussant remarks from each conference are published in the journal. The analysis is careful, usually empirical, takes real-world institutions seriously, and aims to be relevant to policy. The findings are described in a clear and accessible style to maximize their impact on the economics profession and economic policymaking.         BPEA publishes research in macroeconomics, broadly defined, with an emphasis on analysis that is empirical, focuses on real-world events and institutions, and is relevant to economic policy. The subject matter encompasses all fields of economic inquiry relevant to macroeconomics, including business cycles; development and long-term growth; the distribution of income, wealth, and opportunities; financial markets;  international capital and foreign exchange markets; fiscal and monetary policy; international trade; labor markets; the public sector and the welfare state; energy; the environment; political economy; regulation and industrial organization; education; health; and demography.         The topics covered in the 45 BPEA papers produced between 9/1/2015 and 8/31/2018 cover topics as wide-ranging as monetary policy, financial stability, immigration, public health, and European politics, to name just a few.  The papers are widely cited in later research by other scholars, and some in the most recent volumes (since 2015) have been cited over 200 times in the brief period since publication, according to Google Scholar.  Papers' citations increase over the years, and BPEA papers remain relevant for years after their publication, with several among the most widely referenced in the profession.
