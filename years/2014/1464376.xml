<AbstractNarration>This project contributes to our understanding of the relationship between people and technology by addressing two related core open problems in the field: enacting anonymity online and managing strong tie support in online communities.  Issues of privacy, anonymity, equality of participation, engagement, and social support are of interest in many online contexts.  This work extends the theory and practice of Social Computing and Human-Computer Interaction by contributing a rigorous empirical investigation of online anonymity and peer support practices in online communities for recovery from addiction and alcoholism. Additionally, this project will contribute to the design of new technologies to advance national health and welfare - addressing the "treatment gap" for addicts and alcoholics who seek recovery by leveraging novel technology to connect them with treatment and peer support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These topics will be investigated through four specific research activities. First, participatory observation will be conducted of an online community for recovering addicts and alcoholics. Second, data will be downloaded from this online community over the course of a year to develop a quantitative understanding of the evolution of the relationships and activities in this community over time. Third, in-depth interviews with members of this community will examine the role of leadership in these online health communities and the factors that contribute to strong social support online. Finally, participatory design workshops with recovering addicts and alcoholics will integrate, vet, and validate the findings of these empirical investigations and develop novel ecologically-valid technology prototypes for supporting recovery from addiction and alcoholism.</AbstractNarration>

Our work investigated how people turn to online communities to find social support while facing health conditions like substance use disorders or cancer. Based on our findings, we built novel computing technologies to help people get the support they need.  INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  To understand how people manage the tension between online self-disclosure and privacy, we carried out a series of studies which included in-depth interviews with more than 50 people with health conditions, online questionnaires with over 300 participants, and quantitative analysis of over 25,000 accounts in an online community for substance use disorders and over 85,000 accounts in an online community focusing on cancer.

Based on these findings, we worked with collaboration with people facing health conditions to design novel technologies to address challenges they viewed as critical to their recovery.

Overall, the main intellectual merit contributions of this body of work were in addressing fundamental empirical questions in social computing and health informatics, as well as leading to the design of novel systems and methods in computing.  BROADER IMPACTS:  Results from this project were disseminated through academic publications and presentations, including five full-length papers in the top venues on social computing and human information retrieval. The results and findings were also disseminated to a lay audience through a series of blog posts (on GroupLens.org and InTheRooms.com) and a webinar course aimed at medical practitioners.

Finally, we also integrated research findings and outcomes from this project into curriculum development activities, including an instructional unit on big data analysis in online health communities in a large undergraduate programming course and a design challenge for a capstone course in physical computing.  Overall, the main broader impact contributions centered on broad dissemination of outcomes to relevant communities and on building national STEM capacity and diversity through curricular integration and student training.
