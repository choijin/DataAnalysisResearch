<AbstractNarration>This award supports the annual summer CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions) workshop as well as planning activities by the award recipient and the CEDAR Steering Committee. The CEDAR Workshop and associated community services, such as maintenance of a participant database, wiki web pages, and community emails, will be managed by the UCAR Visiting Scientist Program (VSP). The workshop brings together the upper atmospheric research community to share information among students, researchers, and government agencies. The workshop promotes undergraduate and graduate exposure and participation in related sciences. The community web pages and email support also serve to tie the community together.&lt;br/&gt; CEDAR is a broad-based, community-initiated, upper atmospheric research program. The goal is to understand the behavior of atmospheric regions from the middle atmosphere upward through the thermosphere and ionosphere into the exosphere in terms of coupling, energetics, chemistry, and dynamics on regional and global scales.</AbstractNarration>
