<AbstractNarration>CBET-1402949&lt;br/&gt;Broido&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As microelectronic devices continue to shrink, heat dissipation is becoming an increasingly critical technology challenge.  High thermal conductivity materials are urgently needed to address this challenge.  The carbon-based crystals, diamond, graphite, graphene and carbon nanotubes have long been known to have by far the highest thermal conductivities, &amp;#954;, of any material.  Diamond, in particular, is widely used for passive cooling of electronics, but its synthetic fabrication suffers from slow growth rates, high cost, and low quality.  In spite of well-defined criteria to guide the search for new high &amp;#954; materials, little progress has been made over the years.  Using an accurate, first principles, theoretical approach, we have recently found that an unexpected material, boron arsenide should have exceptionally high thermal conductivity, comparable to that of diamond.  This surprising finding stems from fundamental material properties, some of which are not typically connected to prescriptions for high &amp;#954; in materials.  The objectives of this project will be to study in detail the thermal transport properties of boron arsenide, and to identify new high &amp;#954; materials using the materials search paradigm identified for boron arsenide.  This project will therefore help address the heat dissipation challenge and benefit society by aiding in the development of new high &amp;#954; materials. This will facilitate technological breakthroughs that may lead to the next generation of passive cooling devices for electronics, such as heat spreaders and heat sinks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research effort will implement a state-of-the-art, first principles thermal transport approach to provide fundamental understanding of our recent finding of exceptionally high &amp;#954; in boron arsenide and the proposed new paradigm for achieving high thermal conductivity in materials.  A central feature of this approach is that it has no adjustable parameters. Furthermore, it has already demonstrated excellent agreement with measured thermal conductivities for a wide range of materials, validating its predictive capability.  Efficient computational algorithms incorporating the novel material properties found in boron arsenide will be used to implement a broad search for a new class of novel high &amp;#954; materials.  This will facilitate the discovery of as yet unidentified high &amp;#954; materials.  Deeper understanding of the role of defects and insight into how to tune the desirable material properties to enhance &amp;#954; will also be investigated.  This project with provide important new insights into the nature of thermal conductivity in materials, give guidance to measurement efforts, and facilitate the design and of high &amp;#954; materials for thermal management applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As microelectronic devices continue to shrink, heat dissipation is becoming an increasingly critical technology challenge. Diamond has long been known to have by far the highest thermal conductivity (k) of any bulk material, but its synthetic fabrication is expensive and often yields poor quality crystals. In spite of well-defined criteria to guide the search for new high k materials, little progress has been made over the years.  This research effort has used a state-of-the-art, "first principles" computational approach to provide fundamental understanding of a novel paradigm recently proposed by us for achieving high k in materials and identifying specific materials that have ultrahigh k. The new paradigm combines conventional criteria for achieving high k with newly identified ones thereby introducing the possibility that previously unexpected combinations of elements from the periodic table may give materials with ultra-high k.  A central feature of this approach is that it has no adjustable parameters. Furthermore, it has already demonstrated excellent agreement with measured thermal conductivities for a wide range of materials, validating its predictive capability.  Building on our recent prediction of exceptionally high k in boron arsenide (BAs) using the identified high k criteria, this project has implemented a broad search for a new class of novel high k materials. This investigation has identified new criteria that must be met to achieve high k thereby refining the search space of candidate materials. Additionally, sensitivity of the k of BAs and other identified high k compounds to the presence of defects such as vacancies has been investigated, and the tuning of k with pressure in these unusual materials has also been examined.  Our recent prediction of ultra-high k in BAs and the new paradigm explaining its novel behavior open an exciting new path to search for high k materials. The insights gained from this project into the fundamental nature of thermal conductivity in solids will advance both theoretical and experimental thermal transport research efforts.

This combined with deeper understanding of the role of defects and insight into how to tune the desirable material properties to enhance k will provide important guidance to measurement efforts as well as facilitating the design and of new high k materials for thermal management applications.  In fact, recent measurements have found that BAs indeed has ultrahigh k validating our prediction and supporting the new paradigm for identifying high k materials.
