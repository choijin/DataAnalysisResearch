<AbstractNarration>Science-based design of new materials for mechanical applications in aerospace, transportation, tooling, energy and biomedical industries is crucial to continued American economic competitiveness. Breakthrough technologies and innovative applications are often enabled by new materials science; however, the timeline from concept to commerce, based on past approaches, has been too long. Recent advances in computational modeling science and material manufacturing techniques provide new avenues for discovering, designing and commercializing new materials at a greatly accelerated pace. This Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) collaborative research award supports fundamental research to enable such discoveries in multiple material classes. The basic approach is the generation of fundamental materials data regarding the relationship between chemical composition and mechanical behavior, using a technologically important material system, titanium-boron, as a basis. The research involves an integrated effort between academia and industry. It comprises collaborative computational modeling and discovery, rapid synthesis and analysis of new material properties, product design, development and testing, as well as the training of future engineers in advanced manufacturing settings provided by the industry partners.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research is on the development of the CALPHAD-type thermodynamic and phase data for ternary Ti-B-X (X=Fe/Mo/Nb) materials, and on first-principles modeling and mechanical property data development for the key phases of these materials' microstructures. This material system is uniquely versatile, and uncovering its governing properties and data will enable science-driven material design spanning the classes of metal-matrix composites, cermets and monolithic ceramics. Novel material designs will be created using recent advances in computational techniques that model material behavior on the scale of the atoms and their crystal lattice structures. Using the models to evaluate multiple virtual material designs, the research will rapidly optimize boride phase compositions for hardness, strength and wear resistance, and that of the beta-Ti metal phase for ductility and toughness, by computing predictions of the solute partitioning levels and the elastic slip and deformation properties. The experiments will validate the models and the data set by fully demonstrating their utility through rapid synthesis and characterization of multiple compositions of boride ceramics, cermets and metal-boride composites. The characterization will span three length scales: 1) the phase-scale, by nano-indentation, 2) the specimen-scale, by tensile, flexure and fracture toughness testing, and 3) the component-scale, by application-centered testing. A mechanical property database for each class of materials will be launched, whereby the data on borides (e.g., hardness, modulus and strength of phases as functions of composition) and other properties will be disseminated. The GOALI component includes student-driven Research-in-Industry, Industry-in-Academia, and timely evaluations by an Industry Advisory Panel formed to support this research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Since inception, this materials design project pursued iterative design, processing and characterization to gather the genomic data for specific material designs based on ternary titanium alloys containing multiple alloying elements. Specifically, the research undertook computational design, electric-field-activated synthesis, and application-specific characterization of alloy compositions in three material classes (ceramic, cermet and metal-matrix composite) emerging from the genomic system of titanium containing boron, iron and molybdenum as components. Core research themes, which simultaneously benefit these distinct material classes were focused, which led to a much greater impact on material design.</p> <p>First, the project developed a computational modeling approach for the titanium alloy design using the CALPHAD approach. An extensive &nbsp;thermodynamic database has been created exclusively for this project. On the basis of the assembled database, the phase diagram modeling efforts involved calculations of various ternary phase diagrams of titanium with B, Fe, Mo and Mn, at various temperatures of interest. In particular, high temperature phase diagrams, which outline complex phase equilibria, have been constructed to assist in the manufacturing of the materials designed here.

Alloy design focusing on obtaining a high volume fraction TiB ceramic embedded in a beta titanium matrix, was successfully completed by extensive CALPHAD modeling. The phase diagram constructions to identify optimum processing temperature, microstructure evaluations, and measurements of strength and toughness have been completed. This represents successful conclusion of a multiyear effort to successfully design and produce a high strength and high toughness ceramic material. A new composition of titanium boride rich ceramic has been discovered by controlling the alloying elements to implement a residual metallic ductile beta phase in the microstructure. Additionally, the discovery of new alloy composition basis in the system, Ti-B-Fe-Mo-Al, also helped to significantly improve the fracture toughness of the TiB cermet and metal-matrix composite was also realized. This material was synthesized in very large sizes (typically 60 mm diameter and 10 mm thickness) by sintering under electric field induced heating and with pressure. Simultaneously, in the interest of finding scientific underlying principles, this project has also completed the analysis of kinetics versus densification during the rapid processing of the TiB based ceramic, thus providing a mechanistic understanding of microstructure formation.

This effort yielded cermets with high strength and toughness. An extensive effort to increase the toughness of beta phase titanium with TiB cermet, by controlling the composition of the beta phase, was completed. Microstructure versus composition factors that control toughness in these cermets have been determined by fractography.
