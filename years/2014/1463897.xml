<AbstractNarration>One of the most fundamental objects in mathematics is the "group," a set with a rule analogous to multiplication for combining elements of the set.  Groups can be viewed as precise ways to capture the symmetries of sets, shapes, and other mathematical objects. The last decade has seen an explosion of activity that can be viewed through the lens of what is called Super Approximation. Very roughly speaking, this refers to the idea that walking around randomly on the points of a group mixes things up very rapidly. The growth of this subject was swiftly followed by a variety of applications to geometry, groups, and number theory. The striking symbiosis of the resultant collection of problems and fields has inspired this team of researchers to unify and more deeply connect these and related themes of research, in order to make further advances. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigators, as well as their postdocs and students, will work on a variety of projects concerned with the group theoretic, geometric, and number theoretic aspects of Super Approximation. Exponential sums and "Affine Sieve" methods will be developed further to "Local-Global" settings, including attacks on McMullen's Arithmetic Chaos Conjecture and Zaremba's Conjecture. The PIs will furthermore explore the use of privileged circle and sphere packings to understand the construction of trace (and invariant trace) fields for hyperbolic manifolds, a long-standing and almost completely untouched aspect of the theory. Moreover, the PIs will investigate the construction of interesting subgroups of arithmetic lattices via geometric deformations, as well as study problems in combinatorics and computer science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Intellectual Merit: The PI along with the Co-PI's were involved in a   multi-faceted approach to understanding groups of symmetries called   "thin groups". These arise naturally from many different mathematical   perspectives and different techniques from geometry, topology, number   theory, and analysis can be brought to bear to try to unravel their   mysteries. The PI has made some significant progress on these topics   over the course of the grant, as well as proving other important   results in areas related to the main theme of the grant, e.g. proving "first order rigidity" for high rank arithmetic groups; a work which opens the door for more connections between the topic of the grant and model theory.   Broader Impact: The PI along with Co-PI's have been engaged in   graduate student training, and postdoc advising over the course of the   grant. There have been 2 major conference organized over the course of   the grant, and this has given the PI and Co-PI's further opportunites   to educate and to help train students and postdocs in topics related   to these thin groups.  Furthermore, the end of the grant culminated in   a well-received article in the Notices of the AMS about some aspects   of these thin groups and what makes them so interesting and   challenging to study.  Plans for further conferences and workshops   that build on what was achieved over the course of the grant are   already in the works.
