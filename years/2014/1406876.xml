<AbstractNarration>Genetic studies across species frequently uncover conflicting patterns between the nuclear and organellar (including mitochondria) genomes. Contrasting patterns of genomic divergence can potentially be explained by differences related to inheritance, gene flow, and mutation rate, but it is unknown how co-evolutionary interactions between these genomes influence genetic divergence. Using Dusky Salamanders and revolutionary DNA sequencing technologies, evolutionary patterns of divergence will be compared between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, with a focus on nuclear genes that function within the mitochondrion. Dusky salamanders are an excellent system for this project because they are regionally diverse in eastern North America and have demonstrated gene flow across species boundaries. These criteria, and the growing genetic resources available for salamanders, make them an excellent system to test for conflicting evolutionary patterns between nuclear and nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will contribute toward graduate student training in the use of rapidly changing and advancing genetic technologies and help preparations for an academic career through peer-reviewed research and undergraduate mentorship. Results from this study will provide new insights into how researchers should use genomic data to reconstruct the Tree of Life, and will contribute to an understanding of the processes that influence genetic divergence and speciation.</AbstractNarration>
