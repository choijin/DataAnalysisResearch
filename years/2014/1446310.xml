<AbstractNarration>Reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) have long been associated with oxidative stress, intracellular signaling, and deleterious effects in biological systems.  However, a large part of the evolution that led to life as we know it and the conservation of mechanisms across species occurred in anoxic and sulfidic environments.  Evidence suggests that 'antioxidant pathways' were developed long before the appearance of atmospheric oxygen.  Furthermore, many methods for measuring ROS are more sensitive to reactive sulfide species (RSS), which are chemically more reactive and biologically more versatile signaling molecules than ROS.  The proposed research examines a novel hypothesis that RSS, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and polysulfides (H2Sn, n=2-7) are involved in intracellular signaling, and in many instances RSS not ROS are the true endogenous signals and may contribute to oxidative stress. It is also proposed reactive nitrogen species (RNS), nitric oxide (NO-) and nitrite (NO2-) were primordial oxygen acceptors and they interact with RSS in intracellular signaling. This research will offer an alternative to the long-standing and entrenched paradigm that ROS mediate intracellular signaling and oxidative stress. It will show that RSS are highly reactive and versatile signaling molecules in their own right and that many of the well-studied physiological and pathological effects of ROS can be attributed to RSS. The research could open up new fields of intracellular signaling and redox homeostasis, many of which will be applicable in across biology disciplines and could even have considerable therapeutic value. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will: examine the redox chemistry of RSS; determine the contribution of RSS to redox signaling in cells; and test whether H2S2 may be mistaken for H2O2 by some analytical procedures. Aim 1 will use roGFP to monitor redox activity of RSS and how this is affected by free metals, antioxidant enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase, etc) and heme proteins (hemin, hemoglobin, myoglobin). These studies will be done in normoxia, hypoxia and physiological pO2's, over a range of physiological pH, and in the presence and absence of primordial electron acceptors RNS. Sensitive H2S, O2 and NO amperometric electrodes will be employed to monitor specific RSS reactions and reactions between ROS, RSS and RNS to establish stoichiometric relationships. Aim 2 will examine the specific roles enzymes associated with RSS biosynthesis by inhibition with competitive inhibitors and siRNA. Aim 2 will also examine the effects of exogenous RSS and mitochondrial-targeted H2S releasing drugs on cellular compartmental redox state. Aim 3 will test whether 'specific' ROS assays can distinguish between ROS and RSS.  The PI's laboratory has long supported high school, undergraduate, and graduate training and has especially fostered a learning environment for minorities and under-represented groups. This project will provide the resources for this training to continue. Results from the studies will be distributed through presentations at scientific meetings and  through peer-reviewed journal publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The terms "oxidants" and "antioxidants" are ingrained in our culture as molecules that are either pathological (the former) or beneficial (the latter).  Oxidants are variations of reactive oxygen species (ROS), molecules that are reduced forms of oxygen (minus one or more electrons).  Most notably these are superoxide and peroxide and these are reportedly produced as a part of normal metabolism.  Antioxidants are often ingested as either synthetic or dietary (i.e., blueberries) supplements to offset the effects of excessive ROS.  However, despite extensive epidemiological studies in humans, there is no evidence that these supplements have any health benefits, whereas a number of adverse effects have been noted.The work performed during this NSF Grant examined an alternative hypothesis, reactive sulfide species (RSS), not ROS are more biologically relevant mediators of oxidant/antioxidant activity and the funded research has provided considerable evidence to support this. 1) RSS and ROS are chemically similar, superoxide is identical to supersulfide and peroxide is identical to persulfide (Fig. 1). 2) RSS interact with the same biological targets as ROS.  3) The five most commonly employed assay methods for ROS also detect RSS and the "gold standard" method is over two hundred times more sensitive to RSS than it is to ROS.  RSS are produced from protein metabolism in humans at a rate that is equivalent to the rate of ROS production and the latter may considerably over estimated due to the sensitivity of the methods used (see 3, above).  4) Life began in a world without oxygen 3.8 billion years ago (bya) and a strong case can be made for RSS in the origin of life and the subsequent 3.2 billion years of evolution.  Present day levels of oxygen appeared only 0.6 bya and this has been touted as a crucial time for life as it had to develop antioxidant strategies to survive. Two antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) to remove superoxide and catalase to remove peroxide, are well accepted to have served these functions.  However, both enzymes appear to have evolved nearly 3 billion years earlier (Fig. 2) and research from this grant has shown that both effectively metabolize RSS.  5) Additional work from this Grant has also shown that RSS metabolism is favored over ROS metabolism in lower, and more physiological levels of oxygen.  These low-oxygen conditions are similar to early life and to conditions inside multicellular animals but they are unlike the supraphysiological levels of oxygen (21% O2) commonly employed in tissue culture or routine biochemical experiments.  Collectively, the research supported by this Grant challenges the ROS oxidant/antioxidant paradigm and suggests that a greater appreciation of the physiology and pathophysiology of RSS is needed to understand the role of these molecules in health and disease and to develop more appropriate therapeutic strategies in the future.  The graduate, undergraduate and high school students, including minorities and women whose research was funded by this NSF grant are now trained to continue this quest.
