<AbstractNarration>For many years researchers inspired by the idea of natural selection have experimented with computer programs called evolutionary algorithms.  These algorithms simulate a kind of artificial breeding process in which a set of candidates generated by the computer are evaluated for their ability to perform a desired task.  The best performers are then allowed to reproduce with slight variation to form a new and hopefully improved generation.  In recent years evolutionary algorithms have exhibited the ability to evolve brain-like structures called artificial neural networks in an approach called neuroevolution.  These evolved networks perform tasks often critical to technological progress and artificial intelligence like controlling robots or recognizing images.    However, unlike evolution in nature, which yields dramatic changes over hundreds of thousands of generations, evolutionary algorithms have rarely been run for more than a few thousand.   This project for the first time is applying new evolutionary techniques that reward continual novelty and diversification to experiments evolving over hundreds of thousands of generations, on the scale of nature.  The driving hypothesis is that modern evolutionary algorithms run on this scale can yield robotic behaviors, agent morphologies, and decision-making capabilities significantly beyond the current state of the art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To investigate long-term evolution in practice, artificial neural networks are being evolved in a variety of domains through new kinds of novelty-driven neuroevolution algorithms designed to avoid the convergence seen in typical evolutionary experiments.  Because this new class of algorithms tends to avoid convergence, the long-term dynamics and ultimate potential for discovery of such algorithms over vast time scales (i.e. hundreds of thousands of generations) is almost entirely unknown.  The idea of running neuroevolution at unprecedented timescales mirrors recent results in related areas like deep learning where massive computation has proven capable of fundamentally altering the kinds of problems that can be solved.  Because evolutionary runs over hundreds of thousands of generations yield enormous troves of evolutionary data, an important component of the project is the development visualization techniques for exploring and characterizing the results of such runs.   The project overall is producing a new set of tools, a new set of evolved capabilities for autonomous control and decision-making, and an increased understanding of the implications of big data and big computation for simulated evolution in computers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Evolutionary computation is a research area within machine learning that draws its inspiration from the process of evolution in nature.  The observation that natural evolution has produced all of life on Earth, including such achievements as photosynthesis, the flight of birds, and even the human brain, motivates the search for computer algorithms with similar creative potential.  However, for the most part, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have not hisotircally offered the same kind of boundless innovation and diversification as seen in nature.  Rather, these algorithms tend to pursue a single objective or limited set of objectives and either get stuck or (like other algorithms in machine learning) converge once they are near the intended solutions, leaving no more room for further exploration and discovery.  The question addressed in this project is whether indeed EAs can be made more like nature in the sense that they might produce more interesting and diverse results the longer they are run. This question is important not only because such a dynamic would be powerful and useful in its own right, but because it would allow us to take full advantage of large-scale computation.  That is, ideally, a search algorithm would yield better results the more computation is made available; Yet with algorithms that quickly converge to optima, the need for computation simply ends.  Evolution on Earth seems different: the longer it runs, the most fantastic and diverse its results seem to become.  Even after more than a billion years it continues to innovate and diverge.  To capture the opportunity to align evolutionary computation with the increasing computational resources available today, the project focused on two cutting-edge types of EAs, more in the spirit of nature than optimization: (1) quality diversity (QD) algorithms and (2) open-ended evolution.  The idea in QD algorithms is to search in a single run for a diverse set of solutions, where each solution is as high quality as possible for its niche.  For exampe, a QD algorithm might discover a diverse set of effective walking gaits, each suited to a different robot morphology.  QD algorithms more closely capture the spirit of natural evolution in the sense that nature also found a diverse set of strategies, all optimized for their individual niches.  Open-ended evolution, on the other hand, focuses on evolutionary processes that innovate indefinitely and without bound.  They have proven notoriously difficult to implement in practice, though natural evolution itself appears open-ended.  The primary intellectual merit of the project was to show that indeed both kinds of algorithms can benefit from large-scale computation, and to contribute major algorithmic advances for both kinds of algorithms, including the insight that QD algorithms can themselves exhibit open-ended properties.  A major study from this project on QD appeared in Frontiers in Robotics and AI journal and already has 51 citations (Google Scholar).  It helped to establish best practices and algorithmic optimizations for QD, and has become already a primary referene for this growing new research area.  An extensive separate study of open-endedness was completed in an artificial life world called Chromaria, which introduced also four hypothesized necessary conditions for open-endedness, as well as an algorithm and environment for meeting those conditions, which were tested in publications for their contribution to open-ended dynmics.  Finally, another domain called VoxelBuild was introduced, where evolving controllers can build arbitrary structures out of bricks.  By running QD in VoxelBuild, it was possible to show that dramatic new innovations in building strategies and styles (see images) were possible to discover in a signle run.  Overall, the main contributions then are new algorithms with both practical and scienticic implications, as well as large-scale studies and hypotheses on open-endedness.  The result is a new tier of EAs that take advantage of massive computation and open the door to genuinely unique kinds of result that require QD or open-ended algorithms.  An important broader impact of the project was to bring in underrepresented groups to computer science and machine learning as undergraduates.  This strategy culminated in a paper with undergraduate coauthors at an internatioal conference. The project's results also offer a new window into evolution that can feed insight back into biology as well, and they offer a glimpse of novel creative applications of large-scale machine learning for the future that go beyond the typical practice of modern machine learning.
