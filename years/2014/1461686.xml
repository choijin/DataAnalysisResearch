<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the rapid globalization of emergent economic markets over the last fifteen years. The research will examine both the primary drivers of this process and the impacts on local economies, communities and individuals. The project complements and extends existing scholarship on globalization in three key ways. First, the project moves beyond a traditional focus on major global north corporations as key economic drivers of globalization to analyze the operations of small to mid-sized manufacturers, traders, and consumers based in the global south. Second, the project focuses on emerging ties between countries that are largely independent of Western Europe and North America. Third, the project develops an innovative and transferable methodological framework for analyzing the ties between transnational macro economic and political processes and everyday experiences, actions and reactions. Project results will be disseminated in field site locations in the Gulf and East Africa, and in the US. These findings may be used in local, regional and international government economic policy planning, by actors in the small, mid-sized and larger private sector, and by the wider public. The project may thus support future development of the entrepreneurial sector in these locales, promoting partnerships between academia and industry and improving socio-economic well being. The project also develops and strengthens ties between educational establishments, students and faculty based in the US, the Gulf Region and East Africa, promoting US-International institutional collaboration. The research engages US-based minority undergraduate and graduate students currently underrepresented in STEM disciplines in collaborative research and co-authorship, enhancing efforts to diversify geographical education and research. Given the grounded focus of the project, it also has potential to promote increased public engagement in the geographical sciences and draw minorities and women into the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three objectives: 1. to examine the spatial, socio-cultural, economic and ideological transformations in and drivers of African-Middle Eastern ties over the last 15 years; 2. to interrogate the poorly understood "social life" of commodities globally traded outside of Western Europe and North America, including the way these new circuits of global connection are shaped by varied power relations; and 3. to better understand the social-cultural and economic impacts of heightened market integration on local and regional economic markets, communities and individuals. An innovative transnational, relational methodology is utilized in this project. This brings feminist and postcolonial perspectives to bear on traditional commodity chain analyses in economic geography, revealing macro-micro power-laden operations of globalization that are often overlooked. Through a mixture of interviews, observation, surveys, and both visual-textual and material object-based analysis, and an empirical focus on Dubai and Uganda, key sites of African-Gulf connection, the project will shed new light on the significant role of the global south in contemporary processes of globalization.</AbstractNarration>

In the wake of rapidly globalized disease pathways and terrorist networks it is of the greatest imperative to interrogate the operations of globalization in seemingly peripheral and poorly understood world regions. So too is it vital to identify, understand, and support examples of and potentials for vibrant innovation and entrepreneurialism. Yet, despite a long history of sub-Saharan African global integration and its dramatic global repositioning over the last 20 years, research on globalization in Africa and shaped by African peoples remains rare. This research responds via a study of one insightful indicator and driver of globalization: The Gulf-East African beauty trade.</p> <p><strong>Project Overview</strong></p> <p>The research examines how economic liberalization in East Africa, accelerating over the last 15 years, has heightened market integration and the global flows of people, products and ideas into and out of the region. The research objectives are as follows: 1. to examine the spatial, socio-cultural, economic and ideological nature of and transformations in sub-Saharan African-Middle Eastern ties. 2<strong>.</strong><em> </em>to interrogate the ?social life? of commodities amidst these reconfigured ties, including the experiences of those involved in its trade, their varied mobilities, and how varied power-relations underpin these new circuits of global connection. Last, 3:<em> </em>to understand how manufacturers, designers and consumers in East Africa are affected by and themselves transforming, the nature of globalization in the region. <em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p><strong>Methods&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The project, spanning three years, integrated extensive qualitative research including interviews and survey work with hundreds of traders, stylists, consumers and manufacturers involved in the trade; participant observation at key industry events, market centers, and manufacturing locations; and visual and textual analysis of over 20 years of fashion media coverage. This was complemented with quantitative secondary data collection and retailing mapping in key retail and wholesale locations in the Gulf and East Africa.</p> <p><strong>Findings</strong></p> <p>Our research findings document the everyday impacts, of global economic and political shifts on individuals and urban spaces of East Africa, demonstrating how these impacts vary by class and gender status. These include: market displacement, dramatic and varied shifts in product source, quality, price; local manufacturing decline in some sectors, and economic growth in others; new contestations around imported products powerfully shaped by racial, gender and nationalist norms; and the emergence of new spatial strategies including concerning the mobilities of economic trade. We show that, while the neighboring region of the Gulf powerfully shapes this process - as a site of conspicuous consumption and trend setting, and as a logistically significant trade hub - the innovation, negotiation and spatial strategizing of largely small and mid-scale African traders is key. &nbsp;In turn, while the region has seen dramatic shifts in the last 15-20 years, we identify long standing colonially-rooted influences that have continued, if transformed, legacies for present-day trading and consumption practices.</p> <p><strong>Research products</strong></p> <p>Completed and in-progress products emerging from this research project include: a series peer-reviewed academic publications and book chapters, co-authored with US and Ugandan undergraduate and graduate students and research collaborators (7 submitted/ accepted/ forthcoming and/or published, with 4 plus in preparation); methodological showcasing of creative GIS mapping techniques outlined in academic publications and a series of conference and student workshops; support for academic research amongst underrepresented female and minority undergraduate and graduate geography students; the formation of a nationally and internationally networked geographic research group supporting underrepresented scholars; the creation of a digital archive of over 20 years of fashion coverage, in partnership with Makerere University, Uganda.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p> <p>The broader impacts of the study include: methodological and conceptual innovation in spatializing the drivers and impacts of the global economy; promoting diversity with geographically oriented research and education; promoting institutional development and networks for research and education between the US, UAE and Uganda; increased public engagement in the geographical sciences; and the promotion of partnerships between academia and industry with benefits for individuals in society.</p> <p>The project funding directly fostered conceptual and methodological innovation and the support of scholar researchers underrepresented in STEM fields: namely one faculty, one graduate student, and three research collaborators in Uganda. However, it laid the foundations for far wider reaching beneficial impacts. For example, NSF support for the creation of our transnational research group, based at UT-Austin, that laid the foundations for us to support a far larger community of underrepresented graduate and undergraduates to pursue scientific inquiry in the US and Uganda.</p> <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/04/2019<br>      Modified by: Caroline&nbsp;Faria</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461686/1461686_10361966_1549298269331_NSF_outcomes(research_collective_home)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461686/1461686_10361966_1549298269331_NSF_outcomes(research_collective_home)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Website Home: The Feminist Geography Research Collective"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461686/1461686_10361966_1549298269331_NSF_outcomes(research_collective_home)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Website Home: The Feminist Geography Research Collective"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">From 2016-2018 we grew to include a four faculty and over ten undergraduate and graduate students.
