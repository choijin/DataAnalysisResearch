<AbstractNarration>In order to address the national need for the U.S. to remain globally competitive in Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines, an infusion of an untapped pool of talented, creative, and intelligent students historically underrepresented in STEM who earn Ph.Ds. is needed.  Jackson State University (JSU), a Historically Black University (HBCU), has a strong track record for preparing primarily African American graduate students in chemistry, mathematics, biology, environmental science, computer science, and engineering for STEM doctoral degrees. JSU's BD program to date has produced 20 Ph.D. graduates from underrepresented groups and 94 who were admitted into doctoral programs. Through their program, JSU has and will provide well-qualified and diverse faculty members for U.S. universities and colleges, as well as impact the number of scientists, mathematicians, and engineers holding the doctorate and entering the workforce.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jackson State University will execute a BD program that is based upon challenging and rich research and academic experiences, the development and implementation of professional long term goals and objectives, the utilization of STEM summer research internships at targeted Ph.D. program institutions, and international research experiences.  The objectives of their BD program fall into four categories: Research and Academics, Enrichment Activities, National and International Partnerships, and Evaluation and Student Tracking. These activities along with sufficient financial support from the LSAMP program, rigorous curricula, and committed mentoring will allow their BD program to continue to accelerate and increase the quality and number of students historically underrepresented in STEM entering the Ph.D. pipeline.</AbstractNarration>

The program seeks to remove students' hesitancy about entering graduate school and fears of creating financial indebtedness.   To date 45 PhD?s have been produced by the Mississippi alliance BD program and many more students are in the pipeline.     Cohort 1- 13 have proven to be very committed to completing the requirements of the program and to pursuing their terminal degrees.     ACCOMPLISHMENTS to DATE     Table 1:  Impact of BD Program for Cohorts 1-13        Past performance of the LSMAMP BD signifies its success in producing students who attain PhDs and the program?s potential to continue to achieve this goal.
