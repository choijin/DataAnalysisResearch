<AbstractNarration>This study uses in-depth interviews with more than 500 victims involved in cases before the International Criminal Court (ICC) to understand victims' experiences participating in trials for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. When established in 2002, the International Criminal Court was hailed as a new type of international court, one that would promote justice for victims as well as punishing perpetrators. Yet no studies have examined why victims apply to participate, how they view participation programs, or what they hope to achieve through their participation. This research will fill that gap by evaluating participation models used in different criminal cases.  It will contribute to a growing literature on the importance of procedural fairness and respect for court participants and their broader communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will be completed in three phases: (1) interviews with key ICC staff and judges in The Hague, as well as an examination of motions and rulings pertaining to victim participation; (2) interviews with victim participants; their legal counsel; and ICC field staff in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, and Uganda; and (3) report writing, publication, and presentation of findings to the Court and victims' communities. Fieldwork for the study will be conducted in English, French, and a number of local languages, and researchers will use an intentional sampling method to include members from affected communities across the cases, including members of differing ethnic groups, and both men and women. By documenting for the first time the lived experiences of victims' participating in trials at the International Criminal Court, the study will provide insight into the social-psychological dynamics of victim participation in order to strengthen the functioning of the Court.</AbstractNarration>

Victims represented a wide spectrum of people affected by war crimes or crimes against humanity, including widows, child soldiers, and survivors of sexual violence. In addition, we interviewed 41 ICC staff members, legal representatives, and victimsÆ advocates to understand the evolution of the victim participation at the ICC. Interviews were conducted in The Hague (N=27), Uganda (N=151), Democratic Republic of Congo (N=154), Kenya (N=204), and C&ocirc;te dÆIvoire (N=127). Interviews were confidential and varied in length from twenty minutes to two hours.  Imperfect information about affected communities and victim applicants did not make random sampling possible, but we recruited victim participants roughly in proportion to their appearance in the victim population by geography, ethnic affiliation, ICC case affiliation, applicant status, age cohorts, and sex.   Summary of Findings  Most victim participants have insufficient knowledge to make informed decisions about their participation in ICC cases. RespondentsÆ understanding of the ICCÆs mandate, basic structure, and most important rules varied depending on location. Respondents in rural areas tended to have far less knowledge of or information about the ICC than respondents in urban communities. Few knew the location of the courtÆs headquarters, and many believed the ICC was an aid organization rather than a criminal court.

For example, victim participants in Abidjan, C&ocirc;te dÆIvoire, had a good understanding of the ICC and wanted to participate in legal proceedings.

Of the hundreds of ICC victim participants interviewed for this study, few said that they wanted to participate in person in trials at The Hague, and some felt that such exposure could lead to reprisals. The overwhelming majority reported that they were pleased to participate through intermediaries or their legal representatives who could convey their stories to the court. Even among victim participants motivated by the promise of criminal convictions, few said they needed to appear at trial to confront the accused.  Victim partici...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
