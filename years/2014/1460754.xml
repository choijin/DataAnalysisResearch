<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL PART:  Physics REU (research experience for undergraduates) at the University of Arkansas will be focused on experimental and theoretical projects in nano-materials and condensed matter, soft matter and biophysics, photonics, lasers and quantum optics.  It builds upon the department's educational environment, which is highly supportive of undergraduate research as evidenced by the success of its majors in nationally competitive research-based awards and highly ranked graduate programs.  REU participants, selected from diverse groups including women and minorities, will experience some of the basic concepts central to undergraduate physics education come alive, discover their own creativity, and acquire skills and practices essential to scientific problem solving.  They will also participate in a variety of professional development activities, including:  weekly lectures and seminars, training on library usage, communications and scientific writing skills, a one-hour scientific ethics course, and social/cultural activities with other REU groups and the Carver program for minorities at the University.  These will help them improve their communication skills, develop skills for working in a collaborative environment, and recognize the value of different points of view.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL PART:  REU participants will work on carefully chosen research projects on topics of current interest such as properties of nano-materials, STM of twisted bilayer graphene, solid-state nano-pore fabrication for detection of DNA, light driven photon pumps, light-matter interaction, plasmonic nanostructures, lasers and quantum optics, and statistical and nonlinear physics of extremophiles and the brain.  The department has strong research activities in each of these areas and infrastructure to support graduate and undergraduate research and education.  Through engagement with their research projects for ten weeks, the participants will leave having experienced the creative process involved in scientific research starting from the formulation of a problem to its solution, the ups and downs, and the eventual thrill of a new discovery.  This experience will ignite a spark of creativity and enthusiasm for pursuing graduate education and/or careers in science and technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The physics research experience for undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Arkansas provided 10-week summer research experience in experimental and theoretical projects in biophysics, nanomaterials, computational condensed matter physics (NCM), lasers, quantum optics, and photonics. The physics department has strong research program in each of these areas with well-equipped labs and the academic environment in the department is highly supportive of undergraduate research. During this NSF-REU (2015-2018), a diverse group of 38 REU students participated in the REU experience. Overall, the students came from nearly all parts of the country, attending 31 schools in 15 different states. 68% of the students came from schools with limited or no infrastructure to support research and 3 from schools that do not offer physics major. The program was successful in recruiting from its primary target populations that included females and under-represented minority (URM) groups primarily from undergraduate institutions in the Ozark region.  More than half (53%) were women [much higher than the national average of 20%], 15% [compared to the national average10%] were from URM groups and 74% came from the states in the Ozark region.   Each participant acquired experimental, theoretical, and computational problem-solving skills depending on their research projects from their faculty mentors and/or members of their research group. In particular, they learned how to handle lasers, optics, operate a scanning tunneling microscope, confocal microscopes, super-computer programing, prepare and handle biological samples, learned various aspects of conducting research, data acquisition and analysis, writing a research paper, and presenting their research.   Despite their varied backgrounds, all students from this program completed their REU projects with enthusiasm for scientific research, and gained a sense of confidence of their abilities to succeed in a Ph.D. program. The REU participants coauthored 11 publications (with a few still in preparation) and presented 25 papers at national, international, or regional conferences. This is a remarkable achievement considering that most of the students had very little or no prior research experience. At the end of the REU, each REU students submitted a research paper based on their findings and presented their work in a conference like setting.  The students thus leave with a poster that many may choose to display at their home institutions and with slides for an oral presentation, which have the potential to inspire another group of undergraduates to participate in research. Based on the alumni survey response 83% had completed their BS degree, 69% of graduated REU alumni are going to graduate schools, and 17.2% have found jobs in STEM areas. 5 REU alumni chose the University of Arkansas for their graduate studies.   In addition to working on theirs research projects, the students participated in activities and workshops designed to help them gain professional skills to succeed in STEM careers. Weekly research seminars/lab tours by the physics faculty and workshops exposed the students to other research areas and career opportunities in physics and related disciplines. Ethics class provided interaction and discussion with a diverse group of participants and improved their communication skills. Dallas field trip provided valuable experience of touring cutting edge high-tech industrial manufacturing, and research and development facilities at Globitech, Zyvex, and Texas Instruments RFAB facility.   The outcome of many projects also helped in strengthening research proposals by the participating faculty mentors.

All REUs had the same start date and the participants of each were housed in the same dorm. This added academic diversity to an already diverse group with which the physics REU students had the opportunity to interact.
