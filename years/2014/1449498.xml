<AbstractNarration>This proposal provides funding for the second GREPSEC: Underrepresented Groups in Security Research workshop, which will be affiliated with the annual IEEE Symposium on Research in Security &amp; Privacy, in May 2015, in San Jose CA.  The first event, held in May 2013, attracted 50 participants, two-thirds of them students, and almost all from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;USC/ISI will organize a day-and-a-half-long workshop for women and underrepresented minorities in computer security and privacy. The workshop will be held May 16-17, 2015. This is the weekend before the IEEE Computer Society's Security and Privacy Symposium, the premier conference in security, and this workshop will be co-located in San Jose, California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad goal of the workshop is to increase the number of women and underrepresented minorities in computer security research. Security is a wide field, encompassing network security, operating system security, language-based security, forensics, privacy, as well as legal and policy issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the organizers is to encourage Ph.D. students who are female and from underrepresented groups to choose security as their field of specialization. Their approach is to show the wide range of problems within the field and how women and underrepresented groups are working towards solving those problems.</AbstractNarration>
