<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the period of 8/14 through 5/17, the PI was supported by the NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship grant DMS-1402370 entitled "Flexibility and Rigidity of Isometric Embeddings" with a total award of $150,000.  The project has resulted in seven research papers including one working paper, six papers that have been accepted or published in highly selective peer-reviewed mathematical journals, and one published book.  The project has also involved the conducting of seminars and mini-courses for the training of graduate students and other researchers in the new mathematical methods developed by the PI and other researchers in the field.  The work of the PI during the supported period has generated breakthrough results in the study of low regularity solutions to the equations of fluid dynamics.  The study of these solutions is motivated not only by the need within mathematics to sharpen the understanding of high-frequency phenomena in the field of nonlinear partial differential equations, but also by needs within physics and engineering applications to obtain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the occurrence of turbulence in fluid motion.  One of the main results of the project provides an answer to a fundamental question that was first brought forth through the work of renowned physicist and chemist Lars Onsager in 1949.  The question is whether it is mathematically possible in the absence of internal friction for the kinetic energy in a fluid to decrease in accordance with the scaling laws expected in the theory of turbulence.  The work of the PI on the incompressible Euler equations has confirmed that such variations in kinetic energy are indeed mathematically possible for any scaling law that cannot exceed but can be arbitrarily close to the law expected in turbulence theory.  The work of the PI has also generated further insights into the internal quantitative and geometric structure that these solutions to the incompressible Euler equations possess, and has shown moreover how similar questions can be approached for a broad family of equations in fluid dynamics.  The results of the project have also greatly advanced the understanding of an important flexibility phenomenon known as the ``h-Principle??, which was first observed in the context of the isometric embedding equations of differential geometry through the work of John Nash, but which has turned out to play an important role in the study of low regularity solutions of fluid dynamics as well.
