<AbstractNarration>MRI:  Acquisition of a Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical:  This award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program provides Murray State University with a Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (DMA), thus enhancing a rapidly expanding research and educational initiative in polymer and materials science. The DMA is primarily used to determine the strength and elasticity of polymer films and fibers as well as other plastics and materials.  Acquisition of this state-of-the-art instrumentation supports a number of multi-disciplinary and collaborative research and education efforts across the Jesse D. Jones College of Science, Engineering and Technology and expands industrial outreach activities in the region. The instrumentation directly impacts research teams within the college, where an understanding of the fundamental mechanical properties of novel plastics and materials advances applications in energy storage, electronic devices and liquid crystalline technologies. The integration of a practical instrument component and "hands-on" training into lecture and laboratory courses for undergraduate and graduate (Masters) students within the college further improves an already growing curriculum in polymer and materials science. Since Murray State is a comprehensive university in rural, far-western Kentucky, many undergraduates are first-generation college students, thus access to this instrumentation is extremely rare and provides a tremendous advantage in gaining meaningful employment or in acceptance into pre-professional school. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:  The Department of Chemistry at Murray State University (MSU) will acquire a TA Q800 Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (DMA), complete with humidifier and low temperature capabilities, for the mechanical testing of polymer films, fibers and liquid crystalline materials.  The DMA instrumentation immediately enhances the research programs of the three PIs, all of whom have been very active in the promotion and publication of their research.  Since 2010, the PIs have collectively mentored 27 students (20 undergraduate, 7 Masters) and published 14 peer-reviewed papers (12 with student co-authors).  Specific projects that benefit from this instrumentation include (a) ionic-liquid containing polyester networks for use in electroactive devices (PI Miller), (b) ionic-liquid containing polyurethanes for microfluidic devices and ion selective electrodes (co-PI Johnson) and (c) liquid crystalline materials (co-PI Allenbaugh). In order to enhance these projects, the standard film/fiber tension kits as well as the humidity and submersion features are used to test the mechanical strength of novel materials developed in the laboratory under a controlled environment, while liquid crystalline materials are tested using the parallel plate and/or shear sandwich accessories. Dissemination of the results from these experiments is made in the form of peer-reviewed publications as well as undergraduate student presentations at local, regional and national conferences.  Various lecture and laboratory classes, ranging from Polymer Chemistry and Materials Science to Instrumental Analysis, are also enhanced through the integration of this instrumentation and hands-on training. Beyond teaching and research, the DMA instrumentation allows MSU to establish collaborative efforts with regional companies such as Ashland and Estron Chemical, Inc. that aid in the development of commercial products in applications ranging from paints and coatings to construction materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview of the Award:  The one-year, NSF-MRI award entitled "MRI:  Acquisition of a Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer" was awarded to the Department of Chemistry at Murray State University (MSU) in 2014.  The award covered the purchase of a TA Instruments Q800 Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (DMA), complete with variable temperature and humidity capabilities, for the mechanical testing of polymeric films, fibers and liquid crystalline materials.  The instrument was purchased and installed in the fall of 2014 and has already had a significant impact on teaching and research opportunities in the department.  Ultimately, the acquisition of the DMA instrumentation has provided the department with a full complement of polymer and materials science equipment, making MSU the only university in the far-western Kentucky region to have such capabilities. In fact, a new research space entitled the Polymer and Materials Characterization laboratory has been dedicated to specifically house this instrumentation.  The acquisition of the DMA has also resulted in one growing industrial partnership with Estron Chemical, Inc.  Intellectual Merit:  Murray State University has a very robust and active-centered research culture. The DMA instrumentation has already heavily impacted PI Miller's research program during the first and only year of this award.  In summary, PI Miller and his research team were able to define specific structure-property relationships for a series of charge-containing polymers, the results of which could have potential impact on energy-related applications such as carbon dioxide capture and ion-selective electrodes.  The results of this work have been dissemination in one peer-reviewed publication (Polymer) and PI Miller has highlighted the data acquired from the DMA in two talks which were given at national meetings of the American Chemical Society. Co-PI Johnson and his research team are currently using the DMA to analyze the effect of charge-containing plasticizers on poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) for applications in ion-selective electrodes.  Co-PI Allenbaugh's research group will soon be analyzing a series of metal-containing liquid crystalline materials, prepared by environmentally-friendly, cost-saving mechanochemical methods, for their mechanical properties.  In collaboration with Estron Chemical, Inc., PI Miller has begun investigating the mechanical properties of a series of commercially available thermoplastic coatings.  From a teaching and educational perspective, four undergraduate and one M.S. student have been directly involved with the research projects above and thus have had first-hand use of the DMA instrumentation.  Additionally, PI Miller incorporated DMA training and data analysis as part of his upper-level Polymer Chemistry course offered during the fall 2014 semester (eight students total, four undergraduates).  In all, 162 individual experiments have been completed to date.   Broader Impact:  Murray State University is a comprehensive, regional state university of nearly 11,000 students (60% female, 8 % minority), many of whom are first generation college students from the rural counties of far-western Kentucky, northwestern Tennessee and southern Illinois.  The American Chemical Society (ACS) accredited Department of Chemistry services approximately 100 undergraduate chemistry majors, 110 chemistry minors and 15 graduate (M.S.) students.  Undergraduate research is strongly emphasized in the department, resulting in roughly 25 undergraduate student researchers each year.  As described above, a number of projects and classroom activities have already been impacted by the acquisition of this instrument.  MSU and the Department of Chemistry will continue to promote the acquisition of the DMA in an effort to increase STEM enrollment, particularly in the new Polymer and Materials Science track, which was offered for the first time during the fall 2014 semester.
