<AbstractNarration>Title: DMREF/Collaborative Research: Development of Materials for On-Chip Silicon-Integrated Optical Communication &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data transfer rates between silicon electronic chips are reaching a limit that prevents the continued development of high speed smart-phones, computers, and internet devices. While silicon?s properties are excellent for electronic devices, optical sources based on silicon are incapable of efficient, high-speed communication. Within the framework of the Materials Genome Initiative, this project will seek new materials and associated fabrication processes to overcome this hurdle. Recently it has been shown that MDC materials, such as molybdenum disulfide, can be grown in large-scale, high quality, atomically thin films on silicon dioxide substrates.  Theoretically, it is predicted that such materials are semiconductors with a tunable, direct band gap that renders them far superior for optical communication applications than silicon. This research project intends to develop a theory-driven understanding of fabrication and control of such atomically-thin materials towards validating their use as on-chip light sources for future optical interconnects for integrated circuits. The PIs have an excellent track of record on promoting STEM activities within their respective institution. They intend to work with high school students, undergraduate and graduate students, and involve students from underrepresented groups in the planned research. The outreach activities proposed in this project are solid and will definitely have a broader societal impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are to create a continuous knowledge link between atomistic material theory and chemical material synthesis of a variety of 2D metal dichalcogenidies and their alloys as a foundation for discovering, synthesizing, and accelerating the next generation of on-chip laser devices suitable for applications in telecommunication and data-processing. It builds on recent findings by the principal investigators such as strain-stabilization of different metal&lt;br/&gt;dichalcogenide phases, mm-scale growth of continuous single-layer molybdenum disulfide films, and loss management and demonstration of laser devices featuring optical mode sizes below the diffraction limit of light. The research collaborators will combine theoretical screening of a broad range of materials and predictive modeling of substrate stabilization of their structure, with development of growth methods for a diverse set of materials, and application-near functional evaluation on a waveguide tested. This project brings together an interdisciplinary set of methods ranging from analytical and numerical simulation, to chemical process development and the design and characterization of on-chip integrated laser devices. This vertical, theory-based integration of materials development methods realizes the goal of the Materials Genome Initiative. Success of this project will provide input to the field of functional 2D materials for years to come that will be instrumental in the development of novel photonic integrated circuits, and potentially sensors.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project studied 2D dimensional layered materials. The work included three major trusts of investigations on modeling, synthesis, and device prototyping. In detail, the project investigated a) fundamental properties such as band-gaps of a wide plurality of possible transition metal Dichalcogenides (TMD) materials using simulation and modeling, b) the synthesis and characterization of novel van der Waals materials, and c) opto-electronic device prototyping via heterogeneous integration of these materials into silicon photonics.</p> <p>In detail, we developed a database of over 1000 layered materials by data mining the Materials Project&nbsp;database of 70,000 bulk materials that have been mostly either synthesized or mined, and discovered that there are approximately 100 materials that have either been mined or synthesized that are layered, but consist of more than one type of layer. These are essentially bulk 3D analogs to the vertical heterostructure that many researchers are attempting to create mechanically in the lab. Furthermore. Here we found that the photoluminescence (PL) emission enhancement of plasmon cavities depend critically on the relative position of the TMD with respect to the field enhancement of the cavity. In this context, we found that the often-reported Electric-field field enhancement in the center of a bow-tie or dimer plasmon cavity in fact vanishes when the TMD is placed some in a quenching-save distance away from the cavity.&nbsp;In addition, we developed new chemical vapor deposition growth capabilities for directly growing 2D on-chip, and studied phases of 2D materials to in-situ control their properties. Computational screening of the ability of adsorbates to stabilize phases was conducted. Experimentally, we validated the growth of the 1T phase of MoTe2 in the presence of CO<sub>2</sub> in the process gas highlighting the viability of the computationally predicted approach. Furthermore, a variation of the growth method allows the formation of hybrid films of mixed phases that exhibit susceptibility to gating and significantly increased conductivity. Here we demonstrated 2D material interactions with surface acoustic waves on-chip. We developed a new method to integrate CVD-grown TMDs with plasmonic cavities. We found that the TMD PL obtained from the sample is indeed an average of the relative E-field enhancement across not only the cavity's spatially different field enhancement, but more importantly a convolution between the Gaussian pump-profile, the cavity spatial resonances, and the TMD. We found that the exciton, trion, and bi-excitons contribute non-linearly to the PL with changing pump power of the TMD. We designed and deployed a TMD PL-testbed to benchmark a variety of TMD materials. We developed a novel 2D material transfer setup that improves both accurately and cross-contamination compared to all other transfer setups, allowing for on-demand printing of 2D Materials. We filed a patent on this invention with the USPTO.&nbsp; We predicted and then subsequently observed in the lab a new mechanism for structural phase changes using electrostatic gating in a 2D material with large optical contrast between phases. An interesting application of the developed 2D material printer is the first demonstration of an TMD-based electro-optic modulator and photodetector monolithically integrated in silicon photonics microring cavity. We were granted a US Patent on this technology. The project engaged in STEM outreach, teaching and training, such as to include a NUE summer course on hands-on nanotechnology using GWU&rsquo;s new clean room facilities. We further managed a REU on STEM education with focus on supporting students from underrepresented groups. Taken together the PI&rsquo;s supported more than 12 female STEM students in their labs. We exchanged students, held combined group meetings, and met in person to discuss details about our research and program.</p> <p>High-level impacts of 2D material photonics are found in applications such as neuromorphic computing and machine learning such as DeepLearning and convolutional neural networks for inference tasks. Classical modulator and photodetector applications are in data comm. However, also RF photonics could be an interesting field where these components perform optical pre-processing and filtering functions such as FFT. Lastly, having demonstrated active phase shifting is a key solution for numerous societal applications such as phased arrays in LiDAR, performing the dot-product in weighting functions of neural networks, aligning the phase of optical pre-processors such as temporal FFT for OFDM signaling or speech processing, or hyper spectral filtering in remote sensing, just to mention a few.</p> <p>At a 30,000 foot level, TMDs are quantum wells that are place-able at virtually any substrate without requiring any lattice matching. Their tiny formfactor and high performance-to-weight ratio enables them to become a holistic platform to continue miniaturizing opto-electronic hardware impacting sensors, computers, data-IT systems and more.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/13/2018<br>      Modified by: Volker&nbsp;J&nbsp;Sorger</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div
