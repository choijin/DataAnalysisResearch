<AbstractNarration>The March 2011 Great Eastern Japan Earthquake (GEJE), resulting tsunami, and Fukushima Dai-ichi&lt;br/&gt;power plant safety systems failures were catastrophic for Japan, and have influenced risk&lt;br/&gt;perceptions and policies globally. The nature of that influence remains an active area of&lt;br/&gt;social scientific inquiry. Early findings suggest that risk communication and management inadequacies&lt;br/&gt;contributed to the social amplification of events. The symposium will provide&lt;br/&gt;a timely opportunity to synthesize emerging social and behavioral risk research findings regarding&lt;br/&gt;these extreme events, develop a risk communication and management research agenda to address&lt;br/&gt;the challenges identified, and inform ongoing international risk communication and disaster&lt;br/&gt;risk reduction efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research to date on the nature and consequences of Great Eastern Japan Earthquake (GEJE) and Fukushima-related risk communications identifies a wide range of contributory factors, ranging from lack of scientific consensus&lt;br/&gt;and public misconceptions about the risks, to social amplification of risk by the media, lack&lt;br/&gt;of transparency by management, and insufficient public engagement. Nevertheless, an overarching&lt;br/&gt;synthesis and assessment of theoretical implications and resulting risk communication research&lt;br/&gt;questions stemming from these events is lacking, and would advance the related risk and decision&lt;br/&gt;sciences. Extreme events of the last decade have increased in impact, heightening the global focus on&lt;br/&gt;the necessity of disaster risk reduction. International efforts to improve the evidence base&lt;br/&gt;for risk management include the Integrated Research on Disaster Risk (IRDR) supported by the&lt;br/&gt;United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR), the International Council&lt;br/&gt;for Science (ICSU), and the International Social Science Council (ISSC) and UNISDR activities,&lt;br/&gt;including its lead role in developing a post-2015 Hyogo Framework for Action. Risk Interpretation&lt;br/&gt;and Action (RIA) is a key activity of the IRDR, with the aim of understanding how people, both&lt;br/&gt;decision-makers and ordinary citizens, make decisions, individually and collectively, in the&lt;br/&gt;face of risk, and thereby contributing to an integrated research approach to disaster risk&lt;br/&gt;reduction, to ultimately decrease disaster risks worldwide. The proposed symposium advances&lt;br/&gt;this agenda, as well as integration of this research with research on the communication and&lt;br/&gt;management of extreme technological risks, and enhances collaboration between Japan and the&lt;br/&gt;U.S. in the social, decision and risk sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported the International Symposium on Risk Communication, held at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies (GRIPS) in Roppongi, Minato-ku, Tokyo, October 16, 2014, and co-sponsored by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).   The Symposium was attended by well over 100 participants, in addition to the 15 speakers from five countries, including a representative from the sponsoring agencies. The award also supported a workshop on October 17, 2014, at which the Symposium speakers, sponsors and organizers developed the following recommendations to advance risk communication research and practice.   To build capability with respect to domain-specific, evidence-based, theory-driven risk communication strategy, promote three kinds of social, behavioral and interdisciplinary science studies and associated practices:  Human cognitive processes under risk and uncertainty (micro-dynamics of perception, information processing and decision making), Human behavior in hazardous processes (e.g., natural hazards, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, as well as technological hazards) (meso-scale; individual and group behaviors and dynamics in these specific contexts), Causality in social and environmental changes resulting from hazardous processes (geophysical and social macro-dynamics).   Mechanisms to achieve this may include but should not be limited to: funding research (targeted requests for proposals), funding workshops and training institutes, and requiring integrated risk research projects to include elements of the above.     To create capacity for advances in risk communication&mdash;i.e., expertise, training and resources&mdash;requires integrating risk communication as an international, interdisciplinary field:  Develop international research coordination and funding mechanisms, such as the Trans-Atlantic Platform (TAP, http://www.transatlanticplatform.com/voorpagina) to include risk communication research, in order to learn about the full range of hazards, including low-probability high-consequence (extreme) events. Connect country-level risk communication research efforts through existing international research platforms and scientific efforts such as the Risk Interpretation and Action working group of the Integrated Research on Disaster Risk programme.  Provide funding for risk communication graduate student interns and postdoctoral scholars to operate in situ in government agencies (for example, 100 a year for five years in each country). Consider international exchange internship funding as well.   Explore the idea of certification, like LEED certification (for risk communication skills and achievements, including demonstrating high quality risk communication evaluation).   To build capacity in the consulting groups with which government agencies work, develop (new/better) partnerships with journalism and other professional schools.  Create champions for risk communication in agencies like JST and NSF.        Workshop participants were in agreement that evaluation and feedback are essential to promote systematic research on current practices in risk communication, and science-based advances in risk communication practices. Some speakers recommended that the field develop specific, detailed guidance for the evaluation of risk communication practices and products.  Developing such guidance might be a productive area for collaboration between risk communication researchers and program evaluation researchers.       A 2003 NSF report suggested several innovative institutional arrangements to achieve integration across decision and risk scholars, foster interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research that involves engineering, information, natural and social sciences, and advance risk management.  These included many of the above or similar mechanisms, such as organizing summer institutes to provide intensive training experiences for graduate students and young scholars.
