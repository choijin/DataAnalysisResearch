<AbstractNarration>Biomass burning aerosols (BBA) are ubiquitous throughout the global atmosphere. BBA source strength is believed to be of similar magnitude to the fossil fuel burning aerosols. Biomass burning plumes can affect the atmosphere on local to global scales, and BBAs can have a significant impact on visibility, and on the radiative forcing due to the direct scattering and absorption of radiation. By altering the properties of clouds, BBA also exert indirect effects on the radiation balance. Organic aerosols, representing a major mass fraction of the submicron size fraction, are implicated in human health effects. During atmospheric transport, organic aerosol particles are chemically transformed due to reactions with trace oxidizing species such as the hydroxyl radical (OH), resulting in chemical aging and ultimately cleansing of the atmosphere.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chemical aging of BBA particles by reactive trace gas species is not well understood, and so far investigations have been limited mostly to room temperature and dry conditions, although most of the atmosphere exhibits oxidizing conditions at lower temperatures and wider variations in relative humidity.  Ambient environmental parameters,  which induce altered viscosity or even phase changes,  are responsible for altered chemical reactivity in BBA, and may in turn be responsible for altering the kinetics of many of these chemical transformations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A series of laboratory based investigations, using proxy and surrogate compounds under controlled conditions, are to be carried out in order to further describe the chemical transformations taking place during the formation, dispersal and aging of natural, biomass burning aerosols</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit: We conducted laboratory experiments that improve our understanding of how particle phase state modulated by temperature and humidity impacts the oxidation reactions between typical organic surrogates representing biomass burning aerosol (BBA) and gaseous oxidants such as ozone (O3), nitrate radical (NO3), and hydroxyl radical (OH). We developed a new experimental setup that allowed us to determine the reaction kinetics between O3, NO3 and OH and amorphous OA surrogates for temperatures between -60 C and 40 C. To evaluate the phase state of the organic matter we built a poke-flow experiment yielding viscosity information for examined temperature ranges. Our study demonstrates unambiguously that the chemical reactivity of organic matter towards atmospheric oxidants can vary significantly in response to changes in ambient temperature that modulates the organic phase state.
