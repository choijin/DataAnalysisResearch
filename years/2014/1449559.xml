<AbstractNarration>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are often used for surveillance and reconnaissance missions.  They typically fly high above the ground to avoid obstacles.  As such, they execute such missions passively.  This project adds dexterous arms to a UAV.  This would yield paradigm-shifting missions; the arms could then be used for near-Earth environment tasks like infrastructure repair, agricultural crop handling and border inspection.  The critical gap preventing the realization of such UAVs is the lack of data on reaction forces and torques.  When the arms on such vehicles (dubbed Mobile Manipulating UAVs or MM-UAV) interact with objects like building edifices, trees and common objects on the ground, these reactions can upset vehicle stability.  The new infrastructure built by this project fills this gap.  Robotic arms/hands is retrofitted and on existing 6-DOF gantry that is configured to mimic the UAV?s lateral and longitudinal dynamics.  The net effect is a hardware-in-the-loop system that enables capture and study of reaction forces and torques.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts resulting from such infrastructure include: data to analytically design MM-UAV to yield a new class of unmanned aircraft suitable for near-Earth missions; international collaborations that spinout results to industrial partners; hands-on lab components to complement robotics courses; and Girl Scouts outreach programs to inspire and motivate young girls to science and engineering.  Dissemination includes the open sharing of data and publishing in the literature.  The outcome of the project is a new class of UAV for field and service robotics with a wide range of missions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This CRI (07/01/12 to 08/31/17) proposed an infrastructure that essentially added robotic limbs (arms and grippers) to drones.  Called a mobile-manipulating unmanned aerial vehicle (MM-UAV), the limbs would allow the drone to carry and operate tools.  Envisioned tasks include repairing bridges, harvesting crops and operating valves in sectors like infrastructure maintenance, agriculture and oil refineries.     The critical gap that prevents the realization of MM-UAV is the lack of interaction data. As the aircraft?s arms manipulate tools or grasp objects, the reaction forces and torques can destabilize the aircraft. Such destabilization can lead to the aircraft crashing. The intellectual merit thus stems from creating an infrastructure to fill this gap.  The infrastructure is a 6 degree-of-freedom gantry that emulates aircraft motion called SISTR (Systems Integrated Sensor Test Rig). This test rig serves as a hardware- in-the-loop tool to analytically design MM-UAVs.  Rotorcraft drones, like quadcopters, were implemented in SISTR.  Several robotic limbs were designed.  These include: two- and three-link serial arms and a parallel (also known as a Stewart Platform or Delta) link arm.  Interaction data was captured with these prototype MM-UAVs.  Dexterous manipulation tasks include insertion (peg-in-hole), turning (closing valves and opening hatches), and tool operation (drills).  SISTR afforded safe and rapid testing-and-evaluation (T&amp;E).  The data was then used to create 2nd generation limbs that were then field-tested to verify and validate (V&amp;V) designs.  The net effect was successful implementation of MM-UAV.  Visible outcomes include: MM-UAVs that being deployed for bridge cleaning tasks in a Department of Transportation (DOT) Tier 1 university transportation center (UTC) project; and a text book entitle "Aerial Manipulation" published by Springer-Verlag (2017).  Beyond aircraft, robotic limbs can be mounted on submersibles and spacecraft.  In underwater operations, salvage and oil rig deconstruction missions demand robotic limbs.  In space, satellite repair and debris collection demand robotic limbs.  Thus the academic broader impact of MM-UAV is an infrastructure to analytically design robotic limbs for such "free-floating" vehicles.   Adoption of rotorcraft drones continues to grow.  Robotic limbs that can quickly be attached to such drones suggest strong broader impacts for technology transfer and commercialization.  Outreach activities with the American Helicopter Museum and the Girls Scouts of America added broader impacts for outreach.  The net effect is that during the life of this CRI, MM-UAV has been well-received in the robotics community and has become active research and development topic globally.
