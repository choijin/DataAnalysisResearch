<AbstractNarration>Professor Alena Kubatova and colleagues are requesting funding for their REU Site at the University of North Dakota. This project, funded by the REU Sites Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, provides a 10-week summer research experience for 2nd and 3rd year undergraduate students from primarily undergraduate institutions using interdisciplinary research projects at the intersection of chemistry, chemical engineering, and atmospheric sciences. The interdisciplinary design of the IREC research experience is intended to achieve a two-fold learning goal for all students involved: it highlights the chemistry principles underlying their work and demonstrates the relevance and significance of chemistry principles to other fields. The specific research projects are based on current expertise of faculty at UND and target development of renewable chemicals from lignin and lignocellulose, measurement and modeling of atmospheric processes, and the determination of contaminants in tribal wells. Research projects are pursued from the combined perspectives of organic, analytical and physical chemists, chemical engineers, atmospheric scientists, and geologists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A distinguishing feature of the IREC (Interdisciplinary Renewable and Environmental Chemistry) REU is that all students are jointly mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty mentors, providing students with unique exposure to scientific approaches from different disciplines. The IREC experience focuses on underrepresented minorities, targeting students from tribal community colleges, through initial research projects at the college, followed by a summer research experience for both Native American students and their faculty at UND. As a part of the project, students receive training in science communication, community outreach, and research ethics. Besides enhancing the presentation abilities of IREC participants, this training helps motivate both young students and IREC participants to pursue science and science-related careers.</AbstractNarration>
