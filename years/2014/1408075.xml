<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is the development of a high-sensitivity, wide-field diamond-based magnetic field imaging instrument suitable for applications in the physical and biological sciences.  The approach is based on coherent microwave and optical manipulation of Nitrogen-Vacancy color centers implanted in a thin layer at the surface of a diamond chip.  The Nitrogen-Vacancy center in diamond has emerged as a promising tool for quantum information, sensing, and metrology due to its long electronic spin coherence time at room temperature, and an unusual energy level structure that allows convenient optical spin polarization and readout.  Recent work has demonstrated the potential of ensembles of Nitrogen-Vacancy centers for sensitive detection and imaging of stationary and time-varying magnetic fields, including those produced by biological samples.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this program is the translation of techniques from fundamental quantum science into the development of a solid-state, room temperature magnetic imager with a combination of nanoscale spatial resolution, wide field-of-view, and excellent magnetic field sensitivity that cannot be obtained with any other technology.  In addition, the unique physical properties of diamond (hardness, high thermal conductivity, optical transparency), together with its chemical inertness and excellent biocompatibility, make the diamond magnetic imager particularly well suited for sensing and imaging applications in materials science and biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this program include: (i) applying the diamond magnetic imager to a wide variety of physical and biological problems, e.g., probing magnetic order and domain structure in low-dimensional systems such as graphene, anti-ferromagnetic, and multiferroic materials, as well as minimally-invasive imaging of functional activity and magnetic structures in living cells such as magnetotactic bacteria; (ii) providing interdisciplinary training to students in condensed matter physics, nanoscience, optical imaging techniques, and quantum information science, as well as in application areas such as surface science and bioimaging, with a particular focus on inclusion of members of underrepresented groups in science and engineering; and (iii) performing outreach by communicating to a wider audience the exciting interdisciplinary nature of the proposed instrument development and the research it will enable, through public lectures, websites, magazine articles, and undergraduate course material.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project we optimized the performance of a quantum technology for magnetic sensing and imaging with high spatial resolution, and demonstrated its applicability in both the physical and life sciences.  This technology employs quantum defects in diamond known as nitrogen vacancy (or NV) color centers.  NV color centers emit light with an intensity that depends on the local magnetic field.  The NV color centers are fabricated in a surface layer of a macroscopic diamond chip, with the sample to be studied is placed onto the diamond &mdash; much like is done with a conventional microscope slide.  We therefore refer to this magnetic imaging technology as a ?quantum diamond microscope? or QDM.  Over the course of the project, we realized several key technical improvements to QDM performance: MRI-like and nonlinear optical methods for improving magnetic imaging spatial resolution to the level of a few nanometers; 3 millimeter field-of-view (a 3x upgrade from previous instruments); a 20x improvement in broadband magnetic field sensitivity; a robust method for determining the depth of individual NV centers in diamond with about 1 nanometer uncertainty, which will be essential for atomic-scale magnetic sensing; and a Fourier-plane optical technique to enhance the dynamic range of magnetic field sensing.  We also applied the QDM to a diverse set of scientific studies, including: the first demonstration of wide-field NMR spectroscopy of nanoscale samples containing multiple nuclear species (1H, 19F, and 31P), as well as two-dimensional optical MRI with sub-micron resolution; the first wide-field magnetic imaging of labeled biological cells, providing single-cell resolution and quantitative identification of cancer biomarkers; magnetic images of several terrestrial and meteoritic rock samples, demonstrating the ability to resolve spatially distinct populations of ferromagnetic carriers; and the first noninvasive detection of the magnetic field from single-neuron action potentials, including in whole organisms.  Broader impacts of this project include the diverse set of new scientific applications enabled by the QDM, such as those noted above; as well as ongoing commercialization of related technology.  Students and postdoctoral researchers were active participants in all phases of this research: design, construction, and execution of experiments; detailed calculations; magnetic imaging applications; analysis of data; presentation of results at scientific meetings; and writing scientific papers.  In addition, the investigators on this NSF-supported project described the scientific process and results in a wide variety of presentations ranging from scientific conferences and seminars to public lectures.
