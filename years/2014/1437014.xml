<AbstractNarration>1437014 &lt;br/&gt;Karagozian, Ann R.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the proposed research is to understand and control the behavior of jets in crossflow (JICF). &lt;br/&gt;Since the presence of JICF is prevalent in a plethora of engineering and technological applications related to energy production, propulsion, and combustion, the work proposed here would have a significant impact in engineering JICF systems with tailored behavior. In that case, increasing fuel efficiency and reducing emissions would have an impact on the national economy and the environment. In addition, the co-PIs will reach students outside of their university with presentations and demonstrations for students at Community Colleges in Southern California. Opportunities for local high school students as well as CC students to gain laboratory experiences in the summer will be provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to study the effects of instabilities on the behavior JICF. These instabilities may develop at the jet?s upstream shear layer depending on the crossflow characteristics (e.g., fluid density, fluid velocity). Experimental evidence indicates that these instabilities can profoundly affect the JICF spreading, trajectory, speed etc. This proposal is a fundamental approach to develop a deeper mechanistic understanding of how the crossflow leads to the instabilities, and what the effects are exactly. Experiments that employ state-of-the-art imaging techniques (stereo-particle image velocimetry and planar laser-induced fluoresence), in combination with theory and modeling of the process are proposed, in order to develop predictive capabilities that allow control of spreading and mixing of JICF.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The technical outcomes from this NSF-supported project involve experimental exploration of tailored control of shear layer instability mechanisms for the jet in crossflow (JICF), with applications to the control of jet mixing processes.  These studies are performed in the gas phase, with engineering applications and detailed measurements relevant to non-reactive as well as reactive systems.  This flowfield is found in gas turbine engines for energy generation as well as aircraft engines, where control of instabilities can improve turbine blade cooling, reduce atmospheric pollutants, and improve fuel efficiency.  It is also applicable to rocket engines, where improved mixing in preburners or thrust vectoring can impact performance and safety.  Based on these wide-ranging applications, an understanding of the relationships among flow instabilities, jet structure, mixing, and local fluid mechanical strain rates, and mechanisms for tailoring the control of the jet to enhance desired features, can have important implications for practical propulsion and energy-generation systems.  The present experiments have employed non-intrusive laser diagnostics, including simultaneous stereo particle image velocimetry (PIV) and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) imaging of seeded acetone, in order to quantify three-dimensional velocity fields as well as jet structure and scalar transport/mixing/interfacial straining processes.  Both axisymmetric and asymmetric jet excitation are applied in the context of this tailored control, and both have significant influence on JICF behavior.  To our knowledge, this type of extensive exploration of the transverse jet, with and without tailored control, has never been done, especially for such a wide range of operating conditions.  Important new discoveries have been made in these studies, involving the nature of transition in the jet?s fundamental shear layer instabilities, mechanisms of lock-in to both axisymmetric and asymmetric forcing frequencies, and the ability of both types of excitation to enhance fluid mechanical mixing.  Different mixing metrics are explored here, including molecular mixing metrics applied in both the jet?s centerplane and cross-section, with interesting correlations between the two.   The broader impacts of these studies have gone well beyond the practical applications of the jet in crossflow and the usual graduate level research and education.  Our activities have included undergraduate research training as well as outreach and presentations to visiting high school and community college students, many of whom are from under-represented groups.  Continued outreach, especially to pre-engineering community college students, is being pursued by our group.          Last Modified: 10/26/2018       Submitted by: Ann R Karagozian]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
