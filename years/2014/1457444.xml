<AbstractNarration>Nitrogen (N) is a necessary nutrient for plant growth.  The atmosphere consists mainly of nitrogen gas (N2), and this form of N is extremely stable. Most plants can't directly access N2 and their rate of growth is instead limited by the presence of available N in the soil.  Therefore, some species of trees have evolved a symbiosis with a special class of bacteria that fix atmospheric N2 and convert it into a plant-available form. These nitrogen-fixing trees have abundant access to nitrogen, but there is a cost to this symbiotic association:  these trees provide carbon to bacteria and therefore sacrifice some of their own growth to maintain the symbiosis.  As a result, nitrogen-fixing trees comprise only a small proportion of tree species on earth.  In theory, nitrogen fixation is only advantageous in ecosystems that have very limited amounts of N in the soil.  N-limited forests tend to be more common at high latitudes than at lower latitudes (the tropics and subtropics), but curiously, N-fixing trees are actually most common at lower latitudes.  In fact, N-fixing trees are ten times less abundant at higher latitudes than at lower latitudes.  Why is this the case?  This proposal will test a potential explanation.  The "differential regulation hypothesis" states that variation in the degree to which N-fixing trees regulate N fixation can explain the pattern.  N-fixing trees that rapidly adjust N-fixation to meet N demand should be more abundant, as is the case in lower-latitude forests.  In contrast, species that cannot regulate N-fixation should be less abundant, as observed in higher-latitude forests.  This project will measure the extent to which the regulation of N-fixation actually varies across latitudes, as well as the metabolic costs of regulating N-fixation and the relationship of these costs to temperature. The results will provide a long sought after explanation for the distribution of N-fixing trees on earth, which is an essential component of the growth of forests worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will involve a field experiment in forests at different latitudes as well as two greenhouse experiments.  The field experiment will fertilize forests with labeled N to vary the degree of N limitation and measure the regulation of N fixation in the field.  The experimental locations are Oregon (with Alnus rubra), New York (with Robinia pseudoacacia), and Hawaii (with Morella faya, Casuarina equisetifolia, Acacia koa, and Sophora chrysophylla) and span the latitudinal threshold for N-fixing tree abundance (35Â° N).  There are two major types of N fixing symbioses (actinorhizal and rhizobial) and the field sites were chosen to capture both.  The greenhouse experiments will test a larger number of species and involve more highly controlled conditions.  The greenhouse experiments will also evaluate how quickly plants can regulate N fixation. The experiments and laboratory analyses will involve participation of Title 1 high school students as well as undergraduate and graduate students in New York, California and Oregon.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Legumes are an agriculturally and ecologically important plant group.  They are different from the majority of plant species because they have beneficial associations with a particular type of bacteria in their roots.  These bacteria are capable of converting atmospheric nitrogen to a form that plants can use through a process called nitrogen fixation.  Plants give the bacteria sugar in exchange for this nitrogen.  Our previous research demonstrated that legume species can control the nature of their relationships with the bacteria to differing degrees.  Some legume species (facultative fixers) have the ability to terminate the bacterial colonies when they are growing in fertile soil, which allows the plant to use that sugar for other functions like growth and reproduction.  Some legume species (obligate fixers) cannot adjust the relationship with their bacterial partners.      N-fixing trees are ten times more abundant equatorward of 35&deg;N than at higher latitudes in the Americas.  This seems counterintuitive given that many lower-latitude forests have high nitrogen availability, which should select against nitrogen-fixing trees.  There is no consensus explanation for this latitudinal abundance paradox.  One explanation&mdash;the "differential regulation hypothesis"&mdash;suggests that a difference in the degree to which nitrogen fixers regulate nitrogen fixation can explain the pattern.  Specifically, facultative fixers should have abundance patterns similar to lower-latitude forests, whereas obligate fixers should have abundance patterns similar to higher-latitude forests.  The primary objective of this research is to determine strategies of nitrogen fixation in nitrogen-fixing trees spanning a broad latitudinal gradient.     This project included researchers from Columbia University, Chapman University, and USGS working in low- and high-latitude sites.  The grant made to Chapman University funded work at the low-latitude site in Hawaii.  We grew nitrogen-fixing (Acacia koa, Casuarina equisetifolia, Gliricidia sepium, Morella faya) and non-fixing (Dodonaea viscosa, Psidium cattleianum) trees at a variety of fertilization levels (control, high nitrogen, very high nitrogen, and very high nitrogen + very high phosphorus, each replicated eight times) at two sites on the island of Hawaii.  After planting in January 2016, and annually thereafter, we collected growth measures (height, stem diameter, canopy dimensions).  In July 2017, we began fertilizing with isotopically-labeled fertilizer and measured soil and leaf nutrients every six months after the first application.  The experiment is still ongoing, and the final measurements will be collected in July 2019.     Results from the first three years of the project are still being analyzed and we have no results to report at this time.  This project had several broader impacts.  First, the project advanced the research program of an early-career female scientist (postdoc Amelia Wolf) and supported faculty-student mentorship: one female masters student (University of Hawaii, Hilo) used the plots for her thesis project, which will examine differences in fixation strategy between native and non-native legumes.  Second, knowledge of how different species regulate nitrogen fixation could be important for agroforestry.  Nitrogen-fixing trees are often used in agroforestry to increase nitrogen supply to soils, and our findings could provide guidance on whether different species will supply sufficient versus excess nitrogen.  Finally, the proposed research also has implications for our understanding of global change.  For example, excess nitrogen accumulation stimulates the production of greenhouse gases.
