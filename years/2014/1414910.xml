<AbstractNarration>Because they require no conventional propulsion system, solar sail spacecraft are at the forefront of sustainable technology in space. The recent successful deployment of the JAXA IKAROS solar sail has renewed interest in this type of spacecraft to fulfill a certain class of missions once thought to be impractical due to large propellant requirements. Of all the possible types of solar sail configurations, the heliogyro has the most understood control strategy and is the easiest to deploy. This structure, akin to a dutch windmill, uses long, thin, flexible blades rotating about a central spacecraft body in order to propel itself using solar radiation pressure (solar wind). The objective of this project is to investigate the appropriate control architecture to maneuver the attitude (orientation) of such a spacecraft while guaranteeing the stability of the structure. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Jer-Nan Juang, an expert on solar sail technology at the National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a consequence of their flexibility and size, heliogyro sails require persistent control attention at the root of each blade in order to maintain stability and achieve changes in attitude. The proposer will design an adaptive control scheme robust to random vibrations and changes in the response of the blades due to the highly-coupled non-linear nature of the system. The development of the control algorithm will implement concepts of estimation and system identification to approximate the system parameters and adapt to uncertainties in real time. Furthermore, the project will require devising a model to capture the system's dynamic response; creating blade pitch actuation routines to reproduce attitude-changing maneuvers; implementing a realistic model of solar radiation pressure; and investigating optimal sensor placement along the blades in order to maximize observability. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Science Council of Taiwan.</AbstractNarration>

Of all the types of possible solar sail configurations, the heliogyro has the most well-understood deployment and attitude control strategy. This structure, akin to a dutch windmill, makes use of large, extremely flexible blades that rotate about a central hub as sails. Because of their flexibility, heliogyro blades require persistent control attention to ensure the stability of the whole structure and provide orientation (attitude) control. The objective of this research project consists of developing an adaptive control algorithm to impose stability and trajectory tracking on the blades of  a heliogyro-type solar sail spacecraft.  The NSF EAPSI - funded portion of this project, which was carried out at the National Cheng Kung University of Taiwan, consisted on the following efforts:  Development and validation of a mathematical model of the dynamics of an idealized single blade with varying degrees of freedom and coupling. Finding mathematical expressions for the influence of solar radiation pressure on the dynamics of the blades. Finding a suitable mathematical model for the attitude maneuvers to be imposed on the spacecraft based on helicopter dynamics. Developing and simulating an controller to actuate at the root of the blade in order to counteract vibrations and provide stable maneuver tracking to the blade.   To develop the models for the equations of motion, the blade structure was idealized as a lumped-mass structure where point masses were concentrated on the end-corners, and were connected by massless tubes. See Figure 1. Three principal motions were identified: bending (out of plane), twisting, and in-plane bending. Fully-coupled nonlinear model for the dynamics of the blade were derived, using the aforementioned idealization, for 1 to 3 - degree of freedom cases: Bending motion, Bending + Twisting motions, Bending + Twisting + In-plane bending motions. In the three cases, the models were evaluated using previously-developed models, provided by the host researcher, and were found to be valid representations of the dynamics of the structure.  The influence of the solar radiation pressure was quantified into a mathematical representation, and then applied to the aforementioned dynamics utilizing a simplified optical model that accounts for the orientation of the blade with respect to the sun, diffuse and spectral light radiation, as well as the absorption rate of the surface.  A mathematical model was selected to represent the coordinated actuation of all the blades in the spacecraft onto the individual maneuver profile of a single blade. The model was adapted to the study from the field of helicopter controls, where actuation of the pitch of each blade at the root affects the orientation of the helicopter.   An controller based on model reference adaptive control (MRAC) was derived for the two and three-degree of freedom models which made use of a few assumptions:  Only a single facet is considered. The full state is measurable; that is, the orientation of the blade is always known. No noise (unmodelled vibrations) is to affect the system.   A simple controller design follows Figure 2.  Where a MRAC-type adaptive controller is used, a reference model is specified by selected maneuver profiles, and SRP input is calculated at each step and applied back into the plant given the disposition of the blade at that specific moment. Simulation results show that the controller achieves maneuver tracking fairly quickly and accurately for both models. See Figure 3.  While the models and results seen in this NSF-funded stage of the project are idealized, the merit of this project to the scientific community constitutes the fact that no other previous research that has shown successful attitude control on a heliogyro has ever been published. These preliminary results constitute the building blocks for further in-depth...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
