<AbstractNarration>This project will support the workshop on securing computation at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing. The confluence of smart devices, cloud and social computing, storage outsourcing and data mining, distributed systems and web-based services is changing the face of computing. To achieve data security in the face of these modes of computation the proposed workshop will tackle fundamental questions such as: How to perform computations on encrypted data stored in multiple locations? How to outsource computation to a third party and verify the correctness of the results with minimal overhead? How to provide selected access to parts of the encrypted data on a need-to-know basis? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This timely workshop will bring together researchers and students from diverse backgrounds to contribute to this highly important topic. The students will have the opportunity to interact with experts in the field. The materials and findings from workshop will be made publically available.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The "Securing Computation" workshop, part of the 2015 Cryptography Program at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, took place during the week of June 8-12, 2015. Organized by Hugo Krawczyk and Amit Sahai, the workshop focused on recent advances in cryptography, particularly in the area of secure computation.  The workshop reflected two major trends in current cryptographic research.  On the one hand, we are seeing dramatic advances in fresh concepts such as fully homomorphic encryption, functional encryption and secure program obfuscation, as well as candidate constructions for these notions. These promise to significantly expand the scope of cryptography, allowing the increasing sophistication of computational settings and adversaries to be addressed in ways previously unimagined.  In a complementary trend, more mature cryptographic techniques such as secure multi-party computation (MPC), secure function evaluation, oblivious RAM and others are seeing significant advances through increasingly efficient solutions, thus enhancing their practical relevance for real-world problems. The timeliness of these results cannot be overstated.  The confluence of cloud and social computing, storage outsourcing and data mining, distributed systems and web-based services is changing the face of computing and freeing it from the limitations of localized isolated processing.  At the same time, this new era of computing amplifies the opportunities and sophistication of adversaries determined to tamper with the integrity and privacy of computation and data. This is exactly the setting cryptography has envisioned for more than three decades.   The bulk of the workshop's program was built from 30-minute invited talks covering state-of-the-art results, as well as a few longer survey-type talks.  In addition, significant time was allocated to discussions that focused on specific workshop sessions as well as two long discussion sections on the subjects of "Practical Advanced Crypto: Bottlenecks and the Future" and "Obfuscation: Bottlenecks and the Future".  These two extended discussions were a highlight of the workshop, with many participants expressing their appreciation for the discussion format, where a single moderator led an open and wide-ranging discussion.  The first discussion focused on barriers and opportunities for crypto adoption in practice, while the second focused on open problems.  Thursday afternoon was dedicated to recent results presented mostly by students and recent graduates. These sessions were organized into three parallel tracks dedicated to the subjects of "Obfuscation", "Secure Multi-Party Computation", and "Towards Practice."  Presenters were encouraged to make whiteboard presentations as a way to induce more interaction with the audience.  Overall, these young-researcher tracks, the discussion sessions, and ample coffee and lunch breaks fostered a great deal of interaction and collaboration between workshop participants.  Talks on obfuscation theory covered the gamut of issues, including (1) the state-of-the-art for basic constructions and security proofs for obfuscation schemes; (2) the latest develpments on the construction of multilinear maps, which underlie current constructions of obfuscation, including both attacks on some multilinear map candidates as well as the latest candidates designed to resist such attacks; (3) bootstrapping obfuscation to work for Turing machines; (4) achieving new levels of space efficiency for obfuscation; and (5) several alternative definitions of obfuscation.    Talks about secure computation protocols covered both practical and theoretical aspects and reflected the increasing focus on bringing these techniques to a level of efficiency that would allow their use and implementation in truly practical settings.  Examples of such work included efficient techniques for multi-party computation based on optimized garbling of circuits, the relaxation of security models for obtaining more efficient forms of secure computation (allowing, for example, practical systems for searching on encrypted data), and advances in the applicability of verifiable computation techniques and, in particular, the development of SNARKSs (succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge) as a building block for verifying computation.  As an example of the interaction between cryptographic techniques and practical needs, recent advances in the SNARK area have been strongly motivated by the applicability of this primitive to bitcoin-like crypto-currencies.  Interestingly, several results were presented in the workshop which directly address bitcoin protocols or build on such protocols for additional cryptographic functionality.  Additional topics of practical interest included applications of multi-party techniques to the stock market, and the use of cryptographic theory and tools to combat computer malware.  On the more theoretical side of secure multi-party computation, there were presentations on lower bounds and new constructions with improved parameters.  The latter included an optimal 2-round MPC protocol based on the LWE (learning with errors) problem, a recursive scheme for MPC using self composition, information-theoretic MPC over "elastic noisy channels", and advances in secure RAM computation.  Finally, a number of presentations addressed the game-theoretic "rational players" setting covering rational proofs, protocol fairness, and a recent result showing the cryptographic hardness of finding a Nash equilibrium based on the existence of indistinguishability obfuscation.
