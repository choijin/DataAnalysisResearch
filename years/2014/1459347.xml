<AbstractNarration>The physical processes responsible for distributing momentum throughout the ocean surface boundary layer are the subject of active concern in the oceanographic community. This interest is motivated to a large degree by the central importance of correctly parameterizing upper-ocean processes in coupled climate models.  At the same time, there is a tradition in oceanography of seeking physical information by examining the nature of the relationship between wind stress and observed surface currents. This study will contribute to a better understanding of the mixing processes that are needed to accurately parameterize the ocean surface boundary layer in global climate models, an important societal benefit.  Any improvement in the ability to estimate surface currents given the wind forcing is expected to be of interest for oil spill response and other practical applications. A key output for the community will be an improved estimate of the locally wind-driven currents, which will be distributed from the Global Drifter Program's website as a supplementary data product. This project will also support an early-career scientist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to better understand the dynamics of the ocean surface boundary layer through the first global study of the wind/current transfer function. This is to be accomplished by analyzing in detail the response to wind forcing in the global array of surface drifters, which sample the ocean currents in the vicinity of their 15 m drogue depth. The global analysis is to be informed and tested by (i) a prototype study from the Salinity Processes in the Upper Ocean Regional Study region, near a well-instrumented air-sea flux mooring, and (ii) analysis of synthetic data generated with a recently improved turbulence closure model that explicitly includes Langmuir turbulence. The hypotheses that wind, wave, and stratification state substantially modify near-surface mixing will be tested by examining dependencies of the transfer function on various environmental parameters, such as Langmuir number. Observed patterns will then be interpreted and scrutinized by deriving new theoretical approximations to the expected transfer functions characterizing different mixing processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has examined the relationship between the wind and the ocean surface currents.  The currents have many causes, and in fact, the direct influence of the wind is not the dominant cause of the ocean currents at most locations and at most times.  Nonetheless, it does play an important role and globally accounts for 10-30% of the current variability.  In this project, we have been seeking better predictions of the ocean surface currents through the creation of mathematical models for the wind/current relationship.   As the winds may be regarded as "known", this will enable us to make better predictions of the wind-forced currents than was previously possible.   Eventually this work will help society better respond in cases of, for example, search and rescue operations or oil spills.   As a part of this project, we also studied the behavior of the wind over the ocean, and learned a great deal about how its variability changes with latitude or geographic location.     The work is made possible through the analysis of data from simple instruments known as "drifters" that float on the surface of the ocean and track the ocean currents.   An important point is in regards to the interpretation of the data.  The drifters are attached to a long "sock" or drogue, which helps them follow the water movements rather than be directly blown by the wind. Often this drogue falls off at some point during the drifter?s life.  We have found that it is important to know when the drogue is present and when it is not, because the behaviors in these two cases are totally different.  Fortunately the situation is very clear, and by accessing the right information we can have confidence in whether the drogue is attached or not, allowing us to obtain the correct wind/current relationship.
