<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for students and young postdoctoral scientists to attend the 24th International Workshop on Vertex Detectors in Santa Fe, New Mexico,June 1-5, 2015. This conference will review existing and proposed future semiconductor detectors,&lt;br/&gt;new technologies, radiation hardness, simulation, tracking alignment, electronics, triggering, and applications to medical and other fields. Attendance by junior members of the instrumentation community is a priority for this meeting.  Accelerators play a critical role in future advances in a number of scientific disciplines, as well as a number of technologies, including materials processing and medical imaging.  Training of a cadre of junior scientists in the development of new detectors is especially important, both for the role they play in making new discoveries as well as supporting the broad commercial use of accelerator and detector technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A conference on the subject of advanced technologies for detecting and tracking elementary particles was held in New Mexico and attended by 55 delegates from the US and abroad.  Forty-nine talks were presented on state-of-the-art electronics, materials, algorithms, and detection devices.  Topics ranged over applications from particle physics to astronomy, bionic devices, and radiation detection.  Eleven graduate students and postdoctoral fellows received travel stipends that allowed them to participate; all of these people presented plenary talks.  Proceedings have been published at http://pos.sissa.it/cgi-bin/reader/conf.cgi?confid=254 and are accessible worldwide without restriction.  The intellectual merit of this project included its role in fostering the exchange of scientific knowledge in a rapidly evolving field at the frontier of human inquiry.  Ideas stimulated by this meeting may influence the development of technology for decades.  The broader impact of this project included the exchange of ideas for improvement of devices involved in bionic sensing, radiation detection, and electronics of broad application.  For some of the junior people whose travel was supported, this was the first conference experience and was thus an important step in their professional training and intellectual development.  This workshop brought experts from around the world to the Southwest, allowing our regional scientists and students to make new contacts and receive new ideas.
