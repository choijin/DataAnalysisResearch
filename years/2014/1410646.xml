<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coherent twin boundaries are defects in materials, widely described as perfect interfaces theoretically and experimentally, playing a significant role in a variety of materials. The ability of coherent twin boundaries in strengthening, maintaining the ductility, and retaining high electrical conductivity is well documented.    The integration of advanced computational and experimental techniques in this research will lead to a fundamentally new understanding of plasticity and fracture in  metallic metals containing these defects because of newly-developed imaging tools and computational models.   The multidisciplinary research team will allow  new understanding and  may accelerate the deployment of the next-generation structural materials with tolerance to extreme environments such as high radiation exposure and high temperature. The education and outreach components of this project will also include research training and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students, organization of an international symposium, and activities for attraction and retention of freshman and sophomore college students in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This combined computational and experimental study aims to understand the fundamental role of newly-observed kink-like twin boundary defects in the deformation and fracture of nanotwinned metals, with a particular focus on face-centered cubic metals with low and intermediate stacking-fault energies. The objectives of this project are three-fold. First, we will study new kink-dependent plastic deformation processes in model nanotwinned metals in Cu, Ag and Ag-Cu alloys using atomistic simulations tightly coupled to a new nanodiffraction mapping technique inside a transmission electron microscope, in-situ synchrotron x-ray diffraction tensile tests, and atomic force microscopy nanoindentation experiments. Second, we will examine the impact of temperature, stacking-fault energy, defect density, and grain boundary structure on hardening and softening mechanisms in these metals. Third, a multiscale approach using quasi-continuum computer simulations will be deployed to model the effects of twin boundary defects and twin size on fracture toughness. This project will benefit from the expertise of the PI in theoretical and computational materials research in nanotwinned systems, and from collaboration with scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Ames Laboratory who will perform state-of-the-art experiments on freestanding nanotwinned films.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merit.</strong> This research has successfully integrated large-scale atomistic simulations, materials theory, and nanoscale experiments to gain new fundamental insights into the roles of intrinsic twin-boundary (TB) defects, stacking-fault energy, and solute atom segregation in the plastic deformation and fracture of nanotwinned face-centered cubic (fcc) metals at the atomic scale. The ability of nanosized growth twins in strengthening and maintaining the ductility has been well documented in the literature, but most theoretical models proposed to understand this behavior have assumed that TBs are perfect interfaces. The present research, however, has proven that atomic-scale kink-step defects in TBs can dramatically alter both the transmission of dislocations intersecting TBs and TB instability in nanotwinned Ag and Cu metals under applied stress. A major conclusion is that both twin stability and yield strength in nanotwinned Ag can be increased substantially by introducing trace concentrations of segregated Cu atoms less than 1 at.%. It was discovered that preferential segregation of solute Cu atoms towards TB kink steps promotes twin stability and resistance to detwinning by pinning of TB defects, alongside classical GB segregation. Also, a strong Hall-Petch-type strengthening behavior, and reversible pseudo-elastic shape-memory effects, have been revealed in the deformation of nanotwinned Au nanowires. Furthermore, we have found direct experimental and theoretical evidence for an unusual slip-activated surface creep mechanism that suppresses the tendency towards plastic instability without compromising the strength, resulting in ultra-large room-temperature superplasticity in &lt;112&gt; single-crystalline Ag nanocrystals. The superplasticity phenomenon was observed over a sample diameter range between 15 and 70 nm, which is considered well above the maximum size where surface-assisted Coble creep is expected to dominate plasticity. The products of this research include five peer-reviewed articles in high-impact factor journals such as <em>Nature Materials</em> and <em>Nano Letters</em>, and one invited review article in <em>MRS Bulletin</em>.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong>. The findings of this research have shown that microalloying and sample diameter may enable the design of interface-strengthened metals and silver nanowires with strengths and stability that could far exceed their current limits. This research has led to new understandings of interface and surface defect dynamics in nanotwinned metals and nanowires. New in-situ characterization methods, atomistic simulations, and analytical materials theory have been developed for this program. The results could potentially impact a range of energy-related applications from structural materials for extreme environments, such as high-temperature and radiation conditions, to functional materials for flexible transparent conductive electrodes in soft electronics and opto-electronics. Furthermore, this research has created opportunities for research training and professional development for two PhD students, including one female student, who have participated in the dissemination of their research in thesis manuscripts, peer-reviewed journal articles, and conference presentations, resulting in a nomination for best poster award. This project has created opportunities for a first-year female undergraduate student to conduct experimental research on silver nanowires, who has subsequently obtained a competitive research scholarship based on this work. The PI has organized two international symposia in the field of mechanical behavior of nanostructured materials.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/04/2017<br>      Modified by: Frederic&nbsp;Sansoz</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1410646/1410646_10317744_1512362541142_Figure1-finalreport--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1410646/1410646_10317744_1512362541142_Figure1-finalreport--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Atomistic models of nanotwinned metals containing defective twin boundaries"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1410646/1410646_10317744_1512362541142_Figure1-finalreport--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Atomistic models of nanotwinned metals containing defective twin boundaries"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Atomistic models of nanotwinned fcc metals containing defective twin boundaries.
