<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Liviu Mirica from Washington University and colleagues Robert Blankenship, William Buhro, D. Andre d'Avignon and Sophia Hayes will acquire an EPR spectrometer that would operate at X-band. This instrument will allow research in a variety of fields such as those that provide insight on how biologically relevant species behave when they possess unpaired electrons. In general, an EPR spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid state materials. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive species involved in valuable chemical transformations as well as the initiation of pathological tumor growth. These studies will impact a number of areas, from the synthesis of inorganic and organic molecules to the development of new solid state materials to compounds of magnetic and biological interest. Employing examples inspired from ongoing research, this instrument will be an integral part of research and teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels at Washington University as well as institutions in the entire St. Louis area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) investigating and developing metal-based catalytic systems; (b) characterizing metal-containing biomolecules biological importance; (c) studying biological macromolecular assemblies relevant to solar energy conversion; (d) characterizing nanomaterials; and (e) understanding the electronic characteristics of inorganic compounds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Overview:   This project allowed the Department of Chemistry at Washington University (WU) in St. Louis, MO to purchase an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) instrument. The main reason for this application is that currently there is no EPR instrument at Washington University or in the entire St. Louis area that has the capability of performing experiments at variable temperatures. The acquisition of the EPR spectrometer has enhanced the research capabilities at WU, but also provided for the first time to the entire St. Louis area the ability to characterize paramagnetic molecules in the 4 K - 298 K temperature range. This research capability has been essential for a wide range of studies in chemical catalysis, biochemistry, inorganic chemistry, and nanoscience.   Intellectual Merit: The CW-EPR spectrometer has greatly benefited the researchers in chemistry, life sciences, materials science, and engineering at WU and in the entire St. Louis area. The range of research areas that have so far benefited directly include include: a) investigation and development of novel metal-based catalytic systems; b) characterization of metal-containing biomolecules of key biological importance; c) study of biological macromolecular assemblies relevant to solar energy conversion; d) characterization of nanomaterials with novel chemical and physical properties, and e) a further understanding of the electronic characteristics of inorganic compounds.

In addition, several more manuscripts are in preparation that will include data collected on the Bruker EMXplus.   Broader Impacts: The purchased EPR instrument had an immediate broad impact on the research, teaching, and educational activities at WU and other institutions from the St. Louis area. WU students were trained in the theory, use, and interpretation of EPR spectroscopy through a specialized, Electron Spin Resonance course. In addition, the EPR instrument has been implemented in several laboratory undergraduate and graduate courses, focusing on the measurement and interpretation of EPR spectra of various paramagnetic metal complexes and organic radicals.
