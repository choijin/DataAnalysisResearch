<AbstractNarration>#14-49101&lt;br/&gt;Dena K. Plemmons&lt;br/&gt;San Diego State University&lt;br/&gt;?Research Ethics Education Workshop?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;US-Japan Research Ethics Education Workshop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As research, practice, and education in science and engineering become increasingly global so must efforts to address their ethical dimensions. This workshop will bring together Japanese counterparts ? researchers, administrators, government representatives ? to discuss the critical issues of misconduct in science and approaches toward education and training which may mitigate some of the circumstances leading to such misconduct. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will facilitate future collaborative interactions with Japanese science and education agencies and researchers.  It is the first US-Japan collaboration on this topic and holds the promise of building new collaborations that will be highly relevant to both sides.</AbstractNarration>
