<AbstractNarration>This award funds the LHC Theory Initiative, a competitive national fellowship program supporting the training of postdoctoral fellows in theoretical particle physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of particle physics is to identify the fundamental principles that govern matter, energy, space and time. The Standard Model (SM) provides a well tested quantitative description of the known particles and forces. A body of evidence suggests that the SM is not complete, and that it is the low-energy limit of a more fundamental theory.The CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) began physics operations in 2010, and on July 4, 2012, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations announced discovery of a new resonance with a mass near 125 GeV. Subsequent running has confirmed that the new particle looks like the long-sought Higgs boson.  CERN is in the process of doubling the LHC's energy and significantly increasing its luminosity.  Physics goals include precision measurements of Higgs properties, as well as direct searches for new particles, especially dark matter. Accurate theoretical predictions are needed for the LHC to realize its full potential. For example, because of the LHC's high luminosity, it can be difficult to separate signals from backgrounds. The lowest-order predictions for such processes exhibit significant uncertainties that can be reduced by including higher orders in perturbation theory. Also, it is essential to explore signatures and strategies in depth to make the most of the new discoveries and to fully exploit the physics potential of this powerful experimental facility.   This fellowship program will help ensure that the United States has the young theorists it needs to gain full benefit from the investment it has made in the LHC experimental facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activities proposed here are to provide calculational tools and theoretical results necessary to fully extract physics results from the LHC. Proposed activities include calculations of higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections in the SM and beyond-the-SM models, as well as the development of new, improved, shower algorithms. Also important is the development of robust and well-tested Monte Carlo tools to confront the data with theoretical models. Much remains to be done in these areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the pre-eminent facility in the field of elementary particle physics. It is located in a 27-km ring outside Geneva, Switzerland.  The LHC experiments were constructed through a global collaboration, with the United States contributing a substantial fraction of the cost, both in people and in equipment.  The experiments are at the forefront of discovery.  Indeed, the Higgs Boson was discovered there In 2013, leading to the Nobel Prize in physics that year.  Critical to success is the LHC's ability to discriminate discovery-class "signals" from garden-variety "backgrounds."  New state-of-the-art techniques were needed to separate the needles from the haystack.  This award assured that the next generation of US particle theorists was up to the task.  In particular, it was the final installment in a series of NSF awards funding the LHC Theory Initiative, which supported a total of 25 students and 23 postdocs across 29 institutions from Massachusetts to California, Wisconsin to Florida, as they developed their skills and deepened their training in LHC-oriented theory.  The LHC Theory Initiative Fellows were instrumental in developing the sophisticated jet analysis techniques now used by the LHC experiments.  But beyond that, through a series of workshops, they formed a community ready and able to work with the LHC experimenters to achieve their common goals.  The LHC was and is a strategic priority of the NSF, and this award helped assure that the United States received full value from its substantial investment in the facility.  It also supported a cadre of students and postdocs with skills that have direct impact both in academia but also in the private sector.
