<AbstractNarration>The world of pure mathematics is rooted in words and ideas rather than numbers and algebraic equations.  At first glance these words and ideas seem foreign and unrelated to the natural world.  However, pure mathematics is the language of modern physics.  Broadly speaking the main intellectual merit of this proposal is to create new mathematics which will add to the language of physics.  More precisely, the theory of quantum groups associated to Lie algebras is widely and productively used in low-dimensional topology, in particular with the creation of quantum invariants.  Within this context, the PI and his collaborators have given new systematic strategies to define re-normalized quantum invariants arising from non-semi-simple categories.  The focus of this proposal is to describe and explore the geometric and physical meanings of these re-normalized invariants, while concurrently using the unique properties of these invariants to gain new information about well-known problems in low-dimensional topology.   The broader impacts of this proposal can be arranged in two main categories: mentoring and outreach.  The PI will create a mentoring system for the students of the Mathematics Department at Utah State University, with the aim of providing students skills to help them succeed in future academic pursuits.  The outreach component of this grant is to organize a Moab Topology Conference which will allow students and postdocs to attend and present their research, while also interacting with leading experts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first main theme of the proposed research is further exploration of the PI's re-normalized Reshetikhin-Turaev 3-manifold invariants in the context of the Volume Conjecture.  In particular, he proposes to develop a theory of refined re-normalized 3-manifold invariants, leading to new invariants which are computable and catch novel geometric features.  The proposed research will also focus on continuing the PI's creation and study of new Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs) arising from re-normalized invariants.  A final theme of the proposed research is to widen the PI's development and inspection of the Levin-Wen models.  He proposes to continue to use known mathematical techniques to interpret physical properties which were not previously detected in the L-W models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As a pure mathematician, I am often asked the following questions about my work:   I thought all mathematics was understood, what kind of research is there to do in mathematics?  Are your research papers just really big equations?  The answers to these questions are surprising to most people.  First, there is a huge beautiful world of unknown mathematics waiting to be discovered or created.    Second, the world of pure mathematics is rooted in words and ideas rather than numbers and algebraic equations.  At first glance these words and ideas seem foreign and unrelated to the natural world.  However, pure mathematics is the language of modern physics.  This relationship is a miracle that is not well understood, but is productively used.  My research is centered in this context.  In particular, I am creating new mathematics with the aim of understanding physical phenomena.  One of the fundamental ways mathematics arises in nature is through geometry and more generally topology.  In particular, geometric objects called manifolds are used to model space and time in general relativity.  Surprisingly, manifolds can be studied by knots and more generally links.  Knots appear in many places ranging from everyday items such as tied shoe laces to string theory and protein folding.  In mathematics, knots and links are fundamental basic objects in topology.  Knots as mathematical objects have been studied since the 19th century.  More recently, with the influx of quantum field theory into topology, the past two decades have seen the emergence of a revolutionary point of view in the theory of links and 3-manifold invariants.  The discovery of the Jones polynomial by V. Jones in 1984 and its 3-dimensional quantum field theory interpretation by E. Witten in 1989 have opened the door for the use of new algebraic techniques to study topology.  These developments led to a new branch of mathematics known as "quantum topology.''  This area has connections to theoretical physics, including quantum gravity, topological quantum field theory and quantum computing.    A principal feature of quantum topology is its interplay between topology and representation theory (or more generally abstract algebra).  The work of NSF grant DMS-1452093 is centered around this interplay.  The productive interplay between quantum topology and quantum algebra has been used extensively.  Within this context the Principal Investigator and his collaborators have given new systematic strategies to define re-normalized quantum invariants.  These strategies produce non-trivial invariants when the standard approaches fail.  The intellectual merit of this grant focused on understanding the geometric meaning of these re-normalized invariants.  The two main broader impacts of this grant are: (1) Made educational podcasts for calculus and developed a graduate mentoring system at USU. To produce the podcasts, the Principal Investigator worked with his graduate students Brandon Ashley and Kaitlin Murphy. Both students have won several teaching awards and Ashley was awarded the university wide 2019 "USU Graduate Student Teacher of the Year." (2)  The Principal Investigator was co-Organizer of the 2019 Moab Topology Conference.       Last Modified: 10/29/2020       Submitted by: Nathan C Geer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
