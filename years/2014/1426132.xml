<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks to use continuous u-channel and discrete paleomagnetic data in combination with color analysis and shipboard data to develop chronological and climate data on the Quaternary contourite section cored during IODP exp. 339.The magnetic data will enable development of a detailed regional type section of Quaternary geomagnetic field variability with implications for both geochronology and larger questions concerning the nature of the magnetic field and geodynamo. Five sites cored during exp. 339 will be examined and preliminary data suggests that magnetic properties can be correlated from hole-to-hole. The thickness of the Quaternary record and overall high sedimentation rates could make these cores particularly amenable to this type of detailed analysis. This study, in combination with isotopic, astronomic, and stratigraphic analysis will enable construction of an exceptionally detailed chronology which can then be tied to climate models, especially those related to thermohaline circulation. This is directly related to the primary objective of exp. 339 which is the development and constraint of models relating saline Mediterranean outflow to climate variations and events. In the modern Atlantic, this outflow has important effects of the circulation of deep ocean water. The understanding of these circulation patterns is one important element of predicting global climate variations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 339 cored multiple sites along the margins of Spain and Portugal to investigate the paleoclimatic influence of the discharge of warm and salty Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) into the Atlantic Ocean. As the MOW current flowed out of the Straits of Gibraltar and along the Iberian Peninsula, it deposited sediments, which have accumulated over the past 5 million years into thick sedimentary sections. The strength and position of the MOW current through time can be reconstructed using proxy data such as changes in sediment grain size and composition.</p> <p>Our study uses the variations in magnetic properties (magnetic composition, concentration, and grain size) of the sediments as indicators of changes in the strength of the MOW currents over time. Magnetic concentration highs are found to correlate with Heinrich events (cold periods with massive iceberg discharges) and the lows correlate with Greenland interstadials (warm periods). These peaks and troughs can be further correlated among the other Expedition 339 sites down to depths of about 100 meters below seafloor, spanning about the past 250 k.y., allowing comparison of paleocurrent strength and position along the Iberian Margin through time (see Figure 1, which shows the correlation of magnetic susceptibility from one site to another, and Figure 2, which shows the correlation of the susceptibility at drill site U1385 to North Greenland Ice Core Project [NGRIP] oxygen isotope record, where high values correspond to warmer intervals than the low values). Similar to the physical grain size of the sediment, coarser magnetic grain sizes are associated with turbiditic intervals, which were deposited when MOW current speeds were high. Thus, we can use the size of the magnetic grains as an indicator of current speed.</p> <p>Our study also uses the paleomagnetic (ancient magnetic) directions recorded in the sediments as they were deposited to determine the ages of the sediments. From these data, we established an accurate age model for the sedimentary section at Site U1387, which was used to determine that weak flow between the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean began immediately after the Pliocene-Miocene boundary (5.3 Ma), which marks the opening of the Gibraltar Straits (van der Schee et al., 2016, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.margeo.2016.04.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.margeo.2016.04.005</a>).</p> <p>This NSF funded project provided a research experience for 16 undergraduate students at Sam Houston State University, who were majoring in geology, physics, or geography. In addition, data from this project was used in classes to teach students about data processing, data mining, and general geophysical methods. One of the main outcomes from the work of the students was to establish best practices for measuring the high- and low-frequency susceptibility accurately on sediments with low susceptibility in order to determine the concentration of extremely small magnetic grain sizes (&lt;30 nanometers). The students found that these tiny particles only have significant concentrations in the upper 30 m or so of the stratigraphic sections. The abundance of these tiny grains appears to be controlled mostly by a chemical reaction (reduction diagenesis), probably facilitated by bacteria. This process possibly spans the upper 100 m, with the tiniest magnetite grains being gradually consuming in the upper 30 m and then larger grains of magnetite being gradually consumed until magnetite is nearly depleted at depths 100 mbsf. Because magnetite is the main source of the magnetic susceptibility signal, this explains the very low susceptibility values that occur below 100 mbsf.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/06/2019<br>      Modified by: Gary&nbsp;Acton</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1426132/1426132_10284636_1559861020478_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1426132/1426132_10284636_1559861020478_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1426132/1426132_10284636_1559861020478_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Correlation of magnetic susceptibility from one site to another along the margin of Spain and Portugal.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Gary D.
