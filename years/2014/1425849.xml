<AbstractNarration>Climate changes leading to new migrations of hosts that viruses require for transmission is causing serious new outbreaks of viruses that threaten agriculture throughout the world. How viruses naturally cross species barriers and evolve to populate new hosts is a key theme of the Plant Virology Satellite Saturday Symposium. This grant is to help support travel for 10 graduate students/postdoctoral fellows to attend the Plant Virology Satellite Saturday Symposium at the 33rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Virology (ASV), which will take place from June 21-25, 2014 at Colorado State University.  Attending top meetings in their fields, such as the annual meeting of ASV, is critical for students as they learn new research, expand their scientific thinking, network with peers and meet top researchers in the field of virology. The Satellite Symposium, entitled: Viruses in a Transitioning World: Species Jumping and Emerging Plant and Animal Viruses is sponsored by the Plant Virology Club, an organization within the American Society of Virology that was initiated to support research and speakers at the annual meeting who focus on plant viruses. Because of the world class reputations of both the animal and plant virologists who will be presenting at the Symposium, a large audience of students and researchers in both animal and plant virology is expected. This should result in a broadening of the appreciation of research fields regardless of the host and hopefully foster new areas of communication within the broad field of virology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This request is for funds to help provide for travel fellowships for graduate students/post-doctoral fellows who are currently conducting research in plant/insect/fungal viruses that will support their attendance at the conference. Attention will be paid to distribution of the travel awards to labs in all regions of the US, and preference will be given to students/postdocs who are underrepresented minorities, women and persons with disabilities. Providing support to allow these young investigators to attend the satellite meeting and the larger ASV meeting should encourage them to have excellent interactions with the larger viral scientific community and make connections that will be useful for their future work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Conferences that intermix talks on animal and plant viruses are rare (e.g., the Plus-strand RNA Virus meetings every three years), and the vast majority of talks even at these meetings continue to focus on animal viruses. The Plant Satellite Symposium was thus organized as a cross-talk meeting.  The title of the symposium was:  Viruses in a Transitioning World: Species Jumping and Emerging Plant and Animal Viruses. The symposium was divided into two main areas: Wild-domestic interactions and Reemerging viruses in domestic hosts. Climate changes leading to new migrations of vectors that viruses require for transmission is causing serious new outbreaks of viruses that threaten agriculture throughout the world. In particular, whitefly transmitted geminiviruses (begomoviruses) and thrip-transmitted tosposviruses have emerged as major threats to crop production. As humans populate new and denser environments, and the world becomes more connected, the exposure to emergent animal and human viruses such as influenza, HIV, SARS, Ebola, and MERS, have already caused millions of deaths and promise more devastation in the future. How viruses naturally cross species barriers and evolve to populate new hosts was a key theme of the symposium.       The award provided funds to help defray the cost for 10 graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in non-animal virus labs to support their attendance at the conference.      The Plant Virology Club (PVC), which sponsored this event, is an organization within the American Society of Virology that was initiated to support research and speakers at the annual meeting who focus on plant viruses.  The Symposium this past year was organized by Dr. Anne Simon, the elected Plant Virus Councilor and the PI of this award.  Dr. Simon has worked throughout her career to bring together researchers working on plant and animal viruses and to make animal virus researchers more aware of the exciting work that uses plant viruses as models.  Most virologists receive their graduate education in Medical Schools, which nearly uniformly ignore research that pertains to plant viruses.  Similarly, most students studying plant viruses are educated in plant pathology departments that likewise spend little time on animal viruses.       Students selected for the travel awards came from labs throughout the country as follows:  California (3), Maryland (2), Kentucky (1), Ohio (1), Oklahoma (1), Colorado  (1), Iowa (1).   The requirement was that the students be engaged in research in the field of Plant Virology.  Each of the students received $600 to help defray expenses in attending the conference.  With the current paucity of funds in this field, these funds made the difference in the ability of many of these students being able to attend this important annual conference and present their research.  The 10 recipients of the travel awards joined nearly 140 additional attendees in listening to world class Virologists make connections between fields to stimulate ideas and broaden their appreciation of research fields regardless of the host and foster new areas of communication within the broad field of Virology.  The feedback received from the speakers and audience members was that this was one of the satellite symposium ever attended at ASV and a highlight of the 2014 meeting.
