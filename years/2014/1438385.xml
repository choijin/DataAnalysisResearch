<AbstractNarration>Title: Electrochemical Conversion of Carbon Dioxide and Nitrogen to High-Value Products Using Engineered Metal-Ligand Interfaces &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plants do a wonderful job of converting gases like carbon dioxide and nitrogen into products like cellulose and nutrients.   The reactions are driven by sunlight and provide a critical balance to life - including oxygen in the atmosphere and our food supply.   In the last century, man is responsible for significant changes in the balance; atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have risen by about 30% and more than 50% of the world population now relies on man-made fertilizers for food.  Unfortunately, there are no commercial processes that can duplicate the ability of nature to use sunlight, atmospheric gases and water to make fuels, plastics or fertilizers. However, this remains a grand challenge for science and technology and efforts to achieve some measure of success still require funding. This GOALI award is made to a team comprised of Professors John Flake and Ye Xu and Dr. Joe Sauer of Louisiana State University and A&amp;M College and Dr. Anne Sauer of Albemarle Corporation.  The aim of this work is to mimic nature and design new catalysts that can produce valuable products from these basic feedstocks.  Catalyst surfaces and interfaces will be created using highly active metal clusters and functional ligand molecules that promote the selective formation of one particular product over another.   The energy to power the reaction is ideally provided solely by electricity from solar or wind energy (no fossil fuels).  The research will shed light on the fundamental behavior of electrocatalysts and the team of academic and industry investigators will work to commercialize "green" processes to make chemicals, fertilizers and fuels using purely renewable resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goals of this project are to: (1) build a fundamental framework for understanding the behavior of ligand-functionalized metal nanoclusters as electrocatalysts and (2) leverage this understanding to create electrocatalysts by design.  The team will explore the roles of metal type, nanocluster size, ligand chemistry and their behavior in electrolytic reactions using a combined theoretical and experimental approach. While there has been a renewed interest in electrochemical CO2 reduction in recent years (including for solar fuels), the reaction pathways and selectivity-controlling mechanisms are not well understood.  Likewise, the mechanisms involved in N2 reduction are also poorly understood. The investigators will explore reduction pathways as a function of nanocluster size/type (Au, Ag, Cu, Ni, Fe) and ligand chemistry (e.g. thiols, sulfides, amides, amines, imines and other sulfo- or amino-functional groups) using voltammetry, surface analyses and other product characterization tools.  The work will include a special in-operando spectroscopic study of electrocatalytic reactions using synchrotron-source XANES (X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy) analysis to probe reactions as they occur.  These experimental results will be complemented by density functional theory (DFT) based modeling techniques to generate an in-depth understanding of the nature of the active electrode interface, the key steps in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 and N2, and the cooperative effects between the electrode and the ligand.  The versatility and accuracy of modern DFT methods will be leveraged to identify the fundamental factors that systematically control the efficiency and selectivity of the reactions, and subsequently to predict the performance of new electrode/ligand combinations.  Results from this work will yield new insights into reactions mechanisms, a framework for predicting and controlling selectivity, and new electrocatalysts to produce fuels, fertilizers, and chemicals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  Nature provides wonderful examples for conversion of Carbon Dioxide to hydrocarbons and fixation of Nitrogen using only air, water and sunlight. At the molecular level, both reduction reactions use enzymes (with ligated-metal nanoclusters) to promote the highly efficient and selective formation of one particular product. Inspired by this, our team advanced the understanding the role of metal type, nanocluster size, ligand chemistry and their behaviors in selective electrolytic reduction reactions using a combined simulation (DFT) and experiment approach. Project uncovered insights on ligand-metal interaction in electrochemical reduction.  Intellectual Merit  There has been a renewed interest in electrochemical CO2 reduction (including solar fuels); however, the reduction pathways and selectivity-controlling mechanisms are not well understood. Catalysts with best performance are still limited to the 2-electron products CO and HCOOH mainly due to the constrains from scaling relationship between Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and CO hydrogenation reaction at transition metal electrodes. Here we explore the function of ligand in transcending the limitation.   Experimentally, we evaluated functional ligands on metals including self-assembled monolayers:  Phenyl- moieties functionalized metal electrodes showed dramatic changes in selectivity from competing HER to CO evolution in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), which shows the potential of ligand dependent selectivity modification at the molecular level. Complementary theoretical work has shown that thiol ligand-induced surface reconstruction plays a dominant role in the observed modification to the activity and selectivity of CO2RR on Au electrodes.  The charge redistribution with phenyl ligand created a favored environment that favors the interaction with CO2 reduction intermediates (COOH) over hydrogen evolution. Ligands that are tethered to Au via different atoms (e.g. S vs. C) have different stability and are suitable as electrode modifiers in different electrolytes.  Pyridine moieties, on the other hand, shift the selectivity toward formate evolution from CO evolution which improves liquid fuel synthesis.  Butler-Volmer analysis suggests mechanistic modification to favor proton coupled electron transfer for CO2RR. This ligand facilitated mechanistic preference for hydrogenation reaction further indicates possible CO hydrogenation transcending scaling limitations.  The interface with carbon supported Pd nanoparticle and siloxane functionalized silica powder was engineered based on the ligand facilitated proton transfer mechanism. A six-fold enhancement in selectivity and up to four times in yield for CH3OH production was observed compared with Pd nanoparticle.   Results from this work provide a better framework for engineering selectivity-controlled catalysis for renewable fuels and chemical synthesis with the separation of metal-supported electron transfer coupled with ligand-facilitated proton donate.     Broader Impacts  More than 99% of world?s vehicles are powered by fossil fuels (either directly or indirectly) which is responsible for several billions metric tons of CO2 added to the atmosphere each year. These numbers are staggering from any perspective, but are particularly concerning with respect to sustainability and climate change. Liquid chemical fuels are the best sustainable alternative for fuel supply.
