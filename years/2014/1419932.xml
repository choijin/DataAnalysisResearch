<AbstractNarration>This is a project to develop a new technology for temperature profiling from super-pressure balloons that fly along constant density surfaces, typically in the stratosphere.  The sensor is a fiber-optic temperature profiler (FTP), consisting of a 2-4km length of optical fiber suspended from the gondola of a balloon.  Temperature is determined along the length of the fiber from the backscatter returned from a laser pulse injected at the top of the fiber.  Changes in the temperature of the fiber lead to changes in Raman scattering (particularly the wavelengths of the stokes and anti-stokes lines), which can be inverted to retrieve temperature, and the timing of the laser pulses can be used to ascribe  the temperature measurement to a specific linear position along the fiber.  This technology is currently used for industrial applications (e.g. borehole temperature sensing in oil and gas drilling operations), and the sensors are commercially available.  However, it requires substantial enhancement before it can be deployed from a balloon gondola.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the core instrument, several other components must be developed to form a complete system.  One of these is an end-of-fiber module which is weighted  to make the fiber hang more or less vertically and contains a thermometer and a GPS receiver.  The GPS receiver determines the position of the bottom end of the fiber, which is combined with a position fix from a GPS receiver in the gondola to estimate the altitudes of the temperature readings.  Additional components include a data and control system and a fiber deployment system, the latter consisting of a spool that reels out the fiber once the balloon reaches altitude.  Funds provided here will be used to develop a prototype and conduct a test flight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has scientific broader impacts due to the wide variety of potential applications of the system.  The primary intended use of the system is for sounding the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL).  There is considerable interest in the fine-scale temperature structure of the TTL, particularly as it relates to issues including the difference between cloud-top height and the height of the cold-point tropical tropopause, the minimum temperature of the TTL and its role in limiting the transport of water vapor into the stratosphere, and the temperature perturbations associated with vertically propagating gravity waves.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ High-resolution measurements of atmospheric temperature profiles are a challenging yet important part of understanding the structure of our atmosphere and the dynamical processes that drive these structures.   This project has demonstrated a new technique for make measurements of atmospheric temperature profiles using distributed temperature sensing.    A new instrument, the Fiber-optic Laser Operated Atmospheric Temperature Sensor (FLOATS) was developed and a prototype of this instrument was successfully flown on multiple high altitude balloon flights.   The FLOATS instrument works by injecting pulses of laser light into an optical fiber suspended in the region of the atmosphere of interest, the scattering of the light by the glass of the fiber is a function of temperature, and by observing this scattering the temperature of the fiber can be determined as a function of distance along the fiber.  While there are many possible applications of this technique in the atmospheric sciences, the FLOATS instrument was specifically designed to measure the temperature of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere &ndash; a region of the atmosphere with a large impact on the radiative balance of the atmosphere.   The suitability of the FLOATS instrument for measuring this region of the atmosphere was demonstrated through multiple high altitude balloon flights.  On these flights the temperature profiles obtained from FLOATS were compared with those measured by radiosondes and satellite measurements.    FLOATS agreed with these reference measurements to within 0.5 Kelvin, with a vertical resolution of 2m.   In addition to these flights, the FLOATS instrument was operated at a 300m tall meteorological tower and compared to reference temperature sensors on the tower, also with good agreement.  These tests demonstrated the ability of the instrument to operate autonomously for months at a time.     The successful demonstration of the application of distributed temperature sensing to temperature profile measurements in the free atmosphere, and specifically the performance on the FLOATS instrument. has lead to the inclusion of this instrument in the payload plan for a pioneering mission to study the tropical tropopause layer form a constellation of long duration super pressure balloons circling the earth.
