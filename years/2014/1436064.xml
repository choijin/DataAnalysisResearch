<AbstractNarration>Steel is a metallic material with iron and carbon as the primary components.  The properties of steel can vary greatly depending on carbon level and processing.  Steels with ultra-high carbon levels behave more like ceramics than metals; they are extremely hard and very brittle.  These steels are primarily utilized in tool components to shape softer steels and other metals, but could see greater usage if their brittleness can be reduced.  To date, brittleness has been reduced by cycles of heating and forming, methods that are challenging to implement on a large production scale.  It is possible to decrease brittleness in these materials by simply heating alone; however existing heat treatments are energy intensive and far from optimized.  This award supports fundamental research on the structural transformation behavior of ultra-high carbon steels during heating.  The research utilizes novel experimental methods to observe changes to the steel structure in real time during heating and to develop new metrics that can be used to optimize processing and properties.  These fundamental studies will lead to improved heat treatment strategies that will enable production of ultra-high carbon steels with improved combinations of properties while also reducing energy usage.  Results from this research will also introduce materials science undergraduate students to fundamental topics of modern steelmaking and an outreach component will expose middle and high school students to digital image analysis and methods used to characterize materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultra-high carbon steels can exhibit superior hardness and strength compared to other steels of lower carbon contents.  However, the high fraction of carbides in these steels render them too brittle for many structural applications.  This project seeks to investigate microstructural transformations at elevated temperatures in steels containing ultrahigh carbon contents (1.7-2.3 weight percent) and the impact of these transformations on mechanical properties: toughness, hardness, strength and ductility.  This study will apply in-situ confocal scanning laser microscopy and ex-situ electron microscopy to study and quantify microstructural evolution, specifically examining the effects of time, temperature and alloy chemistry on carbide dissolution kinetics and their final distribution in heat treated steels.  A comprehensive assessment of important mechanical properties will be correlated to the final microstructural state.  These pursuits will result in an analytical model that can accurately describe carbide dissolution and precipitation behavior at temperature ranges employed for heat treatments of ultra-high carbon steels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project examined ultra-high carbon steels during heat treatment.  These materials contain approximately 2 wt% carbon.  They are very hard and very strong, but are also brittle.  We focused on the features of these materials that cause them to be brittle.   We examined how processing methods and steel chemistry can influence these features.  First we developed an image analysis tool to identify and measure these features from scanning electron and optical microscope images.  This image analysis approach was automated so that many images could be examined.  Then we examined how microstructures change over a range of heat treatment conditions and identified the rate at which these changes occurred.  This study produced over 900 microscope images that were used by a colleague in a separate project to automatically identify material features from images using machine learning methods.  The final aspect of this work identified the effects of niobium additions to the steel.  Additions of niobium can improve ductility, but our work showed that processing conditions, specifically solidification rate, must be considered when deciding how much niobium is needed to modify the material.  This project has involved two graduate students and one undergraduate student.  The students were trained in ferrous physical metallurgy, electron microscopy, and image analysis. One graduate student completed his Ph.D. thesis during this project, with a second graduate student contributing some of the digital image processing and analysis work.  Additionally, one undergraduate student was supported on a REU for two summers to contribute additional programming and microscopy for the digital image processing of micrographs of the steel microstructure.      5 peer-reviewed publications were produced along with three scientific presenations and two poster presentations.  The Ph.D. student primarily supported by this project received one award (Microscopy and Microanalysis Presidential award) and two poster awards.     A middle school outreach program called PICSELS (PICtures for Seeing Extremely Little Stuff) was designed to teach students the basics of image formation and how materials engineers use images in their jobs.  This course was 1 week in duration and featured as part of a summer outreach program at Carnegie Mellon University.  Approximately 12 middle school students learned about basic optics, the physics of color, the concepts of pixels and digital information, properties of waves, optical microscopy of various samples (onion cells, microbes, microfeatures in currency, spider silk, structure of flowers), image processing and facial recognition.
