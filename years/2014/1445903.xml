<AbstractNarration>This award, cofunded by Systems and Synthetic Biology/MCB, Science,Technology and Society/SES, and Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering/CBET, will support a workshop that addresses societal issues associated with the emerging technology, synthetic biology. Synthetic biology is often defined as the design (or re-design) of biological parts, devices, and systems, toward a useful purpose.  Societal questions about the governance of synthetic biology, as well as questions about its ethical dimensions and visions of its desirable futures are important projects for systematic inquiry.  Societal research on synthetic biology is crucial for its responsible development.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be held at Arizona State University (ASU) in Tempe, AZ, 4-6 November 2014.  The workshop will gather approximately 75 social scientists, humanists, scientists and engineers who are working in the area of synthetic biology and related emerging technologies. Through drafting assignments prior to the workshop, an engaging combination of plenaries, break-out activities, and ambiance at the workshop, and aggressive and varied outreach afterward, the workshop conveners will articulate, and disseminate community-generated ideas for research on the societal aspects of synthetic biology. The issues the workshop plans to explore include: biosafety and biosecurity, ethics, sustainability, DIY/makers, public opinion and values, research and innovations systems analysis, integration and reflexivity, anticipation and futures, informal science education, international and inter-agency collaboration, risk, and governance. The workshop is designed to raise and attend to other issues that emerge through discussion.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Project Outcomes Report for the Workshop on Research Agendas in the Societal Aspects of Synthetic Biology     Personalized healthcare, renewable biofuels, pest-resistant crops, greener chemicals, disease elimination, and de-extinction of species cover only a portion of the promise synthetic biology holds to transform society. Along with these desirable outcomes, however, also comes the potential for unintended and possibly negative consequences. Furthermore, creating, cloning, and tinkering with life forms, as well as the publicÆs expanding access to conducting synthetic biology research and development themselves, raises numerous safety and ethical considerations.     To help articulate these societal concerns surrounding synthetic biology and develop research agendas to address them, this project convened an intensive two-day workshop November 4 &ndash; 6, 2014, in Tempe, Arizona.  The workshop brought together approximately 115 participants representing academia, industry, government, and nonprofits to review the current state of research, identify gaps, and provide direction for moving forward.     Including eight plenary lectures, a poster session, and breakout working groups, the workshop enabled participants to share a broad range of opinions surrounding the areas of safety and security; ethics; governance; sustainability; the economy, public engagement and opinion; futures and anticipation; mid-research adaptability; innovation systems and pathways; international and interdisciplinary research collaboration; and formal and informal science education as these topics relate to synthetic biology in particular and emerging technologies in general.     The primary outcome of the workshop, a comprehensive collection of educational and guidance materials focusing not only on what research needs to be done, but how it should be done, is available on a public website:  http://cns.asu.edu/synbio. The site includes 69 background papers addressing what research we should be doing, 17 posters on current or recently completed research, videos of workshop presentations, graphic recordings of the presentations, interviews with workshop attendees, a bibliography, a glossary, reflections on the workshop, and workshop reports and evaluations.     Included in the culminating workshop report for NSF is a list of key questions and challenges that were identified during the workshop and which could be used as a template or sample language for future requests for proposals.     Additional outcomes include a special "Perspectives" section in the March 2015 issue of the Journal of Responsible Innovation on responsible research and innovation for synthetic biology, which was edited by project co-PI Brian and features 17 commentaries written by workshop participants. On April 24, 2015, PI Guston and co-PI Brian presented workshop findings at the New Tools for Science Policy breakfast seminar held at the ASU Washington, DC Center.
