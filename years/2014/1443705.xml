<AbstractNarration>Marine communities along the western Antarctic Peninsula are highly productive ecosystems which support a diverse assemblage of charismatic animals such as penguins, seals, and whales as well as commercial fisheries such as that on Antarctic krill. Fjords (long, narrow, deep inlets of the sea between high cliffs) along the central coast of the Peninsula appear to be intense, potentially climate sensitive, hotspots of biological production and biodiversity, yet the structure and dynamics of these fjord ecosystems are very poorly understood. Because of this intense biological activity and the charismatic fauna it supports, these fjords are also major destinations for a large Antarctic tourism industry. This project is an integrated field and modeling program to evaluate physical oceanographic processes, glacial inputs, water column community dynamics, and seafloor bottom community structure and function in these important yet little understood fjord systems. These Antarctic fjords have characteristics that are substantially different from well-studied Arctic fjords, likely yielding much different responses to climate warming. This project will provide major new insights into the dynamics and climate sensitivity of Antarctic fjord ecosystems, highlighting contrasts with Arctic sub-polar fjords, and potentially transforming our understanding of the ecological role of fjords in the rapidly warming west Antarctic coastal marine landscape. The project will also further the NSF goal of training new generations of scientists, providing scientific training for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students. This includes the unique educational opportunity for undergraduates to participate in research cruises in Antarctica and the development of a novel summer graduate course on fjord ecosystems. Internet based outreach activities will be enhanced and extended by the participation of a professional photographer who will produce magazine articles, websites, radio broadcasts, and other forms of public outreach on the fascinating Antarctic ecosystem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will involve a 15-month field program to test mechanistic hypotheses concerning oceanographic and glaciological forcing, and phytoplankton and benthic community response in the Antarctic fjords. Those efforts will be followed by a coupled physical/biological modeling effort to evaluate the drivers of biogeochemical cycles in the fjords and to explore their potential sensitivity to enhanced meltwater and sediment inputs. Fieldwork over two oceanographic cruises will utilize moorings, weather stations, and glacial, sea-ice and seafloor time-lapse cameras to obtain an integrated view of fjord ecosystem processes. The field team will also make multiple shipboard measurements and will use towed and autonomous underwater vehicles to intensively evaluate fjord ecosystem structure and function during spring/summer and autumn seasons. These integrated field and modeling studies are expected to elucidate fundamental properties of water column and sea bottom ecosystem structure and function in the fjords, and to identify key physical-chemical-glaciological forcing in these rapidly warming ecosystems.</AbstractNarration>

The landcape is restricted to rocks and ice, with a few mosses and lichens where the ice melts in the summer, without bushes, grasses or trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this stark but beautiful setting the coastal ocean receives the water that melts from nearby glaciers. These are rivers of ice bringing frozen water down the mountains, through valleys, to the ocean. In polar regions like Antarctica, the glaciers reach all the way to the seashore, the ice is in contact with the ocean, and the melting of ice happens right at the shore. Whales congregate at these coastal fjords, also penguins and seals abound (Figure 2), suggesting plenty of food must be available.&nbsp;&nbsp;Animals that live on the seafloor in these fjords are unusually abundant and with large bodies, compared to other animals of the same species that live further offshore. Our question was then, why are these coasts so productive?&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As most of the productivity in the ocean is sustained by microalgae, unicellular plants that live at the surface of the ocean, what is the role they play in sustaining high fjord productivity? A group of biologists, glaciologists and physical oceanographer decided to collaborate in answering this question and based on what we knew of the polar microalgae, or phytoplankton, and the fjords in general we formulated three hypotheses that were tested during two research cruises to Andvord Bay in the west Antarctic Peninsula. This fjord was chosen as a model system for the region, what we learn from Andvord Bay can be extended to other fjords.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>These Antarctic fjords, next to glaciers, are indeed locations of high primary productivity due to a combination of biological, chemical and physical factors, all working together to create a rich environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;The productivity is maintained by diatoms, a group of microalgae that have carbon-rich cells and are able to photosynthesize at a high rate (Figure 3). Diatoms inside the fjords maintain a rate of productivity higher than in more offshore waters of Antarctica, even the rich continental shelf of the western Antarctic Peninsula. Chemically, glaciers are a source of sediments and Fe, that is exported out by currents, thus the fjords are a source of Fe to the continental shelf. The biological and chemical processes are supported by freshwater input from glaciers at the ice-ocean interface that can actively mix, bringing nutrients, or fertilizers, from depth into surface water where there is light, supporting phytoplankton photosynthesis.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As in other projects, we also obtained new, unexpected insights. We learned that unknown species (Figure 4)can be responsible for phytoplankton blooms in these WAP fjords, i.e., responsible for cycling large amounts of organic carbon.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also learned that fine sediments found within freshwater plumes can be modeled by their optical properties, opening a new way of detecting meltwater from space (Figure 5). A most intriguing result is the interplay between nitrogen sources and iron for phytoplankton growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, nutrient concentration is the variable used to assess phytoplankton health in Antarctic waters. However, our results suggest concentration of nutrient is not enough as an indicator and we have developed the alternative hypothesis that the proportion of nitrate to iron is critical in Antarctica. Finally, in our interest to apply the best technology to analyze our data, we have interacted with a private company to test machine-learning models developed for self-driving cars for environmental applications.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We established a Citizen Science project, FjordPhyto, in collaboration with the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO).&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 3,000 guests have participated in phytoplankton sampling in the western Antarctic Peninsula fjords (Figure 6).&nbsp;&nbsp;With an instrument kit we provide, the guests, as instructed by the ship?s science guides, sample for phytoplankton, temperature and salinity of the ocean water.
