<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to employ a novel mathematical paradigm, known as a differential variational inequality (DVI), to study two fundamental problems in transportation analysis, namely, the continue-time dynamic user equilibrium with flow propagation and delays, and the problem of traffic disequilibrium in the face of network disruption. Our aim is to develop a nonlinear dynamical system theory that combines classical ordinary differential equation (ODE) methods with contemporary mathematical programming advances to study the equilibrium of short-time (e.g. within-day dynamics) and the equilibration process of longer-time (e.g. transient dynamics) traffic flows, answering questions such as: how to compute dynamic user equilibria, how traffic evolves from a disequilibrium state, due to network disruptions, toward an equilibrium, and how close the current traffic state is to an equilibrium. Results from this study will lead to a new paradigm integrating traffic network analysis methods with recent advances in mathematical science, and bridge the gaps between current practice of traffic analysis and the needs to consider short-term and long-term traffic dynamics in a holistic manner.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be the first step to develop a mathematical framework for traffic dynamic analysis that, in a long term, has the potential to revolutionize the traditional way of conducting transportation analyses such as network signal optimization, dynamic congestion pricing, emergency management after disruptions, among others. Since equilibrium analysis and system dynamics are widely used in other science and engineering fields, the concepts and methodologies developed in this research can also provide new perspectives for equilibrium based analysis in these fields. The research team plans to integrate research findings to undergraduate and graduate courses, and involve undergraduate and graduate students with multidisciplinary backgrounds in this research. The team also plans to reach out to policy makers and practitioners at various transportation management agencies for whom findings from the proposed research will enable them to better manage transportation systems.</AbstractNarration>

Beginning with a careful formulation of the continuous dynamic user equilibrium as a DVI, we designed numerical methods to solve the problem, analyzed the convergence the discretization schemes, and implementd and test the methods on some realistic traffic networks existed in the literature. Each of these tasks has its own challenging characteristics.  As the overall traffic problem is highly complex and its mathematical formulation involves delay differential equations, nonlinearities, and disjunctive conditions, to name a few of the challenges, the derived model has to be numerically tractable and practically implementable. The realism of the end model, its practical tractability, and the ability to analyze the model are the guiding principles throughout the research of this project.  We have derived improved point queue models to describe traffic flow propagation that remedy a major deficiency in a well-known model existing in the literature.  We have introduced and analyzed an optimal control problem as the mathematical formulation of the continuous-time dynamic system optimization problem for single-destination traffic networks with queue spillbacks, and implemented a time-discretization method for solving this problem.  We have proposed a fairly advanced differential complementarity system model that integrates capacitated queue dynamics and spillbacks from downstream links to upstream links.  The departure-time choice and user route choices and other equilibrium conditions are included to complete the model. Numerical tests are developed to illustrate the application of this model.  The significance of this work is that all the mentioned features are captured in a single mathematical model amenable to rigorous treatment and solution. This is a milestone in the research of traffic equilibrium problems as existing studies have only considered these features separately to which heuristics and ad hoc schemes were proposed without careful analysis.
