<AbstractNarration>Doctoral candidate Caroline Antonelli (University at Albany-SUNY) will evaluate the sustainability of diverse agricultural systems employed by farmers in pre-modern urban settings focusing on the late prehistoric Mesoamerican site of Mayapan. Food supply challenges faced by residents of ancient cities were especially acute in fragile environmental contexts characterized by chronic instability. This study investigates the diverse and complex methods employed by past agriculturalists that helped to mitigate risks and contribute toward stable, enduring urban political economies in relatively extreme environmental settings. Diversity in agricultural practices was manifested by a gardening-to-farming continuum involving plots that graded from small, urban gardens to larger, distant cultivation zones just beyond the urban sprawl. This study will determine the duration and intensity of cultivation of specific types of crops, the productive potential of local soils, human impacts to the environment in the form of degradation or engineered improvements to soil, and the exploitation of contrastive natural microenvironments formed by differences in soil, elevation, and moisture. Archaeological science is uniquely positioned to reconstruct and analyze the impacts of long-term human-environmental relationships and to present useful applications of these findings to traditional farmers in marginal, impoverished zones of the world today, including the study area including this rural locality of the northwest Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. This region is one of the driest zones in southern Mexico and historical records attest to the regularity of droughts and hurricanes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study area was long thought to be of dismal agrarian potential, despite the seeming contradiction that this zone was home to numerous large cities and extensive rural populations through time, including the present day. This investigation will be the first to systematically reconstruct the array of urban-to-rural agrarian strategies and landscape impacts across time and space from a geoarchaeological perspective in this part of southern Mexico. A key broader impact is represented by educational outreach to local farmer communities who will benefit from knowledge concerning intensive enrichment, variable local agrarian potential, and niche cultivation practices of the past. Data for this project will derive from interdisciplinary methods in archaeology and geology, including geochemical soil composition, the USDA system of geophysical soil classification, stable isotopic analysis, remote sensing-assisted environmental mapping (Landsat satellite and LiDAR imagery), and the use of spatial and statistical software. Mayapan was the largest city of the Maya world of its time (A.D. 1200-1450) and home to a population of 20,000 residents who dwelled in a densely-packed urban zone. This city was the capital of a vast regional state and trading domain that extended from the Gulf to the Caribbean coasts, but little is known regarding its staple food supply. The issue of agricultural sustainability, especially in the face of urban growth and environmental constraints, is a problem of great interest to researchers in the social sciences and to the modern world. This project will provide important new archaeological data on long-term strategies for resiliency in human-environmental systems.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This research seeks to broaden the depth of research into the political economy of an ancient agrarian site by assessing the long-term impacts of agricultural production in the past. This report focuses on Mayapan, a Postclassic Maya site, as a case study. Soil analyses methods were used in this analysis. The resulting data includes a prediction of likely areas of ancient maize production and agrarian management techniques in the past that today have direct implications locally for modern farmers.</p> <p>In the previous report to the National Science Foundation, the results of soil typology and formation processes were discussed. Since then, elemental and carbon isotope chemistry analyses were completed. This report will focus on subsequent analyses related to the soil chemistry at the site. Two alternate hypotheses for maize production and agrarian systems at the site were formulated based on previous research in the Maya area and at Mayapan. The proposed hyotheses are as follows:</p> <p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maize farming occurred on a large-scale outside the city&rsquo;s walled center in extensively farmed plots. The chemical results that would support this hypothesis would be a lower d13C ratio in this region than in the interior of the city&rsquo;s walled center.</p> <p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maize farming occurred within a smaller intensive plots. This model closely reflects the Netting small-holder model. The chemical results that would support this hypothesis are lower d13C ratios in the city&rsquo;s wall center, where the urban population resided. While there may be areas outside this region that have low d13C values, the lack of concentrated maize farming outside the wall, would increase the overall d13C ratios.</p> <p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no observed difference, or the distribution is random of maize farming throughout the area.</p> <p>Stable Carbon Isotope soil analysis supports intensive small-holder farming at the site (second hypothesis above). A low d13C value indicates an increased maize farming through time. This process is described in detail in the previous report to the NSF. Spatial analysis confirmed low d13C values in the city&rsquo;s walled center and isolated neighborhoods outside the walled center. Control samples were taken from the top and bottom of the same units in order to evaluate deeper soil d13C values to newer, shallower soils.&nbsp; The results of sample analysis confirms that deeper soils in the same unit ( at least .3m below surface) have decreased d13C values, indicating that stable carbon isotope tests are candidates for stable carbon isotope testing (at &nbsp;.3m below surface). This is an important finding, because there were previously concerns about the rapid erosion of soils at the site.</p> <p>Other patterns were observed in d13C results. d13C values were higher in areas with cambisol soils. These are more developed red soils. These higher d13C values indicate that the cumulative amount of maize farming in areas rich in cambisols is lower than in other types of soils. Cambisol soils were sampled across the site, however, the results from these samples may be skewed because it was not possible to excavate to the bottom of these soils within the constraints of this project. Because these soils tend to erode slowly and the matrices preserve, a more thorough testing of these soils is required.&nbsp;</p> <p>Chemical testing for elemental concentrations in soils is discussed in detail in the previous submission. Elemental testing of soils results were grouped into two categories: macronutrients and non macronutrients. Principle components analysis results showed that the time elapsed since the last burning of the fields accounted for the greatest amount of variation in the elemental chemical tests in both categories. The distribution of the soil elemental testing does not appear to have a clear spatial pattern associated with ancient settlement, and instead corresponds to modern activities.&nbsp;</p> <p>More research is needed to understand the ways in which the greater rural lands of Mayapan were used. This study provides evidence that while urban land was a scarce resource, it was not scarce enough to pressure residents into turning to lands just outside the urban core for farming. This suggests that the site was able to produce or trade in ample food for its continued subsistence for the greater share of its period of occupation.</p> <p><strong>Dissemination</strong></p> <p>The results of this work are currently being prepared for dissemination in several forms. &nbsp;The primary objective is the production of a dissertation by the Co-PI, and graduate student grantee, Caroline Antonelli. The anticipated completion date for this work will be by the deadline imposed by University at Albany, SUNY for doctoral degree conferral in May 2017.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Outreach and Broader Goals</strong></p> <p>Materials have yet to be disseminated to the community local to the field site. In summer 2016 maps of soil data and vegetation productivity will be made available to the municipal government in Tecoh and to the local administration in Telchaquillo, Mexico, the communal land owners.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/08/2016<br>      Modified by: Marilyn&nbsp;Masson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1460338/1460338_10346003_1481227808955_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1460338/1460338_10346003_1481227808955_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1460338/1460338_10346003_1481227808955_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Context of Site</div> <div class="imageCredit">Antonelli</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Marilyn&nbsp;Masson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1460338/1460338_10346003_1481227862967_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1460338/1460338_10346003_1481227862967_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1460338/1460338_10346003_1481227862967_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">All sample locations and associated depth and soil type</div> <div class="imageCredit">Antonelli</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Marilyn&nbsp;Masson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1460338/1460338_10346003_1481227900263_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1460338/1460338_10346003_1481227900263_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1460338/1460338_10346003_1481227900263_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Areas with high and low concentrations of d13C values</div> <div class="imageCredit">Antonelli</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Marilyn&nbsp;Masson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 4</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1460338/1460338_10346003_1481227993334_Fig4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1460338/1460338_10346003_1481227993334_Fig4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1460338/1460338_10346003_1481227993334_Fig4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Locations of samples associated with ancient walls</div> <div class="imageCredit">Antonelli</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Marilyn&nbsp;Masson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 4</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
