<AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of US mathematicians in the 'Algebraic Lie Theory and Representation Theory' conference hosted by the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences in Edinburgh, Scotland during the week of September 1-5, 2014 and the accompanying LMS-CMI Research School for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and other young researchers hosted by the University of Glasgow in Glasgow, Scotland during the week of August 25-29, 2014.  In recent years there have been many exciting developments within algebraic Lie theory which provide significant advances and insights to the field. These innovative methods involve a mixture of combinatorial, algebraic, geometric, and topological tools.  However, the rapid progress made possible by this diversity of techniques means that even experts are not familiar with all facets of the field.  The workshop is designed to bring together leading researchers and young mathematicians from the US, Europe, and Asia so that these methods may be shared.  The research school is designed to bring young mathematicians up to speed on some of the most fruitful areas of current research.  The current schedule for the school features lecture series by Iain Gordon, Andrew Mathas, and Catharina Stroppel.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lie groups and Lie algebras have been a central theme in mathematics since their origins in the work of Sophus Lie in the late 19th century. They find profound applications in diverse areas of mathematics and physics. Their ubiquity and importance led to the expansion of Lie theory into many new areas.  This expanded area is now known as algebraic Lie theory.  Leading researchers can now be found in the US, Europe, and Asia.  The workshop and research school provide a unique opportunity for researchers from around the world to disseminate the latest results and techniques in algebraic Lie theory.  Both the workshop and research school place a strong emphasis on encouraging international collaboration and the involvement of up-and-coming researchers.  In particular, this grant will allow participation by US based mathematicians who are young researchers, from underrepresented groups, or who would otherwise be unable to attend.  It will provide a rich opportunity for US mathematicians to learn of cutting edge work and initiate international collaborations.  We anticipate this grant will have a significant impact on US based students and researchers in this exciting field.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Lie groups and Lie algebras have been a central theme in mathematics since their origins in the work of Sophus Lie in the late 19th century. In the 1950s the "analytic theory" was extended so that it also makes sense over arbitrary algebraically closed fields and spurned the area of mathematics now known as algebraic Lie theory. Nowadays Lie theory is a central area of mathematics research with diverse applications across mathematics and in the physical sciences.   The focus of this workshop was on modern innovative methods and developments in algebraic Lie theory. Recently categorification methods have led to ground-breaking progress in Lie theory and this was one of the focal topics of the workshop. Another theme of the workshop was quiver Hecke algebras (or KLR algebras). These algebras were introduced recently by Khovanov&ndash;Lauda and Rouquier, and have led to major advances and insights in the field. Also the interplay between geometric and combinatorial methods in the representation theory of Lie theoretic algebras was a central theme to the workshop.  There was a world class list of speakers including both established internationally leading researchers along with younger researchers who are likely to become leaders in the field. The workshop induced a relaxed environment for research interactions, and led to many research discussions potentially starting new research projects, as well as developing established collaborations.  There was a relaxed and engaging atmosphere at the workshop, which led to many research discussions. Throughout the week, the coffee and lunch breaks were particularly lively, with participants taking advantage of the free time to further discuss the talks, ask questions of the speakers, and further pursue ideas inspired by the lectures. These discussions were particularly helpful for junior participants, who took the opportunity to delve further into the topics of the workshop by discussing them with leading experts. They also fostered collaboration between mathematicians, with the lectures sparking ideas which were then hashed out during the breaks.   The feedback from participants about the workshop was very positive and included comments such as "The choice of speakers was excellent" and "I found the standard of the talks very high". In addition there were many informal comments at the end of the workshop about how much participants had appreciated and benefitted from the week. We received an email from one participant saying "It was really one of the best conferences for me for the last few years!".  In conjunction with the workshop, we also held a week long research school for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and other young mathematicians.  The goal was to introduce the next generation of researchers to several areas of cutting edge research in Lie theory in a way which emphasized the breadth and interconnectedness of the field.  The feedback of the research school was uniformly positive.  There is every reason to believe that the young mathematicians' participation in the research school and workshop will have a significant impact on their careers and on future advances in the field.  It is planned to create a research monograph based upon the topics of the research school suitable for others who would like to learn about central questions in modern Lie theory.  In addition, a public lecture given by Arun Ram entitled "The Glass Bead Game" was a real highlight of the workshop. In the talk Arun told some stories and explained various games, which gave insights into the topics related to the workshop. This included a novel explanation of combinatorics related to canonical bases of quantum groups. There was very positive feedback from members of the public who attended the lecture including the comment "Loved the presentation. It felt a little like an "Alice in Wonderland" tour with mathematical equations thrown in."  In total the grant supported the participation of 24 US ba...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
