<AbstractNarration>1450509&lt;br/&gt;Brown&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop on Advancing Direct Potable Reuse as a Sustainable Water Supply by Engaging the Environmental Community&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The drought in Southern California and in fact the US Southwest has stimulated people to start to discuss alternative water supplies.  One of the most sustainable supplies is the use of wastewater for direct potable reuse (DPR). DPR is the process of treating wastewater to drinkable standards and returning it into the potable supply. It is gaining attention as a supply alternative with multiple environmental benefits, particularly for arid and drought-ridden communities. However, DPR is not widely implemented in the U.S. due to gaps in technical knowledge and insufficient protocols for achieving public acceptance. The environmental community, which holds a prominent role in advocacy and public outreach, supports the development of safe, reliable, and cost effective water supply projects; however, they need more information to better understand DPR and approaches to support the implementation of DPR as a sustainable community resource. Armed with this knowledge, the environmental community can become a strong proponent of DPR within the broader community. The proposed workshop will provide an overview of current DPR research, address challenges, and recommend strategies for successful community outreach. The workshop will be held in the fall of 2015 in Southern California. Possible topic areas include DPR research and applications, regulatory issues, public health concerns, outreach challenges, and enhancing public acceptance. Invited speakers will include academics and water professionals with expertise and experience in these topic areas. Attendees will include executive directors and public outreach managers of environmental nonprofit organizations from arid states such as Arizona, California, Nevada and Texas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives and methods for the workshop include: (1) Organizing a forum for environmental groups to learn more about DPR and its role as a sustainable water supply; (2) Providing presentations by research experts on the technical and social aspects of DPR and representatives from regulatory agencies; (3) Dividing attendees into working groups to identify challenges, strategies, and solutions to help environmental groups support and advance DPR as a sustainable water supply; (4) Producing a final workshop report for dissemination among the environmental community, water agencies, and policy and decision makers. The workshop is designed to address the question, "What approaches can the environmental community implement to advance DPR as a sustainable water supply?" A final workshop report that includes summaries of the presentations, working group reports, and recommendations will be developed by Coastkeeper and NWRI and disseminated by the two groups to their respective networks within the environmental community and water industry. The workshop will bridge a gap between the scientific community (academic researchers), the engineering community (water treatment and supply agencies), the environmental community (nonprofit organizations), and policymakers. While there have been a number of recent outreach initiatives designed for academia and water professionals working in potable reuse, there has been a lack of resources designed to specifically address the environmental community's interest in sustainable communities and role in advancing DPR. The proposed workshop and final report, which will be disseminated to the environmental community, will enhance the technical and social understanding of DPR, giving practitioners and proponents the tools and knowledge necessary to achieve public acceptance and support appropriate policy measures. The societal benefits of DPR include providing a water supply resource that is locally controlled, requires less energy than other supply options (such as ocean desalination and imported deliveries), and protects oceanic and inland surface water quality by reducing wastewater discharge. The final report will enhance outreach, education, and advocacy efforts by the environmental community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Using NSF grant funding, the Orange County Coastkeeper collaborated with the National Water Research Institute (NWRI) and the California Coastkeeper Alliance to organize a workshop to define the environmental community?s role in implementing direct potable reuse (DPR), in which highly treated municipal wastewater (referred to as "advanced treated water") is added directly into a water distribution system or into a raw water supply immediately upstream of a drinking water treatment facility for the purpose of augmenting public water supplies.  DPR is gaining support throughout California and other regions in need of developing develop sustainable, reliable local supplies of water. It also has attracted the interest of the environmental community, which holds a prominent role in advocacy and public outreach and supports the development of safe, reliable, and cost-effective water supply projects.  The environmental community could play a significant role in the implementation of DPR locally and nationally in terms of increasing public knowledge, enhancing public perception, building public trust and support, and assisting with policy, research, and funding efforts for DPR projects.  The workshop was held in January 2016 at the Orange County Water District in Fountain Valley, California, drawing more than 70 participants. The objectives of the workshop included:  Provide a forum for environmental groups to learn more about DPR and its role as a sustainable water supply. Review relevant research on the technical and social aspects of DPR. Identify challenges, strategies, solutions, and messages to help environmental groups supportand advance DPR as a sustainable water supply.   There has been a lack of resources designed specifically to address the environmental community?s interest in advancing DPR as a sustainable water supply. This workshop was designed to help bridge the gap between the scientific community (i.e., academic researchers), engineering community (i.e., watertreatment and supply agencies), environmental community (i.e., nonprofit organizations), and policymakers (e.g., state and federal regulators).  Seven individuals involved in potable reuse or outreach and communication activities gave presentations at the workshop, followed by an interactive Panel discussion featuring two panelists from the environmental community and two from the water industry. The purpose of each presentation was to provide information to address the environmental community?s interest in potable reuse as a sustainable source of water supply and, in particular, the environmental community?s role in advancingthe implementation of DPR.  Slide presentations included:  Overview of Direct Potable Reuse: Technology, Costs, and Energy Chemicals and Emerging Contaminants Expert Panel to Determine the Feasibility of Developing Direct Potable Reuse Criteria for California Current Direct Potable Reuse Studies and Research Evaluating Direct Potable Reuse and Desalination as Water Supply Options Public Outreach/Communications on Direct Potable Reuse Direct Potable Reuse Messaging, Outreach Tools, and Communication Plan Panel Discussion: The Environmental Community?s Role in Direct Potable Reuse   A report was created and represents the final product of the workshop, which is a summary document offering clarification and guidance in regards to how the water industry and environmental community cancollaborate on advancing the implementation of DPR.  The report will be posted online as a free download on the websites of the three sponsoring agencies.  It will be shared among our environmental community, water industry, and regulatory contacts.  It will also be promoted through various public communication processes (newsletters, social media, etc.).       Last Modified: 03/31/2017       Submitted by: Jeffrey J Mosher]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
