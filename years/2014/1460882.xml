<AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in physics at Indiana University (IU).   The program will support up to 15 participants for 10 weeks during the summers of 2015-17 to carry out experimental and theoretical research projects in a broad range of areas in the IU Physics Department and the IU Center for Exploration of Energy and Matter (CEEM). Special programs for the students include orientation sessions on lab safety, weekly seminars on current research in physics, discussions on professional development and scientific ethics, and short progress reports. At the conclusion of the program, the students will present their results in talks at a closing symposium and develop a way to share their results to a technical audience. They will also be encouraged and supported to continue working on their projects as well as to present their work at professional meetings during the following academic year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program provides promising undergraduate physics majors with significant and challenging experiences in scientific research in a research-intensive environment. Students will be matched to projects appropriate to their level and interests, and early contact of students and mentors will be encouraged. The participants will gain original research experience by working as integral parts of ongoing research programs under the supervision of faculty members and senior research staff. Students will learn about a broad range of current research areas through seminars and peer interactions. The program emphasizes the development of clear, honest, and concise scientific communication and presentation skills.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The principal goal of the IU Physics Summer REU program is to provide the students with meaningful, challenging, and exciting experiences in the research-intensive environments of the Indiana University Bloomington Department of Physics and Center for Exploration of Energy and Matter. We strive to match each student with the type of research (theory/experiment/computational) and choice of subfield that they have expressed interest in pursuing, including astrophysics, atomic and optical physics, biophysics, condensed matter physics, elementary particle physics, and nuclear physics.     During the summers of 2015-2017 the program supported a total of 31 students during our ten-week programs, including 18 female participants and 3 males who are members of other groups underrepresented in physics.  Thirty of the students attend or attended another institution, and 20 of the supported participants were from colleges that lack the depth of research opportunities and facilities at IU.  Two IU students and one visiting student, each with other support, also participated fully in our activities, including two females and a male in an underrepresented group in physics.  Participants worked on individual research projects under the supervision of faculty members and postdoctoral researchers.   A total of 19 faculty members served as mentors for the participants, including 5 female professors and two female research scientists.   In addition to their research projects, the students attended a seminar/discussion series, which presented overviews of a number of physics research areas and initiated discussions on topics such as career paths in physics, preparing for graduate school, issues of integrity in scientific research, and scientific communication. Each summer, participants had the option of visiting research facilities at Fermilab and were given scientist-led tours of a number of experimental sites.   By the end of the program, students prepared a tangible method to share their work in an appropriate form (such as a research paper, research poster, conference presentation, technical report). During the final week of the program each student also presented a talk on their work at a local symposium.   Students were encouraged and supported to attend national and regional research conferences where they could present their work to a wider audience.
