<AbstractNarration>1402231&lt;br/&gt;Sung&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator proposes to develop comprehensive chemical kinetic models for diesel fuel combustion.  The methodology will also be important to fuel research for many other applications, including aviation, propulsion, industrial combustion, power generation, and several other chemical processes. The chemical kinetic models and the underlying methodology will be widely disseminated through the principal investigator's research website, presentations, and publications. The PI's research group participates in the NSF GK-12 program, where local high school students experience ongoing research through laboratory tours and presentations, to promote interest in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A three-year research program is proposed to fill in gaps in fundamental combustion data on fuel components and mixtures relevant to diesel fuel that is commonly proposed for use in next-generation engines. These newly-acquired data, along with the available literature data, will be used to develop and validate predictive chemical kinetic models (in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) to predict combustion chemistry at engine relevant conditions. Specifically, autoignition characteristics of lean-to-stoichiometric mixtures of various fuels will be investigated at pressures and temperatures in the ranges of 10-75 bar and 600-1100 K, respectively. Rapid compression machines will be used to determine ignition delay while species evolution will be measured using in-situ mid-IR absorption spectroscopy and ex-situ gas sampling.  The outcome of the proposed study will greatly help reduce the design cycle for improved engine efficiency and reduced emissions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>As federal programs require increasingly stringent engine emissions and fuel economy standards, these ambitions can only be met if next-generation combustion technology is developed focusing on high-efficiency and low-emissions engines. Recent research has indicated the need to operate engines at higher compression ratios and with low temperature combustion (LTC) to achieve the needed gains in engine efficiency and reductions in emissions. These LTC engines are designed to operate at lower temperatures, great degree of premixing, and higher dilution levels. In such LTC modes, the overall reactivity leading to ignition is constrained, which results in increasing dominance of fuel chemistry. Furthermore, the flame structure, the heat release rate profile, and the temperature stratification are also different from those observed in conventional compression ignition engines. As a result, the understanding of the autoignition characteristics of diesel fuels under low-to-intermediate temperatures becomes important.</p> <p>However, the composition of diesel is too complex to model because diesel fuels contain hundreds, even thousands of species. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a surrogate fuel, which is a simpler mixture that can capture the essential chemical/physical properties and performance characteristics of the target diesel fuel to sufficient accuracy, but contains approximately 10 or fewer pure "palette" compounds for the sake of computational tractability. As a result, the development of diesel surrogates and their chemical kinetic models is vital in reducing the design cycle of future diesel engines.</p> <p>This research program aims to fill in gaps in fundamental combustion data on fuel components and mixtures relevant to diesel fuels. These newly-acquired data, along with the available literature data, have been used to develop validated chemical kinetic models (in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) to predict combustion chemistry at engine relevant conditions. Autoignition characteristics of lean-to-rich mixtures of various fuels have been investigated at elevated pressures and low-to-intermediate temperatures. Extensive experimental datasets for autoignition characteristics of (1) neat diesel surrogate components, (2) ultra-low-sulfur research-grade diesel fuels, and (3) diesel surrogate mixtures have been obtained using rapid compression machines. Predictive chemical kinetic models based on the current experimental results and the literature data obtained in well-defined experimental configurations have been developed in collaboration with the team of Dr. William J. Pitz at the Material Sciences Division, Physical and Life Sciences Directorate, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.</p> <p>The present research for developing a comprehensive understanding of fuel combustion, surrogate model formulation, and chemical kinetic models for transportation fuels furthers understanding of autoignition under engine relevant conditions and lead to validated, predictive chemical kinetic mechanisms. A basic understanding of the transportation fuel combustion at a fundamental level and development/validation of chemical kinetic models at engine relevant conditions hold the key for realistic engine simulations that will greatly help reduce the design cycle for improved engine efficiency and reduced emissions.</p> <p>Since experimental data obtained from this research are of fundamental and practical importance, we have made the database available to the combustion community through our research websites (e.g., <a href="https://combdiaglab.engr.uconn.edu/">https://combdiaglab.engr.uconn.edu/</a>; <a href="https://combdiaglab.engr.uconn.edu/database/rcm-database/">https://combdiaglab.engr.uconn.edu/database/rcm-database/</a>; <a href="https://github.com/bryanwweber/UConnRCMPy">https://github.com/bryanwweber/UConnRCMPy</a>) as well as presentations and publications.
