<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motion of charges through metals and semiconductors produces heat.  This fundamental result of the collisions of electrons in electrical currents means that modern electronic circuits, where currents flow rapidly in features with nanometer dimensions, suffer losses and other challenges due to high densities of heat.  If information could instead be carried by angular momentum in the form of the electron's spin, much of this heat can be avoided.  Furthermore, recent work suggests that application of heat to nanomagnetic systems could provide a long-sought source for such spin currents, in addition to allowing possible applications in energy harvesting based on heat, charge, and spin flow.   In this project, the principal investigator and his research team carry out fundamental studies of the interactions between these flows.  The essential technique is a novel thermal isolation structure that allows accurate measurements of tiny temperature changes of magnetic thin films and nanostructures.  The results allow a new view into the phenomena arising from the coupling of heat, charge, and spin, and form the essential foundations for designing and optimizing new devices for nanoelectronics and energy harvesting. &lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The generation of pure spin currents is an important requirement for future spintronic nanoelectronics models. However, reliable methods to generate such a flow of angular momentum without associated charge remain elusive. Recently some groups have reported that a spin current can be produced simply by applying a thermal gradient to a ferromagnetic material. This effect, called the spin Seebeck effect, has generated tremendous interest in the interaction of heat, charge and spin in ferromagnetic systems and has also raised the possibility of new thermoelectric devices based on magnetic materials. Such thermoelectric systems could offer breakthrough performance by decoupling heat and charge flow, one of the traditional challenges in thermoelectric materials.  This project extends the principal investigator's recent work on thermoelectric and thermomagnetic effects in thin film metallic ferromagnets. His research team's measurements are enabled by a micromachined thermal isolation platform that removes potentially confounding effects introduced by the presence of a highly thermally conductive bulk substrate.  This allows accurate measurements of the thermopower (traditional Seebeck effect), thermal and electrical conductivity, and Peltier effects in addition to a variety of less widely known thermoelectric and thermomagnetic effects. All these measurements can be performed on a single sample.  These novel techniques provide the probe of the physics governing the interaction of heat, charge and  spin currents in nanomagnetic systems required to understand and optimize their potential use for spintronics and energy generation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A wide range of important technologies, most importantly computer processors, are made from nanoscale materials in the form of thin films.  The motion of electrons required to operate these processors causes heat, and this heat is the main limitation on progress toward faster and better computers.  This project was focused on developing new ways to measure this heat in thin film systems, and to clarify if this heating in small systems can generate flows of angular momentum.  Angular momentum, or spin, is a potentially different way to create computers.       The project clarified that for metallic ferromagnetic thin films, heating can only create spin flow with certain types of temperature difference, providing key information for the field on where to focus our efforts.  Our studies, and the novel measurement tools we use to study heat flow in tiny systems, also led to several important new directions, including revealing new ranges of materials that allow spin flow.  These include those with less atomic order, that are potentially much simpler to include in nanoscale circuits for future computers.       The project also contributed meaningfully to technical training of students at the graduate and undergraduate level.  This included mentoring one-on-one in the laboratory as well as more traditional teaching of new courses in the classroom.  The project also contributed to career development of all project staff by supporting and facilitating collaborative work with partners ranging from national labs to other local universities, and organization of scientific conferences and symposia.      Finally, the project also supported public outreach including several public presentations on research topics for the general public.
