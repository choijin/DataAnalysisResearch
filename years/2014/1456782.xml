<AbstractNarration>Alteration in plant architecture has been critically important during crop domestication. Through generations of breeding to increase yield, crop plants have been selected for a variety of branching patterns that change the number, length or angle of branches. In maize, leaf angle has been an important branching trait that has likely contributed to increasing corn yields. The angle of the leaf is determined by the ligule region, which forms at the boundary between the blade and sheath. The blade tilts back to absorb energy from the sun while the sheath holds tight to the stem. This angle between the blade and sheath is a heritable trait that can be modified through selection: decreased angle makes plants more upright for more compact fields, whereas increased angle optimizes the surface area of the blade for more energy capture. Thus, understanding the basic molecular mechanisms involved in establishing the leaf angle will provide new tools for manipulating maize architecture. This project aims to clarify the complex network of factors that determine when and how the ligule region forms. This project will first identify and characterize the expression of genes that define the ligule boundary during the earliest stages of development. Molecular, genetic and genomic methods will then be used to investigate how the ligule region forms. The results will be shared with diverse audiences including breeders, the scientific community and with students. To that end, YouTube videos will be produced that describe the science of corn development to a general audience and additional educational materials will be generated for student classrooms. All resources will be made publically available through lab websites and the maize community website (http://www.maizegdb.org).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates how the ligular region is established as a defined organ boundary in the undifferentiated leaf primordium. Previous work used the anatomically distinct ligule as a site for transcriptome analysis: preligule, preblade and presheath cells were clearly identified for laser capture followed by RNA sequencing. Due to the specificity of capture, a collection of candidate genes was identified that is uniquely and differentially expressed in the ligule region. Shared expression patterns in other organ boundaries suggest that the ligule reiterates the lateral organ initiation program that occurs at the shoot apical meristem and at tassel branch boundaries. Thus, distinctly different organ boundaries are hypothesized to share genes and use common mechanisms to define and restrict developmental pathways. To test this hypothesis, gene networks will be established for early stages of ligule development and mechanisms of ligule initiation further investigated. The first specific aim is to identify the earliest determinants of ligule formation by capturing cells from the youngest accessible leaf primordia. Candidate genes will be prioritized based on their expression in other ligule-specific mutants. The second aim investigates three promising candidate gene pathways that support the role of KNOTTED1 (KN1)-like homeobox transcription factors and partner proteins in establishing the ligule boundary. Mutants will be analyzed in these genes for ligule and branching phenotypes.  The third aim tests the hypothesis that the bZIP transcription factor LIGULELESS2 (LG2), bound by KN1, is involved in positioning the blade/sheath boundary. Protein partners will be identified as will down-stream targets to determine the role of LG2 in establishing the blade sheath boundary.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The formation of boundary regions between distinct organs and tissues is an essential component of plant and animal development.  Boundaries form throughout all stages of development, and correspond to active sites of new organ/tissue formation.  The developing maize leaf is an excellent model system to study boundary formation.  Maize leaves are composed of a proximal sheath region that attaches at the node, and a distal blade region that captures sunlight for photosynthesis. Composed of a fringe of tissue outgrowth called the ligule, and a hinge-like structure called the auricle, the ligule region forms the boundary between sheath and blade tissue.

Intriguingly, we also found that many of the genes expressed during the development of the ligule boundary are also expressed in your leaf primordia, long before there is any morphological evidence of boundary formation. Our current study tests the hypothesis that there is a pre-pattern for ligule development in the maize leaf, whereby boundaries of gene expression are set in place long before morphological elaboration of the ligule boundary.     Intellectual Merit: Understanding gene networks that pattern boundaries in leaves is a central topic in plant biology with important applications in agriculture.  In this study, patterns of gene expression were examined in four contiguous proximal-distal microdomains in tiny P4 leaf primordia, and early developmental stage where ligule boundary is morphologically undetectable. Our study identified 1,045 differentially-expressed genes across these microdomains.  Computation/statistical analyses of gene expression patterns, called self-organizing map clustering (SOM clustering), was used to identify a blade/sheath boundary pre-pattern in this young leaf, a distinct region defined by marked changes in gene expression patterns. Furthermore, genes involved in plant hormone responses, and genes encoding proteins that control expression of other genes (transcription factors) were especially enriched in this pre-ligule region. These studies propose a testable genetic network for how transcription factors and hormonal signaling generates a pre-pattern in young leaf primordia that eventually leads to formation of the ligule boundary in maize.      Broader Impacts: A Postdoctoral Fellow was trained in bioinformatics and network analysis, and gave an invited talk at the 2019 Annual Maize Genetics Conference in St Louis MO.  A Cornell undergraduate researcher conducted independent research learning molecular genetic and genetic techniques, and presented his work as Senior Seminar at the Plant Sciences Undergraduate Symposium, Cornell University, on May 11, 2018.  This study generated tissue-specific gene expression data that is publically available.       Last Modified: 06/26/2019       Submitted by: Michael J Scanlon]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
