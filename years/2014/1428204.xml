<AbstractNarration>This project, acquiring a photogrammetry-based 3D acquisition system (multi-camera computer vision 3D capture system) as a research instrument, aims to enable easy and repeatable collection of data across a wide range of research areas (Computer Science, Information Science, Geography, Environmental Science, Engineering, American Studies, Visual Arts, History, Library Science, etc.). The system consists of 96 synchronized cameras and associated flash and projection lights to capture a single object ranging from about 5 centimeters to several meters instantly. The flexibility of a photo-based system allows the same system to capture high resolution models over a wide range of scales, and to be equally useful for a single rigid object, an object in motion, or a person using a subject, object, or software, all with no object or subject preparation and minimal setup or reconfiguration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scanning device is likely to have significant impacts: the projects on assistive technologies promise a lasting impact on disabled individuals; the brain imaging and genomics projects promise improvements on diagnostics health; the project will also have impact in the humanities, in understanding, and in documenting artifacts; and the digital library project will directly address how data generated by an instrument like this one can be preserved and referenced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the project will have impacts on education and training of students. The center that will house the instrument has significant undergraduate staff who will be exposed to a state-of-the-art instrument and the research it enables. Undergraduate assistants, under the guidance of the center staff, will support the staffing for the instrument. Moreover, the instrument will impact several classes directly which will be able to use object and motion scanning equipment that is seldom available to undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>
