<AbstractNarration>Medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) are wave-like variations in ionospheric density and altitude that are widely observed from high to low latitudes. This project addresses questions of their origin and evolution by carrying out multi-site, multi-instrument investigations and applying tomographic reconstructions. The project will include outreach activities to students and the public in Puerto Rico. &lt;br/&gt; The tomographic technique will enable a deeper understanding of the electrodynamics of MSTIDs by creating wide area maps of the field-line integrated Pedersen conductivity independent of magnetic-field geometry. The following questions regarding the three-dimensional airglow structure will be addressed: (1) How does MSTID structure relate to the spatial/temporal distribution of field-line integrated Pederson conductivity? (2) Is MSTID plasma transport dominated by neutral winds or electrodynamics?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant resulted in the deployment of two all-sky imagers to Arecibo and Culebra in Puerto Rico.  These imagers took multiple years of data and were able to observe ionospheric disturbances from a stereo perspective.  The data were studied and experimental tomographic reconstructions were performed.  These data were also linked with HF radar observations of the ionosphere to characterize the variability of the ionosphere and its impact on HF propagation.  This work was presented in multiple conference papers over several years and it will support ongoing efforts for more precise HF communications in the presence of ionospheric disturbances.  MSTIDs were frequently observed over Puerto Rico.  There are several instruments operating at Arecibo and in the region that characterize the ionosphere.  The PI also found CODAR systems operating in HF frequencies with variability that could be correlated to ionospheric phenomena, including sporadic E and F layers.  Long periods of observations allowed for assessments and visualization of the HF propagation environment in the region during different years and seasons.  The tomographic reconstruction of MSTIDs proved to be very challenging, as the stereo viewing geometry was not sufficiently separated in longitude for a clear reconstruction of 3D MSTID structure.  Variability could be observed over a period of time but further research will be needed to conclusively identify the nature of the 3D structure of the observed TIDs.  This research could be used as a launching point for future investigations.  Interns supported this program and helped prototype code that could be adapted for future scientific work.
