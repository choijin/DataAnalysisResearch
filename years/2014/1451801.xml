<AbstractNarration>Partnership for Undergraduate Research: Enhancing the Mathematics Curriculum (PUR) will enhance and expand the undergraduate mathematics curriculum at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire (UWEC) by creating a new comprehensive mathematics major focused on undergraduate research and graduate school preparatory courses. UWEC, a primarily undergraduate institution, will partner with the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM), a research institution and the most diverse institution in the University of Wisconsin System, to engage underrepresented students in mathematics research. The newly developed comprehensive major with research emphasis will incorporate formal instruction in research skills and ethics, training in writing and presentation skills, and a sustained undergraduate research experience.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This curriculum redesign allows students to integrate research in progress toward their degrees.  Simultaneously, it creates opportunities to recognize faculty mentorship of undergraduate research as a teaching activity. The investigators will encourage UW System universities and other institutions to adopt the UWEC and UWM partnership model in order to increase access of underrepresented groups to STEM careers and actively develop a more inclusive environment. In addition, this project serves as a model of a sustainable way to increase the number of undergraduates participating in collaborative research by incorporating research into the undergraduate curriculum.  Undergraduate participants will learn how to successfully do research, building skills necessary for conducting original research and disseminating their results. These skills include presentation and writing, surveying papers to find background information, collaborating with others through peer mentoring, and initiating and maintaining a research program. Thus, the program will increase the mathematical knowledge and research skills of undergraduates, better preparing them for graduate school and a globally competitive STEM workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we designed a new comprehensive mathematics research major at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire (UWEC) to incorporate formal instruction in research skills and ethics, training in writing and presentation skills, and a sustained undergraduate research experience.  In addition, we partnered with the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's (UWM) math department to increase the number of underrepresented students engaged in undergraduate research at UWEC. The goal of developing a new comprehensive mathematics research major at UWEC was to combine ongoing experience in mathematics research and effective preparation for graduate study in a field involving mathematics.  This new major requires students to take a greater number of upper-division mathematics courses, take a science sequence along with a speech class, and to engage in undergraduate research. At the time of reporting, eight UWEC students have declared the new comprehensive mathematics research major; two of whom were the first graduates with this degree in the spring of 2019. As part of the new comprehensive research major, a new course, Math 380: Research Methods was designed and began running in the fall of 2015. This course serves as an introduction to research in mathematics.  During the duration of this course, students learn key components on how to successfully conduct research, focus on building the skills necessary for conducting original work as well as several different methods to disseminate results.  These skills include proficiency in mathematical presentation and writing, surveying papers to find background information, collaborating with others, and initiating and maintaining a research program. Also included is an introduction to LaTeX, different computer software used in mathematics, and grant writing. Since this course has been offered, there have been 45 students enrolled in Math 380, nine of whom were UWM students who completed the course via distance education.  Of the nine students from UWM, a third of them self-identified themselves as being part of an underrepresented population. From this course there were 18 distinct collaborative research projects; these projects were mostly distinct from the summer REU research projects.  Four different UWEC faculty members gave several presentations on the design and implementation of the research comprehensive major and Math 380 at the Joint Mathematics Meetings and AMS sectional meetings in hopes of encouraging other institutions to adopt this model as a sustainable way to increase the number of undergraduates, and underrepresented groups, participating in collaborative research. In conjunction with the creation of the comprehensive mathematics research major at UWEC, a summer research experience for undergraduates (REU) was held each of the three years of the funding period.  Each summer, eight students from a combination of UWEC and UWM participated in one of four mathematics research projects on the UWEC campus researching topics from algebra, knot theory, biological combinatorics, and differential equations.  Students and faculty disseminated their work by giving a collective 13 oral presentations and 20 poster presentations at local, regional, and national conferences.  Further, at the time of this reporting, two peer-reviewed articles have been published stemming from the research conducted during these REU projects. In addition to the student participants having a meaningful research experience, they were encouraged to pursue graduate studies and careers in STEM, benefitting society as a whole.
