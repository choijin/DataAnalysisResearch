<AbstractNarration>The Chemistry Division in the Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate and the Division of Biological Infrastructure in the Directorate for Biological Sciences support a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site led by Professor Mary J. Cloninger at Montana State University (MSU) and Professor Ruben M. Ceballos at the University of Minnesota-Morris. Undergraduate research occurs under the theme "New Chemical Insights Into Biology" in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Montana State University, in the Native American Research Lab, and at Universiti Teknologi MARA in Malaysia. Eight students participate in the ten week REU program on-site at Montana State University, with strong commitment to and preferential admission for Native American students, Tribal College students, and students from small colleges in the upper northwest region of the United States where resources for research are limited. Two Native American students who have already completed a research experience, either at MSU's REU Site or through another research mechanism, perform research in Malaysia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this REU program is to introduce students to state-of-the-art instrumentation and frontier research techniques at the chemistry/biology interface. REU projects are designed to use chemical approaches to study biological questions including extremophile responses to stress, mechanisms of action for radical enzymes, native plant natural product chemistry, multivalent intercellular recognition processes, protein structure-function relationships, virus curing agents, hydroxylase reactivity, excited electron states in DNA, chemical sensing materials, and lipid membrane structure and function. These areas are all the focus of current research in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Montana State University, in the Native American Research Lab, and at Universiti Teknologi MARA in Malaysia. The MSU students attend weekly workshops and group meetings. All students participate in video conference group meetings and a poster symposium, and all write a final paper. This REU program allows interdisciplinary research, which uses chemical approaches to address biological problems, to be more accessible to all students including Native Americans students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Program Overview</strong></p> <p>This NSF REU site grant is a collaborative, combined program that includes an on-site summer research experience for approximately eight students per summer at Montana State University and an international research experience for 2-4 additional students to work with partner students in Asia. Forty-eight students participated in this NSF REU program during the summers of 2015 through 2019. Because the grant started in late summer of 2015, two American Indian students performed research in Malaysia in 2015, while the onsite research program at MSU started in 2016. During this funding period, fourteen American Indian students, one Latina, one Puerto Rican, and one African American student participated in the program. Four students from small colleges in Montana and one Tribal College student were participants. Ten students from small regional schools who would not otherwise have access to research or state-of-the-art instrumentation were in our cohort. Eleven American Indian students participated in the international REU. The on-site program at MSU has been active since 2000, and the longevity and reputation of the on-site programming enable the addition of 2-5 students per year through alternative funding sources.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merits </strong>Students performed research with sixteen different faculty mentors to advance research in chemical biology on topics including mechanisms of action for radical enzymes, native plant natural product chemistry, multivalent intercellular recognition processes, protein structure-function relationships, and chemical sensing materials. These research projects spanned a wide variety of research foci and resulted in four publications in the peer-reviewed literature. The REUs developed communication skills for poster presentations, scientific seminars, and communication of scientific research to the general public. They learned how to use state-of-the-art research instrumentation and completed training in fire safety, general lab safety, lab biosafety, and research ethics. The students learned a wide range of frontier research techniques.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts </strong>Eighteen of the REU students from this funding cycle are now in graduate programs in biochemistry, chemistry, or closely-related fields. Two are in pharmacy school, one works at NIH, one is a high school science teacher, one is a research assistant in a soils lab, and two are certified nursing assistants. Fourteen are still undergraduates, and five are taking a post-graduation gap year. The students overwhelmingly stated that participating in REU greatly bolstered their confidence in their career choices. Many noted that they didn?t feel like they were good enough to go to graduate school until they spent the summer performing research and received encouragement from their faculty mentors. Increasing the number of American Indian and other minority students in STEM affords a broader perspective for design and implementation of scientific research. Providing students from underrepresented minorities with research experiences supervised by culturally supportive mentors enables them to gain support and confidence to continue in STEM. The international research experience enabled American Indian students to perform research focused on research questions relevant to indigenous people while interacting with indigenous communities in other nations. For the MSU graduate students, postdoctoral scientists, and faculty mentors, the REU program offers an opportunity to introduce new students to research and to participate in the infectious excitement of first experiences with scientific discovery.<strong></strong></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/01/2020<br>      Modified by: Mary&nbsp;J&nbsp;Cloninger</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1461218/1461218_10380465_1588305706619_MALAYSIA-GROUPIBANLONGHOUSE-2015SM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1461218/1461218_10380465_1588305706619_MALAYSIA-GROUPIBANLONGHOUSE-2015SM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Malaysia group"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1461218/1461218_10380465_1588305706619_MALAYSIA-GROUPIBANLONGHOUSE-2015SM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Malaysia group"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The REU group visits a traditional Iban longhouse in Malaysia.
