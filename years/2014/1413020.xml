<AbstractNarration>Networks of coupled oscillators abound in nature and science; heart pacemaker cells, chemical oscillations, superconducting circuits, and swarms of fireflies all provide examples of systems of oscillators that communicate with or influence each other, and thereby coordinate collective behavior of the network as a whole. These systems typically consist of large numbers of individual oscillators, so their behavior can be extremely complicated and difficult to analyze.  But often the collective behavior of these complex networks is surprisingly simple; for example, the oscillators may synchronize, as happens in the heart pacemaker network or for certain species of fireflies that synchronize so as to flash in unison.  Other simple collective behaviors of oscillator networks include phase-locked configurations, in which all the oscillators converge to have the same period, or splay states, which are configurations in which the oscillators are uniformly distributed in phase.  Understanding the mathematical principles that underlie or facilitate such simple collective behaviors is a research problem of central importance in applied dynamical systems.  A persistent theme in this study is that the collective dynamics of coupled oscillator networks can often be reduced to that of low-dimensional systems, usually via the presence of hidden invariances or symmetries in the system.  Important examples are networks consisting of identical Kuramoto oscillators, which are simple oscillators governed by trigonometric functions.  Such networks are invariant under a three-dimensional group of symmetries called Mobius transformations, which play a key role in conformal hyperbolic geometry.  This invariance has been used to explain the stability properties of Kuramoto networks and to completely classify the stable long-term dynamics of networks of identical Kuramoto oscillators.  Low-dimensional reduction of oscillator networks can also be achieved through other techniques, such as complex-analytic continuation and residue methods, which have also been employed in reducing the classic Kuramoto model.  This research project will build on such powerful methods to extend and further clarify our understanding of collective behavior in oscillator networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project on collective behavior in oscillator networks has four parts.  Project 1 will use Mobius group, Riccati equation, and linear algebra techniques to study the general question of whether a multi-population Kuramoto oscillator network supports "chimera states," in which a portion of the population synchronizes while the remainder is stably asynchronous.  Project 2 will use analytic techniques including Fokker-Planck methods and infinite-dimensional spectral analysis to study the stability of synchronized and splay states in more general types of oscillator networks, including integrate-and-fire networks, with the goal of better understanding the exceptional nature of Kuramoto oscillators.  Project 3 will apply the complex-analytic techniques of the Ott-Antonsen ansatz to study a model of coupled spins with random pinning and to understand the source of its low-dimensional behavior.  Finally, project 4 will investigate the design of Kuramoto networks in an experimental setting, to realize all the possible long-term stable dynamics predicted in the theoretical classification.  In particular, the investigators have established that there are four possible types of stable attractors for identical Kuramoto networks:  fully synchronized fixed points and limit cycles, and fixed points and limit cycles in which all but one of the oscillators are synchronized.  This project aims to observe these stable "(N-1, 1)" states in an experimental setting, as well as to explore the ramifications of such states in superconducting arrays for the development and stability of coherence in quantum computing.  These projects afford opportunities for interdisciplinary participation at the undergraduate and graduate level, ranging from numerical and experimental simulations to theoretical, analytic investigations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematics through the Applied Mathematics program and the Division of Physics through the Physics of Living Systems program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  A fundamental challenge in science is to understand how collective behavior emerges in complex systems.  For example, how do thousands of heart cells that form the heart's natural pacemaker network manage to fire an electrical pulse simultaneously?  How does a flock of birds or school of fish organize so as to fly or swim together?  What causes a population of fireflies to flash in unison?  How can we prevent a single component failure in a large power grid from cascading through the entire network?  The investigators' particular interest is in networks of oscillators, in which the individual components cycle periodically in time.  Oscillator networks can exhibit a variety of collective behaviors, ranging in simplicity from complete synchronization, when all the oscillators behave in unison, to more complex patterns such as chimera states, where part of the network is synchronized while the rest exhibits asynchronous behavior.  During the course of this grant, the PIs developed mathematical tools, using  geometry and group theory, that greatly simplify the analysis of oscillator networks and their stability, through dimensional reduction.  The virtue of this approach is that the behavior of a large network with many variables can be precisely described using only a small number of equations.  During the funding period we completed four major projects, which we will describe briefly below.  We trained a graduate student, Bolun Chen, who worked on three of these projects, received his PhD in 2017 and was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship at Brandeis University.  In addition, a new PhD graduate student Owen Yang started working in our group in Fall 2018.  Publications in peer-reviewed journals from the first three of the projects have already appeared, and a manuscript from the fourth project has been submitted for publication.  We have disseminated our results at several scientific conferences and seminar talks.  The main theme of our work is the correspondence between the dynamics of Kuramoto oscillator systems and geometric flows on the disc. This correspondence informs in both directions; we used properties of hyperbolic geometry to understand the dynamics of oscillator networks, and also used dynamics to prove results in geometry, like the existence of hyperbolic barycenters.  Our first project studied the dynamics of a neural network with alpha function coupling.  We showed that such a network can exhibit partially synchronized states with a variety of types.  Our second project built the fundamental connection between Kuramoto oscillator networks and hyperbolic geometry, and we discovered several new classes of Kuramoto networks that are gradient dynamical systems in this geometry.  Out third project used this methodology to analyze completely the dynamics of the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model with an asymmetric order parameter.  We proved that this system can exhibit gradient or Hamiltonian dynamics (or both) and in special cases is equivalent to a 2D electrostatic field.  Our final project answered some long-standing conjectures and questions from the seminal work of Watanabe and Strogatz in the 1990s and Ott and Antonsen in the 2000s. We showed that the famous Ott-Antonsen manifold is not attracting, and developed a framework for exploring the dynamics off this manifold.  The application of geometric techniques to the study of oscillator networks is a new and surprising advance, which has already made possible much progress in the study of these networks.  We are confident that we have not come close to exhausting the power of this approach.  More broadly, an important ramification of our work is that it builds interdisciplinary connections between the more applied study of oscillator dynamics and the more pure math study of low-dimensional geometric topology.
