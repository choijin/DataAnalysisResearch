<AbstractNarration>Global patterns of biodiversity demonstrate that most of the species on earth occur in the tropics, with strikingly fewer species occurring in higher-latitude regions.  Biologists predict that this global pattern of species diversity is likely shaped by thee ecological interactions between species.  Yet few detailed experimental data exist that demonstrate how species interactions influence natural communities from the tropics to the arctic.  Therefore, a significant opportunity exists to transform our understanding of how these fundamental species interactions shape patterns of biodiversity across the globe.  Furthermore, these species interactions have the strong potential to limit potentially harmful biological invasions by non-native species, which are often transported by human activities that can breach historical dispersal barriers, such as ocean basins and continents.  Biological invasions can cause undesired ecological and economic effects and are considered one of the primary drivers of global change.  Through extensive field research on marine ecosystems along the Pacific Coast of North and Central America, from the tropics to the subarctic, this project will study ecological factors that shape global patterns of diversity and limit biological invasions. Undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow will be fully-integrated members of the research team.  The objective of mentoring these early-career scientists will be to integrate scientific, professional, and cross-cultural training into a comprehensive professional development framework that will prepare them for a successful scientific career in an international forum.  The research team will further promote awareness of marine and invasion ecology through a suite of activities, including outreach and educational activities for school children and young adults in Philadelphia, Alaska and Panama.  Information that can be applied to the management of non-native species will be disseminated to a wide diversity of U.S. and international stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biologists have long theorized that the latitudinal diversity gradient may be shaped by stronger species interactions, such as competition and predation, occurring in the tropics than at higher latitudes.  Prior research suggests that predation pressure is indeed stronger at lower latitudes, but it is unclear how interactive effects of predation and competition structure communities to maintain these diversity patterns in ecological time.  This project represents an international research program to expand ecological understanding of species interactions across latitude.  The objectives are to determine the relative influences of two primary species interactions, competition and predation, on patterns of species diversity, community assembly and sensitivity to species invasion.  Field research will employ a large-scale experimental approach that focuses on sessile marine invertebrate communities across 47 degrees of latitude (over 7000 km).  Experiments will manipulate levels of predation and competition for one year and will be conducted in four regions, ranging from the subarctic to the tropics:  Alaska, California, Mexico, and Panama.  Communities of sessile marine invertebrates, composed of both native and non-native species, will be examined iteratively under different predation and competition regimes to evaluate community dynamics.  The relative importance of a suite of factors, including environmental conditions and recruitment rates, to interaction outcomes will be evaluated.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project established an international research collaboration, involving over 40 researchers and students across three countries and five institutions, to understand how fundamental species interactions can shape marine communities across latitude.  We conducted a series of year-long manipulative experiments in nearshore marine communities along the Pacific coast of North and Central America.  Experiments were conducted at 12 sites in four regions spanning the tropics to the subarctic, representing one of the largest marine experiments in nearshore environments.  Using multiple lines of evidence, our results support the long-held hypothesis that predation is more intense and has stronger impacts on prey communities in the tropics relative to higher latitudes.  We found that predation shaped patterns of community biomass and composition in tropical Panama, with weaker effects of predators in subtropical Mexico, and no measurable effects in temperate California or subarctic Alaska.  Using direct observations of the predator community, we documented predation rates in Panama that were an order of magnitude greater than in Alaska or California.  Despite the intensity of predation in the tropics, our observations of both predator activity and interaction outcomes suggest high spatial and temporal variability in predation pressure on the Pacific coast of Panama.  Additional experiments demonstrated that the effects of predators are more intense on the Pacific in comparison to the Atlantic coast of Panama, suggesting variability in predation pressure between tropical ocean basins as well.  We further found that predation reduced non-native species abundance on the Pacific but not the Atlantic coast of Panama, suggesting that intense predation in the tropics has the potential to shape patterns of biological invasions.  Results also suggest that competition may be stronger at higher latitudes, demonstrating that competition and predation may covary in their intensity at a biogeographic scale.   Our collaboration trained one postdoctoral scholar and 28 early-career professionals and students ranging from high school to graduate school.  We disseminated the results of our research to the scientific community through over 28 conference presentations and a growing list of peer-reviewed papers in the scientific literature.  Our team actively engaged in numerous outreach activities with K-12 school children and teachers, demonstrating both the scientific principles of our research and the applications to biological invasions.  This project also catalyzed a cross-hemisphere international research initiative, entitled PanAmEx: Pan-American Experimental Initiative in Marine Macroecology, led by Smithsonian's Marine Global Earth Observatory, Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, and Temple University.  PanAmEx is a collaborative network to examine broad-scale ecological patterns and processes across coastal marine ecosystems of North, Central, and South America, spanning nearly 40 sites, two hemispheres, and two ocean basins.
