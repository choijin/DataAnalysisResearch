<AbstractNarration>This project is supported under the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program, which is an NSF-wide program although each Directorate administers its own REU Site competition. This program supports active research participation by undergraduate students in an effort to introduce them to scientific research so as to encourage their continued engagement in the nation's scientific research and development enterprise. REU projects involve students in meaningful ways in ongoing research programs or in research projects designed especially for the purpose. The REU program is a major contributor to the NSF's goal of developing a diverse, internationally competitive, and globally-engaged science and engineering workforce. The Social, Behavioral and Economic (SBE) sciences Directorate awarded this REU Site grant to Swarthmore College to provide undergraduate students with intensive training in community-based collaborative language documentation. The project builds bridges between indigenous linguists in the US academic community, Mexico, Micronesia, and the Navajo Nation, with collaborative research that benefits all parties. It helps uncover deep connections between languages and landscapes by documenting the knowledge base about the natural world found in endangered languages. The resulting linguistic materials support local communities' language revitalization efforts. They will also be a resource to the broader scientific community seeking to understand language complexity, diversity and universals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site recruits a diverse group of twelve undergraduate students of Linguistics. The project begins with a two-week intensive, hands-on training session on current best practice for recording languages (or areas of grammar within languages) that have not yet been adequately documented. Students learn directly from professional linguists and indigenous language experts how endangered languages are being modernized, digitized, and expanded into new technological domains. In weeks three and four, students participate in a two-week field practicum. Working in teams led by indigenous language experts, students help record basic and specialized lexica, folk taxonomies, toponyms, and ethno-biological nomenclature. They explore and help document the rich knowledge base in each language that uniquely encodes the natural environment (flora, fauna, weather, geography, etc.). They also learn current best practices in sustaining indigenous languages and supporting global language diversity. The program concludes with a one-week workshop, where students reflect on their collaborative fieldwork and prepare presentations for their respective home institutions. This REU Site project is co-funded by the Documenting Endangered Languages program and also by the International Science and Engineering Program.</AbstractNarration>

When Johnny Rudolph, our Nukuoro language expert from Micronesia, arrive on Swarthmore College campus, he felt inspired to tell an origin myth about the rainbow people who sailed down from the sky and founded Nukuoro Atoll.

When Moises Garcia Guzman, secretary of culture of San Jeronimo Tlacochahuaya Pueblo, came to Haverford College for our digital lexicography workshop, he told us "The [Zapotec] Talking Dictionary, personally means that we are able to document all this knowledge in a digital platform and share it with others, and that ultimately leads to a better preservation efforts for the language and the community.&nbsp;It's been a great to share words that at the same time remind me of stories that my grandmother taught me, and be able to link them."</p> <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Our reciprocal arrangement has thus served as a catalyst for recovering voices and fortifying cultural memories, and returning them in digital form to their communities of origin.

We sought to establish Environmental Linguistics as a practical way to apply linguistic expertise to nature knowledge. The nine Talking Dictionaries we created, and the many ethnographic videos, contain not only lexica and grammatical structures, but also myths, stories, songs, and narratives with a strong emphasis on the environmental. At our field site in Micronesia, for example, our consultants recorded thousands of words pertaining to plants, animals, astronomy, navigation, wayfinding, meteorology, and other specialized, nature-based knowledge.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      We set out in 2016 to create a first-ever REU Site for Linguistics, to build capacity and train the next generation of Linguists. Linguistics is undergoing a paradigm shift as it moves away from a preoccupation with theoretical grammars to more applied and empirical studies. This shift is driven in part by engagement with indigenous communities, and in part by advancing technologies.
