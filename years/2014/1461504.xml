<AbstractNarration>The public investments that have been made in science obligate researchers to make as much data as possible available, such that society to benefit from those investments as future researchers analyze that data and produce new discoveries. This research project amasses decades of primary data the demography and genealogy of population that has been extensively studied by anthropologists, begins to analyze it for patterns related to cultural and biological success, and archives it for future public access. In making several decades of primary data available to the public on-line at the University of Michigan through IPSCR, this project broadens the dissemination of scientific data to enhance scientific and technological understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Napoleon Chagnon of the University of Missouri at Columbia, and Dr. Raymond Hames of the University of Nebraska at Lincoln will explore the impact of marriage form, marital alliances, kin presence, and parental loss on fertility, offspring survivorship and marital stability. This project has two objectives. The first is to make the Yanomamo demographic and genealogical data base available to researchers via the Internet for use by interested social scientists who wish to test a wide variety of theories revolving around kinship, demographic processes, and marriage.  The second goal is to test a variety of human evolutionary theories that address how variation in marriage form, marriage duration, and kin support affects the wellbeing and marital and social success of children.  As a natural fertility population with little outside contact and with all known marital forms the Yanomamo are uniquely suited to shed light on the nature of human marriage and families.  Just as importantly, the Yanomam√∂ data base is the largest ever amassed for any tribal population.  It was collected over a 35 year period through 25 field trips by Napoleon Chagnon from 1964-1999.  Currently, this largely prospective data base has genealogical and demographic information on approximately 4,159 (2,107 living and 2,052 deceased) individuals and the project will permit the addition of another 2,500 Yanomamo who have yet to be entered, error checked, and integrated into the current data base.  Its resultant size will allow comprehensive statistical analysis not possible with smaller data bases collected by anthropologists.  The data will be archived for downloading in a variety of standard formats for statistical analysis.  In addition, the project will create a freely available but more user friendly version of KINDEMCOM, a unique PC comparative statistical program designed for sophisticated genealogical analysis of the data.  Once the data base is complete and publically goes on-line through IPSCR at the University of Michigan the project leaders and other interested social scientists will be able to investigate the genealogical and demographic dimensions of cultural and biological success.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF project outcomes report     This project is a collaboration between Napoleon Chagnon, an anthropologist at the University of Missouri, and Raymond Hames, an anthropologist at the University of Nebraska. The goal of the project was to update and enhance an existing database on Yanomam&ouml; kinship and demography, make it publicly available, and conduct and publish analyses of the data. Major activities included augmenting and correcting errors and inconsistencies in the data and improving the database structures, publication of an article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and new analyses of fertility using data on the Yanomam&ouml; recorded by Chagnon in field trips completed between 1985 and 1988.     Substantial effort has been devoted to ensuring data quality and standardizing formats so that the primary data on the Yanomam&ouml; collected by Chagnon can be made available to the public at the IPSCR at the University of Michigan. Arrangements for the storage of these data have been made, but the data are still being prepared and have not yet been deposited.     The PNAS paper presented results of a test of the Trivers? parent offspring conflict hypothesis. Analyses indicated asymmetric fitness outcomes depending upon whether children or opposite-sex siblings marry relatives in comparison to when parents or same-sex siblings marry relatives. These results suggest conflicts between parents and offspring and among siblings over optimal mating strategies.     Demographic analyses involved new calculations of, for example, the total fertility rate for reproducing Yanomam&ouml; women, estimates of ages at first and last birth, and assessment of longitudinal changes in the age at first birth. Results substantiated Chagnon?s earlier conclusion from a more limited data set that Yanomam&ouml; women have relatively low fertility in comparison with other similar populations, and in addition, they give birth for the first time at younger ages than were observed by researchers ( Early, J., &amp; Peters, J. (2000). The Xiliana Yanomami of the Amazon. Gainesville, FL: University Press of Florida.) working among another Yanomami group.     Funds from this grant have partially supported a postdoctoral scholar and a female doctoral student. The grant has thus aided the advanced training and fostered the development of two promising young scientists and provides opportunities for both of them to publish in high profile journals.     The research conducted among the Yanomam&ouml; by the PI has been one of the foundational studies in contemporary anthropology. A primary goal of this project is to ensure survival in perpetuity of the valuable data derived from the PI?s work; the public availability of these data will have a major impact on future anthropological research. The papers that are coming out of this project are interdisciplinary and will influence not only anthropology, but demography, behavioral ecology, and other social and behavioral sciences. Furthermore, the Yanomam&ouml; are the classic example of a small-scale Amazonian  population, but there are many others who have been in only limited contact with the outside world and are in danger due to a variety of external pressures (e.g., loggers and gold miners). An understanding of the pattern of natural demographic shifts and social relationships is providing information on indigenous population dynamics that may improve policies toward uncontacted indigenous cultures and help to ensure their survival.
