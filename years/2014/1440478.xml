<AbstractNarration>Arid-land ecosystems cover more than 40% of continental land area of the Earth. They support local economies comprised of ranchers, farmers, and pastoralists around the world. Transitions from grass- to shrub-dominated communities are increasing in frequency, threatening human well-being and these economies in both developed and developing countries. This long-term project explores the diverse mechanisms responsible for these changes in an effort to predict the future of arid-land habitats. Clear understanding of underlying mechanisms is necessary to maintain arable land and ecosystem services necessary for human well being. The project engages hundreds of middle and high school students and teachers who sample along the Middle Rio Grande, a highly visible and highly disturbed ecosystem. The resulting data are used by local conservancy groups, the US Army Corps of Engineers, the US Bureau of Reclamation, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service, to name a few among many agencies, in management of an economically and culturally important region. Participants in the Bosque Ecosystem Monitoring Program blend Hispanic, Native American, and Anglo cultures and integrate participants from inner-city, suburban, and rural areas. By connecting K-12 and university students in scientific research, the project enhances education in STEM fields. Undergraduate training is also extensive, involving national efforts to recruit under-served groups into science and participation from the Southwest Indian Polytechnic Institute. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research at the Sevilleta Long Term Ecological Research site seeks to understand how abiotic drivers and constraints affect the pulse dynamics and stability of arid-land populations, communities, and ecosystems. This award will extend previous research on short-term, local-scale processes to understand pulse-driven regional-scale transitions and transfer of materials between landscape units. An experiment at the grassland-shrubland transition will be initiated to understand the roles of shallow versus deep soil moisture in plant and microbial exchanges and associated ecosystem processes. A rain manipulation will impose large monsoons to assess the impact of rainfall pulses, and manipulations of fragile bio-crusts will document exchanges and biotic interactions underlying a novel loop by which fungi integrate ecosystem functions by transforming, translocating, and storing C and nutrients.  New research in pinon-juniper woodlands will examine plant function across this transition and assess microbial community responses to water manipulations. This research will compare the role that fungi play in woodlands with the roles that microbes play in grasslands. High resolution measurements of daily and seasonal changes in water quality and quantity will be used to document how disturbances such as fire interact with pulses of rain to transfer nutrients and organic matter into tributaries that feed the Rio Grande River. Results from these diverse activities will be integrated, using simulation models, to document the effects that precipitation pulses have on plant  recruitment, growth, and mortality of different species at the plant to patch scale, and how these drive long-term patterns in dominance and composition across landscapes.</AbstractNarration>

We study how the growth and activity of plant species in each of these communities responds to variation and change in the physical environment, the influence of plant growth, flowering and seed production on associated animal communities, the role of microbes in soils and plants, particularly understudied desert ascomycetes, and the response of these ecosystems to disturbances such as fire or climate extremes (drought, severe freezing).  During the first 30 years of the project, examples of key SEV LTER measurements and the resulting advances in ecological knowledge that could only be obtained through long-term monitoring and experimentation include:     1) Long-term measurements of growth, productivity and reproduction of key species in multiple ecosystems captured the response of these species as growing conditions change over time.  Comparison of these data with long-term records of temperature and precipitation allowed SEV LTER researchers to advance our knowledge of the role of long-term weather patterns like El Ni?o and La Ni?a in controlling the growth and reproduction of plants in these ecosystems.     2) Long-term measurements of populations of small mammals at multiple sites spanning key regional ecosystems captured how rodent population cycles are related to variation in environment (temperature and precipitation) and vegetation productivity and reproduction.  These data, together with museum specimens of key rodent species collected over time, were used to help reveal the ecological context and identity of Hanta virus in the southwestern US when it emerged as an unknown disease in the Four Corners region.     3) Long-term experiments at SEV LTER have imposed changes in growing conditions (temperature and precipitation) or vegetation structure, coupled with long-term measurements to understand the impact of these manipulations as they unfold through a period of years.  Coupled with long-term observations of biological function under climate variability and change, these experiments allow us to understand the impacts climate conditions that cannot be assumed to occur during the period of a standard research grant.  These experiments have advanced our understanding of the response mechanisms of grasses (photo 3), shrubs and trees during severe drought, the changes in grassland vegetation when warming and precipitation interact, and the impact of changes to summer precipitation in the region on grassland communities (photo 4).      4) Using eddy covariance methods (photo 5), large-scale long-term measurements of the uptake and release of CO2 provides a cumulative record across ecosystems that are representative of large areas of the southwestern US.  These data have revealed the role of within-season versus between-season climate fluctuation on the storage of carbon in semi-arid ecosystems.     5) Combining long-term observations and experiments, SEV LTER has tested the long-standing idea in ecology that the many aspects of ecosystem activity in arid lands are governed by the size, frequency, and intensity of rainfall events (the pulse-reserve hypothesis of Noy-Meir), which generate activity by adding water to the ecosystem.  SEV research revised the focus of this idea from the role of single rainfall events, to the importance of year-to-year variation in the sequence of pulses, an area of study that is ongoing.      As the breadth and impact of SEV research have expanded (over 800 publications cited more than 61,000 times according to Google Scholar), SEV LTER has contributed to training generations of young scientists through graduate research (more than 80 masters and doctoral students), undergraduate mentoring (including an NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates program) and through our Schoolyard LTER, the Bosque Environmental Monitoring Program (BEMP). BEMP brings K-12 students from schools along the Rio Grande to local sites where students collect long-term data describing the state and function of this landmark ecosystem of the western US.

During the 3-year period of this final award that ended the first phase of the Sevilleta LTER, our proposal to work at the same site won a competitive external review process for a new LTER site. This new award extends the long-term data collection from the past and addresses a novel set of research questions, enabling a continuous record of the structure and function of the ecosystems that represent key ecological transitions in drylands and continuing the legacy of BEMP?s contributions to community science and science literacy.
