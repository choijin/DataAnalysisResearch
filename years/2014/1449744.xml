<AbstractNarration>Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano is one of the best places on Earth to study processes within basaltic volcanoes. Its high eruption frequency, easy access to lavas, distinct geologic setting in the central Pacific far from plate boundaries or continents, and the extensive knowledge base on Kilauea allows research us to address fundamental problems related to active volcanoes. The tasks and issues we propose to address are: 1) Monitoring the magmatic evolution of lavas from Kilauea's two ongoing eruptions to evaluate mantle melting processes and the magmatic architecture of the volcano; 2) Documenting the extent and origin of crustal contamination in its recent lavas; 3) Determining the controls of Kilauea's effusive-explosive cycles during the last 2200 years; and 4) Creating an education module to engage students in learning science through studying active volcanoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hawaii is a superb location for petrologic and geochemical research on basaltic volcanoes. Prior NSF support has allowed the Principal Investigator and colleagues to monitor the petrologic and geochemical variations of lava from the current rift eruption and to witness the dynamic changes in the melting process and mantle source composition during this long-lasting magmatic event. Our published work has shown that melt is transported through the mantle in open channels to the surface without significant pooling and homogenization, preserving remarkable short-term (~10 years) Pb isotopic variations. The new summit eruption (ongoing since 2008) provided the first samples from Kilauea's central magma storage reservoir since 1982. These new samples indicate a geochemically distinct mantle-derived magma was delivered to the summit reservoir in 2009 that has not yet (as of 2012) erupted at Pu'u 'O'o. If the geochemical differences between these two eruptions persist, they suggest there are separate conduits to the mantle for each vent, a major departure from current models for Kilauea's magmatic system. New studies have shown that explosive eruptions have dominated Kilauea's last 2200 years and that geochemistry may be a harbinger of explosive eruptions. NSF funding will be used to: 1. Monitor the magmatic evolution of Kilauea lavas from its two ongoing eruptions; 2. determine whether the O isotope variations we have observed for Kilauea lavas are related to crustal contamination or source heterogeneity; and 3. extend our study of temporal geochemical variations of Kilauea's rocks ~2000 years into its explosive past to determine whether enriched magmas are indicators of explosive eruptions. Our geochemical results have been and will continued to be integrated with observations from Hawaiian Volcano Observatory's field, geochemical and geophysical monitoring programs, and interpreted in consultation with their staff. Our holistic approach to evaluating magmatic processes at Kilauea is critical for understanding how this and other basaltic volcanoes work.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Kilauea volcano is the best studied volcano on Earth but much remains to be understood. As we gather more information, we learn more about what we don't understand and are able to ask better questions to address the fundamental causes of volcanism on oceanic islands. K&#299;lauea volcano is a superb venue for geochemical research because of its high frequency and easy access to eruptions, and its unique geological setting in the central Pacific far from plate boundaries or continents. This NSF sponsored study addressed several aspects of Kilauea's recent activity.&nbsp; In chronological order: 1. Age of Kilauea; 2. the explosive period from 1500-1820 CE; 3. Magmatic architecture of Kilauea from 1790-2018; and 4. Kilauea's longest lived eruption (1983-2018).</p> <p>1. How old is Kilauea volcano? This study examined lava from a deep drill hole (1.7 km) to determine when Kilauea started shield stage volcanism. Our new results (Garcia et al., 2017) show that it is twice the age that was previously proposed and that it starting growing about 600 thousand years ago. These new ages also indicate Kilauea is much larger than previously assumed and that the recent growth has been much more rapid than previously thought.</p> <p>2. The explosive period started in 1500 CE long before the first observations by westerners in 1820's. We examined the petrology (glass and olivine chemistry) of the explosion products to assess the cause of this explosive period. We found that it was not related to volatile-rich magma as previously thought. Rather, the cause was related to a dramatic decrease in the magma supply rate and the interaction of these more primitive mantle-derived magmas with surface water (Lynn et al., 2017; Garcia et al. 2018).</p> <p>3. Magmatic architecture of Kilauea: How do the rift zone and summit magma systems relate? This study examined historical lavas (1790-2018) erupted at the summit and along the two rift zones to evaluate Kilauea's magmatic plumbing system. The goal was to identify geochemically distinct magma batches from the mantle and track their movement though the ERZ and/or SWRZ. The results show that geochemically distinct batches of magma are routinely (every few years to few months) intruded into Kilauea. Thus, magma was efficiently transmitted from the source to the surface. In most cases, magma is first intruded into the summit magma reservoir before being intruded into the rift zones (Pietruszka et al., 2018). This is the opposite to what was previously thought about how the magma system at Kilauea worked.</p> <p>&nbsp;4. The Puu Oo: Kilauea's longest lived and most voluminous historical eruption. This timeseries study</p> <p>of isotopic and geochemical variations over short time scales (months to years) Kilauea improved our temporal and spatial resolution of melting processes and the chemical structure of mantle plumes (Garcia et al., in review). We collected more than 500 samples (usually in a molten state) on hoursly to weekly timescales to evaluate petrologic and geochemical variations during the eruption and these results have been published in eight peer-reivewed papers with another one in review. This dense and real-time sampling allowed identification of the dynamic changes in crustal and mantle process during a single, long-lasting magmatic event to be assessed. We found that melt extraction and transport was through open channels during the Pu?u ?&#332;?&#333; eruption. Melt was efficiently transmitted variations of melting in the heterogeneous source to lavas erupted at the surface without significant pooling and homogenization, preserving short-term isotopic and geochemical variations. The small size of K&#299;lauea's summit reservoir compared to the volume of magma produced during the Pu?u ?&#332;?&#333; eruption (0.1?0.5 km<sup>3</sup>) allowed the buffering effects of mixing with summit stored magma to be minimized and the erupted lava to more closely reflect its parental composition. The geochemistry of these samples revealed compositional changes over hours (in rare cases) for major elements to a few years for isotope ratios resulting from source heterogeneity, and variations in crustal processes (magma mixing and crustal assimilation. Thus, the Pu?u ?&#332;?&#333; eruption provides a rare opportunity to sample mantle-derived melts almost continuously over 3.5 decades. This time-series analysis of Pu?u ?&#332;?&#333; lavas allowed us to distinguish the changing roles of mantle and crustal processes in great detail.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/29/2019<br>      Modified by: Michael&nbsp;O&nbsp;Garcia</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1449744/1449744_10367851_1572393286711_AgeofKilauea--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1449744/1449744_10367851_1572393286711_AgeofKilauea--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Age of Kilauea"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1449744/1449744_10367851_1572393286711_AgeofKilauea--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Age of Kilauea"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Radioisotopic ages for Hawaii Scientific Observation Hole Program SOH-1 samples plotted versus corrected depth (afterexcluding intervening dikes).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Garcia et al. 2017</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Michael&nbsp;O&nbsp;Garcia</div> <div class="imageTitle">Age of Kilauea</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1449744/1449744_10367851_1572387516150_Pietruszkaetal2018crosssection--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1449744/1449744_10367851_1572387516150_Pietruszkaetal2018crosssection--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Kilauea's magma plumbing system"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1449744/1449744_10367851_1572387516150_Pietruszkaetal2018crosssection--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Kilauea's magma plumbing system"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The magmatic evolution and architecture of the summit and rift zones of K&#305;lauea Volcano from 1959 to early 2018, illustrated using a time series of schematic cross sections.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Pietruszka et al. 2018</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Michael&nbsp;O&nbsp;Garcia</div> <div class="imageTitle">Kilauea's magma plumbing system</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1449744/1449744_10367851_1572390671784_Garciaetal2018stratsection--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1449744/1449744_10367851_1572390671784_Garciaetal2018stratsection--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Kilauea explosive deposits: 1500-1820 CE"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1449744/1449744_10367851_1572390671784_Garciaetal2018stratsection--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Kilauea explosive deposits: 1500-1820 CE"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Graphic log showing a simplified composite section for theKeanak&#257;ko?i Tephra with basic descriptions of some units.
