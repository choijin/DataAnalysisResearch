<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Proposal for a Workshop on Reducing Barriers for the Management, Integration, and Public Sharing of Large and Complex Data among Biologists Working at Genome-Phenome to Macrosystems Levels (EF-1450894)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS) will convene a workshop for biologists from plant sciences and environmental macrosystems to discuss public access to federally funded research. The workshop will focus on challenges associated with research that requires combining data from multiple sources to conduct the research. The need to consider data management practices and problems is especially pressing for research communities in biology that require and generate large complex data, particularly when the resulting data will be used for future research. While different fields of biology may require different data these same research communities have common (and unique) issues they face related to managing and integrating these complex data, complying with standards and requirements, and how they can improve their science and its ongoing usefulness to the general public that support it through federal tax dollars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The macrosystems biology community works on quantitative, interdisciplinary, systems-oriented research on biosphere processes and their complex interactions with climate, land use, and invasive species at regional to continental scales. The systematics, evolutionary biology, and biological collections communities are also grappling with "big data" and "long tail data" issues. The genome-to-phenome community works in disciplines that include, but are not limited to, plant physiology, quantitative genetics, biochemistry, and bioengineering, especially in plants of economic importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop has broad reaching implications as researchers from different fields learn of each other's data, tools, and techniques, new scientific questions and opportunities can be expected to emerge, many at the intersection of previously independent lines of scholarship. Coupled with increased public access, the results can stimulate new private sector innovations and contribute to new scientific discoveries as different research communities access data collected by other disciplines. Results of the workshop and plans for further cross-disciplinary collaboration will be shared in a publicly accessible article that will be placed in the BioScience journal.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Complex data integration, bringing together data from two or more domains, is required for addressing many scientific questions that will improve the health, prosperity and security of the nation.  For example, the ability to bring together data from genetics and genomics with environmental data will enable scientists to better understand how agriculturally important species respond to environmental stresses.  This information will enable agricultural scientists to develop new crops that will help to promote global food availability and security. Similarly, with increased data integration, public health officials can obtain the information they require to forecast the spread of pathogens.  These are only two of many examples of the benefits society will receive from increased integration of complex biological data.   Participants at a March 2015 "Workshop on Complex Data Integration" identified multiple data integration use cases, both current and potential, that can guide the development of practices that support increased data integration. The workshop&mdash;convened by the American Institute of Biological Sciences&mdash;discussed barriers to complex data integration, in areas such as data discovery and access, evaluating data for fitness of use, the process of data integration, education and training, and infrastructure and governance to coordinate progress toward solutions.  Participants recognized domain silos as a major reason for the high barriers to data integration.  For example, data discovery and integration are currently hampered by a lack of common standards, including those for identifications, representation, ontologies, data formats, and data collection protocols.  Community coalescence around standards, not more standards, is key.  Participants recommend greater interagency discussions about how to provide linkages across data systems, thus making data from all sites more readily discoverable and distributing the financial burden.    Complex data integration requires well-honed technical expertise.  Participants supported cross-training in informatics for graduate students in the biological sciences and a higher level of specialist "data scientist" training.  Funding mechanisms that enable scientists to employ technical specialists for specific data integration tasks would enable complex data integration.  Participants also discussed a need for a governance function or infrastructure that could help identify a path forward in complex data integration, including developing strategic and operational plans, brokering relationships, facilitating communication, and overseeing the implementation of data integration plans.
