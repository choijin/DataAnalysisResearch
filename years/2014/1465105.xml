<AbstractNarration>With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Drs. Blair, Rahman, and Tetard of the University of Central Florida are involved in a vertically integrated effort aimed at understanding catalysis over defects in 2D structures. This "waste" carbon dioxide, which is presently discarded, could be a useful material for making a variety of products.  By chemically combining carbon dioxide with hydrogen generated using solar energy, products such as fuels and plastics could be realized without the need for petroleum, and carbon dioxide would be removed from the waste stream and used as a starting material.  This would enable carbon dioxide to be seen as a valuable resource instead of a waste product to be managed.  Key to this approach is the application of a new type of catalyst based on sheet-like materials with imperfections.  By introducing imperfections into materials like boron nitride, which is currently used as a lubricant and in cosmetics, Drs. Blair, Rahman, and Tetard are accessing new chemical pathways that may pave the way towards a carbon dioxide economy.  Dr. Rahman is investigating the theoretical underpinnings of these new catalysts. Dr. Tetard is studying their structure and reactivity at a molecular level and Dr. Blair is moving the findings toward implementation in the real world.  The catalysts being investigated may supplant existing toxic metal catalysts, eliminate the health risks associated with the metals, and divert carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere.  Summer research projects targeting those with disadvantaged backgrounds are being developed.  Drs. Blair, Rahman, and Tetard are actively working to integrate disadvantaged minority individuals in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This team is investigating how defects in h-BN (boron nitride) produce catalytic activity towards the production of linear alcohols from carbon dioxide and hydrogen as well as the unique, metal-free activation of olefins for hydrogenation.  These defects are very difficult to characterize and a tiered approach is required to fully understand this system.  DFT-based calculations are used to generate reaction energetics and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations are performed to evaluate the temporal evolution of surface species on defects, as a function of temperatures and pressures relevant to Dr. Blair's experiments.  Experimental data acquired by Drs. Blair and Tetard are linked to the theoretical results in order to develop a complete understanding of the catalytic system at the atomic level.  Dr. Tetard is developing methods for direct imaging and measurement of defects as well as bound species using scanning transmission electron microscopy and functionalized-tip atomic force microscopy.  A new technique combining atomic force microscopy (AFM) hardware with Raman and infrared spectroscopy is being developed to allow nano-scale analysis of bound species under conditions relevant to macroscopic reactions.  Dr. Blair is studying the kinetics and reaction products of multi-gram batch reactions for carbon dioxide as well as olefin hydrogenation.  A multi-size ranged understanding of catalysis over defects in 2D materials will foster innovation in the capture and utilization of carbon dioxide.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This work demonstrated the importance of localized surface electronic structures in the catalytic processing of hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide.  It is the absence of atoms in the catalyst studied that enables chemistry.  Study of the effect defects, such as vacancies, have on catalytic efficacy is extremely challenging and this effort sought to develop experimental and theoretical tools to understand the interaction of defects with chemical species.  An integrated research effort resulted in a research cycle where theory was used to understand fundamental surface interactions, which were then measured and implemented.  Bulk reaction observations were used to improve theoretical models.  We found that olefin hydrogenation proceeded metal-free over nitrogen vacancies in boron nitride.  Carbon dioxide was also converted to methyl alcohol and standard computational approaches were not sufficient to describe the observed chemistry.  By following adsorption of both carbon dioxide and hydrogen simultaneously, a plausible chemical pathway to methyl alcohol and formic acid was found. Surface studies identified the binding of carbon dioxide to defect-laden boron nitride and found that this material also facilitate the dehydrogenation of olefins under laser light illumination.  We successfully developed a mechanically coupled reactor that allowed defects to be generated continuously and macroscopic rates to be studied. This design was transitioned to a more industrially relevant implementation with reactant gases flowing through the catalyst.  This integrated research effort employed theoreticians, surface scientists, chemists, and mechanical engineers.  Student researchers learned to look beyond disciplinary boundaries to study this challenging topic. The carbon dioxide chemistry studied represents a relatively low energy method for the capture and utilization of carbon dioxide.  Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main component of all combustion products produced in power generation and transportation. As consumer demands increase, increased CO2 emissions are expected. Global carbon dioxide emissions have been steadily increasing with each year setting a new record high. Reducing emissions, of this greenhouse gas, is of critical importance.  This effort enabled basic research in the reduction of carbon dioxide to value-added compounds providing economic incentive for capturing and utilizing CO2 instead of disincentives for CO2 release. Additionally, the catalytic system investigated for this effort could enable energy shifting as CO2 is processed with solar-generated hydrogen during peak production and the methyl alcohol produced burned to generate power during peak demand and low solar output.  The ideas developed in this effort present an alternative to the traditional use of metals in catalytic reactions.  A pathway toward metal-free processing of industrial and consumer products will reduce the United States dependence on raw materials from other countries.
