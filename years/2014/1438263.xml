<AbstractNarration>Principal Investigator:  Scott Banta&lt;br/&gt;Number:  1438263&lt;br/&gt;Title:  SusChEM: Long chain hydrocarbons from CO2 and electricity via genetic modification of a chemolithoautotrophic bacterium&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Columbia University&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;There is a national need to develop carbon-neutral processes for the production of liquid transportation fuels.  This project will develop a new process to turn carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, and renewable electricity into liquid fuels and chemicals using a unique microorganism integrated into an electrochemical device. Particular efforts will be made to dramatically increase the production of the liquid hydrocarbon heptadecane by genetically engineering the metabolism of the microorganism.  Genetic engineering tools will also be developed to make the genetic modifications permanent, which will create robust cell lines capable of making fuels and chemicals in an industrial process using electricity and atmospheric carbon dioxide as the feedstock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a new electrofuels platform for producing hydrocarbons from atmospheric carbon dioxide using electricity.  The unique electrofuels platform consists of two integrated reactors.  The first is a bioreactor containing Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans cells which are able to grow at low pH using carbon dioxide as their sole carbon source and the oxidation of ferrous to ferric iron as an energy source.  The ferric iron is sent to an electrochemical reactor which efficiently reduces the ferric iron back to ferrous iron.  The combined reactor system produces biomass from electricity, water and air.  The cells have been genetically modified with two different exogenous metabolic pathways for chemical and/or fuel production, and preliminary results show that cells can be transiently transformed to produce small amounts of heptadecane from carbon dioxide.  In order to advance this new technology, it will be critical to increase the production of heptadecane and/or other long chain hydrocarbons.  This will be accomplished using co-transformations to transiently over-express or knock-down the expression of key metabolic genes to determine strategies to direct the flux of carbon into the production of the fuels.  Further development of this technology will require permanent transformation of exogenous genes into the chromosome of these cells.  New methods will be developed to edit the A. ferrooxidans genome to enable the chromosomal integration of genes and pathways into this unique host cell system.  The best new cell lines will be characterized in the integrated electrofuels platform so that the improvements in efficiency obtained from these maneuvers can be quantified in terms of yield of fuel per kW-hr of electricity utilized.   Through these research activities, the project will train a Columbia University graduate student, who will also help to develop content for a distant-learning program to build the capacity of West African experts in the field of sustainable energy systems and solutions.  Topics from this course will also be integrated into two graduate level elective courses at Columbia University as well as other outreach activities in the local community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The development of chemicals and fuels without using fossil carbon resources is a grand societal challenge.  In one emerging concept, termed electrofuels, electricity from renewable sources could be used to convert carbon dioxide into fuels and chemicals that are currently obtained from petroleum.  We have explored the use of the iron oxidizing bacterium Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans for this process.  These cells (which are currently exploited in commercialized biomining operations) grow at low pH, obtain CO2 from the air, and obtain energy from the oxidation of ferrous iron to ferric iron.  The ferric iron can be reduced back to ferrous iron using electrochemical reactors powered by renewable energy.  We have previously demonstrated the first preliminary genetic engineering of these cells to produce isobutyric acid (a chemical) and heptadecane (a fuel) from CO2.  The overall goal of this SusChEM project was the development of an improved electrofuel platform via the genetic engineering of A. ferrooxidans cells.  The Intellectual Merit of the project stemmed from the fact that new genetic engineering tools are needed to advance the electrofuel concept, and the Broader Impact of the project arose from the societal benefits of new carbon-neutral sustainable energy solutions.  During the course of this project we were able to make several breakthrough advances in the genetic modification of A. ferrooxidans cells.  We developed and characterized new inducible promoter sequences, we demonstrated the use of a new plasmid DNA vector, we developed new growth medium and selection techniques to enhance the genetic transformation of the cells.  And most importantly, we demonstrated the first integration of functional foreign genes into the A. ferrooxidans genome which is an essential accomplishment for the use of these cells in any industrial process.  Several graduate students and undergraduate students were supported during the course of this research. A PhD dissertation, at least 3 peer reviewed publications, and several national meeting presentations were supported by this work.  A start-up company based on this research has been launched and has already received STTR Phase I funding from the NSF.
