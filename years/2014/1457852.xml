<AbstractNarration>This proposal supports the National Center for Atmospheric Research to assist the Army Research Laboratory (ARL)in preparing a written description of the observation-nudging code data assimilation in the community version of the Advanced Research Weather (ARW) Research Forecast model.  The document might suggest changes to the available configurations of the ARW.  In addition, NCAR will collaborate with ARL on a studey of the relative performances of the observation nudging in the community ARW and the observation nudging in the 4DWX system developed by NCAR Research Aviation Laboratory. The result will be a written at least one journal article. Furthermore, a white paper will be produced conveying best practices for applying the ARW for simulations at gride intervals less than 1.0km.</AbstractNarration>

Preliminary modeling results show that smaller grid intervals increase the model's ability to simulate the fine-scale structure and intensity of moist convection and high wind. Sensitivity experiments reveal the impact of different sub-grid filters (diffusion schemes), terrain smoothing, and surface momentum fluxes and heat fluxes.  The research efforts led to the development of better documentation for the observation-nudging code for data assimilation in the community version of the WRF model.  Project outcomes included output from the WRF Model, algorithms for filtering observations and model data, and an informal report on the developed algorithms for diagnosing turbulence at unmanned aircraft system scales.  These tools improve the use and visualization of forecasts by end users.  Results from the project have been disseminated through journal articles, conference presentations, and technology transfer of computer code.
