<AbstractNarration>The new Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule should regulate more than 90% of mercury emissions virtually from all combustion sources including from coal- and oil-fired utility, industrial, commercial, and institutional power plants from 2016.  Among elemental, oxidized, and particulate-bound mercury species present in flue gas, elemental mercury (Hg(0)) vapor is most difficult to control, but imperative to control in order to meet the stringent MATS rule from all coal-fired power plants.  The proposed project bridges the gap between a fundamental mechanistic understanding of heterogeneous catalytic Hg(0) oxidation and its scale-up issues. It will not only validate the PI's heterogeneous Hg(0) oxidation technology in a more practical bench-scale setting but also allow for investigating the scale-up of the catalytic reaction from a granular shape to a structured shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed research will enhance the engineering capability to predict Hg(0) removal based on the  fundamental understanding of physical and chemical principles. It will lead to advancing scientific knowledge and broadening mercury control options for the new proposed mercury rule. It will ultimately lead to various environmental remediation and separation technologies based on heterogeneous catalysis, adsorption, and absorption. The educational plan will provide co-benefits for chemical and environmental engineering faculty, students, and professionals in the areas of environmental catalysis, separation, and air quality/air pollution control.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The new U.S. EPAÆs Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule should regulate more than 90% of mercury emissions virtually from all combustion sources including from coal- and oil-fired utility, industrial, commercial, and institutional power plants from 2016.  Among elemental, oxidized, and particulate-bound mercury species present in flue gas, elemental mercury vapor is most difficult to control, but imperative to control in order to meet the stringent MATS rule from all coal-fired power plants.  Although the MATS rule would be effective in 2016, there are not many reliable and economical mercury control technologies in the market.  Activated carbon injection is one of the most mature technologies, but still has potential issues such as fly ash sales, economics, and fugitive emissions.      Our I-Corps teamÆs catalyst can reliably and robustly oxidize elemental mercury under various flue gas conditions, and can be installed as a separate catalytic reactor system or integrated into an existing Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) unit for NOx reduction.  Then the resultant oxidized mercury species can be readily separated by wet flue gas desulfurization (wet FGD) systems or activated carbon sorbent injection.     Our teamÆs project could bridge the gap between the performances obtained from lab-scale heterogeneous catalytic Hg(0) oxidation and its scale-up issues.  It not only validated the PIÆs heterogeneous Hg(0) oxidation technology in a more practical bench-scale setting but also allowed for investigating the scale-up of the catalytic reaction from a granular shape to a structured shape.  This is a critical engineering issue when a catalytic process is scaled up.  However, this has not been well studied and reported in Hg(0) oxidation catalysis.  The bench-scale setting used for the project also allowed the team to evaluate the catalyst performance under more practical conditions than a lab-scale setting.  The catalyst was also examined for an Hg(0) oxidation mechanism over the catalyst surface.  This project helped fill the technological gap associated with scale-up by elevating our teamÆs heterogeneous catalytic Hg(0) oxidation technology from research discoveries to a commercial technology.     Our catalyst technology has potential to reliably, economically, and consistently oxidize Hg(0) vapor without any significant interactions with other flue gas constituents under various flue gas conditions.  Along with the MATS rule, the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) already started to strictly regulate SO2 and NOx emissions, and will drive the installation of a total 272.2 GW of wet FGD out of a total 373 GW to be generated from coal combustion by 2020.  Our Hg(0) oxidation catalyst can be installed as a Hg(0)-specific catalytic reactor or at the tail end of an existing SCR unit.  Subsequent oxidized mercury separation in wet FGD systems has been identified as one of the most economical control options, and would be applicable to most major coal-fired plants.  The commercialization of this technology is expected to help overcome technological barriers for impending mercury emissions control, which will ultimately lead to effective utilization of an abundant coal reserve in the country, the national health, and welfare.
