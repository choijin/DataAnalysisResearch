<AbstractNarration>Non-technical abstract:  &lt;br/&gt;The electron spin is a fascinating property of materials.  Its binary nature "spin-up or -down" acts as the simplest example of quantization, and as such, it is often used as the starting point for quantum mechanics textbooks. The magnetic moment of the electron spin is a primary driver of the rich field of magnetism, and its interaction with the orbital motion (known as spin-orbit interaction), can have significant consequences such as the anomalous Hall effect in ferromagnets.  Although present in some degree in all materials, only recently with the discovery of a new class of materials known as topological insulators (materials insulating on the bulk but metallic on the surface), it has been realized that spin-orbit coupling can be the driver of beautiful new phenomena in non-magnetic materials as well.  This project focuses on an experimental investigation of the emergent spin dependent physics from spin-orbit coupling in a range of materials relevant to both fundamental materials science research and technology, with main focus on the three dimensional topological insulators.  Students working on this project will develop expertise in material characterization methodologies and the evolving techniques of photoelectron spectroscopy to become future leaders of the new growing community of experimental spin-dynamics. This will prepare them for scientific careers in industry, academia or government laboratories. In conjunction with outreach programs at UC Berkeley, this project will involve minorities and young students to instill passion and curiosity for science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract:  &lt;br/&gt;A prominent topic in current condensed matter physics is the development of materials and devices that utilize the spin degree of freedom, in contrast to traditional electronics, which use only the electronic charge.  The rapidly expanding field of spin-orbit coupled materials and the recent discovery of topological insulators constitute one exciting route to such control.   Topological insulators are insulating materials characterized by a bulk bandgap, and massless Dirac fermion surface states which are spin non-degenerate and features unique spin-momentum locking in which states are strongly spin polarized along a spatial direction determined by the direction of their crystal momentum.  This project seeks to advance our understanding of spin-orbit physics in three-dimensional topological insulators and on the interaction between topologically protected surface states and symmetry breaking materials, as well as to search for new way to manipulate the resulting spin texture with light. This is achieved by use of novel technique of time-, spin- and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Students working on this project will develop expertise in the field of vacuum, material characterization, laser, optics and photoelectron spectroscopy. The project will also target minorities and young students through school-year mentorship and summer research projects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Materials that can both conduct and insulate against the flow of electricity are of great interest for use as components in advanced electronic devices as well as for fundamental condensed-matter studies.     One of such materials, V2O3, has attracted interests for more than 50 years.  Indeed V2O3 behaves as a metal at high temperature (above 160K) and turns to an insulator below this temperature. For long time it was believed that V2O3 is the typical example of an ideal Mott metal insulator transition, where the insulator state arise as a result of Coulomb repulsion between electrons.   However, despite many years of study and progress the origin of this phenomenon ultimately remained a mystery, due to the lack of information on the electronic structure and how it evolves with temperature.  Using high resolution angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy we have revealed and overturn a decade-old theory about metal/insulator transitions (MITs) in this material, showing that the measured electronic structure  cannot be explained by any known theory, asking for a reconsideration of the nature of the metal insulator transition in this materials.   Specifically we found a triangular like Fermi surface (see figure) with an hole pocket like dispersion, in contrast to the previously predicted electron pocket requiring an half-filling of the eg pi bands.
