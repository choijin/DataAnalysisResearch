<AbstractNarration>This award is being used to convene an expert workshop on STEM educator professional development using online and blended delivery methods and their potential application within the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program.  GLOBE is an international science and science education program, jointly managed by NASA and NSF, that engages educators and students in collecting protocol-driven data on more than 55 different environmental parameters and contributing those observations to a global database. Elementary and secondary students in more than 110 countries participate in the program. The workshop will identify the current state of knowledge regarding effective online and blended professional development models that have the greatest potential to be used by the GLOBE program. Switching to a mostly online format for training teachers in the GLOBE protocols - currently done through face-to-face workshops - will allow the GLOBE program to continue growing in a more cost effective way.  The workshop will also identify a set of important education research questions that can leverage the large and diverse GLOBE community as a research platform.  These include issues such as how effective online professional development links to student achievement in STEM, cultural factors that may influence the effectiveness of educator professional development, and how to scale-up effective professional development practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "GLOBE Program Online Teacher Professional Development Conference" is being convened at NSF headquarters in early September 2014. It will bring together 20 participants with expertise in STEM educator professional development, online learning, and the GLOBE program.  The main deliverable of this workshop will be a report identifying the most appropriate and best strategies for using online and blended training for GLOBE program educators and a preliminary education research agenda that might leverage the unparalleled opportunities offered by the extensive and culturally diverse community that engages in GLOBE activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Organized in partnership by the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), the GLOBE Program Online Teacher Professional Development Conference convened on September 4&ndash;5, 2014 at the NSF Headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. The conference involved 20 participants, comprising national experts in teacher professional development and online learning, as well as relevant staff from the NSF, NASA, and the GLOBE Program.  GLOBE engages students and teachers at participating schools around the world in inquiry-based investigations of the environment and the Earth system, collaborating with scientists and working in close partnership with NASA, NOAA, and NSF. Since 1995, the program has reached over 66,000 teachers and 10 million students in 112 countries. One of the greatest challenges faced by the GLOBE Program is providing high quality professional development opportunities around the world that are accessible and affordable for science teachers. By providing a forum for identifying best practices in teacher professional development that include online strategies to support GLOBE teachers throughout the world, the two day GLOBE Program Conference made an important contribution to enhancing environmental awareness and scientific knowledge for tens of thousands of teachers, and will impact millions of students.  The conference set out to accomplish the following major goals: (1) to identify best practices for teacher professional development that include online and blended strategies that are most relevant to the needs of the GLOBE Program; and (2) to identify a potential research agenda for advancing our understanding of how to provide effective online and blended teacher professional development opportunities, leveraging the GLOBE ProgramÆs investment in this area. The expert workshop explored several topics to inform the design and scope of an online or blended professional development model that supports the needs of the GLOBE Program, including: effective professional development, models of professional development delivery, cultural differences, scale, technology, and research.  At the conclusion of the conference, following a review and synthesis of the findings, the participants made five key recommendations to enhance online professional development for the GLOBE Program:  Define      specific goals for students, science teachers, and professional      development facilitators. Develop      a continuum of teacher professional development opportunities. Leverage      GLOBEÆs online platform. Expand      GLOBEÆs existing teaching resources. Develop      potential research agenda.   By bringing together STEM professional development leaders from across the nation, the conference provided a unique opportunity for experts to identify digital delivery models and online learning strategies that can make GLOBE teacher professional development&mdash;and other professional development for inquiry-driven STEM education&mdash;more accessible to science teachers around the world.
