<AbstractNarration>This project will develop new approaches that will unleash the potential of Bayesian methods for extracting meaningful structure in the "big data" that are of increasing interest and importance today.  This will entail the creation of rapidly computable methods that enhance or bypass the much slower simulation methods upon which Bayesian methods have come to rely.   By more efficiently harnessing the power of high-performance computing, our methods will provide a feasible vehicle for uncovering systematic associations in data across a variety of scientific disciplines. Examples include (a) genomics, where identifying the genetic determinants of diseases can substantially enhance targeted therapeutic decisions, (b) neuroimaging, where efficient methods will greatly facilitate understanding the complex brain architecture, and (c) environmental sciences, where identifying the determinants of climate change can better inform policy decisions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The main thrust of this research will be the development of a broad framework for fast deterministic search implementations for Bayesian model selection and inference.   Building on new directions recently opened up by EMVS, a fast new alternative to stochastic search, this work will vastly increase the feasibility of general Bayesian implementations for large high-dimensional problems. This will entail the development of algorithms for classes of models that go beyond the canonical normal linear model. The speed of these algorithms will enable the broad application of new dynamic posterior exploration. Properties of the implicit selective shrinkage selection will be studied and asymptotic theory developed. New approaches to posterior reconstruction will provide new avenues for inference.  Effectively, this project will lay the groundwork for a new paradigm for posterior exploration in large high-dimensional problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A major component of the accomplished research successfully developed new methods for finding systematic structure in large complex data.  Using the Bayesian paradigm for extracting information, these methods deployed carefully designed probabilistic models which implicitly assign high probability to promising information. Fast new methods for feasible implementation were also devised.  And in further new directions, new research on post selection inference and the consequences of model misspecification laid the groundwork for new assumption lean frameworks as a new basis for honest, practical statistical practice.  A particularly valuable feature of this new paradigm is its ability to guard against the irreproducibility phenomena which have all too often contaminated contemporary scientific reporting.  The major activities of this project consisted of the preparation of 27 papers, of which 16 were published selective, prominent peer reviewed statistical journals and the rest submitted and now under review at similar venues. Further dissemination of these results was accomplished with 42 lecture presentations at universities and conferences around the world.   Another major component of the project consisted of educating graduate students and mentoring junior researchers. The postdocs and students who were advised by the PI are now at various stages of very successful careers the at the University of Chicago, at INSEAD and at MIT.  These and other current graduate students at Wharton all collaborated with the PI on developing the many new promising research directions opened up by this NSF supported research.
