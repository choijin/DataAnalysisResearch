<AbstractNarration>With a collection of more than 1.2 million preserved plant specimens, the Wisconsin State Herbarium (WIS) at the UW-Madison ranks among the top 1% of the world's largest and most active herbaria.  It is the third largest public university herbarium in the Americas, and is used extensively by a diverse clientele, including citizens engaged in ecological restoration, state biologists, researchers, professors, as well as students who are conducting independent research or enrolled in any of the nine different university courses that incorporate the herbarium's collection into teaching.  Recently, WIS was listed as one of 14 herbaria in the world whose online specimen data has been consulted at least 20 times in studies documenting environmental change; it is a world class resource.  As its holdings have grown, the herbarium reached its carrying capacity decades ago, and its facilities are now overcrowded, inadequate for maintaining curatorial standards of specimen storage, and unable to provide full public access.  For example, the mechanized compactor holding 476 cabinets of flowering plants has failed and cannot be repaired.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Critical upgrades will take place on both floors of the herbarium; its 30-year old motorized compactor system on the main floor will be modified into a new, more reliable manual system, and a new high-density mobile storage system and associated cabinets will be installed in the herbarium's newly acquired second floor.  These improvements will allow for consolidation of collections scattered throughout the building, proper safekeeping and expansion, especially among its exceptional algae, fungi, lichens, and mosses.  A reorganization of the entire herbarium collection will follow this expansion, including adoption of a contemporary phylogenetic system of plant classification, which is now taught in all formal university courses on campus.  The acquisition of new real estate on the Madison campus coincides with the purchase of a collection of ca. 60,000 lichen specimens that complement existing holdings.  In addition, WIS is involved in a number of current regional, national, and international collection digitization activities, and is the lead institution for two NSF-funded Thematic Collections Networks.  All data resulting from this project will be posted online (http://herbarium.wisc.edu/databases.htm) and shared with iDigBio (https://www.idigbio.org/), ensuring accessibility to researchers and educators. Finally, in order to highlight unparalleled natural history museum resources to senior citizens and pre-college teens, WIS will develop a two-day botany "major" during UW-Madison's summer Grandparent's University week. Additional information about WIS and its outreach activities is available at http://herbarium.wisc.edu/.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Wisconsin State Herbarium at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (WIS) is recognized today as one of the world's leading natural history museums dedicated to the preservation and study of botanical plant diversity.  What began in 1849 as a modest collection of 1,500 donated plant specimens has grown to &gt;1.35 million specimens, placing it among the top 1% by size of the world's herbaria.  Within 100 years of WIS's founding, the number of specimens had grown to the point where they could not longer be properly stored.  In 2012 a solution to WIS' space crisis finally materialized when the UW Biology Library was relocated on campus, and the Herbarium was given possession of the vacated space. Subsequent financial support from NSF finally allowed for expansion of the Herbarium, and the long-awaited unification of its world-class cryptogamic collections (i.e., fungi, mosses, liverworts, lichens).  Many of those specimens were previously stored in unsecure locations that threatened their integrity; they were also mostly unavailable to researchers.  This is no longer the case as they have been re-located, re-organized, and are now permanently stored in archival cabinets on a new high-density mobile compactor system.  Already, exciting discoveries are being made with this specimens, including recognition of species new to science, and access to them has allowed for their digitization as they are made available online.   In addition to focusing on WIS' 'cryptogamic' collections, this project allowed for the repair and upgrade of an antiquated compactor system that holds an enormous collection of vascular plants.  Dozens of students, staff curators, and visiting scientists use these specimens each week for a variety of research purposes related to taxonomy, ecology, conservation biology, etc.  Regular public outreach activities (e.g., open house tours) take place frequently.  The two-story WI State Hebarium is now functioning as a major regional center of botanical diversity with state-of-the art facilities appropriate to its significance.
