<AbstractNarration>Tissue welding, also known as electrosurgical joining of tissues, is a process used in surgery to seal blood vessels in order to control bleeding.  It uses a combination of electro-resistive heating and mechanical clamping to elevate tissue temperature and denature collagen, such that separate tissue can be reconnected.  Tissue welding is becoming more prevalent because of the increasing use of minimally invasive surgical procedures, where only a few small incisions are made to access the surgical site.  In these cases, it is difficult to use the traditional hand suturing technique to seal wounds because of limited accessibility.  There are more than 1.5 million surgical procedures done in US annually that involve the tissue welding process.  The overall market size for electrosurgical devices is more than 1 billion dollars in US in 2011 and is increasing by 5-6 percent each year.  Despite its importance, the quality of tissue welding joints is often inconsistent due to the lack of good understanding and proper quality control of the tissue welding process.  Failed joints can cause severe bleeding, prolonged operative time, and impaired surgical outcomes. This research will lead to more consistent and reliable tissue joints, thus improved healthcare safety and quality. It will also lead to the advancement of electrosurgical tools for tissue welding, and increase the competitiveness of US medical device manufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will study the dynamic behavior of tissue's thermal and electrical impedances during the tissue welding process and to correlate these behaviors to the joint strength. The tissue thermal and electrical impedances will be experimentally determined at different levels of thermal dose. The results will be used to develop a multi-physics finite element model to predict spatial and temporal temperature distribution of the joint site from the electrical energy input.  The effect of clamping force on the contact area between the electrosurgical tool and tissue will be explored. A series of tissue joints using various levels of thermal dose and mechanical clamping force will be conducted and the strength of these joints tested to establish a weld quality prediction model. The fundamental understanding obtained from this research on biological material responses to heat will find many applications in other surgical processes, such as laser and ultrasonic tumor ablation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Tissue welding, also known as bipolar electrosurgery, is a widely used medical procedure for hemostasis in many healthcare specialties, such as gynecologic, urologic, cardio-thoracic, colorectal, and neurological surgery. Due to the lack of a reliable monitoring method, problems including tissue charring, sticking, peripheral nerve damage, and post-procedure seal failure still occur, sometimes even fatal if major rebleeding happens after the surgery. The objectives of this research are to understand dynamic behaviors of the tissue welding process and to develop an on-line monitoring method for tissue welding quality assurance. An experimental system is developed for testing tissue welding under various process conditions with both muscle tissue and blood vessels. The experimental system consists of an apparatus to control the compression level before welding and a data acquisition system to collect on-line signals including welding current, tip voltage, and sound. The system also consists of a blood vessel welding setup with mimicking blood flows and a sensor to measure the burst pressure of sealed blood vessels. Fundamental studies have been conducted to understand the dynamic behavior of the tissue welding process and to discover on-line signal features that could be used to predict the weld joint strength. These studies include the effect of non-uniform compression on the joint quality, the effect of tissue welding process parameters, characterization of acoustic signals from the tissue welding process, and dynamic impedance behavior of large-diameter blood vessel welding. A finite element analysis model was also developed to understand the dynamic process behavior. It is found that the dynamic tissue impedance reveals the progression of the protein denaturing process. However, it is strongly affected by the compression level and heating power. Existing criteria for quality prediction and control using heating energy and the minimal impedance are not reliable. A novel acoustic signal monitoring method is introduced in this research to ensure the seal quality of the bipolar tissue hemostasis process. Experiments were conducted to compare the efficacy of the acoustic signal and the impedance signal methods. The size of the denatured tissue zone, false trigger rate, and underheating occurrences were examined. It is shown that the acoustic monitoring method performs significantly better than the impedance monitoring method, especially in some of the most common surgical scenarios of variability including unsteady and non-uniform compression. The acoustic monitoring method is highly sensitive and expected to play a major role in welding quality monitoring for electrosurgeries. &nbsp;</p> <p>Based on the research results, a provisional pattern has been filed on the acoustic signal monitoring method for tissue welding. The technology is an innovative and will solve the current problems in electrosurgeries. It will lead to reduction of overall healthcare cost, while improving the patient experience. With the fast-increasing global market for electrosurgical equipment, the proposed technology has a large commercial potential and could bring significant impact on how electrosurgeries are performed today. Effort is underway to commercialize the developed technology in order to benefit society at large. The research also provided interdisciplinary training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students, promoted collaboration between engineers and surgeons, and helped advance research infrastructure. The research findings have been disseminated in both the manufacturing and biomedical research community in the forms of conference presentations and archival journal publications.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2018<br>      Modified by: Wei&nbsp;Li</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1434584/1434584_10320741_1543620724632_Bipolarforceps--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1434584/1434584_10320741_1543620724632_Bipolarforceps--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Bipolar Electrosurgery"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1434584/1434584_10320741_1543620724632_Bipolarforceps--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Bipolar Electrosurgery"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Monitoring of bipolar electrosurgery, also known as tissue welding</div> <div class="imageCredit">Created by Wei Li using images from own research and public domain</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wei&nbsp;Li</div> <div class="imageTitle">Bipolar Electrosurgery</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1434584/1434584_10320741_1543620867381_Soundsignal--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1434584/1434584_10320741_1543620867381_Soundsignal--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Acoustic Signal of Tissue Welding"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1434584/1434584_10320741_1543620867381_Soundsignal--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Acoustic Signal of Tissue Welding"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Sound signal captured with a microphone can be used to monitor the tissue welding process</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xiaoran Li</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wei&nbsp;Li</div> <div class="imageTitle">Acoustic Signal of Tissue Welding</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1434584/1434584_10320741_1543621709182_BurstPressure--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1434584/1434584_10320741_1543621709182_BurstPressure--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Burst Pressure Study"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1434584/1434584_10320741_1543621709182_BurstPressure--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Burst Pressure Study"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Tissue welding of blood vessels showing burst pressure could be three times as high as the normal human systolic blood pressure.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xiaoran Li</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wei&nbsp;Li</div> <div class="imageTitle">Burst Pressure Study</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
