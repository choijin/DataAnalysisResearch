<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on how neural activity in relatively simple invertebrates encodes information about an odorant?s identity and intensity, in a manner that is robust to variations in the intensities and background contexts in which sensory stimuli can be encountered. Electrophysiological, computational and behavioral approaches are combined in this effort to determine the basic principles of olfactory information processing. The identified biological olfaction principles will also lead to development of novel signal-processing algorithms for artificial olfaction, i.e. for electronic noses used in many non-invasive chemical-sensing applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical goals of the project are to determine how response dynamics at the single neuron and population levels maintain/alter olfactory invariance and examine correlations between physiology and odor-driven behavior. An integrative approach will take advantage of the rich repertoire of genetic tools available in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) to study single neuron dynamics, and combine it with multi-unit electrophysiological approaches that are well established in locusts (Schistocerca americana) to examine neural circuit dynamics. The biological data will be used to develop experimentally constrained models of olfactory signal processing to gain mechanistic insights and facilitate development of bio-inspired algorithms for an electronic nose.  This research will reveal how dynamic patterns of neural activity allow the olfactory system to represent odorants in a background- and concentration-invariant manner. Examination of the interactions between an external stimulus and intrinsic neural dynamics is also expected to inform a better general understanding of dynamical neuronal networks. Data and analytical approaches obtained from the proposed work will be used to develop new neural engineering modules for undergraduate and graduate courses and thereby enhance the existing biomedical engineering curriculum. Furthermore, a K-12 teachers professional development workshop: ?Where biology meets engineering? will be created to provide middle- and high-school teachers with content and tools to offer their students a meaningful exposure to the interdisciplinary nature of science education.</AbstractNarration>
