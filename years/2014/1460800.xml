<AbstractNarration>The Mote Marine Laboratory will continue to host a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site located at their campus in Sarasota, FL. The program will support internships for a group of ten students every summer during a 10 week research and professional training experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mote offers a diverse array of research in ocean sciences and emphasizes the essential interconnectedness of varied disciplines towards the common goal of fostering ocean health. Students are paired with Mote researchers from 24 research programs and conduct mentored research projects on one of several major threats to coastal habitats: aquatic pollution, natural toxins, habitat alteration, animal behavior due to habitat change, coral reef decline, ocean acidification, and climate change. In addition to research skills, students gain valuable experience in scientific communication by developing and presenting research proposals for independent projects and reporting findings in poster presentations. Career guidance on grantsmanship, scientific writing, presenting poster and oral research talks, and pursuing graduate study in the Ocean Sciences is provided in student-centered discussion groups. Students are also exposed to a broader range of topics in coastal and estuarine sciences through research seminars presented by Mote staff, visiting scientists, and Mote REU Program alumni. Participants are encouraged to present research findings in peer-reviewed literature and/or at professional conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Mote Marine Laboratory&rsquo;s Research Experience for Undergraduates Program provided a unique research experience to 30 participants from the funded periods 2015-2017. The program is extremely competitive with &gt;400 applications received each year for the 10 available positions. The intellectual focus of Mote&rsquo;s REU program is on estuarine science, particularly basic and applied research on the biological and chemical features of estuaries. The integrating theme of the program is to address major threats to coastal habitats that were highlighted in reports on the state of the oceans by the Pew Oceans Commission (2003) and the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy (USCOP) (2004). In particular, students conduct independent research projects related to one or more of the following topics: aquatic pollution, natural toxins, habitat alteration and coral reef decline.</p> <p>Under mentorship of a Mote scientist, each student plans and conducts his/her own research project. The culminating event is a poster session in which students present their research findings to Mote Scientific staff, other interns, and volunteers. In addition to research projects, various activities are provided to enrich student experiences. Activities include social activities such as boating and kayaking trips. Professional development activities include seminars on how to present a scientific talk, tips on applying to grad school, and visiting State and Federal agencies conducting research in marine science to provide insight on various career paths. A research ethics component is also included. Students complete the summer with a well-rounded view of the responsibilities of a research scientist. Students provide feedback at the end of the summer on experiences they considered the most beneficial and suggestions on how to continue to improve the program to provide the best research experience for future intern cohorts.</p> <p>All of students come from outside Mote Marine Laboratory. Over the funded period (2015-2017), our participants included over 40% that were from groups underrepresented in Ocean Sciences and non-traditional students. We have a high percentage of our students who continue their education in science through pursuing graduate degrees. From interns participating during this funded period, we currently have 33% students that are either actively applying to or currently enrolled in graduate schools and or currently employed in a science field. Due to a recent emphasis on providing research experiences to students earlier in the career, many (50%) of our interns are currently still in undergraduate school. Past interns that participated during this funded period have also been productive, with 10 giving presentations at scientific conferences and six as co-authors on scientific publications. One intern from this funded period was the recipient of an NSF GRFP award (2018), and two previous interns received either an award or Honorable Mention in 2017. Many of our previous interns are actively collaborating with their Mote mentors. We are very proud of our interns!</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/09/2018<br>      Modified by: Catherine&nbsp;J&nbsp;Walsh</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1460800/1460800_10361092_1539090302436_2017GroupPHoto_small--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1460800/1460800_10361092_1539090302436_2017GroupPHoto_small--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2017 Cohort"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1460800/1460800_10361092_1539090302436_2017GroupPHoto_small--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2017 Cohort"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 2. 1 photo of 2017 Cohort participants and their research mentors at the final poster session.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mote Marine Laboratory</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Catherine&nbsp;J&nbsp;Walsh</div> <div class="imageTitle">2017 Cohort</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1460800/1460800_10361092_1539090050489_Ronquelda_Crosby--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1460800/1460800_10361092_1539090050489_Ronquelda_Crosby--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2017 Participant with MML President"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1460800/1460800_10361092_1539090050489_Ronquelda_Crosby--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2017 Participant with MML President"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Ronquelda Quillen (2017) of Norfolk State University, discussing results from her summer research project with Dr. Micheal Crosby, President and CEO of Mote Marine Laboratory</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mote Marine Laboratory</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Catherine&nbsp;J&nbsp;Walsh</div> <div class="imageTitle">2017 Participant with MML President</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1460800/1460800_10361092_1539090578192_Bean_2017_rot--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1460800/1460800_10361092_1539090578192_Bean_2017_rot--rgov-800width.jpg" title="NInaBean"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1460800/1460800_10361092_1539090578192_Bean_2017_rot--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="NInaBean"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 3.
