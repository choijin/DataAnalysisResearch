<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jessica Hoover of West Virginia University is developing new catalytic reactions for the formation of carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds from carboxylic acids through oxidative decarboxylative coupling reactions. This new method uses a copper catalyst to transform simple carboxylic acids and arenes into heterobiaryls and haloalkyl arenes that are relevant to pharmaceutical and biological molecules. This technology offers improvements over classical coupling methods, including the replacement of expensive, toxic, and wasteful organometallic reagents with inexpensive and readily available carboxylic acid starting materials while generating minimal waste. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The formation of C-C bonds are key steps in the construction of complex structures and the successful development of this methodology will enable the design of new, more efficient catalysts for the formation of C-C bonds by the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. Professor Hoover is actively engaged in the integration of research and education at the undergraduate level partly by involving undergraduates in the research laboratory and partly by incorporating research experiments and concepts into the undergraduate curriculum. This award also supports the development of a new summer program designed to bring together chemists, engineers, and artists to work toward the common goal of building a public science-art installation. The program is designed to initiate a meaningful dialog of science within the local Morgantown community, to help student participants communicate effectively between science, the humanities, and art, and with the broader public sphere.</AbstractNarration>

The central goal of this program was to develop decarboxylative coupling reactions that use stable and abundant benzoic acids as coupling partners for new C-C bond forming reactions. Our work in this area uncovered several new decarboxylative arylation reactions to form C-C bond and decarboxylative thiolation reactions to form new C-S bonds. We reported the first examples of Cu-catalyzed reactions of these types and also disclosed a decarboxylative arylation that is capable of the coupling of a wide scope of heteroaromatic carboxylate coupling partners. While these reactions provide a new route to access functionalized arenes of biological importance, the most important findings from this work are related to the limitations of these reactions. For example, these reactions are often limited to the coupling of specific benzoic acids, such as 2-nitrobenzoic acid. We performed detailed kinetic studies to address the origin of this limitation and identified the field effect (<em>F</em>), a though-space electronic effect, to be responsible for the limited substrate scope.

We identified a copper-catalyzed decarboxylative thiolation reaction that proceeds efficiently while using O<sub>2</sub> as the sole oxidant.
