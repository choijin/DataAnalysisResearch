<AbstractNarration>The configuration of points on a surface at which computations are carried out affects how well one can approximate functions of the surface or the shape of the surface itself. Configurations that optimize some notion of energy associated with the arrangement of points can lead to better approximations. This research project explores efficient implementation of such optimal configurations, to provide improved tools for data sampling methods and for simulating complex geophysical processes such as climate changes and heat diffusion in Earth's mantle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optimization problems for energy are of significance in discretizing various surfaces and volumes. For example, point configurations generated by a suitably weighted Riesz energy can approximate a prescribed density on the object.  The investigative team is (i) implementing numerically the theory developed by the principal investigators by exploring efficient algorithms for the computation of near optimal energy configurations on manifolds, and (ii) developing the asymptotic theory of periodic versions of optimal energy problems and especially their connection to lattice (crystalline) structures.  Undergraduate and graduate students as well as post-doctoral fellows play an active role in the research program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We investgated methods for generating point configurations on a surface (such as a sphere) or on a d-dimensional body (such as a ball)  that have desirable properties from the perspective of  data sampling and geometric design. In particular for this purpose we utilized energy minimization  techniques, linear programming methods as well as random configurations. These investigations involved graduate students and  post-doctoral fellows who were supervised by the principal investigators.  The main outcomes of this project include:  a)  That independent identically distributed random points on the sphere have poor separations properties but, surprisingly, have rather good covering properties that are best possible except for a logarithmic factor.  b)  That linear programming methods that have been exploited for the purpose of generating maximal codes on a sphere can be adapted to obtain universal lower bounds for the minimal energy of point configurations on the sphere, where 'universal' refers to the fact that these bounds hold for a large class of potentials.  c) That given a desired density of points on a surface, such  points can be generated by means of minimizing the energy of pairwise potentials by introducing an appropriate external field especially in the case of non-integrable kernels.  d) That minimum energy methods combined with stratified quasi Monte Carlo methods can be effective tools for generating point configurations useful for numerically solving partial differential equations related to the study of the earth's atmosphere and gravitation.  e) That the shapes of disjoint regions in the plane can be approximated from finitely many area moments via  the use of orthogonal polynomials and their related Christoffel functions.
