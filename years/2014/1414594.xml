<AbstractNarration>Learning a second language is crucial to interacting in today's global world. Much of the difficulty in acquiring a second language is in learning its sound system. Failure to learn the sound system can lead to incorrect word representations, word representations being made up of smaller sound units: for example, the sounds d, ah, g make the word dog. Understanding what can make words containing foreign sounds easier to learn is important for developing better methods of teaching a second language. Many studies suggest that hearing words produced by multiple talkers helps infants and young children to develop more robust word representations. Multiple talkers may also help second language learners, who are likewise inexperienced with the language's sound system. However, second language learners may not benefit from multiple talkers in all circumstances. In collaboration with Dr. Jane Tsay at National Chung Chen University in Taiwan, this project will explore the circumstances in which multiple talkers are beneficial for second language learners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from a behavioral experiment at the Psycholinguistic Lab at Chung Cheng National University will shed light on the question of why multiple talkers are helpful for forming a robust word representation. It will also speak to the long-standing question: to what extent is perceiving speech related to producing speech? Based on the PI's previous studies, it is hypothesized that when perceiving new words, experienced learners will not benefit from multiple talkers, while inexperienced learners will. In contrast, it is hypothesized that even experienced learners will continue to benefit from multiple talkers when producing new words, although they will cease to benefit when perceiving new words. Such a result would suggest that speakers use different word representations for perceiving vs. producing words. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Science Council of Taiwan.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Learning to speak a second language is extremeley difficult, but also increasingly necessary in today's global world.  One the most challenging parts of learning a second language is learning the speech sounds that do not exist in one's native language.    Past studies have shown that learning from multiple talkers, rather than from a single talker, is beneficial for learning speech sounds in a second language, and especially for recognizing the second language speech sounds as spoken by different speakers.  The reasoning for this is as follows.  Speakers of a language vary in their exact pronunciation, yet native speakers of that language have no trouble understanding different speakers.  This may seem obvious, but it is not trivial.  Babies have to learn to tell apart speakers, and to recognize a word as pronounced by different speakers.  If you learn a speech sound, for example ba, from just one speaker, you will not know the range of allowable variation in how that speech sound is pronounced.  If you learn ba from multiple speakers, you have a better sense of the amount of variation allowed.  You can both better recognize ba from a new speaker as being the same sound as pronounced by another speaker, and better differentiate ba from similar speech sounds like da.  Additionally, you can use this knowledge of allowable pronunciation variation to recognize the words bad and dad across different pronunciations, and also differentiate these words from each other.    Speech sounds do not exist in isolation, however; they are part of words.  When learning new, similar-sounding words, a speaker who is already proficient in the sounds of her language is not predicted to benefit from learning from multiple talkers.  She already knows how much variation is allowed in pronunciation, as in the above example.  However, a less proficient speaker is predicted to benefit from learning from multiple talkers when learning new, similar-sounding words.    An experiment was conducted in Taiwan with second language English speakers.  They learned four pairs of similar-sounding, imaginary English words, for example lossip and rossip, eight words in total.  Each participant in the experiment learned the words either from a single, pre-recorded talker, or from ten different pre-recorded talkers.  These participants had a range of proficiency in English.   Participants were then tested on their knowledge of the words in two ways.  First they had a perceptual test: participants heard a word they had learned and had to choose between two pictures which picture corresponded to the word.  Secondly, they had a production test: they saw a picture and heard the corresponding word, had to repeat the word, and were scored on their pronunciation accuracy.    As predicted, the participants who were less proficient in English benefited from learning the words from multiple talkers, in both the perception test and the production test.  In contrast, the participants who were more proficient in English learned the words equally well whether they learned from multiple talkers or from a single talker, again in both the perception test and the production test.    These results have implications for linguistic theory.  One current debate in linguistics concerns how speech sounds are represented in the mind.  On one side, it is argued that words are represented whole.  On the other side, it is argued that words are stored as smaller units of sound - for example, the word bad is stored as the sequence of speech sounds b, a, d.  My results support the second view.  More proficient speakers do not benefit from multiple talkers, because they must already be familiar with smaller units of speech sound, and can use that knowledge even in words they've never heard before.    The results also have implications for how second languages are currently taught.  Most language classes are taught by a single teacher, such that students have little exposure to other speakers.
