<AbstractNarration>The proposed I/UCRC for Robots and Sensors for the Human Well-being (RoSeHuB) will focus on complementing a broad variety of off-the-self sensors with intelligent processing software that enables them to extract useful information about the operating environments in medicine and agriculture. RoSeHuB research will make heavy use of commercial cameras that can work in different parts of the electro-magnetic spectrum (i.e., visible, IR, Thermal, etc.), laser or radar sensors, etc. Sensors or sensor systems may exhibit different degrees of mobility. They may be embedded in robots or flying drones or they may be fixed with limited degrees of motion (PTZ cameras). In the areas of algorithms and learning methods the focus and the challenge is on creating methodologies that can balance real-time operation and computational power while providing high level semantic information either for planning, interaction or situational awareness for human operators. With respect to robots, efforts will focus on building systems with advanced mobility, manipulation, human-machine interaction, and coordination skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robots and sensors can lead to more effective precision agriculture techniques that provide more food than current levels while they save water and prevent soil erosion. Similarly, robots play a critical and growing role in modern medicine, from training the next generation of doctors, dentists, and nurses, to comforting and protecting elderly patients in the early stages of dementia. The proposed Center will attract large companies to the pertinent domains and energize innovative startup companies, both through research and through the production of highly trained graduate students with advanced coursework in sensory-based robotic systems and hands-on exposure to multi-disciplinary, integrative systems. The Center will also fund a projects to pursue new pertinent high-risk initiatives, ensuring that technology continues to meet emerging societal needs. RoSeHuB faculty will aggressively recruit women and minority graduate and undergraduate students and host an annual summer camp for middle-schoolers from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit:     The UNC Charlotte site of ROSE-HUB was engaged in applied robotics and sensing research for a wide range of applications funded by related industry members, including energy, healthcare, material handling, and manufacturing, to increase human safety and well-being. The site research resulted in numerous publications in major conferences and journals in robotics and related application fields, including joint publications with related industry collaborators, such as papers in the international conference on applied robotics for the power industry.

The aim was to augment human capability, reduce visual stress, and improve efficiency. Another notable project was to use continuum robot to conduct automatic inspection in nuclear environment in order to keep people out of harm’s way. The research was a major part of Jinglin Li’s PhD dissertation Continuum Robot Manipulation, which received the 2016 UNC Charlotte Graduate Dean’s Distinguished Dissertation Award.     UNC Charlotte researchers also collaborated with researchers at the other sites of the multi-university ROSE-HUB.
