<AbstractNarration>The purposes of this study are to promote and understand how undergraduate students learn foundational biology ideas in introductory biology courses. It will implement and study an innovative approach, which has students learn biological explanations by modeling phenomena as biologists do. The approach directs students to think about structures, behaviors and functions in nature, and to write these out and discuss them. This study will explore in detail student reasoning while they do this and how they learn. The project has potential not only to advance the field's ability to measure student competencies that are valued in recent science education standards documents (e.g., NGSS), but also to advance the field's understanding of how student "modeling ability" develops in a particular discipline. In this way, it can provide an important foundation for other research on the learning of modeling practices in science. Moreover, because the innovations take place in an introduction to biology course and introduction to biology is required for a large number of college majors, the project can be transformative for a large number of students across the country. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will be conducted in a pre-designed undergraduate biology course across four universities, two public and two private, serving diverse populations. The aims are: (1) propose systems thinking skills needed by biology students, by (a) getting feedback from academics, and reviewing; (2) to examine more closely student thinking during their activities by (a) recording group discussions, (b) conducting clinical interviews with a subset of students, and (c) collecting student drawings in response to different prompts than they have used previously that help the instructors better understand what students are thinking; (3) conduct open-ended comparisons between other assessments and their assessments of student models; (4) compare outcomes when students are provided different visual representations as feedback (split-plot design); and (5) make comparisons between different demographic groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Modeling is a foundational practice in STEM and a core competency in most science education frameworks. Our previous research focused on analyzing constructed models as representations of students' thinking about biological systems.  In this work, we sought to unpack the behaviors, mechanisms, and cognitive practices that underlie students' abilities to use, construct, and reason with those models.  In particular, we were interested in the potential of Systems Thinking to serve as a unifying framework to cohere the suite of skills and competencies necessary for model-based learning.   Outcome 1: Findings related to Systems Thinking (ST). Constructs such as ST are represented in vast bodies of literature that cross multiple disciplines. This makes traditional approaches to literature reviews impractical as ways to explore and extract meaning from primary sources. We adapted bibliographic and data science methods to describe co-citation networks as an approach for identifying key literature and peer-recognized ideas with the greatest potential to inform understanding.  In applying this approach to the ST literature we were able to identify communities thinking about ST, analyze and summarize the specific contributions of these communities, inform development of a tentative ST framework for undergraduate biology education, and reveal patterns in cross-discipline communication in ST literature.

Outcome 2: Findings about model-based learning. To determine how students consruct models in group settings, we collected videos of classroom modeling activities.

This suggests that students are not memorizing the words to use on the arrows in their models, but rather are developing a conceptual understanding of the mechanisms that relate structures to one another.  Outcome 5: Findings about the impact of learner characteristics on model building. Prior work has suggested that students from low- and middle-achieving tritiles experience the largest gains in their modeling (Dauer et al. 2013), however, we did not know if there were student learning characteristics that contributed to these gains. By exploring student constructed models and their learner characteristics of grit, motivation, academic control and need for cognition, we found no relationship between model correctness or complexity.  This trend held for two scales of biological organization - the central dogma and carbon cycling.     Broader Impacts:  Contemporary society faces numerous challenges, many of which are complex and nonlinear. Society needs tools and skills to make sense of this complexity. Models and systems thinking help fill that need, developing citizens with the skills to make decisions about complex topics such as climate change, genetically engineered organisms, vaccines, and beyond.  The integration of modeling into our entire introductory curriculum as well as upper-level courses helps build these ways of thinking in our students. At Bethel, this project has resulted in the direct mentoring of 5 undergraduate students who obtained research experience and professional development that contributed to their pursuit of a broad diversity of STEM career pathways.
