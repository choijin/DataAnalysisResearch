<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Toledo's Lake Erie Center, located in Toledo, OH, will support the training of 10 students per year for 9 weeks during the summers of 2015- 2017. This REU builds science research skills through multi-disciplinary independent projects addressing key environmental challenges of land-water ecosystems (including harmful algal blooms, invasive species, and climate change) partnering academia, agencies, public sectors, and industry. This Lake Erie Center REU experience gives fellows an opportunity to work in the areas of environmental biology, geospatial technologies, and civil engineering, all linked via a Land-Lake Sensor Network. Tiered mentoring teams partner each fellow with a professor, a Ph.D. graduate student, and an agency scientist, networked within an Environmental Science Learning Community. All will receive ethics/responsible conduct of research training. Fellows gain formative skills to: (1) ask scientific questions and develop testable hypotheses, (2) master science terminology, tools, and techniques, (3) design and conduct original experiments, (4) build working partnerships, (5) analyze and synthesize data, and (6) present, publish, and communicate research. Online application information is available at the program website listed below. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 30 students who are underrepresented minorities, first generation college students, women, veterans, or from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained for the science and engineering careers of tomorrow. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences, and a website, publications, and workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://www.utoledo.edu/nsm/lec/REU.html, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Stepien at carol.stepien@utoledo.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Czajkowski at kevin.czajkowski@utoledo.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Each summer including 2015, 2016 and 2017, ten students from around the United States participated in the University of Toledo's Lake Erie Center Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program. We received a total of 722 applications from 298 universities. Over half the applicants were women, 162 applicants were from minority groups, 8 were military veterans, and 132 were first-generation college students. From this pool we recruited 32 highly talented and diverse REU students consisting of: 9 African-American, 6 Hispanic, 1 Native American, and 1 Caribbean Island students; 22 women, 3 veterans, and 14 first-generation college students. These 32 students were made up of 17 college seniors, 9 juniors, and 6 sophomores. Our REU mentoring team was made up of 16 different faculty mentors over the 3-year program, including 5 women and 21 graduate student mentors.</p> <p>The goal of the program was to engage the REU students in research at the university level to give them a taste of what furthering their education might be like. The REU students contributed to research projects in many departments at the University of Toledo including Environmental Sciences, Geography and Planning, Civil Engineering and Population Health. Most students conducted research related to the harmful algal blooms (HABs) that now form each summer on Lake Erie. Students looked at the causes of the HABs as well as the impact on animals and humans. Students also worked on projects related to invasive species and their potential introduction through anglers, the impact of shore substrate on fish distribution, and the use of remote sensing, drones and geographic mapping to study HABs and habitat. Throughout the program, REU students were mentored by a graduate student and faculty member usually as part of a larger research group. Once a week, all of the REU students met with faculty and graduate students to share their research as well as explore various topics such as writing a scientific paper and pursuing a career. After Year 1, in response to feedback from REU student and mentor surveys, we revised our program to focus less on agency partnerships in our weekly training sessions, and instead we utilized our graduate students and faculty mentors to lead these sessions focusing specifically on practical research skills and the graduate school application progress. In addition, in Years 2 and 3 we more clearly outlined expectations for the REU students from the outset of the program by providing weekly deadlines. This timeline was very well received and useful in keeping fellows on task throughout the summer, while still allowing an appropriate amount of freedom in their research.</p> <p>Thus far, 14 former REU students have given or co-presented 29 presentations of their REU research at national or international conferences; one of these students, Devon Eddins, was one of 115 students competitively selected from all NSF-supported REU programs to present his research at the Council on Undergraduate Research's REU symposium at NSF. Our REU alumni are also co-authors on 6 papers and one book chapter published or submitted to peer-reviewed publications in the scientific literature. In keeping with our goal of training the next generation of scientists to tackle the complex challenges facing the intersection of the land-lake interface, 10 of our REU alumni are now enrolled in graduate programs. In fact, one REU student from 2015, Jessica Garcia, is now a graduate student at UT and became a graduate student mentor to an REU student in our program in 2017.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/30/2019<br>      Modified by: Kevin&nbsp;P&nbsp;Czajkowski</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461124/1461124_10355825_1564446810135_2015-06-0114.23.36--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461124/1461124_10355825_1564446810135_2015-06-0114.23.36--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Dr. Daryl Dwyer on a field trip with students (2015)"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461124/1461124_10355825_1564446810135_2015-06-0114.23.36--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Dr. Daryl Dwyer on a field trip with students (2015)"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dr. Daryl Dwyer is explaining how nutrients from agricultural fields and leaking septic systems flows down Berger Ditch into Lake Erie helping to produce harmful algal blooms.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kevin Czajkowski</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kevin&nbsp;P&nbsp;Czajkowski</div> <div class="imageTitle">Dr. Daryl Dwyer on a field trip with students (2015)</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461124/1461124_10355825_1564447201108_Image-9717047-252369459-2-WebLarge_0_cedc1a75dbcd76e7748c9bfd4ec28e5a_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461124/1461124_10355825_1564447201108_Image-9717047-252369459-2-WebLarge_0_cedc1a75dbcd76e7748c9bfd4ec28e5a_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU student India Harris presenting her research to Ohio Chancellor of the Department of Higher Education John Carey"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461124/1461124_10355825_1564447201108_Image-9717047-252369459-2-WebLarge_0_cedc1a75dbcd76e7748c9bfd4ec28e5a_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU student India Harris presenting her research to Ohio Chancellor of the Department of Higher Education John Carey"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">2015 student India Harris from Central State University in Ohio presented her REU research work when the Chancellor of the Ohio Department of Higher Education visited Central State University.
