<AbstractNarration>In the last decades, astrophysicists and astronomers have studied the Universe for clues about what causes some of the most energetic transient events.  It has long been thought that truly extreme objects such as black holes and neutron stars are responsible.  Advanced instruments spanning the electromagnetic spectrum have provided a wealth of information regarding the transient Universe; however, many observations are unable to directly probe the dynamics of the systems in question.  General relativity provides a way to map out the dynamics of massive, dense objects from a distance by encoding the motion as ripples in space-time known as gravitational waves.  The principal investigator of this project will lead an effort within the LIGO Scientific Collaboration to detect transient gravitational waves from the merger of black holes and neutron stars in real-time, enabling prompt multi-wavelength follow-up observations that can shed new light onto the origin of transients. Discoveries will be relayed to a network of follow-up observatories so that scientists can learn as much as possible about these events before they fade away.  This research will increase understanding of the fundamental nature of space, time and the properties of exotic states of matter and energy that are not accessible to Earth-based laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LIGO Collaboration has built highly sensitive laser interferometric gravitational wave receivers in Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA that will measure to extra-galactic distances the minute oscillations of space-time caused by, for example, the merger of two neutron stars.  Data from these observatories will be streamed in real-time to supercomputing facilities across the U.S where thousands of computing nodes will integrate millions of unique physical models of black hole and neutron star systems, known as templates, with the data in real time.  Advanced signal processing techniques and software co-developed by the PI will infer the presence of a signal from any of the models within seconds of the signal arriving at Earth.  Requiring signals to be observed simultaneously in multiple geographically separated gravitational wave detectors will allow the position of the source to be localized as well as provide confidence that the signal is not of terrestrial origin.  The best-fit parameters and estimate of the event significance will be ingested into the gravitational-wave candidate event database where alerts to external partners will be issued as well as real-time correlation with external triggers such as gamma-ray bursts through the Gamma-ray Coordinates Network (GCN).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The National Science Foundation award "CAREER: Enabling Multimessenger Astrophysics with Real-Time Gravitational Wave Detection" set out to do something that had never been done before: to detect ripples in space caused by colliding black holes and neutron stars, and to use these gravitational waves as a tool for astronomical discovery.  This goal was accomplished through collaboration among the NSF-funded LIGO observatories and a world-wide network of scientists.  Personnel supported by this award are members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration who analyzed data and contributed directly to dozens of gravitational wave discoveries including the first source of gravitational waves also detected in light. Gravitational waves are ripples in space that manifest themselves as a minute change in the distance between two points.  As a gravitational wave passes through Earth, it squeezes and stretches space causing the distance between objects to change by one part in 1021.  This extremely small effect is equivalent to stretching and squeezing the Earth itself by an amount far less than the width of an atom. Detecting gravitational waves requires both extremely sensitive instruments and extremely sophisticated data analysis techniques. LIGO were the first instruments to directly detect gravitational waves.  LIGO consists of two 4-km-long, L-shaped laser interferometers able to measure distance very accurately by using light. As a gravitational wave passes, the length of each of LIGO's arms changes slightly.  This information is encoded in what is known as gravitational wave strain data. Gravitational wave strain data is overwhelmed by noise due to many sources including seismic motion and even bad weather. After LIGO records a gravitational wave, a substantial data analysis and modeling effort must be conducted to extract the signal out of the noise.   Gravitational waves are most abundant from the merger of two neutron stars and black holes. Both neutron stars and black holes are formed after the death and collapse of stars.  Black holes and neutron stars pack the equivalent of the mass of our Sun into a diameter smaller than most American metropolitan areas.  These extremely dense objects are required to produce gravitational waves of sufficient strength to be detected.  In fact, the most detectable gravitational waves require two neutron stars or black holes in orbit around one another. As they orbit, they lose energy due to gravitational wave emission.  This causes them to spiral and eventually crash together in a process that can be exactly modeled using Einstein's theory of gravity known as General Relativity. The fact that gravitational waves can be modeled is a key component to how we analyze the gravitational wave strain data using a technique called matched filtering.  Put simply, matched filtering checks for specific signal shapes in the strain data and is among the most powerful ways to extract weak gravitational wave signals from noise.  The personnel on this project developed novel time-domain matched-filtering techniques and a full analysis software-suite called GstLAL based on the amalgamation of the open source audio processing library Gstreamer and the LSC Algorithm Library (LAL).  Our methods were developed in order to make real-time gravitational wave detection. The goal of real-time gravitational wave detection is to infer the presence of a gravitational wave signal immediately after it passes through the Earth.  It was expected that when two neutron stars merge, the extremely dense matter smashing together produces full-spectrum electromagnetic emission. By measuring light and gravitational waves together, we get a more complete picture about the physics governing these extreme objects.  Not unlike how sound revolutionized cinema, the merging of gravitational and electromagnetic measurements from single astronomical sources is revolutionizing our ability to study the Universe. We call this endeavor multimessenger astrophysics.  Enabling multimessenger astrophysics was the primary goal of this NSF award and we were successful on August 17, 2017 when personnel on this award first discovered GW170817 in the real-time LIGO data stream.  GW170817, a merger of two neutron stars, was observed in gravitational waves, gamma rays, x-rays, UV, infra-red and radio.  It is among the most studied astronomical events of our lifetimes.  It has confirmed the hypothesis that short-hard gamma ray bursts are caused by neutron star mergers, has given a plausible explanation for the production of gold and platinum in our universe, and has even helped to provide an independent measurement of how our universe is expanding.    The team funded by this award made comparably direct contributions to dozens of other gravitational wave events, but we also had a direct impact on our community by sharing this new field with high school students in central pennsylvania. We hosted a gravitational wave summer camp where high-school students learned about gravitational wave astronomy and data analysis methods.  They assembled a small-scale super computer and learned how to search for gravitational waves just like the team supported by this award.
