<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1406209,  Principal Investigator: Benson Farb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator proposes a program of research, education and outreach that is meant to have a maximal impact at all levels. The general research project of the principal investigator involves the topological structure of so-called "locally symmetric spaces." These spaces appear throughout mathematics and physics, and encode deep, complicated and applicable information.  The principal investigator and his collaborators have found a new pattern that occurs in these spaces, and they have built a conjectural picture of other patterns that should exist.  The principal will continue to engage with students at all levels, from PhD to undergraduate to K-12. This outreach includes in particular the training of a number of students from under-represented groups.  It also includes public outreach, communicating of the power of mathematics and science, and how it impacts our daily lives, via public lectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more technical terms, the principal investgiator proposes work with A. Putman and T.  Church to expose new phenomena and introduce new methods to the study of the cohomology of arithmetic groups.  These methods are meant to show, in particular, that the top-dimensional cohomology of certain arithmetic groups over rings of integers in a number field vanishes rationally when the number field has class number one, and otherwise has exponentially growing (in dimension) cohomology, with growth rate depending explicitly on class number. This work is part of a broader conjectural picture of low-codimension cohomology of arithmetic groups, made by the PI with Church and Putman.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant helped in crucial ways to develop the new mathematical area called "representation stability".  This area provides new tools and a new way of understanding complicated mathematical objects that have increasing symmetry. Such objects are ubiquitous in mathematics, from topology to algebraic geometry to combinatorics to number theory.  The methods developed in representation stability have  been used both to solve problems in these areas and to discover new phenomena.  This could all be achieved by applying ideas from representation theory, often extended to representations of various categories adopted to a given situation, to give strong constraints on natural classes of representations, for example on the cohomology of configuration spaces of points.  Such spaces arise in the real world for example as the space of configurations of satellites orbiting the Earth; the configuration of robots on a factory floor; or the configuration of atoms making up a gas in an enclosed container.     This grant was used, among other things, to help fund a summer school to help train 60 PhD students and postdocs;  and to help fund a research conference allowing international collaborations and a venue for the many young people in the field to explain their work.  The grant also contributed to the training of more than 20 PhD students and postdocs at the University of Chicago, not to mention the many undergraduates who interacted closely with the PI's research group.  More than 20 research papers were produced by the group supported under this grant.          Last Modified: 08/11/2019       Submitted by: Benson Farb]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
