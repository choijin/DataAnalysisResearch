<AbstractNarration>American national interests and our economic competitiveness are served best when the free flow of information, ideas, goods, and services are permitted between nations. The success or failure of political and legal reform in new democracies depends on how well such developments calibrate with the local understandings about what constitute rights and obligations. This project, which trains a graduate student in conducting rigorous, empirically grounded scientific fieldwork, asks how such rights and obligations are being negotiated in a newly democratizing context. The results will be useful to policy and development practitioners who analyze the preconditions that are necessary for democratization and political stability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elliott Prasse-Freeman, under the supervision of Dr. Erik Harms of Yale University, explores how rights are invoked and technologies of rule are engaged in a context of democratization.  The research takes place in Burma (Myanmar), which appears to be transitioning to a democratic system after a half-century of military rule. The researcher's unique access to this site gives us an opportunity to explore how rights discourse and democratic transition happens in real time. As former military leaders of Burma have formed a tense pact with opposition politicians to forge reforms, rights have been subject to debate. Reformers and international partners endorse the political liberal idea of rights as reflecting absolute standards that individuals have by the mere fact of being members of a polity or which are fundamentally afforded to humanity; some Burmese, on the other hand, appear to find a concept of rights (in which rights are thought to exist outside of a specific context) as not reflecting their realities. They instead look at rights as synonymous with 'opportunities' (the words are interchangeable in Burmese language). Attaining a right is subject to social position, negotiation skill, resources, and to some extent, randomness. The project hypothesizes that in Burma 'rights' often have meaning only to the extent that actors have the opportunities to realize them. In this perspective, rather than delivering formal rights through reformed laws and policies, Burmese may demand structural transformations of the existing distribution of power and resources in their society. The project would advances scientific debates in anthropology about the state and politics, discussions of political organizations and power that earlier anthropologists had situated in Burma and Southeast Asia, and rights and law. The project connects historic anthropological debates about nonwestern political systems with contemporary discussions of governmentality. The research will use a number of methods, including: documentation and analysis of social movements and legal strategies; semi-structured interviews (of lawyers and movement members); analysis of social movement tactics; and, most importantly, ethnographic participant observation with movement members and lawyers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project studied the contours of political action and daily life in Burma?s quasi-authoritarian context, looking particularly at the strategies deployed by average Burmese citizens to manage their precarious existences. Put differently, it asked: how do people without ?rights? nonetheless conjure the resources to contest oppression? How and why do these contestations sometimes achieve their objectives?  The researcher studied this set of questions by conducting participant observation with a group of highly mobile social activists. Although based in the commercial center of Yangon, this group did extensive organizing work in Burma?s rural communities (principally defending land grab victims). In Yangon, the group worked with laborers in the city?s industrial zones (by organizing unions), as well as with under-employed at-risk youth in Yangon?s peri-urban communities (by running a drop-in center with educational facilities). The researcher was hence able to study the following groups and aspects of social action: (1) the activists themselves; (2) the lives of farmers, workers, and underemployed youth; (3) the interactions between these parties as they developed their collective approaches to challenges; and (4) the conflicts that emerged as activists and those who they defended faced off against state agents (police, judges, prison guards, ?special branch? military police) or elites who conducted the land grabs or ran the factories. By living in Yangon the researcher also observed the quotidian challenges of navigating daily life faced by those who did not characterize themselves as victims of explicit injustice: from the annoyances of power cuts, flooded roads, crumbling infrastructure to the sporadically deadly consequences (including a number of electrocutions) of that reality, people?s dispositions toward institutions of power and what they could demand and expect from those institutions emerged.  A central finding from this ethnographic work regards the way subaltern Burmese understand ?rights.? A close analysis of linguistic uses of the Burmese words most akin to ?rights? shows that everyday Burmese conceptualize rights in ways that depart from the way rights are commonly theorized in social science scholarship. Essentially, the distinctions are as follows: (1) unlike in the Western liberal tradition in which rights are imagined as inalienable, rights in Burma are seen as alienable possessions (they can be lost, and once lost never reinstituted); (2) unlike in the liberal tradition in which social and political rights are imagined as akin to public goods (non-rival and non-excludable: meaning that an additional rights holder doesn?t affect others' rights), in Burma, as one informant put it, "your getting rights means I may not get them"; (3) unlike in the liberal tradition in which rights are transcendent of particular contingent socio-political contexts, for marginalized Burmese ?rights? are closer to opportunities &ndash; realizable only if the situation is right. Hence, if, for example, the activists studied appealed to law, it was not because they saw law as having autonomous power, but only because the appeal to law itself might intimidate, cajole, or persuade, etc the object of the appeal into some sort of submission or compromise. If the appeal did not work, the activists would immediately switch to a different tactic. If they were successful in their maneuver, an opportunity (to get land back, to get a wage increase in the factory, to get a youth a government identification card previously denied) would be realized &ndash; to label such achievements the securing of ?rights?, however, misdescribes the precarious situation produced even in victory.  The results of this research will be useful beyond the understanding it offers of Burmese politics because it promotes a better understanding of political concepts that emerge from the liberal tradition. Looked at through the Burmese experience, it often seems that in the USA, for instance, social activists and general citizens alike presuppose the existence of rights that do not in fact exist in practice: while to declare something as a ?right?

And so, if those rights are not forthcoming after being presumed or demanded, activists and citizens alike seem left with few alternative avenues for redress: they continue to insist that privileges and entitlements inhere even in the midst of the non-realization of those privileges and entitlements. Burmese subalterns, on the other hand, are particular attuned to the processes of politics, in which actions create responses, and those responses may change the very conditions of possibility for social conditions going forward.  Sometimes this is demobilizing, as Burmese read the current situation (produced as a result of responses to previous actions) and determine there is no opportunity to act; but in other cases a processural understanding of politics acts as a resource, directing Burmese to always focus on how to create the opportunity to improve the situation.
