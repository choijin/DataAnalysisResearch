<AbstractNarration>A central goal of biology is to explain the processes that generate patterns of species diversity across the tree of life. One mechanism that may facilitate ecological diversification is that of "key innovations", traits that permit access to previously untapped resources. This project will investigate one particular morphological innovation in ?trap-jaw? ants in the genera Anochetus and Odontomachus: power-amplified mandibles used for prey capture, nest defense, and individual escape from predators. The project will investigate how mandible anatomy and performance has influenced the diversification of these ants, and how key innovations affect patterns of species diversity. Specifically, the project will: 1) generate a species-level molecular phylogeny for trap-jaw ants in the genera Anochetus and Odontomachus, 2) use phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate the relationship between jaw morphology and performance and 3) use finite element modeling to examine the functional consequences of morphological variation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide new insights into the evolution of multifunctional animal movements, integrating data from phylogenetics, morphology and engineering. In addition to graduate student training, the proposed research will also directly train undergraduates in multiple aspects of integrated organismal biology, including techniques such as high-speed videography, motion analysis, animal husbandry and behavior, and molecular sequencing.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goals of the project were to investigate how morphology and mandible performance has influenced the diversification of trap-jaw ants. These ants are capable to generating extreme speeds and forces with their mandibles and are a model for the study of bio-inspiration. Our research generated new insights into the evolution of multifunctional animal movements, integrating data from phylogenetics, morphology and engineering. We found strong biogeographic patterns among clades of trap-jaws ants. We also found a clear relationship between size, morphology and performance allow us to parameterize future models on how morphology drives diversity in insects. Our results will also guide efforts to generate small machines of generating extreme speeds without damaging themselves.
