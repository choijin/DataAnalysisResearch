<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on several problems connected with the long-term dynamics of solutions of partial differential evolution equations. Equations of this type are central to the modeling and simulation of a wide range of phenomena, including water waves, propagation of light, behavior of plasmas, and gravitation. The investigators are senior researchers with experience in different aspects of the study of partial differential equations; their complementary expertise will be brought to bear on four main research directions in the study of solutions of dispersive and hyperbolic equations. The four aspects of nonlinear partial differential equations are all manifestations of the general goal of understanding the long time dynamics of solutions to important nonlinear dispersive and hyperbolic equations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a collective effort of a group of five senior researchers from four institutions with research experience in various areas of partial differential equations. The investigators have been interested in both dispersive and hyperbolic partial differential equations and will collaborate to approach the problems under study from several different directions. The project centers on four main research directions in the study of solutions of dispersive and hyperbolic equations: (1) the analysis of critical semilinear evolutions, with special emphasis on the "soliton resolution conjecture" for extended type II solutions, (2) construction of global solutions of certain quasilinear dispersive models, such as water wave models, plasma models, and crystal optics, (3) stability problems in General Relativity, motivated by the outstanding Kerr nonlinear stability conjecture, and (4) long-term dynamics of solutions corresponding to randomized data. These four aspects of nonlinear partial differential equations are all manifestations of the general goal of understanding the long time dynamics of solutions. While specific major problems are identified for the project, this is a very active field, and it is anticipated that this project will identify and study other important problems during the course of the investigation. The project will also enhance links and collaborations among researchers at leading mathematical centers in the U.S., promoting training through active research involvement of students and postdoctoral researchers. Research resulting from this project will be disseminated widely in advanced graduate courses, survey articles, and monographs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project carried out research at the overlap of analysis, nonlinear partial differential equations, geometry and probability. Its aim was to advance our understanding of new directions at the forefront of  nonlinear partial differential equations and their applications. Of special interest were certain fluid models, and dispersive and hyperbolic nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) which model a wide range of wave propagation phenomena in physical systems ranging from the microscopic interactions of bosons, the propagation of light, the behavior of plasmas, waves breaking on an ocean, to the collision of stars and the formation of black holes at a cosmic scale.   The complexity of such phenomena leads to models which, in order to be mathematically tractable, can only describe the most essential physical aspects of the system. Fundamental features of these models, such as existence and uniqueness of solutions as well as the precise description of their long-time dynamics and the equilibrium behavior of integrable systems are important aspects of a satisfactory theory and remain open problems in many important cases.       This grant was part of a collaborative effort by senior researchers with experience in different aspects of the study of partial differential equations; their complementary expertise was brought to bear on several main research directions in the study of solutions of dispersive and hyperbolic equations. These directions were all manifestations of the general goal of understanding the long time dynamics of solutions to important nonlinear dispersive and hyperbolic equations.      The outcomes of this grant of PI Nahmod achieved two equally important objectives:     (I) The scientific objective which focused on several central problems arising in the study of the long time dynamics of solutions to certain nonlinear evolution equations from a non-deterministic view point. We were interested in exacting how probability can be applied to shed light on behavior and dynamics of ‘generic solutions’.  The idea is that one need not look at the dynamics of equations for every single initial profile of a class to predict an outcome. This is an important question for in many instances obstacles to the existence of solutions stems from an exceptional set of data. While generic data - in the sense of probability - evolve in time to good solutions.  Probability introduces the notion that one can look at it generically; pick one at random that has certain prescribed properties, and understand the long-term dynamics of it by approaching it from a non-deterministic viewpoint. A particular concurrent aim was to shed light into the very difficult question of quantifying the transport of randomness under the nonlinear flow of the nonlinear Sch\"rodinger equation. The PI and collaborators Yu Deng and Haitian Yue (the latter a PhD student of the PI) were able to provide fundamental insight into this question in their joint work supported by this grant.  All in all this project led to several peer-reviewed journal publications and brought the research to bear in other fascinating areas of research under current investigation.     (II) The broader impact objective of the proposal which aimed at fostering  the training of doctoral graduate students and junior researchers in the US, was also successfully achieved. The PIs have fundamentally contributed to the STEM workforce and have substantially enhanced dissemination and collaborative research through their joint FRG research workshops organized supported by this grant as well as the dedicated workshops   for Women in Partial Differential  Equations.  Nahmod has been an invited speaker at numerous conferences and workshops in the U.S and overseas during this period. She supervised 3 PhD students who finished their doctoral dissertations in thsi period and started supervising two additional new PhD students also during this period. Nahmod has also mentored 3 postdoctoral research associates during this period.            Last Modified: 11/17/2019       Submitted by: Andrea R Nahmod]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
