<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certain nonmagnetic metals have been shown to behave like magnets when electrical current is passed through them.  As electrical current is passed through these metals, which exhibit the so-called spin Hall effect, they can be used to control the switching and other functional properties of adjacent ferromagnetic metals, removed by a few atomic layers in a sandwich structure.  This phenomenon, known as the spin Hall effect, is very exciting for applications in magnetic data storage ('spintronics'), since it enables very efficient current-controlled switching for nanoscale magnets.   This project  will search for chemically ordered metal alloys, up to a dozen atomic layers thick, which are expected to offer very efficient electrical-current control of magnetism.      These metallic alloys will be synthesized at thicknesses of dozens of atoms; their atomic arrangements and chemical tranformations will be studied, and their functional properties in data storage will be measured at temperatures approaching absolute zero and up to room temperature.  The discovery of  these improved materials  would have broad impact in information storage technology.  Graduate students will gain broad expertise in topics ranging from classical metallurgy  electronic devices.  Outreach activities are planned with K-12 schools in Manhattan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary:&lt;br/&gt;This project will conduct a materials search for ultrathin paramagnetic intermetallic phases, based on tungsten (W) and other heavy metals, which have the potential to convert charge current to spin current with high efficiency.  Theoretical considerations indicate that intermetallic phases with a large number of atoms per unit cell should have a conversion efficiency (spin Hall angle) possibly in excess of that observed for tungsten (W), which currently has the highest spin Hall angle known.  The experiments will combine epitaxial ultrathin film depositions, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization, measurements of phase transformation kinetics, and innovative measurements of the spin Hall effect using radio-frequency techniques.   The discovery of phases with high spin Hall angles would have broad impact, facilitating the incorporation of spin torque in information storage technology.  Graduate students will gain broad expertise in topics ranging from classical metallurgy (microstructure, phase transformations) to measurements of film-level physical properties (cryogenic magnetotransport and ferromagnetic resonance) to incorporation in spin electronic devices.  Outreach activities are planned with K-12 schools in Manhattan.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is possible to create currents of pure electron spin, unaccompanied by charge, in metallic conductors.  "Pure" spin currents can be generated through electrical current in heavy metals such as Pt, which act as charge-to-spin converters through the spin Hall or related effects.  These pure spin currents can be used to switch nanoscale magnets, and so are useful in emerging nonvolatile solid state magnetic information storage (magnetic random access memory) or information processing devices.  A major goal in spin electronics is to develop new materials with high efficiency in spin-to-charge conversion.  Efficient materials will enable low-power, energy-efficient device operation.  Theoretical predictions and some experimental evidence point towards ordered alloys of heavy metals as promising candidates for the highest efficiency.  More complex crystal structures are thought to promote large spin Hall effects.    During the grant period, we have tested the dependence of spin transport efficiency on crystal structure in a prototype material, tungsten (W.)  Tungsten exists in two crystal phases at room temperature, one stable and simple (alpha-W) and one semi-stable and complex (beta-W, with the A15 crystal structure.)  The spin transport efficiency, as spin mixing conductance, an interfacial quantity, was measured through a microwave absorption technique.  We have found, surprisingly, that there is very little difference in the behavior of the two very different crystal phases of the same metal, at least in this property, which may suggest alternate strategies to improve efficiency.     The program activities have also supported the development of materials synthesis techniques to stabilize semi-stable (metastable) metallic phases, of potential interest as for integrated circuit (IC) interconnects, as well as further experiments on pure spin current transport in magnetic heterostructures.    Intellectual merits: The program has advanced understanding of spin transport in novel alloys, an active scientific area with great applications potential in information storage (hard drives, magnetic random access memory.)  Broader impacts: The program has supported the education of two Ph.D. students, and scientific outreach to the public, through the development of web-based interactive simulations in physical phenomena (hosted at spin.ap.columbia.edu)       Last Modified: 05/02/2019       Submitted by: William Bailey]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
