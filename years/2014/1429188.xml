<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award funds the acquisition of geochemical instrumentation at SUNY Geneseo which will augment the analytical capabilities of a department with a proven record of success in undergraduate research, thereby enhancing the education of the next generation of geoscientists. Three faculty in the Department of Geological Sciences have well-established, undergraduate-friendly research programs that will immediately benefit from the expanded analytical capabilities. The instrumentation will provide high-resolution chemical analysis of rock, sediment and water samples to support ongoing research, and will enable new collaborative research in areas such as geomorphology, petrology, anthropology, and ecology. The research that will benefit from the acquisition is (1) providing key insight to the magnitude, timing and pace of climate changes during the last glacial-interglacial transition in the western U.S. (2) establishing a detailed characterization of ground and surface water chemistry in a region that is targeted for high-volume hydraulic fracturing of the Marcellus Shale for extraction of natural gas; and (3) establishing the impacts of slag on soil and water chemistry in western New York State and the Adirondack State Park, important agricultural and recreational regions. Research in these areas includes field and laboratory components carried out by faculty and undergraduates, in keeping with the tradition of cultivating critical thinking and problem-based learning in the Department of Geological Sciences. This instrumentation will be incorporated into classes reaching more than 300 students per year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this award funds the acquisition of an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) to support research in paleoclimatology, hydrogeology, and geochemistry at SUNY Geneseo. For research in paleoclimatology and related fields, the ICP-OES will be used by the Cosmogenic Nuclide Preparation Lab, which prepares samples for measurement of cosmogenic Beryllium-10 inventory of surficial deposits and landforms. For hydrogeologic studies, the ICP-OES will enable new research on water quality in areas of upstate New York targeted for high volume hydraulic fracturing. For geochemical studies, the ICP-OES will be used for measuring the concentrations of metal and rare-earth elements in slag, a byproduct of smelting, and in soils and water in environments affected by the disposal of slag. Additionally, the ICP-OES will augment the analytical capabilities of ongoing research in the Departments of Anthropology, Biology and Chemistry at SUNY Geneseo, and provide opportunities for new research in these departments. Acquisition of the ICP-OES also provides new opportunities for collaborative research between the Department of Geological Sciences and other institutions within and beyond New York State.</AbstractNarration>
