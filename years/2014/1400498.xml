<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2014 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Samuel Taylor is "Geometry and Dynamics of Mapping Class Groups and Outer Automorphism Groups of Free Group." The host institution for the fellowship is Yale University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Yair Minsky.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Roughly speaking, homogeneous 2-dimensional geometry splits into 3 classical cases: the geometry of the Euclidean plane, the sphere, and the hyperbolic plane. Arguably, the most interesting of these is the hyperbolic plane; it possesses the greatest flexibility in the shapes that one can obtain by gluing together pieces modeled on its structure. This basic insight has vast generalizations in Thurston?s work on the geometry of 3-dimensional spaces and in Gromov?s extensions of these ideas to objects outside of the traditional topological setting.   One goal of this project was to exploit these insights in an algebraic setting, where "hyperbolicity" often does not exist in its strongest form. For example, a significant outcome of this project was the further development of the geometric notion of stability. Informally, this is a property that applies in a variety of settings and allows for one way of expanding the idea of hyperbolicity to more general situations. Starting with the question, "What pairs of points have an optimal route between them?" we can understand certain subspaces which exhibit negative curvature behavior, even when global hyperbolicity fails.   Another of this project?s goals was an explicit understanding of connections between geometry and topology in low dimensions. For example, it?s been known since Thurston that 3-dimensional spaces often have inherent geometric structure which should greatly aid in our understanding. However, these geometric structure are often not known explicitly, that is, concrete quantities like volume can often be difficult to estimate. One outcome of this project has been the continuation of a program to make such estimates explicit, especially in a "randomized" setting.   This project has also applied some of these ideas to more novel settings. One notable example is work which establishes when an extension of a free group is hyperbolic. These extensions are concrete methods of building new objects from old ones, and our results give flexible conditions for when such a combination produces an algebraic object with the strong geometric conditions alluded to above.   Finally, this project has given the PI the opportunity to mature as a researcher, teacher, collaborator, and lecturer.
