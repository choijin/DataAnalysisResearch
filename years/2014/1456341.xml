<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on developing a customizable tissue engineered tracheal implant for tracheal transplantation and reconstruction surgery. Current surgical solutions for these patients are limited by problems with the availability of suitable cadaveric tissue, as well as with unsatisfactory long-term survival of the engrafted tissues due to issues with both revascularization and immune rejection. The combination of an inert biomaterial scaffold and autologous cells avoids any concerns with graft rejection, while allowing for the reliable production of tracheal grafts. Nanofiber Solutions expects this new device will enable as many as 6,500 life-saving procedures annually. A successful Phase 2 project will demonstrate long-term performance of the nanofiber tracheal implant and the mechanisms of action in a large animal model as well as a humanitarian device exemption (HDE) application with the FDA to initiate a clinical trial. This trachea implant product addresses a $600 million dollar opportunity. Other tissue engineered products based on this technology platform address billions of dollars more in market opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is focused on developing a customizable tissue engineered tracheal implant for tracheal transplantation and reconstruction surgery. The trachea has challenging mechanical and biological requirements, and despite many attempts there currently is no fully functional artificial trachea. The fully synthetic tracheal scaffold is seeded with autologous stem cells harvested from the patient?s bone marrow. To prepare for an FDA submission and initial human clinical trials, we will accomplish three technical objectives in this Phase II work: 1) Optimize the use of a closed system, disposable seeding chamber to allow uniform cell seeding throughout the scaffold, 2) Develop a commercial manufacturing process for the production and placement of support ribs on the tracheal graft, and 3) Elucidate mechanisms of tracheal regeneration in vivo of intraoperatively seeded tracheal implants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We demonstrated that despite the hypothesis that porous rings would increase cell seeding, solid C-rings led to increased cell seeding.  Previous Phase 1 results for tissue engineered tracheal grafts (TETG), as well as data from other fields of tissue engineering demonstrate that the dosage of cells achieved onto the graft may decrease complications such as stenosis.  As stenosis is the most commonly described complication in both animal models and in the few clinical cases described, the ability to increase cell seeding may prove to be critical in the development of an optimal TETG.  We were able to successfully 3-D print the solid and porous C-rings for this project based on CAD models we designed. This was a significant improvement over the hand-cut C-rings used in the Phase I work. Additionally, we designed and 3-D printed a jig that allowed for the rapid and reproducible placement of the C-rings onto the tracheal graft during electrospinning.   At early time points of 2 and 6 weeks, inflammatory cell infiltration is evident within the graft.  Additionally, there is formation of granulation tissues around the graft.  However, at these early time points, minimal migration of epithelial cells is evident.  Biopsies of the anastomotic and midgraft regions at these points revealed presence of epithelial progenitor cells. At later time points, maturation of the granulation tissue surrounding the grafts was evident with epithelial lining noted outside of the graft.  Minimal epithelialization is noted at the anastomoses on the luminal surfaces.   Additionally, biopsies at these later time points revealed that the epithelial progenitor cells had decreased compared to the control when evaluating the midgraft.  In summary, we had no graft-related deaths as part of this project but further investigation into the stenosis at the anastamotic areas is needed. This SBIR project has initiated several other collaborative research efforts involving computational fluid dynamics modeling of the airflow through the graft and mechanistic in vitro assays to investigate methods to mitigate stenosis. These tissue engineered tracheal grafts could provide an urgently needed solution to long-segment tracheal lesions.
