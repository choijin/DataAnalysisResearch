<AbstractNarration>The International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) is an annual event, and is the most widely-attended gathering of experts from the signal processing community. In 2014, it will take place in Florence, Italy. Historically, about 25% of the ICASSP participants have been students. This is a very healthy statistic because the future of this all-pervasive discipline is largely determined by the number of young people adopting signal processing as their field of endeavor. Many of the students are coauthors of accepted papers and presenters at the conference. For them, ICASSP is a unique opportunity to meet many of the leaders in the field and to broaden their horizons by being exposed to areas of research different from their own. The conference is also an excellent opportunity for them to start networking with people who will likely be their future collaborators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately is expected that the number of US-based students attending the conference in Florence will be smaller than usual. This is largely due to the high travel costs to get to Florence from North America. This proposal aims at providing travel support for some of these students, hence, insuring better representation of US students at ICASSP 2014.</AbstractNarration>

This conference is the most prestigious gathering of engineers and scientists in the area of signal processing.  An Award Committee for selecting the student winners was formed. The members of the committee were Ananthram Swami from the U.S. Army Research Lab, Alberto Carini from the University of Urbino, Italy, and Petar M. Djuri? from Stony Brook University, New York. The criteria for selecting the student winners were  The student must be US-based and in good standing at her/his university. The student must be the first author of an accepted paper. The student will make the presentation of the paper. The accepted paper is top ranked by reviewers.   The applicants were asked to submit a brief letter from their advisors providing their status and the need for the support, as well as a document with their costs for attending ICASSP 2014.  There were 70 applications and 24 recipients. Of the recipients, 20 of them received $1,100 and four students received $750. Those who received $750 were already recipients of a travel support by IEEE.  The awards were processed by the PI and the Research Foundation at Stony Brook University.  The conference was highly successful and it broke the attendance record of all times. Many of the awarded students would not have attended the conference without the received awards.
