<AbstractNarration>This is a project that creates an I-Corps Site at the University of Pittsburgh. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to further Pitt's entrepreneurial competencies by creating an I-Corps site directed through the University of Pittsburgh Innovation Institute. This award builds on University efforts to instill innovation and entrepreneurship across the entire organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives of Pitt I-Corps include the following:&lt;br/&gt;-Increase the number of entrepreneurial minded individuals by education, training and outreach to disciplines and individuals underrepresented in current commercialization processes;&lt;br/&gt;-Enhance a recently deployed commercialization process focused on supplementing viable innovations from the laboratory with key steps required to move them to the market; and&lt;br/&gt;-Improve connection to the regional entrepreneurial ecosystem for enhanced integration of Pitt opportunities into the local early-stage environment and similar networks beyond Pittsburgh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pitt Ventures is a new multi-step program that was created in the Innovation Institute to provide an experiential learning program enhancing the rate of commercial outcomes of Pitt discoveries. It is a lean launchpad engaging faculty, students, and local mentors in idea discovery and entrepreneurship as a means of turning concepts into products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through support provided in an I-Corps program, Pitt Ventures will be enhanced through a focus on disciplines and individuals that have been underrepresented in current innovation activities. With this outreach, the breadth of commercialized University innovations will be increased as its pipeline will contain a more diversified set of opportunities from a broader group of individuals.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given Pitt's collection of resources and opportunities, Pitt I-Corps will play an important role in strengthening the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the Mid-West by providing more inventions for the region to work on. Through enhanced engagement with this network, the University will be better positioned to utilize the set of capabilities resident in the region that can help to convert Pitt ideas to marketed products. As such, the proposed I-Corps effort will aid the University in more effectively converting intellectual value conceived by its innovators into economic value realized through commercialization. The end result is more new job creation, increased local investment, enhanced economic growth and more products benefiting society reaching the market.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Pittsburgh ("Pitt" or "University") is a leader among academic institutions in the United States and has one of the largest federally-funded research programs in the country (moving from the #5 position in NIH funding with $485 million in fiscal year 2017 to the #4 position in FY2018 at $536 million according to the NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools - RePORT). In November 2013, Pitt launched the Innovation Institute ("Institute"), a major, campus-wide initiative to expand innovation and entrepreneurship among faculty, staff and students while at the same time improving partnerships with regional economic development organizations and the local business community. The Institute was created to serve as the hub of commercialization activities on campus, enhancing the culture of innovation and entrepreneurship at Pitt while also improving the University’s historic technology transfer success.  Pitt’s I-Corps Site was established in January 2015. The number of invention disclosures at Pitt since this time has grown from 307 in 2015 to 367 in fiscal year 2019 while the number of startups has grown nearly 150% over the last five years compared to the previous five. The Institute realizes that not all ideas described in an invention disclosure make sustainable products or scalable companies.  In order to examine a disclosed technology for commercial viability, the Institute deploys a "lean launchpad" based approach to opportunity advancement termed Pitt Ventures.  The Pitt Ventures initiative offers a multiple stage, or "gear," commercialization process that supports Pitt innovators from idea to commercialization through the creation of "virtual startups" facilitated by Institute personnel.  The I-Corps Site program is focused on moving innovations through the "First Gear" element of Pitt Ventures.  In First Gear, cohorts of teams must "Prove It" &ndash; basically show through customer discovery efforts that their innovation addresses a pain point in the marketplace that customers care about. To improve Pitt’s role in the local early stage environment, in 2016 the Institute launched Fourth Gear for local early stage companies seeking entrepreneurial assistance. In 2017, a commercialization short-course, the Innovation Igniter program, was created and piloted as an additional Pitt Ventures stage. In 2018 the Igniter program began as a monthly offering with 88 participants. Two of these sessions were offered jointly with the other Pittsburgh-based I-Corps Site, Carnegie Mellon University &ndash; one of which was an exclusive female, graduate student offering during Women’s Entrepreneurship Week.  Pitt has worked to advance site level teams to the national I-Corps program. Of all of Pitt’s 106 Site teams, 15 First Gear teams and two Fourth Gear teams have applied.
