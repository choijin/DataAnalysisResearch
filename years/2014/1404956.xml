<AbstractNarration>1404956 (Bakshi). The goal of this effort is to develop a new approach for analyzing and designing sustainable systems that accounts for the interaction and dependence between technological and ecological systems. Existing methods tend to ignore the critical role of ecosystems in sustaining all human activities, and could lead to perverse decisions. The framework of techno-ecological synergy is proposed as a way of accounting for the demand and supply of ecosystem services at multiple spatial scales. This approach will also be useful for designing new and innovative networks of technological and ecological systems that may be economically and environmentally superior to systems designed by conventional methods. The project involves highly multidisciplinary research that connects across engineering, ecology, spatial and geographical modeling, and optimization. Collaboration with Dr. Ziv and his group in the UK will greatly enhance the research due to the complementary nature of Dr. Ziv's research and background with that of Dr. Bakshi and his group at Ohio State University. Dr. Ziv and his group will contribute their expertise in modeling the supply of specific ecosystem services in selected regions at various spatial scales. This information will be integrated with knowledge about relevant technological systems. Through visits to Dr. Ziv's group, the PI and graduate students will gain greater insight into modeling and software for ecosystem services and spatial analysis. This will allow research to progress more quickly and explore new directions that would be difficult to study without the collaboration. Both groups will develop the proposed Techo-Ecological Synergy framework together and apply it to various case studies, including the campuses of Ohio State University (OSU) and the University of Leeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaboration across disciplines will help in extending the reach of ecosystem service modeling into industrial supply chains and life cycles, and of tools for modeling technological systems into ecological systems. These contributions will help bridge gaps between research in ecosystem services and sustainable engineering. This will have broad implications beyond the proposed research, and across disciplines by creating unique opportunities for society to learn about the direct and indirect role and capacity of ecosystems in supporting human activities. The proposed application to assessing and enhancing campus sustainability at OSU and Leeds will permit education and outreach to minorities across disciplines and age-groups. Dissemination of the results will be enabled by courses, websites, and outreach through both campuses. The collaboration will also enhance the ability of the research team to secure funds from other US-UK programs such as the global innovation initiative. This grant is co-funded by the Western Europe Program of NSF's International Science and Engineering Section, and the Environmental Sustainability Program in the CBET Division of NSF's Engineering Directorate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project enabled collaborative research between Professor Guy Ziv  of the Department of  Geographical Sciences at the University of Leeds,  UK and Professor Bhavik Bakshi of the Department of Chemical and  Biomolecular Engineering at The Ohio State University.  Ziv's expertise  is in ecology and ecosystem services, while Bakshi's expertise is in  sustainable engineering.  This project enabled further advances in the  framework of techno-ecological synergy, which aims to encourage greater  harmony between human and natural systems.  Some key outcomes of this collaborative project as as follows.  Intellectual Merit.    1) This collaboration helped in extending conventional engineering  design toward including the role of ecological systems.  This approach  was applied to the design of an agricultural landscape while consdering  factors such as production of bioenergy and food, impact on water  quality and quantity, cost, and various ecosystem services.  Attached  figure shows some typical results from this work.  It shows that by  using some land to provide ecosystem services, it is possible to use  intensive farming practices to satisfy human needs along with economic  feasibility.  2) This collaboration is also resulting in a new approach for  determining the "serviceshed" of an ecosystem service.  This is the  region that provides a selected ecosystem service to a beneficiary.  For  example, the watershed is the serviceshed for water provisioning to  beneficiaries in that region.  Broader Impacts.      1) Opportunities for two students, Rebecca Hanes and Michael Charles   to spend time at the University of Leeds.  This provided exposure to   different academic culture and disciplines, which helped their   development as researchers.  Both students are from groups that are  underrepresented in engineering: women and native Americans.  2) The work is being disseminated by means of academic publications.    Relevant data and software tools will also become available at the   group's website (pse.osu.edu).  The outcomes from this collaborative project are playing a central  role in fostering this collaboration to develop methods and tools that  help establish mutually beneficial synergies between human-design and  natural systems.
