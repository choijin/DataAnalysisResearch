<AbstractNarration>Structural dynamics and domain reorientation of a phosphohexomutase:  long range effects and catalysis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigators will address fundamental questions about the functions of enzymes, the intricate molecular machines found in all living things.  In particular, this work will define pathways used for transmitting information across the three-dimensional structures of enzymes.   The program will train young scientists in powerful, state-of-the-art biophysical methods and their applications for unraveling the mysteries of biological macromolecules.  The research and associated training activities in this project will benefit the chemical and biotechnology industries in the U.S., as well as the research communities in protein science and biophysics.  The PI will expand her Science ARTreach program at a local elementary school, using art to improve science literacy of a diverse student population.  The co-PI will launch Scoutreach to introduce molecules of living cells to adolescent youth and will enhance teaching of biophysical methods in the graduate student curricula, to provide highly skilled employees for the work force.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Catalytically relevant motions among domains and in internal networks will be investigated in the enzyme phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase (PMM/PGM).  PMM/PGM is a member of a large enzyme superfamily whose members have important roles in carbohydrate biosynthesis.  Previous studies showed that both phosphorylation and ligand binding affect the structure and flexibility of this enzyme.  As phosphorylation and allostery are topics of wide interest, the mechanisms involved in long-range phospho-regulation of catalysis have implications for understanding many enzyme systems.  Specifically, this will be investigated at the levels of fluctuating domain orientations and networks of communicating and mobile residues, using a combination of cutting-edge X-ray crystallography, NMR, and protein chemistry.  Multiple enzyme states (phosphorylated, dephosphorylated, etc.) will be characterized in terms of the nature and populations of their side chain and domain conformers, their dynamics, and residue networks of transmission and dynamics. How these characteristics are affected by covalent phosphorylation vs. noncovalent ligand binding will be compared and contrasted. This will provide a comprehensive case study of long-range communication in an enzyme, and its tuning by phosphorylation and ligand binding.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the course of this award, we performed cutting-edge, biophysical studies of an enzyme involved in carbohydrate biosynthesis.  This protein, a phosphohexomutase, is part of a large family of enzymes that function in all organisms from bacteria to humans, and play important roles in cellular metabolism.  We used this phosphohexomutase as a model system, to study important issues related to protein structure and enzyme function.  Key to our accomplishments was the use of multiple complementary techniques, to provide information from different experimental viewpoints.  These include NMR, X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics, enzymology, and computational approaches. A better understanding of enzymes has many important implications for biotechnology or industry, such engineering for novel functions, more efficient catalysis, and superior stability.   Among our findings from this award was that phosphorylation and ligand binding appear to drive the enzyme from an "open" state toward a "closed" ligand-bound state. One region of the protein is especially important to these responses, enhancing the folding stability of the protein to a uniform level and establishing a globally unified structure.  We further refined a pipeline of experimental approaches to characterize the effects of phosphorylation on protein structure, which should have widespread applicability to understanding the impacts of this  covalent modification in diverse regulatory processes in biology.  Also as part of this work, we developed a software package called TREND, which has shown broad applicability in processing various types of data, including as NMR spectra. TREND also works well with MRI movies of brain, chest, and heart, where it can separate and analyze multiple simultaneous processes like breathing and beating of the heart.  The TREND software thus has impacts in multiple fields, from data analysis to imaging.               Other activities of this award included training of students, both graduate and undergraduate, and including women and minorities.  An outreach program to a local elementary school (K-5) was continued, which uses a combination of art and science to increase science literacy in a diverse student population.  We also introduced a novel unit on macromolecular crystallography with remote synchrotron data collection in a senior undergraduate biochemistry laboratory class.  This unique educational experience helps prepare students for technical positions in the US workforce, including job opportunities in our national laboratories.
