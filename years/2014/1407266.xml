<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a three year standard award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site program at Rutgers University entitled, "RET SITE: Research Experience for Teachers in Engineering (RU RET-E) for Green Energy and Technology", under the direction of Dr. Kimberly Cook-Chennault. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RU-RET-E is a critical link in Rutgers' educational pipeline in energy engineering education from K-12, to undergraduate and further to graduate education and STEM fields. It builds upon long-term collaborative relationships between the participating school districts and the Rutgers School of Engineering. Participation of these teachers will readily translate to the learning experience of their students and subsequently their academic achievement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed project will build and improve upon a previous successful NSF RET project (EEC-1009797).  It will expand and enhance the previous project as a comprehensive three-year program to host a total of 46 middle and high school teachers for six weeks during the summer. Participating teachers will be recruited from New Brunswick, Plainfield, and Scotch Plains-Fanwood which collectively are home to high populations of underrepresented minorities, economically challenged and special needs students. RU RET-E seeks to provide teaching professionals the opportunity to engage in science and engineering research, with intellectual foci centered around three research thrusts: nanotechnology and materials, renewable and sustainable fuels, and devices and energy management systems for energy generation, conversion, and storage. These are areas where Rutgers has a critical mass of faculty interest, existing academic and physical infrastructure, and funding. Each teacher pair will develop Student Growth Objectives (SGO) rubrics, to be strategically, linked to engineering units, which will be peer-reviewed over the summer. These units and SGOs will be used to assess student comprehension, critiquing proficiency and the ability to execute and construct lab reports, and aptitude for engineering problem solving.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goals of the Rutgers University Research Experience for Teachers in Engineering (RU RET-E) for Green Energy Technology program were to engage middle and high school math and science teachers in innovative ?green? engineering research to 1) enhance their understanding of engineering, 2) assist teachers in their efforts to design and implement grade-appropriate inquiry-based engineering lessons in their academic classrooms and 3) provide financial support for teachers to implement lessons in classrooms.  Teachers were recruited from all school districts in NJ, where particular emphasis was placed on economically disadvantaged and underserved school districts with racially, gender and ethnically diverse student populations.  Teachers were also encouraged to implement engineering activities to classrooms of students with varying degrees of skill level, i.e. general, honors and special needs classrooms.  The program facilitated multi-level mentoring opportunities for selected labs that housed undergraduate, high school and teacher research fellows.  Results from the findings of multilevel mentoring were published and disseminated in conferences and are available for download.  The Rutgers University Research Experience for Teachers in Engineering (RU RET-E) for Green Energy Technology program is a six-week learning experience that took place the last week in June and ended the first week in August for each year of the program.  During this time, teachers spent the summer working within a laboratory of a faculty member for over 80% of their time.  The participating faculty members were from several disciplines: School of Engineering, Marine and Coastal Sciences, Department of Biological and Chemical Sciences, and Bioenvironmental Sciences. RU RET-E teacher fellows participated in weekly professional development seminars and tours in addition to working within research laboratories.  The lecture seminars and working sessions that teachers attended/participated in were called the Nature of Engineering.  In the Nature of Engineering seminars, fellows learned about experimental design, principles of measurement and variability, the engineering design cycle, descriptive and inferential statistics, 'testable' hypotheses and hypothesis testing and sample size, differences between the scientific method and engineering design cycle. The Nature of Engineering seminars also covered the following themes: Green Revolution; Invention &amp; Innovation; Needs, Problems &amp; Problem Solving; Engineering Education &amp; Grant Writing; and Technology &amp; Society.  Fellows also observed presentations from undergraduate students who were part of the NSF REU Site: Green Energy Technology Undergraduate Program (GET UP) and high school students who participated in the Student Learning and Achievement in Aerospace and Mechanical (SLAAM) Engineering Summer Program at Rutgers.   The RU RET-E program engaged over 26 middle and high school teachers from 15 different schools.  Each teacher created a lesson/activity that was implemented into their respective classroom for a minimum of two years, where over 1,560 students engaged in lessons.  Selected lessons were submitted to teachengineering.org for publication. Three of the classrooms included students who were identified as having special needs.  In addition, the RU RET E team also worked with selected schools to incorporate specific lessons into multiple classrooms to identify best practices for teaching activities pertaining to electrochemical cells and batteries, dye-synthesized solar cells and design of nano-organic materials.  Two master teachers: Mariel Kohler and Elizabeth Parker received awards for the lessons they created as part of the RU RET-E program.  Mariel Kohler received the "Northrop Grumman Award" award for a lesson she created in the RU RET E program entitled, "Nanotechnology in Action: Organic Electronics".  Elizabeth Parker was awarded the "Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science teaching" based on the lesson that she created as part of our RU RET E Program.               In addition to providing professional development activities for in-service and pre-service teachers, the RU RET E program held several engineering education workshops for teachers who were unable to participate in the  RU RET-E summer program.  This program has facilitated meaningful partnerships between Rutgers and local schools; provided opportunities for teachers to work along with undergraduate and/or high school researchers in select laboratories; and opportunities for graduate students to hone their skills in mentoring teachers on cutting edge and novel technology, science and engineering.
