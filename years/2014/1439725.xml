<AbstractNarration>This proposal targets the theoretical foundations and algorithmic design of ultra-large-scale sparse signal recovery and spectral estimation problems, with applications to fast MRI acquisition, low-power spectrum-sensing for cognitive radio, and low-power spectroscopy for deep-space exploration.  While compressed sensing has recently emerged as a powerful framework for understanding the fundamental limits of sparse signal processing, current algorithms based on convex optimization, are difficult to scale efficiently.  This proposal is motivated therefore to address the challenge of scale in the theory and design of sparse signal recovery problems, with the goal of enabling real-time processing capability.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This proposal develops the mathematical foundations as well as practical sub-linear-time algorithms for ultra-large-scale sparse signal recovery and spectral estimation problems.  The theory and algorithms are derived through an interdisciplinary mix of intellectual tools from coding theory, graph theory, number theory, and statistical signal processing.  This leads to the proposal of  new computational primitives dubbed as sparse-graph alias codes that are analogous to Low-Density-Parity-Check (LDPC) codes that have revolutionized modern communication systems.  The proposed framework is envisioned to provide a similar impact on next-generation sparse signal processing systems with respect to (i) acquisition overhead; (ii) computational and energy efficiency; and (iii) performance guarantees and stability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project is to establish the theoretical foundations and computationally efficient algorithms, as well as practical implementation to address the challenges of data-intensive applications involving sparse data with respect to:  - acquisition overhead (i.e., the number of samples or measurements needed);  - computational and energy efficiency (i.e., the run-time and/or processing energy);  - performance guarantees and stability (i.e., the reliability, accuracy and robustness to noise).  More specifically, under this overarching umbrella, the following areas were explored as part of this project:  1. sub-linear time sparse signal recovery  This project investigates effective discrete sensing and sampling design through a coding-theoretic lens that leads to sub-linear run-time algorithms (order-optimal) for sparse signal reconstruction, under both discrete and continuous settings. This has the potential to revolutionize the way next-generation compressed sensing and sampling applications evolve in terms of acquisition overhead and real-time running capability.  2. sub-linear time sparse signal transforms  This project is first targeted at robustly estimating the sparse frequency components of a large relevant statistical class of signals, using ultra-low sample complexity and computational complexity, which can be potentially applied in fast MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) reconstruction and spectroscopy for deep space explorations. This also spawns further results in the computation of sparse Walsh hadamard transform, which is tremoundously useful in large-scale data science problems, especially machine learning.  3. sub-linear time algorithm design for large-scale machine learning   This project has connected the problem of polynomial learning, which is a large class of machine learning problems, with the design of good sparse-graph codes. We show that by choosing training samples intelligently, one can learn the underlying unknown polynomials with minimal sample complexity and run-time.   To sum up, in this project, we view the problem of sparse estimation and learning in high-dimensional problems through a novel sparse-graph coding lens. Using a simple divide-and-conquer philosophy and fast peeling-based decoding, we show how to achieve sub-linear time costs for both acquisition, queries and computation. This helps us break the complexity barrier while providing strict performance guarantees, and has the potential to enable "real-time" processing of massive data-sets featuring sparsity. This framework can be used for a host of problems from sparse discrete transform computations to compressed sensing and phase-retrieval, with applications to imaging, optics, quantum information systems, and machine learning.
