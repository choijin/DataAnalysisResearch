<AbstractNarration>Picoeukaryotes are an ecologically important, but understudied group of picophytoplankton that are significant contributors to oceanic primary production and global carbon cycling. In this postdoctoral research project, the fellow will examine the physiological and molecular response of three picoeukaryotes to elevated carbon dioxide and changes in nutrient availability. This is an important and timely topic for improved understanding of marine ecosystem responses to global climate changes. This two year fellowship hosted by Michael Lomas, Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, will advance the career of the fellow who has strong background in microbial research, a field that is of increasing importance in oceanography. The broadening participation activities include education and outreach to youths from a local Somalian community residing in Maine since the Somalian civil war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the fellow will study the response of Micromonas pusilla, Ostreococcus tauri, and Bathycoccus prasinos, picoeukaryotes commonly found in oligotrophic regions, to conditions representative of future oceans, specifically ocean acidification and phosphorus limitation. Physiological measurements and whole-cell transcriptomic profiling will be used to characterize the cellular response of this ecologically important group of picophytoplankton to changes in phosphorus availability and rising ambient carbon dioxide. In addition, cell abundance and gene expression patterns will be investigated in field samples using species-specific molecular assays to understand how natural picoeukaryotic populations respond to regional gradients in environmental conditions. The study will provide insight into how climate change may impact picoeukaryote growth and thus carbon cycling in oligotrophic gyres. Data and information about rate processes and underlying cellular mechanisms are critical for future development of ecologically-driven, predictive ocean ecosystem models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient utilized by phytoplankton for growth and, as such, has the potential to significantly influence oceanic photosynthetic carbon fixation processes, termed primary production. Large regions of the oceans have chronically low concentrations of phosphate (Pi), the preferred form of P, which renders alternative P, such as dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP), an important nutrient source. In these oligotrophic regions, cyanobacteria (photosynthetic bacteria) are often numerically dominant, but picoeukaryotes (eukaryotic phytoplankton &lt; 3 &micro;m) can dominate biomass and productivity making them important contributors to the ocean carbon cycle. Despite their importance, little is known regarding the metabolic mechanisms which permit picoeukaryote growth in oligotrophic oceans.     In response to global climate change, the surface ocean is expected to warm and become increasingly stratified, reducing vertical nutrient supplies and increasing the importance of DOP, in addition to becoming more acidified. Given the importance to carbon cycling, and the hypothesis that oligotrophic gyres will expand as the oceans warm and stratify in the future, understanding the interactive effects of elevated CO2 and changing P availability is critical. Using a combination of culture studies and physiological measurements, the cellular response was characterized in Micromonas and Ostreococcus cells exposed to current and elevated CO2 levels coupled with changing P availability. The picoeukaryotes Micromonas and Ostreococcus are commonly found in the ocean regions where Pi levels are chronically low.     Generally, Micromonas cells were unaffected by elevated CO2, their response was largely driven by changes in P source and availability. Pi-deficiency resulted in Micromonas cells having reduced growth rates and cellular P quotas when compared to cells grown under Pi-replete conditions. When given DOP as the sole source of P, the growth rate and cellular P level of Micromonas was greater than Pi-deficient, but less than Pi-replete cells. Ostreococcus was able to grow equally well when supplied with DOP as the sole source of P as its growth rate and cellular P levels were similar to those measured in the Pi-replete treatment. Ostreococcus growth efficiency increased with elevated CO2; the growth rate and cellular P levels of Pi-replete and DOP-replete cultures increased when compared to the current CO2 condition.     The results from this work provide insight into the cellular response of picoeukaryotes to oligotrophic ocean conditions. This work has demonstrated that picoeukaryotes use an arsenal of metabolic strategies to cope with changes in P source and availability, including reducing their cellular P content. In future, more acidified, oligotrophic oceans picoeukaryotes, like Ostreococcus, could proliferate. The resulting changes to picoeukaryote community composition could have pronounced effects on the biogeochemistry of the oligotrophic oceans.
