<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program has identified STEM teacher preparation as one of its priorities and is committed to funding innovative models to support STEM teacher preparation and professional development. With support from the National Science Foundation, the professional development program at Hampton University will implement comprehensive strategies designed to transform STEM teaching and learning in an effort to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields.  The one-year pilot study, designed to assist high school science teachers with developing inquiry-based learning activities, will impact a large population of minority students and provide opportunities for collaboration and career advancement for teachers. This project has the potential to be a model for increasing the number of minority students pursuing STEM degree programs and careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to enhance the abilities of teachers to provide inquiry-based learning activities for their students by: 1) augmenting curriculum offerings to increase teachers' inventory of teaching activities, materials and tools; 2) increasing teachers' knowledge of STEM education; and 3) establishing collaborative networks with HU professors.  It is expected that this project will enhance the teachers' content knowledge and expose them and their students to new concepts using materials related to their lives, history and culture. The inquiry-based activities manual, a product of this program, will be disseminated widely and thus benefit a large population.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Background  In a 2007 publication by the National Academy of Sciences, "Rising Above the Gathering Storm"1, several concerns were raised as to whether the U.S. Science and Engineering education is suited for the 21st century.  A strong recommendation was made for the improvement of science and engineering education for students, starting at the K-12 levels. It was also suggested that science education will be greatly improved if teachers are given opportunities to improve their knowledge and skills, are sensitized to life-long learning, and can inspire and motivate students to become life-long learners. The critical role of teachers in STEM education is underscored by the Master Teacher Corps National program that was rolled out in 2012 by President Obama to recognize outstanding STEM teachers, strengthen STEM education, and boost the U.S. global competitiveness2. This report is about a one-year professional development pilot study for High School STEM teachers, which was conducted at Hampton University in 2015-2016. The goal was to help the teachers to develop new materials for their science curriculum, emphasizing inquiry-based laboratory instruction.  Intellectual Merit  The pilot study consisted of knowledge enrichment activities given during the school year, and a two-week summer institute during which the teachers designed and tested inquiry-based laboratory activities. The knowledge enrichment activities were in the form of interactive presentations given monthly by invited academic professionals. Development of inquiry-based activities was guided by the underlying provisions and objectives of the State of Virginia Standards of Learning (SOL), emphasizing higher level order thinking. They utilized as resources the Hampton University vast inventory of cultural heritage and historical materials (museum collections, art work, documents, archives, the Emancipation Oak, etc.), the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and Hampton University faculty research programs. The teacher-developed activities were put on trial-run with a small group of their students during the second week of the summer institute. Twelve students were involved.  The study involved the collective participation of science teachers from three high schools in the Hampton School District (Big Bethel, Kecoughtan, and Phoebus). A team of two teachers were selected from each school to engage in the actual training activity (one school had three teacher participants). Working together with their respective Science Curriculum Leaders, the participants would serve as facilitators for the other teachers at their respective schools.  Each team would return with one-to-two inquiry-based activities ready for implementation. Throughout the professional development period, the teachers received continual support, mentoring, and collaboration from Hampton University science faculty and other selected professionals. They were also provided opportunities to pursue research interests in collaboration with HU faculty researchers.  Outcomes/Impact  There were several outcomes in this study:  By the end of the two-week summer institute, five inquiry-based activities were developed, tested, and are now being implemented at the three schools.   One of the teachers received a small grant from the Virginia Association of Science Teachers (VAST) to support implementation of the activity she developed.   While all seven teachers are responsive to new curriculum guidelines and other mandates coming from the school district, they identified areas within those mandates that restrict their ability to implement new ideas. This project helped them to learn how to overcome those impediments.   The overwhelming impression the teachers gave is that K-12 teachers need access to opportunities for continuing professional development.   This project established a mechanism for the teachers to have access to professional development opportunities.   Together, the three schools represent a science teaching staff of 32 science teachers and a total student population of over 4500 students (approximately 60% from minority communities).
