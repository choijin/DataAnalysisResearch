<AbstractNarration>Hydropower reservoirs emit heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) like the coal-fired power plants they were designed to replace. Carbon carried by river waters settles in sediments when it enters slow-moving reservoir waters. When sediments are exposed to oxygenated water, microbes convert carbon to CO2. Without oxygen, microbes also produce CH4.  Therefore, the proportions of gases produced depend on the presence of oxygen in water, which varies between day and night.  Previous studies of CO2 and CH4 emissions from reservoirs have been almost exclusively conducted during the day. In collaboration with Dr. Huai Chen of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, this study will measure CO2 and CH4 emissions from one of the world's largest reservoirs, China's Three Gorges. These measurements, conducted during day and night, will contribute to a more accurate understanding of CO2 and CH4 emissions from hydropower as it expands throughout the developing world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Production of CO2 and CH4 in reservoirs varies spatially, as well as temporally. As water levels in the Three Gorges Reservoir rise and fall annually, 20% of the reservoir area around its margins is flooded and dewatered. Senesced plants in this draw-down zone are a rich and regular substrate for microbial oxidation. This study will measure diel CO2 and CH4 fluxes from the draw-down zone in dissolved and bubble form. Though studies in other reservoirs have taken similar measurements during the day, diel differences in 1) photosynthesis, which consumes CO2 and produces oxygen, 2) respiration, which consumes oxygen, and 3) atmospheric pressure, which may govern bubble release, could mean that current estimates of CO2 and CH4 fluxes in reservoirs are inaccurate. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Hydropower reservoirs are known sources for the greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere.  A synthesis of 85 reservoirs measured in tropical, temperate, and boreal regions found that 88% were sources for CO2 and all were sources for CH4.  Hydropower reservoirs differ from free-flowing rivers and naturally occurring lakes due to high sediment loads, flooding of terrestrial biomass during reservoir formation, subsequent fluctuations in reservoir storage.  Sediment and organic carbon deposition in reservoirs create environments conducive to not only aerobic microbial respiration, resulting in carbon dioxide (CO2), but also anaerobic methanogenesis.  In addition to in-stream processing of organic carbon, reservoirs enhance terrestrial-aquatic coupling through annual fluctuations in reservoir storage.  Stocks of terrestrial biomass replenished annually on reservoir floodplains contribute organic carbon to reservoirs once inundated.  Respiration of this terrestrial organic carbon proceeds considerably faster in lakes, rivers, and flooded soils.  In subtropical and Mediterranean floodplains, organic carbon concentrations have been shown to spike following flooding events, which is likely to result in concurrent spikes of dissolved CH4 and CO2, though these measurements have not been made.     Most studies of reservoirs and other aquatic ecosystems sample during the day, but concentrations of CH4, CO2, and N2O in water may vary on a diel basis.  Tobias et al. [2007] and Hotchkiss et al. [2014] have shown that daytime respiration can be 54-340% of nighttime respiration in temperate lakes and streams.  They attribute this to greater photo-degradation of complex organic carbon, production of labile organic carbon algal exudates, and higher temperatures during the day.  Thus, primary production, availability of oxygen, photo-oxidation, availability of electron donors such as organic carbon, and temperature each have the potential to influence respiration differently over 24 h.  Whether respiration and atmospheric fluxes of CH4, CO2, and N2O vary on a diel basis and across different aquatic ecosystems is relatively unconstrained.         Efforts have been made to characterize greenhouse gas emissions from hydropower at other temporal and spatial scales.  Reservoirs less than 10-20 years old tend to emit more CH4 and CO2 per unit area than older reservoirs.  In general, newly constructed reservoirs in tropical regions are more likely candidates for both CH4 and CO2 emissions than reservoirs in temperate regions.  The rate of hydropower development is also greatest in tropical and subtropical regions.  The highest rates of impoundment (&gt;100 dams currently planned) are in the Amazon-La Plata River basins of Brazil, the Ganges-Bramaputra River basins of India and Nepal, and the Yangzte River basin of China.      Among the largest and newest of these impoundments is the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) on the Yangtze River, covering 1,058 km2 in subtropical central China [Chen et al., 2009b].  Chen et al. [2009b], in a paper led my our collaborator, showed that diffusive CH4 emissions are particularly high on the floodplain of the TGR, which covers 349 km2 or one third of the reservoir area.  During low water storage periods, the TGR floodplain is targeted by farmers for intensive agriculture.  Pesticide, herbicide, and fertilizer use for conventional agriculture has led to the adoption of dike-pond aquaculture in the Pengxi River region of the floodplain as a more sustainable alternative.  Aquatic environments that remain in this region during the summer low storage period (April-August) include natural ponds, engineered ponds, and the Pengxi River.  This region of the TGR therefore represents an opportunity for the study of diel greenhouse gas production and atmospheric flux during low and high storage periods and across different aquatic ecosystems.     We measured the balance of primary production and respiration, organic carbon, diffusive CH4, CO2, and N2O fluxes over 24 h across aquatic ecosystems found in the Pengxi River region of the TGR floodplain during June, July, and August 2014.  We repeated these measurements during January 2015, or the subsequent period of water high storage on the TGR floodplain.  Diffusive CH4, CO2, and N2O fluxes were also measured during the day from different terrestrial ecosystems on this floodplain in order to compare the areal magnitude of emissions from the Pengxi River region during low and high reservoir storage.  We completed this study in collaboration with the Chinese Academy of Sciences? Chengdu Institute of Biology.   We observed marked diel curves in dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll (pigment in primary producers), and temperature (Figure 1).  However, there is little in our data to suggest that fluxes of CH4, CO2, and N2O vary significantly over 24 h (Figure 2).  These gas fluxes are significantly higher from aquatic environments on the floodplain during the summer low storage period than from the TGR during the winter high storage period.  It should be noted that we have not yet compared fluxes from terrestrial vegetation on the floodplain measured during the summer.
