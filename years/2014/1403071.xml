<AbstractNarration>One of the greatest threats to the health of North America's Great Lakes is invasion by exotic species, several of which already have had catastrophic impacts on property values, the fisheries, shipping, and tourism industries, and continue to threaten the survival of native species and wetland ecosystems.  Additional species have been placed on watchlists because of their potential to become aquatic invasives.  This project will create a network of herbaria and zoology museums from among the Great Lakes states of MN, WI, IL, IN, MI, OH, and NY to better document the occurrence of these species in space and time by imaging and providing online access to the information on the specimens of the critical organisms. Several initiatives are already in place to alert citizens to the dangers of spreading aquatic invasives among our nation's waterways, but this project will develop complementary scientific and educational tools for scientists, students, wildlife officers, teachers, and the public who have had little access to images or data derived directly from preserved specimens collected over the past three centuries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This bi-national Thematic Collections Network of &gt;25 institutions from eight states and Canada will digitize 1.73 million historical specimens representing 2,550 species of exotic fish, clams, snails, mussels, algae, plants, and their look-alikes documented to occur in the Great Lakes Basin. It is one of the first efforts to digitize liquid preserved specimens and to integrate cross-kingdom taxa and these methods could become national standards for cross taxon digitization. Students will be provided with hands-on experience in modern methods of specimen curation and this cross-taxon network will provide greater flexibility to existing web platforms for integration of data. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was undertake to document  all plant and fish speciens held at Field Museum that were listed as either invasive or potential invasive specimens for the Great Lakes Basin.  To this end we have digitzed 67,500 herbarium specimens and 20,500 (representing 4700 lots) fish collections,  Taxonomic reviews were done of all species using the following resources, FNA (Flora of North America, USDA Plant List, ITIS (Integrated Taxonomic Information System), and, The Plant List.    The museum's Collections Management System, EMu, is the repository for all specimen and image data.  Georefercing of all collections was completed for all 50 states as well as all Canadian provinces using GEOLocate, a platform for georeferencing natural history collections date.  GEOLocate is embedded in EMu making the transfer of data seamless.  In collaboration with staff from the Morton Arboretum, the N. W. Harris Learning Collection Administrator at the Field Museum developed an expereince box, Great Lakes Invasives.  This consists of  a specimens list as well as the supporting curricular materials including objecta cards and an experience box activity guide consisting of an introduction, content background, three activities, student resources, and museum connections. The activities in the guide are recommended for grades 9-12 but can be adapted for use in grades 6-8.  Teachers can borrow from either the Field Museum or the Morton Arboretum for ease of transport to the entire metro region.  All specimens from this project maybe accessed at the Field Museum website: https://www.fieldmuseum.org/ and, for the entire project at:  http://greatlakesinvasives.org/portal/index.php       Last Modified: 07/16/2018       Submitted by: Christine Niezgoda]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
