<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2014 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Joel B. Lewis is "Combinatorics of Factorizations, Singer Cycles, and Coxeter Elements." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Minnesota, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Victor Reiner.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Reflection groups arise in many branches of mathematics as collections of symmetries of highly symmetric objects, such as the cube and other regular polyhedra.  They generalize the symmetric group of permutations of a finite set, and have as an analogue the finite groups of classical type, that arise as symmetries of finite vector spaces (rather than real Euclidean space).  The purpose of the funded research was to study reflection groups and the finite general linear group from the perspectives of enumerative and algebraic combinatorics, investigating structural properties and exploring counting problems.  The award supported research that led to nine published papers, available to the public through the website arxiv.org or from the publishers.  Each of these works advanced the understanding of real reflection groups or of the finite general linear groups.  Collectively, they shed substantial new light on the structure of these groups and how individual symmetries may be decomposed as products of reflections; on enumerative questions that connect the classical combinatorics of rook theory (which dates to the 1940s) with modern developments in coding theory and the positive part of the Grassmannian; and in the representation theory of the affine symmetric group.  These contributions have already played an important role in subsequent work by other authors on these subjects.  In addition to the research conducted by the awardee, the grant funded outreach to the public at the University of Minnesota Math &amp; Science Family Fun Fair and the training of promising young mathematicians via the UMN-Twin Cities Combinatorics Research Experience for Undergraduates summer program.
