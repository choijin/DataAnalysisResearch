<AbstractNarration>This project, at the University of California-San Diego, will develop a model for computer science classes at large research universities that incorporates lessons from both MOOCs and high-touch classes at small institutions.  The project team will use a combination of lecture, tutors, teaching assistants (TAs), flipped classroom, and peer instruction within the large class setting.  The goal is to determine if this approach will lead to the benefits of the high-touch small class approach within the large class large institution setting, with concomitant improvement in performance and retention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will include the creation of micro-classes within a large single-instructor course.  The micro-classes will be facilitated through the involvement of teaching assistants and tutors, while also leveraging prior experience with peer instruction.  The large course will be taught by a single lead instructor, while each micro-class will include 15-25 students and have a dedicated teaching assistant and several dedicated undergraduate tutors.  Students will be grouped in their micro-classes when they attend the course lectures, and then have smaller discussion sessions within the micro-class grouping.  During these discussion sessions, student will work on interactive exercises, challenge problems, and extensions of the material covered in lecture.  In addition, students will receive extensive personalized feedback on their assignments, provided by the tutors, much like the feedback typically received by students in small classes at small colleges.  Project evaluation will include study of student attitudes, TA and tutor attitudes, student performance on exams, course outcomes such as failure and drop rates, retention of women and underrepresented minority students, and performance in subsequent classes.  This project will be funded by the Division of Undergraduate Education through the IUSE program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Computer science (CS) enrollments have skyrocketed, and undergraduate students at large research universities typically find themselves in large, impersonal classes with 200 or more students.  This project explored ways of improving student experiences in these large CS classrooms through a variety of class changes.  The primary change we explored was what we named "microclasses", a technique of dividing up a large class into smaller groups, each with a dedicated team of graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants, that would sit together during lecture and attend discussion together.  We compared a microclasses implementation of a sophomore/junior level CS course to an implementation taught in a more traditional format by the same instructor in the same term.  We found that the microclasses structure gave students a stronger sense of community than the traditional structure, but that this stronger sense of community did not translate into higher academic outcomes such as grades or retention, either within the class itself, or later in the students? undergraduate career.   Because of the relatively resource-intensive structure of the microclasses format, we also explored other smaller changes including one-on-one tutoring opportunities, having specific course staff assigned to regions of classrooms, and assigned seating.   These lighter-weight techniques had a similar (though sometimes less prominent) impact on students? sense of community as the full microclasses structure. The findings from our project add to the growing knowledge on creating an effective and inclusive classroom in computer science.  We found that our interventions were effective in increasing students? sense of community, but learned that this increased sense of community in a single class is not enough to create immediate or lasting change in students? academic performance or trajectory.  From a broader impact perspective, our lightweight techniques for building community are relatively easy to implement in any CS classroom.  Were these techniques to be implemented broadly across many classes starting early in a CS program, it is possible that the increases in students? sense of belonging would cause more students, particularly those from groups underrepresented in computing, to form the social structures that would help keep them in a computing major.
