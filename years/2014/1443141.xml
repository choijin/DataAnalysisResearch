<AbstractNarration>Name:Sethu&lt;br/&gt;Proposal#:1149059&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research targeted at developing miniaturized, portable cell sorting technologies for isolation of white blood cells (WBCs) containing analytic, diagnostic or therapeutic value with minimal isolation process induced changes (activation) is proposed. Commonly used sorting techniques for isolation of WBCs, rely on the use of antibody and centrifugation -based methods which are associated with cell activation. This project introduces two new techniques that exploit physical and charge based attributes of cells in conjunction with fluid flow phenomenon that develop in microfluidic channels to sort and separate cells. The first technique exploits differences in cell mass density in conjunction with inertial forces using density mismatched fluids in high-aspect ratio microfluidic channels. This technique is suitable for sorting sub-populations of WBCs (i.e.) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from polymorphonuclear cells (PNMs) in an automated format. The second technique relies on differences in cell surface energy to cause initial sorting via phase partitioning and then amplifies this separation using inertial forces in microchannels. This technique will be used to sort specific cellular populations like activated WBCs and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in circulation. Exclusive reliance on flow phenomenon and physical/charge attributes for discrimination into subpopulations ensures minimal cell loss or artifactual activation. Both of these techniques are fast, reliable, require minimal user intervention and are suitable for use in medical or resource limited settings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integral to the success of this project are education and outreach activities seeking to stimulate the interest and increase the participation of minorities and underrepresented groups in STEM fields. This will be achieved through the expansion and enrichment of a partnership previously established with Central HS, a historically minority institution with 87% minority enrollment and 60% female enrollment. Outreach goals will be accomplished through long-term efforts focused on engaging underrepresented students early, during their HS and undergraduate training. Students within the medical magnet program at Central HS will be introduced to bioengineering and career opportunities through seminars; intellectually engaged via research demonstrations and hands-on activities; motivated through interactions with successful professionals in academia and industry (role models); introduced to scholarship and financial aid programs and offered opportunities to participate in paid research activities. During their research experience, students will receive individual mentorship from undergraduate students from the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) and the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) to establish a supportive peer community. Undergraduate research positions will be offered to incoming freshman from underrepresented groups, with priority given to students from Central HS enrolling at the University of Louisville. Complimentary to these activities, the PI will work with two local HS science teachers to create STEM modules on microfluidics as learning tools to enhance understanding of fundamental concepts in science. These learning modules already validated at Walden School will be implemented at Central HS and other schools within the Jefferson County Public School System (JCPS). Research-based learning will also be integrated into all courses taught at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Finally, a laboratory website will be maintained to expose activities in the lab to the local community and others, serve as a recruitment tool and disseminate research and outreach outcomes</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The stated goals of this project were to accomplish realization of miniaturized, portable cell sorting technologies for isolation of white blood cells (WBCs) or other nucleated cell types in blood that contain analytic, diagnostic or therapeutic value with minimal &lsquo;isolation process&rsquo; induced changes (activation). Commonly used sorting techniques for isolation of WBCs, rely on the use of antibody and centrifugation -based methods which are associated with cell activation. To accomplish this we developed two unique microfluidics based protocols. Microfluidics involves precise manipulation of fluids in devices that have sub-millimeter size channels and features. Microfluidics has been commonly used to either to <strong>(a)</strong> enhance conventional macroscale approaches via orders of magnitude improvements in costs, speed, stress and efficiency or <strong>(b)</strong> enable completely new protocols that exploit scaling phenomena that occur at the microscale. The first protocol combined two phenomena that have shown promise in the microscale for cell sorting to develop a new method called inertia enhanced phase partitioning. Phase partitioning can be used to separate cells with differences in cell surface energy. However the separation distances are very small to enable efficient fractionation. By combining phase partitioning with inertial focusing, we show that the separation distance of cells initially separated by phase partitioning can be amplified by inertial forces to ensure ease of fractionation. We demonstrated proof of concept using beads and then demonstrated the utility of this technique to deplete &gt; 99% red blood cells and attain &gt; 99% efficiency in the isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) present at low abundance in whole blood (1 in 1 x 10<sup>9</sup> cells). The second protocol involved miniaturizing conventional density gradient centrifugation using microfluidics to ensure a more rapid separation protocol where the levels of stress that cells are exposed to be significantly lower. After demonstration of proof of concept with beads, we showed that this approach can be used to separate peripheral blood mononuclear cells from whole blood within 5 minutes with significantly lower stress which resulted in efficient separation and minimal isolation process induced activation. This project has resulted in training of 3 graduate students, 15 undergraduate students and ~ 30 high school students. We published 6 manuscripts, 8 conference abstracts and contributed to several senior design projects and high school science fair projects based on work performed as part of this grant.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/04/2018<br>      Modified by: Palaniappan&nbsp;Sethu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443141/1443141_10174036_1538673338076_TOCimage--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443141/1443141_10174036_1538673338076_TOCimage--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Inertia Enhanced Phase Partitioning"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443141/1443141_10174036_1538673338076_TOCimage--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Inertia Enhanced Phase Partitioning"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematic of the setup and performance of the device used for inertia enhanced phase partitioning of PMMA beads from PS beads</div> <div class="imageCredit">LOC</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Palaniappan&nbsp;Sethu</div> <div class="imageTitle">Inertia Enhanced Phase Partitioning</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443141/1443141_10174036_1538673435195_MOLT-3pass1revised--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443141/1443141_10174036_1538673435195_MOLT-3pass1revised--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CTC separation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443141/1443141_10174036_1538673435195_MOLT-3pass1revised--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CTC separation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Results from experiments where circulating tumor cells (MOLT-3) were fractionated from whole blood</div> <div class="imageCredit">LOC</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Palaniappan&nbsp;Sethu</div> <div class="imageTitle">CTC separation</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443141/1443141_10174036_1538673520881_Fig4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443141/1443141_10174036_1538673520881_Fig4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Microfluidic Density Gradient Centrifugation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443141/1443141_10174036_1538673520881_Fig4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Microfluidic Density Gradient Centrifugation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Proof-of-concept studies showing microfluidic density gradient centrifugation can indeed separated beads based on differences in density.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Bioengineering</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Palaniappan&nbsp;Sethu</div> <div class="imageTitle">Microfluidic Density Gradient Centrifugation</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443141/1443141_10174036_1538673596256_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443141/1443141_10174036_1538673596256_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Microfluidic Density Gradient Centrifugation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1443141/1443141_10174036_1538673596256_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Microfluidic Density Gradient Centrifugation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Setup used to demonstrate microfluidic density gradient centrifugation with blood</div> <div class="imageCredit">Biomedical Microdevices</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Palaniappan&nbsp;Sethu</div> <div class="imageTitle">Microfluidic Density Gradient Centrifugation</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
