<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this award is to provide partial support for selected graduate students studying in U.S. institutions to participate in the 4M/ICOMM 2015 International Conference on Micromanufacturing that will be held in Milan, Italy, March 31-April 2, 2015. This is a premiere global conference on micromanufacturing expected to draw attendance of 150-300 people from America, Europe and Asia. The venue is the co-location of annual conferences of the International Institute for Micromanufacturing (I2M2) and the 4M Association, convening together the worldwide community of micromanufacturing experts.  The 4M/ICOMM serves as a platform for exchange of ideas in the field of micromanufacturing and micro-engineering.  It is important to train our next generation of engineers and researchers with a global perspective. This is critical in providing a complete education and high-level perspective to the future industrial leaders and academicians the US students will become.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fourteen graduate students will receive partial support to attend 4M/ICOMM 2015 to learn about the latest research progress and challenges in micro-manufacturing, and to present papers they coauthored.  These students will get an opportunity to network and exchange ideas with leading researchers and engineers from worldwide academe, industrial and governmental facilities, as well as the opportunity to visit with companies involved with micromanufacturing in Europe.  In addition to nurturing a global micromanufacturing vision, participants will learn the latest research areas and results in the fields of micromanufacturing.  This experience will be very valuable to the selected participants in developing their careers in the manufacturing field. The funding opportunity will be broadly announced giving students ample notice and time to apply. Applications will be reviewed by the conference scientific committee. A total of fourteen students will be partially supported from this award which will help offset expenses for travel, conference registration, and lodging.  Each recipient of NSF financial support to attend 4M/ICOMM 2015 must be an author or a co-author of a paper that is accepted for the conference.  A short statement on the participant's vision on micromanufacturing will be requested along with a CV as a part of the selection criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Partial travel support was provided to eleven students studying at U.S. academic institutions as conference participants at the 2015 4M/International Conference on Micromanufacturing, which was held in Milan, Italy on March 31-April 2, 2015.  In addition, partial travel support was provided to seventeen students studying at U.S. academic institutions as conference participants at the 2016 International Conference on Micromanufacturing, which was held in Irvine, CA, March 29-31, 2016.  All students receiving NSF travel support gave excellent presentations and submitted high quality papers.  This is evident by the ?best paper? award of the 4M/ICOMM2015 conference being awarded for the paper of one of the seven students presenting their paper in podium format.  The poster competition was also very competitive in that two students were awarded ?best poster presentation?, with the other students close behind.  For the ICOMM 2016 conference, one of the three outstanding student presentation awards went to one of the seventeen students supported with NSF travel funds.  The dissemination of both the 4M/ICOMM 2015 and ICOMM 2016 conference technical information was distributed to registered conference attendees in a form of a USB drive and for 4M/ICOMM 2015 a printed format of the proceedings was also provided.  In addition, the 4M/ICOMM 2015 proceedings are available online with abstracts (freely accessible) and full papers (fee-based access only) at: (http://rpsonline.com.sg/proceedings/9789810946098/html/copyright.html).  The impact on the development of the project?s primary discipline (micromanufacturing) and other disciplines was in providing graduate students greater opportunities for networking and exchange of ideas with other researchers which should enhance likelihood of future innovation and cross-cutting possibilities. This experience is also very valuable to the selected participants in developing their careers in the manufacturing field.   The project?s impact on the development of human resources was the training of our next generation of engineers and researchers with a global perspective. These conferences provided the selected graduate students with opportunities to exchange ideas with leading researchers and engineers from worldwide academe, industrial and governmental facilities, as well as the opportunity to visit with companies involved with micromanufacturing in Europe, tour of university laboratories and manufacturing facilities, and experience the arts (conference organized tours and receptions held within museums and musical performances).  Nurturing a global micromanufacturing vision, participants learned of the latest research areas and results in the fields of micromanufacturing, and were provided live demonstrations by many of the sponsors showing advanced manufacturing and measuring machines in operation and industrial implementations.  For the impact on society beyond science and technology, young researchers and engineers gained experience with domestic and/or international travel and broadened their cultural exposure.
