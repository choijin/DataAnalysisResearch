<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be to provide a new and improved molecular characterization tool to be used with mass spectrometers for applications in biotechnology, pharmaceutical, forensic, clinical, environmental, food, and material sciences. Disruptive discoveries of new ionization technology for mass spectrometry in the 1980's had a major impact on the advancement of science and fueled new business opportunities. In this proposal, new ionization technology for characterization of material using mass spectrometry is being commercialized. The ionization process converts molecules, regardless of size or volatility, to gas-phase ions without the need for high voltage or lasers used in current methods. Only the vacuum inherent with all mass spectrometers, and an appropriate small molecule matrix compound, is needed for ionization.  This technology is potentially transformative providing ease-of-use, reduced cost, and reliability with high potential for advancing science through improved measurement technologies. These attributes are expected to have the greatest impact in clinical laboratories, field portable mass spectrometers, and bio-threat detection.  The high sensitivity, simplicity, ease-of-use, low-cost, high-throughput capabilities and unique applications suggest high commercial potential in the $4 billion per year mass spectrometer market. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase I project proposes to deliver a prototype ion source for mass spectrometry based a novel ionization technology that transfers small or macromolecules from solution or solid phases to gas-phase ions using only heat and/or sub-atmospheric pressure.  When combined with mass spectrometry, this technology provides a simple yet powerful means of characterizing materials directly from surfaces, such as biological tissue or polymeric films, in a manner that was previously not possible. Certain small molecule compounds when mixed with minute quantities of analyte and exposed to the vacuum inherent with any mass spectrometer spontaneously produces gas-phase ions of the analyte. The knowledge achieved in fundamental studies will be applied to design, construct, and assemble a first generation multifunctional ionization platform to reproducibly introduce samples and materials to the vacuum environment for manual or high throughput analyses.  Means to rapidly characterize micron size surface defects/changes in biological materials (e.g., tissue, ansd microbial communities) will be developed without a laser.  The products of this endeavor will provide new methods for materials characterization which, like other new ionization technology for mass spectrometry, will result in discoveries that advance knowledge in widely divergent areas of science.</AbstractNarration>

During the early stages of the Phase I project based on feedback from potential customers, ease of breaking into the market, and validation studies of the three newly discovered ionization technologies, MSTM, LLC, a newly formed university start-up company, selected matrix-assisted ionization (MAI) for development into the first commercial product.  MAI requires only that a sample in a proprietary small molecule matrix compound be exposed to the vacuum of the mass spectrometer.  No high energy source is needed to achieve conversion of volatile, nonvolatile, low- (e.g., drugs, lipids), and high-mass compounds (e.g. proteins, synthetic polymers) to gas-phase ions.   An initial goal of the project was an automated rapid analysis method.  However, it was discovered that the speed of analysis using MAI is limited by the extended time ions from a sample were observed after exposure to the vacuum of the mass spectrometer.  Research to eliminate this rate limiting issue led to the discovery of the cause of this carryover problem and a means to eliminate it.  The solution involved use of a syringe to deliver the sample directly into the vacuum of the mass spectrometer, which also simplified the method and increased its sensitivity (lower amounts detectable). The commercial platform has sensitivity equivalent to nano-ESI, the previous gold standard for ionization directly from atmospheric pressure, but nanoESI is far more difficult to implement. By the conclusion of the Phase I project, a multi-ionization mode commercial platform was introduced at the American Society for Mass Spectrometry conference held in Saint Louis in June, 2015.

This process is unexpected, and previously unknown, leading us to believe that it will have broad ramifications in science.  The impact of the previously discovered ionization processes of electrospray ionization and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization were immense, earning the inventors a share of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.  Because the ionization methods of this project have attributes of both of these older ionization methods, and are easier to use and cheaper to manufacture, we expect broad impact from commercialization of these novel ionization methods.
