<AbstractNarration>Semantic technologies, Linked Open Data, and knowledge representation formalisms such as the Web Ontology Language OWL are beginning to play increasingly important roles across a broad range of applications. There is an urgent need for the advanced training of graduate students to conduct research in this area and to prepare them for academic or industrial careers. Participation in premier research conferences in the area is an essential element of such training. This project will provide funds to subsidize the travel expenses of 6 students at U.S. universities to attend the 2014 Web Reasoning and Rules Systems conference, RR2014, and the 2014 Reasoning Web Summer School, which will be held September 8-17 in Athens, Greece. Broader impacts of the project include: Enhanced opportunities for training and mentoring of US-based graduate students in Semantic Web and related areas, broadening the participation of students from groups (women and minorities) that are currently under-represented in Computer Science in general, and Semantic Web in particular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Web Reasoning and Rule Systems conference series, established in 2007, and the annual Reasoning Web Summer School series, attract the leading researchers in the field of Web Reasoning, and offer a venue for presentation of the latest advances in the field. Covered topics include ontology modeling languages, e.g., RDF, OWL, and RIF, which enable the inference of implicit knowledge from knowledge that is explicitly encoded in the knowledge base. Web Reasoning and related fields focus on the design, analysis, and development of ontology languages, study of their theoretical properties, and the design and implementation of effective inference algorithms. The co-location of the conference and summer school provides for an excellent venue for the training of graduate students. In addition to attending the invited and contributed talks at the conference, and the summer school, the students will benefit from individualized mentoring by established researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project webpage: http://pascal-hitzler.de/projects/rr2014.html</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The 8th International  Conference on Web Reasoning and Rule Systems (RR 2014) took place in Athens, Greece,  September 15-17, 2014. RR is a relatively novel conference  series that started in 2007 with an event in Innsbruck, Austria and has  continued since then annually with conferences held in the USA, twice in  Germany, twice in Austria, and in Italy. RR's  steering committee consist of several high-profile researchers  (http://www.rr-conference.org/) that continue to push the conference  forward and aim at establishing it as a top-tier conference on web scale  reasoning.   The 10th Reasoning Web Summer School (RW 2014) was co-located with RR 2014, September 8-13, 2014. It is a well-established and prominent summer school which each draws very prominent lecturers in the field.    Web-scale reasoning and knowledge  representation and reasoning in general are of increasing importance for  so called knowledge graphs and next-generation data infrastructures.  They facilitate the publication, discovery, reuse, and integration of  data from heterogeneous sources. By providing human and machine  understandable and reason-able descriptions of data, these technologies  are underlying many of the most advanced knowledge-based systems  currently developed in research. Examples of such systems include  question answering digital personal assistants or large-scale knowledge  federation systems.     The RR conference series is especially well suited for  graduate students at all levels of their career; this is for several  reasons: (I) the conference follows a single track strategy, thereby  allowing students to attend all presentations; (II) RR offers a poster  and demo session for early results as well as applications of rule and  reasoning technologies; (III) the conference features a doctoral  consortium. The RW summer school series is targeted directly to graduate students.         The NSF funding provided by this  project enabled 5 US-based graduate students to travel to the events in Greece, to present their papers, attend the summer school, and/or discuss  with their colleagues and  learn from the leading senior researchers in  their field.
