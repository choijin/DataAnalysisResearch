<AbstractNarration>At the University of California, Riverside (UCR), scientists are using a high-speed network known as a "science demilitarized zone" or DMZ to keep their massive science data flowing between collaborators on and off campus.  Funded by the NSF, the UCR-DMZ is a ?private? high-bandwidth network that enables (i) new ways of collaborating; (ii) collection of data at much higher resolution; (iii) entirely new data-intensive projects; (iv) a much larger number of Big Data projects, including student research. The UCR-DMZ uses Air Blown Fiber (ABF) optical fiber -- high-bandwidth strands literally blown through conduits -- that allow low-cost addition of future capacity. The network prepares UCR?s Cyberinfrastructure for an anticipated 40% growth in faculty in the next five years, along with growth in data-per-faculty-member. The UCR-DMZ supports data-intensive research that includes underground cameras to monitor soil biological activity in real time, insect identification based on wing-beat data, dissemination of gravitational models of the Universe, video bioinformatics, next generation DNA sequencing, Internet performance prediction, and sustainable energy projects.  Research data is being archived by UCR?s libraries.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Terabyte datasets are increasingly routine for many UCR labs. UCR-DMZ offers a 1) a "friction free" network path devoted to research, not competing with day-to-day business and enterprise computing; 2) high-performance Data Transfer Nodes (DTNs) with instrumentation, hardware and operating system optimized end-to-end for data transfer; and 3) performance monitoring using measurement/test nodes in a PERFormance Service Oriented Network monitoring Architecture (perfSONAR).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   A high speed, low latency research network with 4 to 8 times the available bandwidth of previously available networks was installed at the University of California, Riverside.          The key accomplishment of this project is centered around the installation of the Science DMZ Core and Border chassis that provide 160Gbps (4 x 40Gbps) link between them.  The Border router is connected to the CENIC backbone at 100Gbps.  A typical researcher can access port speeds at either N x 10Gbps or N x 40Gbps.  Connections between research sites and the Science DMZ Core are at N x 40Gbps with the number of links available to be driven by the researcher?s requirements.  Currently, there are several research sites connected to the Science DMZ Core.  The Institute for Integrative Genome Biology operates the Bioinformatics Facility which connects over a pair of 40Gbps links bonded as an 80Gbps path.  Another 80Gbps path connects the Winston Chung Hall server room, where multiple researchers from the College of Engineering and Computer Science are provided access to the Science DMZ Core.  Additionally, within the Campus Data Center, the Academic Co-Lo offers easy access to another 80Gbps path to the Science DMZ for those researchers who elect to place equipment within this shared facility.  Please see the attached diagram that shows all the current connections and summary of the research supported.
