<AbstractNarration>This request is to support a workshop that aims to assess the current status of Reactive Transport Modeling (RTM) usage within the Geochemical and Biogeochemical communities, to identify barriers, and to ultimately enhance communication between the modeling and experimental and field researcher communities. Proponents will invite 20 ? 25 researchers, include leading reactive transport code developers/users and leading geochemists and biogeochemists who are interested in including RTM in their research toolbox, to participate in a 2-day workshop in Washington, DC. The complexity and capacity of (bio)geochemical and hydrologic data collection have increased substantially over the past decade, while the accessibility of interpretive tools has not. As a consequence, there is a host of key questions regarding the fundamental coupling of biological, geochemical and hydrological process that can be uniquely addressed through the application of RTM approaches. The overall goal of this workshop is therefore to identify pathways that would facilitate the expansion of RTM approaches and concurrently build a strong community of users and developers. By addressing the systemic challenges in education and identifying key technical gaps, the broader impact of the workshop is a clear roadmap to ensure the widespread expansion of powerful modeling approaches that can capitalize on the era of expansive data to address new hypotheses in (bio)geochemical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Reactive transport models (RTMs) provide a unique opportunity to evaluate and quantify coupling of physical, chemical, and biological processes that operate in EarthÃ†s surface and near-surface environments, and influence the formation, operation, and evolution of Earth systems. Process coupling plays a pivotal role in governing low-temperature biogeochemical systems, including the conversion of rock to soil; release of nutrients from minerals for ecosystem vitality, contaminant reactive transport and bioremediation; and cycling of biogeochemically important elements. Data collection and analysis coupled with field observation continues to provide new insight into biogeochemical processes. At the same time, the complexity of both data collection and analytical techniques used in the biogeochemical sciences is increasing at a rapid pace, with large and complex datasets ("big data") generated at both laboratory and field scales.  These comprehensive field and experimental efforts can be substantially advanced through the use of modeling tools that enable integration between large and diverse data sets and mathematical descriptions of the underlying processes. Such models can then serve as a repository of knowledge that facilitates quantitative treatment of individual processes, while providing an invaluable window into overall system behavior.  Despite more than three decades of development and successful application of RTM approaches, widespread incorporation of RTM theory and methods into teaching and research programs has proceeded slowly. In this context, the National Science Foundation supported a workshop with the goal of expanding the use of RTM within the biogeosciences. This workshop considered three questions:  1)      What are key outstanding hypotheses in biogeochemical sciences that could be addressed with current RTM capabilities?  2)      What additional RTM capabilities would expand the scope of scientific hypotheses that could be addressed?  3)      What educational tools are critically needed but not widely available, and how should these be developed?  The discussions focused on identifying the research, educational, and infrastructure needs to support continued growth of RTM and RTM interfacing disciplines and across scales. Several research directions were highlighted.  RTM interfacing with hydrology: fully understand the coupling between water, reactive gases,  biogeochemical processes, and their drivers. The ability to routinely interface RTM frameworks with models that explicitly include hydrological processes is needed.  RTM interfacing with geomorphology: understand the role of chemical weathering in landscape evolution. The role of lithology, climate, and biota in landscape evolution still needs mechanistic theory.  Much research remains to develop geomorphic transport laws that explicitly account for reactive transport processes to understand and predict the coevolution of ecosystems and landscapes and the interaction of climate and landscapes. RTM interfacing with plant and soil sciences: Understanding the interactions among roots, microbes, organic carbon, water, and minerals in the rooting zone / rhizosphere. Model developments will involve adapting existing root models in the plant community and coupling them with existing RTMs that include explicit reaction networks and geomechnic processes so as to understand root zone biogeochemical process coupling. Detailed representation of soil carbon cycling in RTMs requires careful consideration of how best to represent the complex suite of organic compounds and associated parameters describing the turnover, transport and reactivity of those compounds. RTM interfacing with microbiology: model development incorporating and parameterizing data for elucidating mechanisms of microbial community response to biogeochemical forcing. Major conceptualization and model development are needed to link omic data that are direct signature of microbial community structu...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
