<AbstractNarration>The proposed project will support participation of Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE)  of pioneers in a Symposium to be held on September 7, 2014 at the High Country Conference Center, Flagstaff, Arizona. This special Symposium will precede the International Conference on Molecular Beam Epitaxy, which will take place from September 8 to 12, 2014. The MBE conference has taken place since 1978 and has provided a prominent international forum for reporting new developments in the areas of fundamental and applied molecular beam epitaxy research.. The Symposium will foster advances in the leading research on III-V semiconductors, by gathering a diverse group of experts, researchers and students. The program provides the opportunity to learn about the latest developments in fundamental and applied MBE research, synthesis of new materials, formation of novel heterostructures, and the development of innovative devices. III-V, II-VI, IV-VI and IV semiconductors are addressed including wide bandgap materials, nanowires and quantum dots and various other novel devices. Technological advances of the semiconductors addressed in the Symposium offer the means to meet the increasing demand for higher performance devices with multiple functionalities, in support of communications and sensing applications. Further dissemination will be provided with a presentation of Symposium papers in the Journal of Crystal Growth.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Title: "Meeting with MBE Pioneers", a Special Symposium held at the International Conference on Molecular Beam Epitaxy on September 7, 2014         Overview: The International Conference on Molecular Beam Epitaxy held in Flagstaff, Arizona, September 7-12, 2014 successfully provided a prominent international forum for researchers in the area of fundamental and applied molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth.  The conference included 432 attendees from 24 countries and a contributed technical program that featured 90 oral presentations in three parallel sessions and 143 poster presentations in three poster sessions, with more than 60% of the contributed presentations given by students.  In addition, there were 3 plenary talks, 16 invited presentations, and 26 vendor exhibits.  The one day special symposium "Meeting with MBE Pioneers" (Sunday, September 7, 2014) vividly delivered the legendary history of some of the most prominent MBE pioneers, capturing the history and personal reflections of these researchers during the development, evolution, and use of the technology.  They shared their valuable experience with the community and most importantly with students and junior researchers.           Intellectual Merit: This one day special symposium advanced knowledge by bringing together pioneers, experts, junior researchers, and students from all over the world to interact and exchange ideas in the area of MBE materials growth and the devices this technology enables.  The conference provided a prominent international forum for reporting new developments in the areas of fundamental and applied MBE research, including advances in the technique, synthesis of new materials, discovery of new physical properties, formation of novel heterostructures, and the development of innovative devices.  The technical program included the fundamentals of MBE, the latest developments in III-V, II-VI, IV-VI, and IV semiconductors, oxides, nitrides, and wide gap materials, nanowires, quantum dots, spintronics, emerging materials, heterogeneous epitaxy, devices, and production MBE.           Broader Impacts: This activity benefited society by advancing the knowledge base of materials and devices grown by MBE that are urgently needed for present and future engineering grand challenges, such as III-V, II-VI, IV-VI, IV semiconductors, oxides, nitrides, wide gap semiconductors, nanowires, quantum dots, spintronics, emerging materials, and heterogeneous epitaxy.  The activity advanced discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning by bringing together pioneers, researchers, and students with broad areas of expertise to understand and discover the fundamentals of MBE materials growth and the novel devices enabled by these materials.  Moreover, the activity added value by enhancing science and technology through broader dissemination and understanding via face-to-face interaction at the one day symposium and the conference technical sessions with the results published in the internationally renowned Journal of Crystal Growth.  In this special issue (Volume 425, Pages 1-400), 91 papers associated with the conference presentations are published.  The papers reflect the breadth of the meeting, showing continued progress in MBE fundamentals, elemental and compound semiconductors, oxides and novel materials, nanostructured materials, and devices.  These publications provide a valuable snapshot of the MBE field at this time, and enable future success in MBE-related research.
