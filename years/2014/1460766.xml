<AbstractNarration>The Mathematics Department at Texas A&amp;M University (College Station) will continue their REU Site (Undergraduate Research in the Mathematical Sciences and their Applications), now entering its 16th year. This program provides a novel and accessible entry for undergraduates interested in modern mathematical research.  Three parallel summer programs, led by 4 active researchers, will introduce the students to topics chosen from neural codes, algorithms for solving polynomial equations, biochemical reaction networks, complexity theory, models of immune response, and number theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site is organized around three parallel sessions with different emphases: (1) algebraic methods in computational biology, (2) algorithmic algebraic geometry, and (3) number theory. These thematic areas link naturally with numerous applications in science and engineering, and are of great theoretical interest as well. Students participating in this REU Site will enhance their training as future research scientists by being at a major research university that is also supportive and collegial. Participants will present their results to the entire REU cohort in a locally held conference. They will be encouraged to present at national conferences (e.g., MAA Math Fest, special sessions at AMS meetings), and to publish their results in professional journals. The PIs seek a diverse group of participants and priority will be given to students for whom research opportunities are limited.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Aim. The aim of this REU program is to provide outstanding undergraduate students, including those who might otherwise not have access to a strong research environment, an intense and carefully mentored eight-week summer research experience with leading researchers in computational biology, algorithmic algebraic geometry, topological quantum computation, and number theory, in a welcoming environment that encourages students to pursue careers and/or graduate study in disciplines in the mathematical sciences.   Outcomes. During summers 2015, 2016, and 2017, a total of 41 undergraduates (including 21 women) participated in the REU.  Many of these students are now pursuing Ph.D.'s in mathematics or other STEM areas, including 7 students (including 4 women) who were awarded prestigious NSF Graduate Fellowships.   During the REU, participants gained experience in mathematical research and communication.  This was accomplished in part through participating in workshops on preparing and giving talks, writing mathematics, pursuing graduate studies, and career skills in the mathematical sciences.     The research initiated at the REU resulted in 14 peer-reviewed research articles, including in top journals such as Journal of Number Theory, Journal of Symbolic Computation, and SIAM Journal on Applied Algebra and Geometry.  Additionally, 2 more manuscripts have been submitted for publication. Finally, all participants gave talks on their research, and many presented posters and gave talks at regional or national conferences.
