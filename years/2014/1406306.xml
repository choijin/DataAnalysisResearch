<AbstractNarration>We will explore how organisms respond and adapt to complex, stressful environments by examining the gene activity of a marine invertebrate, the copepod Tigriopus californicus. When challenged with copper, temperature and salinity stress, we observe different levels of survivorship: more individuals from a southern population are likely to survive than from a northern population. We will compare the set of active genes (RNA) specific to the responses of two populations under both single and combined stress. This research explores the consequences of general and specific stress responses: we hypothesize that some genes respond to just one stress while other genes are part of a shared response system. Interaction between these responses could reduce the effect of an additional stress or compound the problem. In resilient and vulnerable populations, we will observe differences in gene activity that may explain how they try to adapt to multiple challenges. Linking the results of this project with genetic analyses will frame adaptation and stress-tolerance, comparing both the gene and its activity response. This project will answer critical questions about how species deal with stressful environments that present simultaneous challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exploring population-wide variation and the context of stressful natural environments will be key to understanding organism-habitat interactions, and is increasingly important in light of climate changes. Integrative approaches that identify these compounded responses and the biological mechanisms at play will provide a robust context for understanding the effects of pollution and contamination. This research will also identify genetic activity that makes one population more resilient than another in complex environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This DDIG grant aimed to develop transcriptomes for an intertidal copepod, Tigriopus californicus, under stressful and control conditions. In previous work, we established that five populations of T. californicus have different levels of survivorship under high temperature stress, copper stress and high and low salinity stress.  We compared survival of individuals from these populations under stressful challenges and under combinations of these stressors. Characterizing responses to each of these stressors helps predict how populations survive under stress that continually changes in intertidal habitats. Additionally, comparing combinations of stressors that co&shy;occur in nature and ones that are only observed under experimental conditions, allows us to explore general and stress-specific responses. (Figure 1.)  Individuals from southern groups were more likely to survive thermal stress and high salinity stress. After acute exposure to combined thermal and high salinity stress, as might occur in tidepools, T. californicus individuals from San Diego, California, (SD) had higher survivorship than those from northern populations, Santa Cruz, California, (SC) and Friday Harbor Labs (FHL) near Seattle, Washington. (Figure 2.)  Combined high salinity stress and thermal stress produced mortality levels beyond the rates predicted by each stressor alone, indicating a synergistic interaction.  Likewise, combined thermal and copper stress produced lower proportions of active individuals from a northern population (Strawberry Hill, SH, Oregon), compared to a southern population (Laguna Beach, LB, California).  In this combination as well, we detected a synergistic interaction between the stressors for SH. (Figure 3.)  Synergistic or at least additive interactions under combinations of thermal and other stressors were generally found across experiments: we found no cases of antagonistic interactions, in which exposure to a second stress would confer some protection against a first stressor.  These findings are consistent with previous work on combined stress in Daphnia and other model systems. For an intertidal copepod particularly adapted to thermal and salinity stress, and extremely tolerant of copper stress, synergistic interactions between habitat stressors are an important factor in survival.  RNA was extracted from small groups of copepods in each stress condition, from each population, and divided by sex and survivorship outcome, to give a snapshot of the expression levels of stress-response mechanisms.  Transcriptomic comparisons of surviving and compromised males and females from each population are underway.  We plan to identify transcripts up-regulated and down-regulated under each stress individually and in combination to compare general and stress specific responses as well as differences between populations with both high and low tolerance.  Intellectual Merit: Dedicated studies of stress-interactions have been largely underdeveloped in non-model systems.  When multiple-stress challenges were performed on organisms, few studies completed the analysis with an analysis of interaction levels, and yet fewer completed this on multiple populations with different tolerance levels.  Linking the physiological results of mortality and activity assays with transcriptomic data is a key feature of this research.  Not only does this work examine interaction effects, it makes substantial links between previous research, integrating transcriptomic stress-responses, genomic data and mortality assays.  Broader Impacts: Research efforts funded by this grant included undergraduate training in experimental assays and data analysis.  These students, including one female underrepresented minority student, are now using their skills in medical school work and in the USC environmental science program.  This grant also provided doctoral student Helen Foley with valuable experience in implementing experiments that take advantage of next-generation sequencing methods, including RNA-handling techniques, library preparation and sequence analysis.  As a member of an underrepresented minority in science (Costa Rica, Central America), she has been a role model to others considering academic careers. She attended the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) Conference in Los Angeles in 2014, and plans to attend the next conference in 2016.  Through SACNAS, she has been able to network with undergraduates pursuing careers in science and considering graduate school, as well as postdocs and professors in her field, giving her unique opportunities as both a mentor and mentee as she progesses through her academic preparation.  Through volunteer work with the Aquarium of the Pacific (AOP) in Long Beach, California, Helen presented research on evolution to salinity tolerance to aquarium educators and developed an interactive activity on DNA and genetic traits for students in K-12. She was able to adapt this activity for Spanish-speaking audiences as well as preschoolers and adults of many educational backgrounds.
