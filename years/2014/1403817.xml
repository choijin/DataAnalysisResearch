<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 1403817&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Roukes, Michael L.&lt;br/&gt;Title: Biophotonic neural probes for studying the brain's immune response&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significance and Importance: An award is made to Caltech to engender new tools for studying the immune response to a brain-machine interface in small mammals.   To develop the next generation of neural probes for massively parallel stimulation and recording, and facilitate advanced brain-machine interfaces, we must attain a better understanding of the brain's immune response to chronic neural implants. The existing state-of-the-art generally only enables such studies to be performed after an animal has been sacrificed. The technology developed through this research will merge the latest advances in nanobiophotonics, implantable neural probes, and state-of-the-art microfluidics to develop, fabricate, and test next-generation technology that will enable real-time monitoring of the immunogenic response of the brain to implanted neural probes, including the ability to perform real-time monitoring of the use of drug regimens to temper the immune response. The project provides an exceptional opportunity for training interdisciplinary scientists and engineers. In broader outreach, the researchers will collaborate with the Community Science Academy at Caltech to develop an iPAD-facilitated learning module for K-12 use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description: The overarching goal of the 3-year project will be the design and development neurochemical probes targeted to the detection of cytokines and chemokines in mice and other small animals. Year 1 will focus on demonstration of detection of targets of interest at concentrations of physiological relevance (100pg/mL to 10ng/mL) with photonic micro-ring resonators.  Year 2 will focus on the integration of photonic micro-ring resonators with etched microfluidics with dialysate membranes appropriate for the detection of specific chemokine and cytokine targets (a 100kDa molecular weight cut-off will be targeted).  Year 3 will focus on the development, fabrication, and calibration of neurochemical probes for use in vivo.  Evaluation and calibration of probes will be performed in 'tissue phantoms' made from agarose with dissolved chemokines and cytokines.  These will include both targets of interest and potential interferents.  We anticipate that by the end of this effort we will be able to provide at least 10 calibrated probes to each of the Siapas (Caltech), Tolias (Baylor College of Medicine) and Laurent (Max Planck Institute for Brain Research) neuroscience research groups for use in vivo. In this third phase we will also begin design discussions in the Alliance for Nanosystems VLSI (very-large-scale integration; co-founded by the PI in 2007) to transfer our Caltech-based fabrication processes to standardized production en masse within our partner's (CEA/LETI) micro-/nano-electronics foundry. The graduate student funded by this effort will learn to employ optical engineering, microfabrication techniques, and neuroscience in order to produce and employ advanced experimental measurement systems. In addition to graduate student education, undergraduate students will contribute to the project through the SURF and MURF (summer- and minority- undergraduate research) programs at Caltech.  The K-12 learning module developed as an outreach effort in collaboration with the Community Science Academy at Caltech will include a low-cost, portable, iPAD-interfaced refractometer and demonstration of total internal reflection for use in Pasadena Unified School District and Los Angeles Unified School District classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is being made jointly by two Programs- (1) Biophotonics, in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (Engineering Directorate), and (2) Instrument Development for Biological Research, in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Biological Sciences Directorate).</AbstractNarration>

The implantable neural probes developed using the funding from this grant have been developed using technology adopted from the semiconductor industry and applied to the aforementioned biological problem.  We employ micro- and nanofabrication techniques to create a miniscule silicon "needle" (less than one-tenth the size of a human hair), which contains a fluidic channel.  The needle can then be implanted into the brain without causing major trauma, and positioned to target a specific brain region to be sampled. The fluidic analytes harvested can be moved through the channel to the head of the probe. Intergrated into the probe head is an optical biosensor, which uses a integrated waveguide-based ring resonator to measure protein binding to the sensor, and thereby evaluate protein concentration from the sampled aliquot.  This biosensor is functionalized with a compound that specifically and selectively binds to a targeted protein of interest -- such as Interleukin-1 (a protein associated with trauma, for example).  By this process, this system can be used to measure the changes in protein concentration after a stimulus perturbs the neural system, whether this pertubation arises from neuromechanical damage, the subject learning new tasks or information, or the addition of a pharmaceutical agent to the subject.  The principal outcome of this research is the development of these novel probes, which will be subsequently disseminated to the neuroscience community.  We have successfully developed fabrication protocols to facilitate reliable manufacturing of these probes, and have developed the protocols to make biochemical measurements with these devices. We have also engineered interfaces between the microscale environment on the probe itself, and  the macroscopic lab environment at the benchtop.  The supplementary figures of this report show the resulting devices and packaging we have developed for use by the neuroscience community.
