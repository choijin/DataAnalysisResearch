<AbstractNarration>This award supports a doctoral dissertation research project that investigates the social and cultural effects of Post Soviet economic policies on indigenous communities in Kamchatka Russia.  By comparing traditional modes of transportation (the dog sled) with the Soviet subsidized mode of transportation (the snow machine) the researcher will examine how policies made in Moscow and enforced in Kamchatka had an effect on contemporary local decision-making and the economies of indigenous communities.  The project has the potential to increase our understanding of how 20th Century federal economic and social policies affect the trajectory of 21st Century local decision-making in a rapidly changing and globalizing economy.   In addition, this project will contribute to the training of the next generation of social scientists.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will compare the social, cultural, economic, and environmental implications of the choice between 'dogs vs. snow-machines' in subsistence and travel strategies by indigenous people.  Combining local histories with larger global impacts to identify the meaning and decision making processes that led to a decline in the use of sled dogs as a mode of transportation concurrent with the rise in snow machine use in rural communities and to their return as fossil fuel costs rise.  This project focuses on the socio-cultural and environmental implications of the choice between 'dogs vs. snow-machines' in subsistence and travel strategies in Kamchatka. The layers of social significance attached to these decisions is further emphasized by the fact that salmon is the "fuel" that powers both of those technologies.  Salmon has two profoundly different uses in this regard:  one as the protein/energy source ingested by dogs and the other as a commodity, where salmon roe is used to pay for fuel (often wasting the flesh).   This project will increase knowledge in the field of anthropology on northern communities and the political economy of Post-Soviet era globalization.   In addition, it will create a culture history of dog sledding in the north.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Title:  Northern Adaptations in Kamchatka:  Fishing for Dogs or Fishing for Snow Machines  The project aimed to study human-animal relations in two specific, interrelated cases: human-dog (specifically sled dog) and human-salmon relations, in rural Northern Kamchatka (Russian Far East) in the context of subsistence use as well as the market economy.

This interdisciplinary anthropological investigation focused on sedentary Koryak people (Nymylans), Native inhabitants of Northern Kamchatka whose livelihood depends heavily on salmon and, traditionally, also on their sled dogs.  The lives of humans, sled dogs and salmon in Northern Kamchatka are closely interrelated on several levels.

Until the advent of motorized winter travel in the 1970s, dog sleds were the only form of winter transportation. Besides being crucially important for a household?s economy, sleds dogs were and are, to a certain degree, also part of their human family; dogs used to play a central role in spiritual beliefs and practices, such as sacrifices.  In the years of severe economic hardship after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, people greatly depended on salmon as a resource for cash through the commodification of salmon roe for caviar. The poaching of salmon reached stock threatening levels and has only slowly been coming under control in recent years. The cash earned from poaching caviar was often invested into motorized mobility that was traditionally provided by sled dogs. Today, sled dogs are used as part of an income strategy that includes racing and tourism. Their feed still consists to a large degree of salmon.  Sustaining and taking care of a sled dog team is a very time consuming and / or financially intense occupation.

The sled dogs? economic importance is irrespective of the official economic framework or paradigm of the different time periods, predominantly subsistence based, market or socialist economy.  INTELLECTUAL MERIT  Human-animal relations as an interdisciplinary topic are currently studied by researchers of several disciplines; in anthropology, the discussion of the different possible relationships between animals and humans has been ignited by Tim Ingold?s analysis in Perception of the Environment (2000, pp. 61-76). The relationship between humans and sled dogs in Northern Kamchatka that were investigated by the project at hand does not readily fit in Ingold?s framework that dichotomizes domesticated and wild  nor is it covered within the wider interdisciplinary discourse on human-animal relations. The form of relationship that exists between sled dogs and humans in Northern Kamchatka should rather be considered a category of human-animal relationship on its own. The project described here contributes to the current discussion of what constitutes domestication by adding an understudied case that suggests an alternative form of domestication. In addition, this ethnographic study of sled dog keeping in Northern Kamchatka adds a contemporary account of living with salmon and sled dogs to the Kamchatkan record.   BROADER IMPACTS  The project at hand focused on studying the past and contemporary forms of the two human animal relations described above in both comparative and diachronic perspectives and demonstrates how the economic strategies and human-animal relations that helped people to survive in the past can still be a viable route for well-being in the modern world.
