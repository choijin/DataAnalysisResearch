<AbstractNarration>Gabriel Caruntu is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) and EPSCoR programs in a CAREER award investigating the survival of ferroelectricity and geometrical ordering of the polarization at sub-micrometer length scales. These still remain elusive despite the tremendous increase in the technological importance of ferroelectric ceramics in the past decades. This CAREER project is aimed at developing a robust predictive methodology of polar ordering in nanoscale perovskites by correlating the intimate relationship between their structural, vibrational, electronic and other macroscopic properties. To this end, Prof. Caruntu designed a comprehensive experimental framework to investigate the complex interrelations between the atomic level distortions, phase transitions, evolution of microstructures, polarization reversal and switching mechanisms using aggregate-free monodisperse perovskite nanocrystals chosen as model systems. The ultimate goal is to predict the extent to which the polar ordering can be induced and manipulated at nanometer scales by finely tuning the composition, surface structure, lateral dimensions and spatial ordering of tri-dimensionally confined perovskites. The knowledge obtained from this work will conceptually broaden the field of nanoscale ferroelectrics, thereby providing new insights into size effects and surface curvature on the polar ordering in these materials. This can potentially result in the improvement of the actual design technologies in smart perovskite materials with programmable ferroelectric, dielectric and piezoelectric properties. Also, this is critical for understanding how the polar distortion and the surface structure influence the spontaneous polarization and the way the atomic dipoles are organized in ferroelectric perovskite quantum dots. Success in this research is therefore expected to extend this methodology to other metal oxide systems and inspire the implementation of these nanostructures in energy harvesting, water splitting and other energy and/or environmental-related technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The societal and educational impacts of this project are strong, taking into account the technological importance of perovskite-based materials. The experimental methodology established in the group will lay a solid foundation for the development of ferroelectric-based functional nanomaterials with controlled shape/morphology and predictable properties. The research is by nature inter-disciplinary, requiring expertise from materials and computational chemistry, device design, vibrational spectroscopy, electron holography, scanning probe microscopy and colloid and surface science. Besides these fields, the project's outcomes will have a significant impact on inter-related disciplines such as energy conversion, piezoelectricity and nanomaterials design. The educational component of this project is strong and varied. The integration of research and educational components will generate broad outreach and educational activities aimed at inspiring young students to consider education and careers in chemistry, materials sciences and nanotechnology, introducing high school students, K-12 teachers, undergraduate and graduate students to the interdisciplinary field of ferroelectrics and broadening the participation of underrepresented minorities. Students will be trained in a combination of nanomaterials synthesis, physical characterization, data analysis and measurement of the physical proprieties of perovskite nanostructures. The work will also lead to the development of new courses and synergistic undergraduate and high school classroom modules that demonstrate the broad possibilities of perovskite nanomaterials for integration into different technological applications. The educational objective of this project is to train undergraduate and graduate students for future jobs in materials science, both through mentoring students from freshman to graduate level in research and by integrating the research into undergraduate and graduate level courses.</AbstractNarration>

The research supported by this CAREER grant was focused on adressing the fundamental question related to nanoscale ferroelectrics? Is the ferroeelctric ordering affected by the grain size and does ferroelectricity survive in small grains regarldess of their size in the naometer length scale?&nbsp; To adress these fundamental questions we performed a systematic study&nbsp; of the nanoscale polarization structure and the survival of the polar ordering in low-dimensional ferroelectrics by using differently-sized (5-80 nm), aggregate-free, monodisperse titanium-containing perovskite ABO<sub>3</sub> (A=Ba, Sr) colloidal nanocrystals as a model system. Cuboidal BaTiO<sub>3</sub> nanocrystals are ideal for such studies, since they can be produced by a highly-versatile solution-based approach developed by our research group, can be surface-functionalized with different capping agents and therefore dispersed in both polar and non-polar solutions, possess nearly atomically flat surfaces with a relatively low local disorder. High resolution electron microscopy measurements, combined with vibrational spectroscopy, atomic pair distribution function analysis and temperature-dependent scanning probe microscopy showed that the ferroelectric order still persists to a size of the BaTiO<sub>3</sub> nanocubes as small as 5 nm (Figure 1), whereas theoretical calculations predicted the eradication of the ferroelectric order in small BaTiO<sub>3&nbsp;&nbsp;</sub>nanoparticles. In particular, we learned that the electrical dipoles found in 10 nm nanocubes orient in linear structures without the formation of vortex patterns, as suggested recently by theoretical calculations. Individual ferroelectric BaTiO3 nanocubes can be assembled into long-range ordered structures, such as self-assembled monolayers, superlattice assemblies or superparticles (Figure 2). Moreover, when dispersed into a polymer host matrix, these nanocubes can be cast into polymer-ceramic nanoparticle films with various thicknesses and filler content, which exhibit an increased dielectric permittivity and high energy density, being suitable for implementation in pulse power capacitors, high power systems and other energy storage applications. The results of the project have been disseminated trough scientific papers and presentations and national and international conferences.
