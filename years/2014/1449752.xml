<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on research instrumentation, training, and policy implementation.  The project consists of three major activities: 1) a summit of relevant, high-level federal administrators, university leaders and others to examine problems in and solutions for achieving compliance with Title IX, 2) an online Title IX toolkit with technical assistance as well as a new research instrumentation for collecting and analyzing intra-university data, and 3) the development and dissemination of a set of Title IX best practices based on the case study of effective implementation of Title IX in California. These activities have the potential to advance desired societal outcomes related to compliance with Title IX and a reduction in female STEM attrition, especially for early career female scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research has shown that family formation is a key point at which women leave their STEM career path. This project worked to reverse that trend by supporting the retention of pregnant and parenting STEM researchers through the implementation of the maternity leave and accommodations required by Title IX and by fostering environments that support researchers who are parents.     The summit  On October 8, 2015 the project held a summit "Pregnancy Accommodations for Students and Postdoctoral Fellows: A Mandate Embedded in Title IX." The event was hosted by the National Academy of Sciences? Committee on Women in Science, Engineering and Medicine in Washington, D.C.  The first-of-its-kind summit brought together dozens of compliance and diversity officials from major funders of research, along with university representatives and advocates, to educate them on Title IX mandates on pregnancy and discuss improving compliance. Participants included representatives from the Dept. of Energy, NASA, NIH, NSF, and the White House.  The summit participants identified several areas for future work, including the need for new resources and technical assistance to support compliance, the need for best practice examples, and the need for more information specifically addressing postdoc researchers.  Later work of the grant project targeted these areas.     Study of Postdoc Parents  Although postdocs are a major population within the STEM pipeline, early investigation and feedback revealed major stakeholders were unaware of postdocs? specific needs and how to best address them. In response, the project studied the experiences of postdocs who became parents during their appointment through a nationwide survey. The result of this study is a report that shed new light on the impact of parenthood on the postdoc experience, Parents in the Pipeline: Retaining Postdoctoral Researchers with Children.  The report includes a series of recommendations on Title IX compliance and best practices recommendations for the universities that host postdocs and the grantors that fund them. Over 1,000 users downloaded the report in its first week of publication.     The online toolkit  Using our expertise and guided by the input provided by university administrators, faculty, postdocs and students, the project created an online toolkit. The toolkit provides students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty with an array of information on Title IX. It also contains resources to support administrators, like Title IX officers and department chairs, in their efforts to foster Title IX compliance and retain women. The online toolkit contains videos, legal memos, model policies and procedures, factsheets, and other resources written language that is accessible to a wide audience.  The toolkit, launched in January 2016, has been accessed by tens of thousands of users. Several universities have reformed their policies on parental leave solely based on information received from the website, and others are currently in the process of revising their policies using the website?s technical assistance as a guide.  The Pregnant Scholar online toolkit will continue to be available following the conclusion of the grant, and will be updated as data and feedback comes in.     The best practices Through interviews and reviews of current university policies nationwide and incorporation of the new California law, we have drafted a model pregnancy leave and accommodation policy. This policy contains the best practices on a number of issues impacting pregnant students and postdoc researchers, including providing leave terms, guidance on accommodations, and support for non-birth parents. The policy provides universities with the guidance they need to not only meet the demands of Title IX, but to go beyond mere compliance to offer the strong support needed to retain parents in STEM higher education.      The model policy has been used by institutions across the nation as a template, and also served as a starting point for project staff to provide technical assistance directly.  In particular, project staff assisted the University of California in implementing Title IX best practices on pregnancy and parenting.  All UC campuses now provide parental leave for their graduate student parents. The project is continuing to engage in this work to learn and disseminate data from this process.     Training and public education  The project has provided trainings for university leaders, administrators, student services providers, students and researchers on Title IX compliance and institutional best practices through webinars and conferences nationwide. These trainings have reached thousands of institutional change makers. Educational videos and webinars will continue to be uploaded to the Pregnant Scholar website for public use following the grant term.  Our findings on the parenthood leak in the STEM pipeline&mdash;and how to close it&mdash;have been disseminated widely through the press, including in Nature, Science, the Chronicle of Higher Education, Chemical &amp; Engineering News, Insider Higher Ed, and many other publications. As a result of the project?s efforts, the Title IX protections for pregnant and parenting students and postdocs have become more well-known and institutions have been armed with the tools they need to retain their researchers.
