<AbstractNarration>The investigators in this collaborative proposal will analyze low frequency radio data from the Murchison Widefield Array to detect the spatial power spectrum of fluctuations in the 21 cm signal caused by the first generation of stars and collapsed objects, during an era known as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Broader impacts of the work include training of graduate students and postdocs, and engagement of under-represented groups toward careers in science.  Community outreach will be undertaken at local urban schools and tribal centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The observations will have the sensitivity to measure the rise and fall of the EoR power spectrum, placing meaningful constraints on models of reionization and early star formation.  These constraints will have impact on the astrophysics community and could influence how JWST observations are interpreted, constrain the optical depth of cosmic microwave background measurements, and aid our understanding of the early universe.</AbstractNarration>
