<AbstractNarration>Bitcoin is the most famous of several new online, cryptographic currency or electronic payment system experiments based on an open-source database protocol referred to as a blockchain. The blockchain permits transactions to take place without a central authority, relying instead on a decentralized network of peers verifying and authorizing them. It permits "trust" without trusted third-parties or mediators. In addition, Bitcoin and systems like it are membership-based means of value transfer and only work if people actively join them. This project examines new forms of private digital currency, exploring shifts in blockchain-based systems, and how innovators and regulators have participated in, advanced, and challenged them. The research examines how a new cadre of corporate and regulatory professionals are creating, understanding, monitoring, and regulating blockchain-based experiments in payment and in legal services.  Studying the interface between law and technology, this research is important not just for what it will reveal about law and regulation in the context of rapid technological change. It is also important because innovations with the bitcoin protocol raise broad questions about the changing nature of money, property, and law, and throw open for debate questions lawmakers thought settled at the end of the 19th century about the state's role in issuing money and the nature of contract. Broader impacts include training of graduate students and the creation and opening of a public-facing portal to a database and archive of compiled regulatory, policy, and industry documents.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As bitcoin-like systems move into the domain of law to create law-like substitutes, this research is designed to answer several questions.  Do new digital currencies create new social and economic exclusions? What do these innovations say about changing understandings of money and law? What happens when new corporate entrants into payment imagine they are innovating in money, not just its transmission, and seek to "disrupt" not just payment, but professions like notaries and escrow agents? How do regulators respond to concomitant challenges to the public interest in payment and in law itself?  The principal research activities are interviews with lawyers, regulators, and payments industry professionals, participant-observation at industry conferences, and code walkthroughs during which the researcher will follow programmers as they build new functionality into the blockchain.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Archaeologists of the future trying to understand computer network technologies of the early 21st century may stumble upon something called blockchain. By that time, far from now, blockchain will have either revolutionized all computational systems and become the basis of digital identification, or it will have faded into obscurity, leaving barely a trace in the techno-archaeological record. Or maybe it will have the status of the ARPANET today - we all sort of know it was something important that laid the foundations for the Internet, even if we don't know how, or why, or what the TCI/IP protocol is that packages, transmits and receives electronic communications on the computer networks we use every day.</p> <p>Although blockchain is associated with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, this project revealed it as an accounting technology that is inserted into conversations in the technology and business worlds about automation and "disintermediation." This project focused on the implications for law and justice, because one thing blockchain developers seek to automate is legal reasoning. In their view, if blockchain can begin to automate various kinds of decision making in the physical world, and in the world of communication among connected computational devices, then it has the potential to disintermediate law. Think of a digital system for tracking the provenance of digital or physical goods in a supply chain, and executing "contracts" based on confirming data gathered at critical points along that supply chain.</p> <p>This project brought a deeper understanding of blockchain to the PI's main disciplinary communities: sociolegal studies and anthropology. The research demonstrated that blockchain has opened up a public conversation over the politics of infrastructure. At stake is the control over the infrastructures at the foundation of economic and communicative relations. Insofar as blockchain helps illuminate these political positions, it is a useful case study to illuminate the political and economic transformations taking place since the global financial crisis of 2008.</p> <p>The project illuminated developers' legal consciousness and understanding of contracts. This is significant because these understandings are now being baked into computational systems doing the some of the work of private governance (as in the supply chain model above) - whether blockchain-based or otherwise. Developers used the word "contracts" because they associated contracts with their binding force, not with their breach or negotiation. Smart contracts are similarly binding, or, rather, bound by the preconditions programmed into them. When these preconditions are met, they instruct the network to execute the code. A simple example is a smart contract that instructs a payment to be made from one party to another when electronic sensors detect that a shipping container has arrived in port and still weighs what it did when it left its origin point. A simple digital switch could perform the same operation. A blockchain-based smart contract has the advantage - at least, in theory - of permitting anonymity among transacting parties with a trusted system for authenticating the state of the shipping container and the transacting parties, and validating the funds transfer, without the need for any intermediaries to carry out these functions, possibly eliminating additional costs and time. A blockchain-based system also has the virtue of being decentralized and thus more resistant to hacking, without requiring a central monitor or auditor. It would also (again, in theory) carry out its instructions automatically, as soon as the pre-set conditions were met. For these reasons some developers also have attempted to develop blockchain-based voting systems.</p> <p>Social scientists have long pointed out that corporate relations and contracts themselves are bound together by non-contractual forms of communication and commitment. But blockchain proponents tend to reduce the corporation to the contractual structures animating it, and to understand the contract, again, in terms of its binding force, its determinism, over the future contingencies that lead people to make contracts in the first place.</p> <p>In addition to academic presentations and publications, the project included numerous presentations to government, industry, and nonprofit bodies, including a particularly deep engagement with the Filene Research Institute, which supports the credit union industry. It resulted in a database of academic research on blockchain (in collaboration with Quinn DuPont, https://www.blockchainresearchnetwork.org/) including research guides. A Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) supplement permitted the PI, over two years, to train 11 computer science undergraduates from diverse background in social science methods and the ethics of computer science. One group compiled a database of blockchain startups, coding for platform used, industry sector, country of incorporation and country of operations; another focused on community organizations, data, justice and law.
