<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2014 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Jesse Wolfson is "Index Theory, Algebraic K-Theory, and Higher Lie Groups." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Chicago, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Alexander Beilinson.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to use geometric and topological tools to understand solutions of polynomial equations.  With Oliver Braunling and Michael Groechenig, the PI conducted a long-running investigation of "higher Tate objects" in connection with local structures on algebraic varieties.  This has led to 8 published/accepted papers,  and another under review.  Alongside this, the PI collaborated with Benson Farb and with Benson Farb and Melanie Wood to study structures at the interface of number theory and topology arising in "discriminant" varieties.  This led to 3 published papers, and another under review.  The PI also collaborated with Satoshi Kondo and Charles Siegel to construct new examples of modular operads, and with Jonathan Campbell and Inna Zakharevich to give a homotopy theoretic enrichment of classical zeta functions.  For broader impacts, the PI developed and ran multiple workshops for 100+ middle-schoolers on math and dance, collaborated with Reggie Wilson/Fist and Heel in the development of two major new concert dance performances, and trained and mentored students at the undergraduate and graduate level.  Finally, the PI served as an alumni committee member on the Roosevelt Institute, which he had previously co-founded (2004) and directed (2006). During this time, the institute was recognized with a MacArthur Award for Creative and Effective Institutions.       Last Modified: 09/20/2018       Submitted by: Jesse Wolfson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
