<AbstractNarration>The effects of two major causes of habitat loss and community extinction - human agency and climate change - can be difficult to distinguish for both scientists and policy makers.  Remedies, which can have major social and economic consequences, must be based on sound science and ample data.  The fossil record represents one of the few ways heavily impacted or now-extinct habitats and communities can be reconstructed to perform the before-and-after studies leading to a better understanding of historical processes on an ecosystem scale. A rich new source of this fossilized information, rare because it comes as a virtually intact ecological community and time slice, has been discovered in a large flooded cave in Madagascar. This fossil 'graveyard" contains abundant fossilized material from extinct forms of the unique Malagasy primate taxa referred to as lemurs, as well as remains of other animals that co-existed with them, and in a geological context that exists in many parts of the world where comparably valuable prehistoric information can be expected.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of the project initiated through this immediate research will test the hypothesis that fossiliferous submerged caves preserve a more comprehensive taxonomic cross-section of a natural community, represented by more complete, more interpretable remains than is typical of paleontological sites reflecting the millennial timeframe of recent human occupation. The most pressing goal is to pilot the methods needed to document the extent of these scientific resources for the first time.  The site is in need of immediate attention because it is unknown to both local policy makers and the international community, and it is not protected from human disturbance or loss of the fossils.  The environment is sensitive to climatic and geological factors which can rapidly harm fragile specimens or destroy them entirely. The need is exigent because global priorities recognize that understanding the causes of ecological degradation is a precondition to finding solutions to the humanitarian and wildlife consequences, especially in fragile island ecosystems such as found on Madagascar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methods used to document the biodiversity, abundance and completeness of this resource involve detailed mapping of the spatial distribution of fossils within the more outwardly accessible and deeper parts of the cave, using a grid system and high-resolution digital underwater videography and close-up photography, which will make it possible to taxonomically identify fossils and prioritize their extraction. The research team consists of six experienced, fossil-collecting divers, including two videographers and two scientists specializing in primate evolution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We organized a paleontological expedition to investigate flooded freshwater caves in Tsimanampetsotsa National Park, Madagascar, under the auspices of Madagascar National Parks and in collaboration with the Department of Paleobiology and Biological Anthropology, University of Antananarivo.  The park is located in the arid southwestern region of the country where the landscape is pocked with dry caves and large water-filled sinkholes.  Our team of nine scuba divers discovered substantial numbers of subfossil remains in three submerged caves.  In Aven Cave we discovered what is likely to be the single largest cache of giant subfossil lemurs ever uncovered.  The other two fossiliferous caves were Mitoho and Malaza Manga.  Each yielded important specimens.  Subfossils had been previously reported from around the entrance to Mitoho Cave but no underwater investigation of remains inside any of these caves had been conducted prior to this expedition.  Thus the primary objective was to establish the paleontological potential of these caves, with the principal aim of assessing the biodiversity of the subfossil content of Aven.  Overall, we identified specimens of nine extinct vertebrate species and found evidence of five species now living in the area.  The extinct finds include three giant subfossil lemur species, a mammalian carnivore, pygmy hippopotamus, elephant bird, giant tortoise, crocodile and falcon.     While our reconnaissance expedition only documents some of the eye-catching veneer of a rich sedimentary deposit replete with subfossils, their diversity is a strong indication of a large shift in the local ecology in the region of Tsimanampesotse.   For example, the native mammalian carnivores that still live in this area are considerably smaller in body size than the giant fosa, which disappeared with its megafaunal prey.  Among the primates, one of the species we found in great numbers (Pachylemur insignus) has been reconstructed as one of the most frugivorous of Malagasy lemurs on the basis of its dentition, but the area now is decidely dry and lacking in abundant fruit trees.  Instead, ring-tailed lemurs thrive today at Tsimanampetsotsa, in part because they consume a lot of leaves of succulent, dry-adapted plants. Knowledge of this ecological shift is important to developing conservation strategies to protect and preserve the local fauna and it will help us better understand the environmental consequences associated with the arrival of people in the region several thoushand years ago.   Among the broader impacts specifically arising from this project, we mention the following: the greater awareness by the authorities of the scientific potential of the region; contributions to the collections of subfossil remains that are widely used by international groups of scientists studying primate evolution and the extinction crisis that has befallen Madagascar; capacity builiding associated with our close collaboration with Malagasy scientists who took part in this project; and, the training of Malagasy students who were participants as well.  In the latter case, this involves providing new research materials and mentoring advanced degree dissertation projects.
