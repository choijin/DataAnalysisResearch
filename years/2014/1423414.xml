<AbstractNarration>Low-cost and disposable paper microfluidic devices are poised to make radical changes in applications such as point-of-care diagnostics, biothreat detection, and food/water supply and environmental monitoring. Scientists presently must design new devices for each application by hand, which is time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone. This proposal will adapt the semiconductor industry design methodologies to paper microfluidic technologies, while leveraging standard equipment such as inkjet printers and paper cutters for fabrication. This project will lower the barrier-to-entry for users of paper microfluidic devices, and will promote their widespread use among scientists.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of existing paper microfluidic devices include products such as pregnancy tests, HIV tests, drug tests, and others, each of which is a one-off device designed by hand. The productivity enhancements attained through this project will reduce the design cost of paper microfluidic devices, and these savings can be passed directly to the consumer. At the University of California, Riverside, the PI and Co-PI will introduce an interdisciplinary undergraduate course on paper microfluidics targeting students from departments such as Bioengineering, Biology, Biomedical sciences, Computer Science/Engineering, Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Environmental Sciences, Neuroscience, and the School of Medicine. The PI and co-PI will continue their ongoing successful efforts to include women and underrepresented minority students in this project, and will disseminate tutorials, open source software, and educational materials developed in the course of this project to the wider scientific/academic community.</AbstractNarration>

A software framework has been developed over the life of the award to address limitations in time and resources for biological researchers looking to identify and solve question and problems in the microfluidic platform. The framework provides a workflow tool that targets development of paper microfluidic devices that, to date, require time consuming design work in non-microfluidic tools such as illustration tools that are not intended to solve scientific problems with sufficient rigor. Researchers would spend hours hand-crafting potential microfluidic devices for a specific question which might require many additional versions to find a usable or effective design. The framework seeks to reduce this effort for researchers by automating as much as the process as possible while also evaluating and validating potential designs well before fabrication, thereby reducing not only time waste, but also costly chemicals and materials in research labs.</p> <p>The development of the framework produced publishable work that features the introduction of novel approaches to identifying valid locations for microfluidic components in a device as well as algorithms to assist in dynamically creating multi-layer, non-linear layouts from just a list of components presented to the framework. Of particular note in the process of investigating the role color ink plays in the hydrophobicity let to the creation and introduction of a novel microfluidic component that targets the limiting of fluid overflows in a device layout that might otherwise ruin a successful completion of a chemical reaction. Furthermore, the development of a radial flow layout for fluid travel was introduced to provide a general use device for researchers seeking to test more than a single chemical reaction in a single device. This device was in turn put to use in a real world test using known chemical assays that could test for conditions such as excess glucose in urine which might indicate a diabetic state. The results are under submission to be published in the bio-engineering publications for a non-computer science audience.</p> <p>The project has had two successfully published results and three more currently under submission to disseminate the efforts and accomplishments produced through the application of this NSF grant. Additionally, seven undergraduate student researchers took part in the development of the framework and testing process in a laboratory setting and were exposed to real world applications of the field of Computer Science. One of the undergraduates was able to get employment from their involvement in the project after graduation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/11/2020<br>      Modified by: Philip&nbsp;L&nbsp;Brisk</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1423414/1423414_10314441_1581448893077_DesignFlow_w_Caption--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1423414/1423414_10314441_1581448893077_DesignFlow_w_Caption--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Microfluidic design framework"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1423414/1423414_10314441_1581448893077_DesignFlow_w_Caption--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Microfluidic design framework"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Microfluidic design framework</div> <div class="imageCredit">Joshua Potter</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Philip&nbsp;L&nbsp;Brisk</div> <div class="imageTitle">Microfluidic design framework</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1423414/1423414_10314441_1581448944549_Anti-fuse--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1423414/1423414_10314441_1581448944549_Anti-fuse--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Anti-fuse"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1423414/1423414_10314441_1581448944549_Anti-fuse--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Anti-fuse"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The anti-fuse ensures that spillage does not affect the active area of a paper microfluidic device.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Joshua Potter</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Philip&nbsp;L&nbsp;Brisk</div> <div class="imageTitle">Anti-fuse</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1423414/1423414_10314441_1581449028870_RadialFlowAssay--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1423414/1423414_10314441_1581449028870_RadialFlowAssay--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Radial flow assay"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1423414/1423414_10314441_1581449028870_RadialFlowAssay--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Radial flow assay"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Depiction of a radial flow assay.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Joshua Potter</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Philip&nbsp;L&nbsp;Brisk</div> <div class="imageTitle">Radial flow assay</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
