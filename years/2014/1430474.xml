<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 13-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum and The Joint Research Programming Initiative on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change (FACCE-JPI). The Belmont Forum is a high level group of the world's major and emerging funders of global environmental change research and international science councils.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. This group developed a funding framework to support multilateral research projects that address global challenges in ways that are beyond the capacity of national or bilateral activities. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders.  This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working together in an inaugural call of the International Opportunities Fund, the Belmont Forum and JPI-FACCE have provided support for research projects that seek to deliver knowledge needed for action to mitigate and adapt to detrimental environmental change and extreme hazardous events that relate to food security and land use change.  This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., policy makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to investigate how food production and distribution affects how land is used and how these choices are affected by changes in the environment.  This project will focus on Southern Africa as a case study and will develop an international group of partners from 4 countries who will work together to understand the relationships between the demands for food, food distribution networks and how land and natural resources are used.   Results of this study are likely to help understand these interactions in other countries, including the United States.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The role of private companies and governmental and nongovernmental institutions is of growing importance in food security and land use issues in southern Africa. Food system actors include those engaged in food processing, marketing, intraregional trading, and the food aid sectors. All are ultimately influenced by consumers, and the way in which they operate, is mediated by their interactions with each other and the governance arrangements among these actors.  The overall purpose of the South African Food Systems Governance (SAFGOV) project was to build an international community of researchers able to jointly undertake research on the effectiveness of food system governance for food security and drivers of land use change. The SAFGOV project team was comprised of faculty from four countries &ndash; Great Britain (UK), the Netherlands, South Africa (SA) and the United States (US).  The project funding mechanism was comprised of three major funding agencies in the represented countries: US - National Science Foundation (NSF); UK- Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); SA &ndash; National Research Foundation (NRF), all working under the umbrella of the Belmont Forum, which intended to foster international collaboration.  The resulting international community of researchers engaged with a range of stakeholders to co-design and jointly undertake research on (i) the effectiveness and adaptiveness of food system governance arrangements for food security; and (ii) food systems governance as driver of land use change and implications for associated ecosystem services.  The U.S. team focused its efforts on developing and testing a web based knowledge management prototype, as well as a case study of the communications characteristics and group dynamics of this international team of academic researchers. The findings revealed there are benefits to dynamic international academic teams. Differences in approach and loose group models allowed for the free flow of information and resulted in new applications and potential solutions to complex problems. This research further shows the need for strong internal communication as a team is built.  The world is facing an increasingly diverse set of problems; if we are going to work collaboratively to solve them we need to look in to the internal workings of international teams as they are developed to ensure success.  The overall project?s focus on governance arrangements in southern Africa?s food systems was and continues to be highly innovative, based on its multi-level approach and examination of the role of governance structures. Results will help inform both public and private policy making on the consequences of ?demand-led? decision making for food security and land use change, thereby complementing other work on land use change as driven by issues of food supply.
