<AbstractNarration>The 40th Spring Lecture Series in the Mathematical Sciences (SLS) will take place March 5th--7th, 2015, and the 41st Spring Lecture Series in the Mathematical Sciences will take place April 14th--16th, 2016; both will be hosted by the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Arkansas, in Fayetteville, Arkansas.  This grant supports travel and lodging, both for the expert speakers who have been invited, and for the graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and young professors who attend the conferences but do not have their own means of support.  These conferences provide opportunities for dissemination of research results, discussions that lead to new discoveries and collaborations, and for professional development of the junior participants.  The broader impact of the conferences also includes some events that will be supported entirely by the University of Arkansas, including a public mathematics lecture each year, and networking events for women in mathematics and for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the 2015 conference will feature lectures by Professor Benson Farb of the University of Chicago on representation stability, and the 2016 conference will feature lectures by Professor Peter Ozsvath of Princeton University, on Heegaard Floer Homology. Both conferences will have talks by ten expert invited speakers in addition to the principal lecturer, as well as contributed talks by participants. The 2015 conference will explore sequences of representations of groups that arise in topology, geometric group theory, algebraic geometry, abstract algebra and other subjects, and make connections between these diverse fields. The 2016 conference will focus on new techniques and applications of Heegaard Floer Homology and Bordered Floer Homology to 3- and 4-manifolds, as well as to contact and symplectic topology.  The website for the conference series is http://math.uark.edu/3742.php .</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This grant supported two meetings of the Spring Lecture Series (SLS), an annual conference series at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Arkansas. This conference series is extremely successful, going back four decades and hosting some of the most respected mathematicians in the world.  The grant supported the 2015 and 2016 events.  Each SLS conference features a series of lectures by a principal lecturer who is a leader in their field.  These SLS meetings also included other invited speakers and contributed talks. Also, one very popular element of these conferences is a public outreach event in the form of a mathematics lecture for the general public.     Abstracts and videos from these events (and other conferences in our series) are available to fellow researchers and the general public at our conference archive website: https://fulbright.uark.edu/departments/math/research/spring-lecture-series/spring-lecture-series-archives/index.php .     The 2015 conference featured a lecture series by Benson Farb (University of Chicago) entitled "Cohomology, Polynomials, and Representations: an Eternal Golden Braid". The invited talks involved connections between geometric group theory, algebraic topology, and algebraic geometry, especially in the subfield of representation stability.  This is a popular current research area.  The conference had 41 external participants with a diverse group of speakers that included several early career mathematicians. The 2016 conference featured a lecture series by John Etnyre (Georgia Tech) entitled "Submanifolds in contact topology" with a particular emphasis on future problems regarding existence and embedding questions for high dimensional contact and symplectic manifolds.  This is also a popular current research area. The invited talks covered a variety of topics in contact and symplectic topology including connections to algebra, gauge theory and mirror symmetry. The conference had 24 external participants, also with a diverse group of speakers that included several early career mathematicians. Intellectual merit: The principal lecturers are leaders in their fields, and the topics of these two conferences are popular current research areas in topology.
