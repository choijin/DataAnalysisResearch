<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to apply the novel ultra-thin cooling technology beyond just mobile phones toward multiple mobile platforms in the communications sector ? an area with several large, multi-billion dollar markets, including tablets and ultrabooks.  With the novel technology's modular, scalable design for ease in manufacturing and bendability for mounting into ultra-thin, tight spaces, the platform can also be adapted for use in routers and other telecommunications hardware platforms.  With data centers, which are already shifting towards using mobile chip technologies to increase energy efficiency and lower cost, this novel cooling technology, once proven in mobile phones, stands to be adopted in this market as well.  Overall, multiple markets are in need of ultra-thin, high performance, but low cost thermal solutions which the cooling technology being developed will be able to address broadening its impact as a thermal management technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project works toward solving major problems in thermal management for mobile chip sets with novel, ultra-thin cooling technology, the initial prototypes which will be developed in Phase I.  Current chipsets do not produce excessive amounts of heat (less than 10W), but their location deep within the phone, and proximity to plastic components with low thermal conductivity, makes it difficult to dissipate heat.  The cooling technology being ultra-thin at 500 um or less and with the ability to be modularly integrated with the unique characteristic of needing little to no changes to current phone topology is ideal for mobile applications.  It can connect with hard to reach hot chips, move heat long distances, and evenly distribute heat along a low conductivity back plate or case.  To maintain comfort for device users, cooling technology being developed would limit temperatures to 45°C at maximum performance, while still being able to dissipate heat to ambient conditions, such as a hand or pants pocket at around 30 degrees celsius.</AbstractNarration>
