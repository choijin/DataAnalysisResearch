<AbstractNarration>The workshop on "Taking Spectral Algorithms from Theory to Practice" is to be held at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, Berkeley, CA, on October 27-31, 2014.  The workshop will explore the applicability of recent developments in spectral graph theory to graph partitioning problems that arise in areas such as image segmentation, machine learning, and scientific computing.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds ($30,000) will be used to support the participation of approximately 25 attendees in the workshop.  Airfare and lodging will be reimbursed.  Participation by women and members of underrepresented minorities will be a factor in the selection.</AbstractNarration>

Fan Chung gave a very simple proof of higher order Cheeger inequalities and discussed properties of directed graphs. Ery Ariel-Castro gave a talk on the related problem of consistently estimating a Cheeger cut for a probability distribution obtained from sampled data.
