<AbstractNarration>The Center for Advanced Research in Forensic Science (CARFS) will be based at Iowa State University as the lead institution. The mission of the proposed Center is to provide a multidisciplinary forum for advancing research and innovation in forensic sciences, enhancing education in relevant scientific disciplines, and improving the interpretation and ethical communication of forensic practitioner findings. CARFS will address the human, analytical, and statistical foundations of forensic science evaluations, including topics such as human observer biases and the interpretation of evidence, assessment and innovation in forensic analysis to include computational and technological innovations, and statistical sampling and measurement approaches for improving the validity of inferences drawn from forensic evaluations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed multidisciplinary Center will offer important opportunities for training new scientists and provide environment for cross-disciplinary engagement. Coordination with Iowa State University's Science Bound Program will facilitate important research and mentorship experiences for underrepresented high school and undergraduate students. The CARFS research team is distributed across key disciplines in science, social science, education, engineering, and statistics, with interests that will directly contribute to forensic practice in a number of important disciplines including toxicology, firearms and toolmarks, questioned documents, trace evidence, controlled substances, biological screening, fracture patterns, impression evidence, and bloodstain pattern analysis. The Midwest Forensics Resource Center at Iowa State University will also provide support to this I/UCRC effort by enabling scientist-practitioner collaborations and ensuring important opportunities for the dissemination of findings through an established network of practitioners.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project sought to develop an industry-university cooperative research center to support improvements in the practice of forensic science. Support was solicited from industry, government, and non-profits to faciliate cross-disciplinary research that could be shared with forensic practitioners. A strategic vision was developed wherein the proposed center would develop innovative technologies and investigative diagnostic approaches for forensic practice. Projects proposed by the center would address the human, analytical, and statistical foundations of forensic evaluations in the following areas:   Chemical Analysis of Drugs, Toxicology, and Trace Materials - Projects address areas of analytical chemistry and instrument development in mass spectrometry, ion mobility, chromatography, laser and optical spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging, and development of aptamers for highly specific and reusable portable sensor systems.  Quantifiable Approaches to Pattern and Impression Analysis - Projects involve development of methods for surface pattern and image characterization using interferometric white light microscopy, surface profilometry, structured light imaging, focus variation microscopy, as well as development and testing of robust comparison algorithms and impression modelling and prediction based on an understanding of the underlying materials properties.  Human Perception and Decision Making - Projects assess the development of perceptual skill and expertise in forensic disciplines, the influence of contextual information and other factors that may bias decision making, the development of approaches (such as linear sequential unmasking or blind, lineup testing) to reduce the potential for bias, and lay understanding of forensic evidence as presented by examiners in court.  Cyber Forensic Analysis - Project assess approaches for solving matrix completion problems in digital evidence analysis, advance the interpretation of cyber events in assessing the origin and scope of computer or network breaches, develop analytical solutions to discover hidden evidence (anti-forensics) and improve determinations of linkability, and more generally assess the fundamental limits of certain computer forensic methodologies.  Statistical Modeling and Prediction of Dynamics, Mechanistic Probabilities - Projects include the development of a scientific understanding of phenomena such as fluid dynamics and environmental factors that result in bloodstains, or the modeling of fractures and other complex patterns.  The activities in this project led to important cross-disciplinary collaborations that have resulted in additional research funding and publications. A website (http://forensicresearch.org) was also developed to support the proposed NSF I/UCRC Center in Forensic Science.
