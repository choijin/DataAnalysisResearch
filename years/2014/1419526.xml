<AbstractNarration>This project will contribute to identifying the attribution of East Asian (EA) precipitation changes to anthropogenic and natural drivers and the effects of climate variability on the ecosystem and water resources. The Tibetan Plateau is the source of major Asian river systems that support more than a billion people downstream. The results from this study will provide useful information for surface hydrology and agriculture, critical for a populous and economically vibrant part of the world. The tools for this EA study can be used for global and other regional studies and the state-of-the-art models developed in this project will be released to the research community. This project will also contribute to a number of educational outreach activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fully-coupled Atmospheric/Ocean GCM/biophysical and biogeochemical models/dynamic vegetation model to: examine the improvements in predictions of EA climate variability and change due to surface-induced forcings, including land use and land cover change (LULCC) and dust and black carbon effects and their two-way interactions in reference to predictions in which one or more of those processes and interactions are neglected; to evaluate and attribute the role played in the EA climate variability by these factors and mechanisms; to examine the effects of those processes on future projections of that regional climate; and to estimate uncertainty through a set of experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data from different sources, especially from observations in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), will be applied to evaluate model predictions. In addition, a regional climate model  with high resolution will be applied to assess the regional details of effects of surface-atmosphere interactions on the climate and ecosystem of EA, the TP in particular. Through the representation of key non-linear feedback processes in the EaSM, this project has the potential to substantially improve predictive capabilities and to further explain how different Earth processes and human activities have contributed to EA climate variability and changes over much of the last century.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project explores an interdisciplinary and synthetic approach to understand the role of major surface forcings, such as the terrestrial ecosystem, land use and land cover change (LULCC), land surface temperature, sea surface temperature, and aerosols from surface, as well as their two-way interactions in the Earth climate system and how proper representations of these processes in the Earth System model produce reliable predictions of East Asia and global climate variability at decadal and other temporal scales.  The National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) coupled with a biosphere and dynamic vegetation model SSiB4/TRIFFID (Simplified Simple Biosphere Model version 4/ Top-down Representation of Interactive Foliage and Flora Including Dynamics), which had been developed under this project, is the major Earth System model used for this project.     This project has demonstrated that the fully-coupled ocean/atmosphere/dynamic vegetation interactions must be considered to realistically simulate the climate variability at different scales.  For instance, using the fully coupled CFSv2 with dynamic vegetation (CFSv2/SSiB4/TRIFFID), the results have shown that compared with the simulation without dynamic vegetation, the fully coupled model improves Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and ENSO simulation. In addition, compared with the CFSv2 with its original land model, our results have shown the substantial improvement in producing North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Pacific/North American (PNA) patterns (Lee et al., 2019, Climate Dynamics).  The simulated correlation coefficient for interannual land temperature variability for the East Asia has been significantly improved from 0.33 to 0.55.  Since this year, the American Meteorological Society (AMS) has agreed to change the "Land-Atmosphere interaction session", which the PI had organized once every two years in the AMS Annual meeting since the year 2000, to "Land-Atmosphere and Land-Ocean Interaction session".     This project has also indicated the significant impact of spatial patterns of decadal temperature and precipitation variability and its intensity due to LULCC after we introduced a latest more realistic annual global LULCC map.  Our LULCC research based on 1950-2015 simulations show an overall land surface temperature increase by 0.47 K in the degraded regions and a decrease by 0.22 K outside the degraded regions.  Furthermore, LULCC causes a southward displacement of intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) with a narrowing by about 0.5 degree, leading to a triple anomalous precipitation pattern over the warm pool and the Indian Ocean. This project has also demonstrated that to appropriately assess the local and remote responses to LULCC, it is critical to use multiple methodologies: in our case, the decomposed temperature metric is used to identify LULCC local effects and the framework of the cross-equatorial energy transport for LULCC’s remote effects (Huang et al., 2020, J. Climate).     The global ecosystem has experienced dramatic changes in past decades.  Using an offline biophysical-dynamic vegetation model (SSiB4/TRIFFID), our study, for the first time, reveals that many parts of the world, before and after the 1980s, had different variabilities and trends.  While 12% and 19% of land has consistently positive leaf area index (LAI) and global primary productivity (GPP) trends since the 1950s, respectively; 17% and 20% of land, saw LAI and GPP trends, respectively, reverse during the 1980s.  Moreover, we had conducted a set of experiments to attribute those trend changes to elevated atmospheric CO2, global warming, and climate variability (mainly precipitation).  Overall, enhanced CO2 consistently contributes to positive LAI and GPP trends in the tropics. Global warming is shown to mostly affect LAI, with positive effects in high latitudes and negative effects in subtropical semi-arid areas. Climate variability is found to dominate the variability of LAI and GPP in the semi-humid and semi-arid areas.  The climate variability effect plays the major in the reversal during the 1980s over many regions in the world (Liu et al., 2019, Earth System Dynamics).     Meanwhile, the expansion of the Sahara Desert and shrinking of frozen land of the Arctic  from 1950-2015 have been confirmed based on observational data and our fully coupled model’s simulations.  The future projection for 2015-2050 have also suggested such trends will continue in the next a few decades (Liu and Xue, 2020, Scientific Reports).                 The Tibetan Plateau has been considered to have significant impact on the Asian monsoon variability.  This project has successfully transferred the methodology and approach that had been developed for the North American study on the relation between spring surface and subsurface temperature anomalies (LST/SUBT) over the Rocky Mountains and the droughts/floods in downstream regions to the Tibetan Plateau and East Asian region and test it validity.  The results suggest that the Tibetan Plateau’s spring LST effect is probably as important as sea surface temperature in producing East Asian summer drought/flood events (Xue et al., 2018, JGR).   Because of this work, GEWEX has supported a new initiative "Impact of initialized land surface temperature and snowpack on subseasonal to seasonal prediction (LS4P)".  About 50 institutions worldwide have participated in LS4P.              Last Modified: 10/04/2020       Submitted by: Yongkang Xue]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
