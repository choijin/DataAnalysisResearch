<AbstractNarration>National college and career readiness standards call for integrating engineering practices into science and mathematics instruction.  Very few models for doing this have been implemented and studied.  This Engineering Teacher Pedagogy project implements and assesses the promise of an extended professional development model coupled with curriculum enactment to develop teacher pedagogical skills for integrating engineering design into high school biology and technology education classrooms.  Professional development is provided to twenty high school biology teachers and twenty technology education teachers in the Baltimore County Public Schools.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The professional development consists of two five day sessions in two consecutive summers and follow up in two academic years as the teachers learn content, pedagogical content knowledge and classroom management skills.  The project investigates the teachers' learning trajectories using validated instruments.  A longitudinal study investigates teachers' change in practice and its role on student learning through classroom observations and examination of student artifacts.   The study also investigates whether the change in practice persists over time and the extent to which the change in practice transfers to other learning environments.  This study should elucidate the issues of teaching science concepts through the use of science and engineering practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this longitudinal study, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, (UMBC) partnered with Baltimore County Public Schools (BCPS) to implement and assess an extended professional development model coupled with curriculum enactment to develop teacher pedagogical skills for integrating engineering design into high school biology and technology education classrooms.  The broad objective of the project was to characterize the benefits and limitations of utilizing an educative curriculum-based Professional Development system followed by curriculum enactment as a mechanism for strengthening teacher instructional skills for integrating engineering practices in high school STEM classrooms.   The integration of engineering practices into ?traditional? science courses is advocated in the Next Generation Science Standards and represents a significant change in how STEM education is taught.  These challenges need to be addressed by the introduction of new curricular materials, instructional practices as well as teacher professional development models.    Findings from this research advanced our understanding of the integration of science, engineering and mathematics in K-12 classrooms and broadly impact the field of teacher professional development.  The core of this proposal was an investigation utilizing an educative curriculum focused professional development system. This proposal had the potential to advance our understanding of the concept in two distinct manners. First, the research examines the use of the same educative materials in two distinct STEM learning environments, technology education and biology.  Making comparisons among teachers enacting the materials within and between each of these two settings provides an opportunity to identify elements that may be teacher dependent, disciplinary dependent or that may be more generalizable. Furthermore, the research design examines not only teacher change within the enactment of the educative unit but also the level of pedagogical transfer to teacher classroom practice external to and beyond the educative unit.   The educative curriculum unit utilized in this study was The INSPIRES Curriculum Engineering in Healthcare: Hemodialysis Case Study.  This exemplar module integrates engineering design with the learning of fundamental biology concepts.  Another unique feature of the curriculum was the use of educative components to support the enactment of the materials in a student-centered, phenomenon-first approach. The design of the INSPIRES (INcreasing Student Participation, Interest and Recruitment in Engineering and Science) was developed and revised during two prior NSF funded projects. The intellectual merit of this project focused on the refinement of this INSPIRES Teacher Professional Development model to support the integration of engineering into mainstream science.    Changes in teacher instructional practices and self-efficacy as well as growth in student learning were measured across multiple years.  Initial data points began with baseline measures of classroom practices prior to the intervention and then again yearly for three years.  Classroom practices were assessed via classroom video and/or audio recordings of two lessons associated with the INSPIRES curriculum as well as one lesson per year of the teacher-participants best attempts at an engineering-design lesson.   Overall, the findings of this three-year study suggest that the INSPIRES PD model is capable of effecting or producing teacher change in the area of reformed pedagogy. By exploring the INSPIRES lessons themselves, teachers may gain confidence in instructing new (engineering) content to their students. Those teachers that matriculated through the final year of the study have experienced the positive impact that the INSPIRES curriculum has on students.

Classroom implementation of exemplar materials with follow up critique of lesson design rationale  3. Guided adaptation of exemplar materials for local context with with follow up critique of adaptations  4.
