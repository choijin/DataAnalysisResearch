<AbstractNarration>The confluence of new networked sensing technologies (e.g., cameras), distributed computational resources (e.g., cloud computing), and algorithmic advances (e.g., computer vision) are offering new and exciting opportunities for solving a variety of new problems that are of societal importance including emergency response, disaster recovery, surveillance, and transportation.  Solutions to this new class of problems, referred to as "situation awareness" applications, include surveillance via large-scale distributed camera networks and personalized traffic alerts in vehicular networks using road and traffic sensing.   A breakthrough in system software technology is needed to meet the challenges posed by these applications since they are latency-sensitive, data intensive, involve heavy-duty processing, and must run 24x7 while dealing with the vagaries of the physical world.  This project aims to make such a breakthrough, through new distributed programming idioms and resource allocation strategies.  To better identify the challenges posed by situation awareness applications, the project includes experimental deployment of the new technologies in partnership with the City of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central activity is to develop appropriate system abstractions for design of situation awareness applications and encapsulate them in distributed programming idioms for domain experts (e.g., vision researchers).  The resulting programming framework allows association of critical attributes such as location, time, and mobility with sensed data to reason about causal events along these axes.  To meet the latency constraints of these applications, the project develops geospatial resource allocation mechanisms that complement and support the distributed programming idioms, extending the utility-computing model of cloud computing to the edge of the network.  Since the applications often have to work with inexact knowledge of what is happening in the physical environment, owing to limitations of the distributed sensing sources, the project also investigates system support for application-specific information fusion and spatio-temporal analyses to increase the quality of results. Efforts toward development of a future cyber-physical systems workforce include creation of a new multidisciplinary curriculum around situation awareness, exploration of new immersive learning pedagogical styles, and mentoring and providing research experience to undergraduate students through research experiences and internships aimed at increasing participation of women and minorities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is an exciting time in computing with the sea-change happening both on the technology fronts and application fronts. Networked sensors and embedded platforms with significant computational capabilities with access to backend utility computing resources, offer a tremendous opportunity to realize large-scale cyber-physical systems (CPS) to address the many societal challenges including emergency response, disaster recovery, surveillance, and transportation. Referred to as Situation awareness applications, they are latency-sensitive, data intensive, involve heavy-duty processing, run 24x7, and result in actuation with possible retargeting of sensors. Examples include surveillance deploying large-scale distributed camera networks, and personalized traffic alerts in vehicular networks using road and traffic sensing.  The key insight that laid the foundation for this project is the realization that Cloud computing as we know it is centralized and hence deficient to meet the requirements of geo-distributed situation awareness applications.  The research carried out under the auspices of this project resulted in defining distributed programming idioms and runtime mechanisms for situation awareness applications running on geo-distributed (also known as "edge" in modern day parlance) infrastructure.  The intent is to provide simple abstractions for the domain experts developing such applications, shielding them from all the vagaries of geo-distribution of the computational infrastructure.   The project resulted in training several students (PhD level, MS-level, and UGs) over the life of the award.  The PI also took it upon himself to organize workshops during the annual CPS PI meetings to evangelize edge computing for CPS applications.  In addition to developing and evaluating the scalability of distributed programming abstractions, the project also undertook in situ studies of the technologies by partnering with the Georgia Tech Police Department and their on-campus camera network.  For example, the project successfully demonstrated how space-time tracking of vehicles can be performed at video ingestion time to facilitate law enforcement to query the path taken by any suspicious vehicle.
