<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Prof. Michael Lynch, Ph.D. candidate Danya Glabau will  conduct ethnographic research to understand how people with food allergies, patient advocacy organization staff, and physicians conceive of "safety" for food allergic people and how they use treatment technologies to manage the risks to life posed by the illness. The co-PI will conduct semi-structured interviews with members of these three groups, observation of biomedical allergy treatment, participant observation in an online food allergy support community, and participant observation at three allergy-related conferences, to learn how patients understand and deploy three treatment strategies:  epinephrine injections, immunotherapy, and elimination diets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include improved communication between clinicians and patients and important contributions to the clinical literature on allergy. The most efficacious treatment strategy, eliminating allergenic foods from the diet of allergic people, requires both individual and collective actions. The individual must take care to avoid foods they are allergic to; but this is only possible if food manufacturers uniformly and consistently disclose ingredients and processing conditions on food labels and if there are mechanisms by which to exclude allergens from public spaces. Understanding what individual and collective measures would most effectively safeguard the health of Americans with chronic conditions is important. By amplifying patient voices, this project will offer a platform for a relatively common but often overlooked patient constituency to contribute to identification of new approaches.  The co PI will also identify existing weaknesses of food allergy treatment strategies and communicate these to the life science entrepreneurship community in the hopes of fostering collaborations that might lead to advances in nutrition substitutes or food processing methods that are healthy, palatable, and safe for people with food allergies who otherwise struggle to maintain a balanced diet.</AbstractNarration>

A fifth trip occurred in November 2015, for which a no-cost, one-year extension was granted.

The Co-PI?s dissertation based on this research argues that medical care is deeply shaped by moral judgments about what constitutes "good" medical care, even when that care uses the tools of scientific biomedicine (or "Western" medicine).

This was a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant, and one important outcome of this award was that the Co-PI Danya Glabau, whose research was supported by the grant, successfully completed and defended her dissertation, in the Department of Science &amp; Technology Studies Graduate Field.  The dissertation was titled, Morality in Action: Risking Death and Caring for Life in American Food Allergy Worlds.  Her PhD was awarded in May 2016, and she is now on the Faculty at the Brooklyn Institute for Social Research, and starting in January 2017 will be a Visiting Research Scholar at the CUNY Graduate Center.
