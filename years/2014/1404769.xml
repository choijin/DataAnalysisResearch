<AbstractNarration>Number theory originates from the study of solutions to equations in whole numbers.  It is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, and its methods have for millenia been based on the interaction between the divisibility properties of whole numbers and their size.  Twentieth-century number theory formalized these two properties in two different ways.  Divisibility and the measure of size can be seen both as geometric and as dynamical properties, the latter rooted in the equations of mathematical physics.  The branch of mathematics concerned with their geometric relations is called arithmetic geometry; the branch concerned with their dynamical relations is called automorphic forms.  Symmetry plays a central role in both arithmetic geometry and automorphic forms; the hypothetical Langlands correspondence unifies these two branches by showing how each kind of symmetry encodes the other. The PI proposes to use this coding to understand objects on one side of the correspondence in terms of properties of the corresponding object on the other side. A particular focus is the transfer of divisibility properties of automorphic forms to arithmetic geometry, which often leads to surprisingly precise information about solutions of equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a contribution to the arithmetic theory of automorphic forms, in the setting of the Langlands program, with special attention to the arithmetic of motives and their associated Galois representations arising in the cohomology of Shimura varieties, directly or by application of congruence methods.  The long-term goals are the identification of all such motives and all such Galois representations (the modularity problem) and the proof of outstanding conjectures on the arithmetic of motives, notably Deligne's conjecture on special values of L-functions, and the conjectures of Greenberg, Coates, Perrin-Riou, and others on the existence of p-adic L-functions, for the motives obtained in this way. Special attention is given to special values of tensor product L-functions. This project fits into an international program  to use the full range of available techniques to extend to all such motives results established for  L-functions of elliptic modular forms; the PI is actively collaborating with colleagues in France, Austria, Israel, Japan, and Hong Kong, as well as in the United States and Canada.  The methods involved in the present project combine standard techniques from arithmetic geometry and automorphic forms, the differential-geometric approach to cohomological automorphic forms on which the PI has worked for many years, with p-adic analysis, and representation theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Number theory, in the broadest sense, is concerned with patterns in the relations among whole numbers:  how many prime numbers there are, how two or more primes relate to one another in various ways, how to determine whether or not a given equation has solutions in whole numbers.  These patterns and relations are the subject of several vast series of conjectures.  Grothendieck's hypothetical theory of motives postulates that the patterns and relations are the reflection of deeper structures related to geometry &mdash; that whole numbers are governed by the possible shapes underlying algebraic equations.  Moreover, while the relevant shapes are highly non-linear, many of their most salient properties can be reconstructed by the means of linear algebra; the relevant terms here are cohomology and Galois representations.  The Langlands program, on the other hand, asserts that Galois representations themselves can be reconstructed by means of automorphic forms, which are the expressions of symmetry properties that originally arose in connection with the equations of mathematical physics.   There is thus a dense web of conjectures that interpret the patterns and relations among whole numbers in the language of symmetry and mathematical physics.  The complete solution of these conjectures is widely understood to be out of reach for the next several generations; nevertheless, they provide a framework that, directly or indirectly, serve to guide most current research in number theory.  The project "Automorphic Galois Representations and Automorphic L-functions" was devoted to testing and extending these conjectures in the cases accessible under the current state of knowledge, adding to current knowledge in the process.   More specifically, the project was concerned with three kinds of open questions:  those specifically raised within the Langlands program; applications of results of the Langlands program to other branches of number theory in the spirit of Grothendieck's theory of motives; and extensions of the Langlands program beyond its original context.  An example of the first type is the PI's ongoing project with B&ouml;ckle, Khare, and Thorne to apply the methods of modularity lifting, originally developed in connection with Andrew Wiles's solution of Fermat's Last Theorem, to representations of the Galois groups of function fields with values in general semisimple groups.  Examples of the second type include the PI's work with Grobner, Lapid, and Lin, applying methods of the Langlands program to study special values of L-functions of (automorphic) Galois representations, as well as the completion of the PI's project with Eischen, Li, and Skinner to provide a systematic construction of p-adic versions of these L-functions.  Examples of the third, most speculative, type of question, include the PI's project with Venkatesh to integrate motivic structures directly into the Langlands program, and the PI's project with Grojnowski and others to develop a geometric version of a hypothetical Langlands program for modular representations of Galois groups of p-adic fields.   Broader impacts of the project were developed through the PI's public presentations of his book Mathematics without Apologies, published in 2015, and through his subsequent writing of articles intended for a general academic audience.
