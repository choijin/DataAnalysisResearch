<AbstractNarration>Cloud computing offers many benefits to users, including increased availability and flexibility of resources, and efficiency of equipment. However, privacy concerns are becoming a major barrier to users transitioning to cloud computing. The privilege design of existing cloud platforms creates great challenges in ensuring the trustworthiness of cloud by granting too much power to the cloud administrators, who could launch serious insider attacks by abusing the administrative privileges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses a well-understood philosophy, separation-of-privilege, in the architectural design of a cloud platform. The architectural design and the strong homomorphic cryptographic approach protect data privacy in cloud environments from different angles. This project develops an innovative privacy-driven architectural design, with one focus on the privilege-level design of each software component of a cloud platform, and another on defending insider attacks. This project investigates new mechanisms to de-privilege the cloud administrator and enable more fine grained access control among the software components of a cloud platform. More specifically, the new mechanisms enable agile configuration of the platform; user-configurable privacy protection; and strong isolation in the user space.  The techniques developed under this project are immensely important as users place more of their data into the cloud and rely upon cloud providers to keep that data private.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>With a focus on developing innovative trustworthy execution environments for applications that make use of sensitive data, this project has three main outcomes. (1) Through collaborative research, we have developed MyCloud, an innovative light-weight hypervisor which prevents corrupted insiders from stealing tenants? private data while enabling applications to access their private data as usual in cloud data centers. A unique feature of MyCloud is that it reduces the TCB (trusted computing base) size to less than 10,000 lines of code. (2) Through collaborative research, we have developed TrustShadow, a new kind of Trustworthy Execution Environments (TEEs) for unmodified applications running on mobile devices (e.g. smartphones) and Internet of Things devices. In contrast to the previous TEEs which rely on a secure operating system (OS), TrustShadow is essentially a lightweight hardware-assisted runtime system.
