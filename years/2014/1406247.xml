<AbstractNarration>The networks with a very large number of nodes but each node having a relatively few neighbors  are abundant in the real world. The examples include, among others, the World Wide Web and the networks of brain neurons. These real-world networks can be effectively modeled by sparse random graphs where the links between the pair of vertices are added under certain stochastic rules. These random graphs have very complex geometry. One way to understand their geometry is to study what are called the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the graphs. For example, by looking at the eigenvalues and eigenvectors one can infer how congested the network is, or identify the different clusters present in the network. A significant part of this proposal is devoted to the study of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these sparse random graphs of which very little is known so far. These random graphs with the associated eigenvalues and eigenvectors are also used as a mathematical model to study the propagation of electrons in a disordered medium, that is, a medium with impurities. Some of the questions outlined in this proposal are motivated by the goal of understanding the transport of electromagnetic waves in disordered media. The proposed research will involve active collaborations between the PI and a number of researchers from various US and international universities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal consists of three directions of research in probability theory, all related to the spectra of sparse random graphs. The first part of this proposal deals with the study of eigenvalue distributions of the adjacency matrices of different models of random graphs with bounded average vertex degrees. In the limit, as the size of the graphs grows to infinity, these eigenvalue distributions exhibit a remarkably complex range of behaviors. The PI will study properties of the eigenvalue distribution for various sparse random graph models, including random graphs with a given degree distribution and percolations on Euclidean lattices, primarily focusing on three key features in the limiting eigenvalue distributions- existence of continuous part, finitely many atoms and gaps in the support. The adjacency matrix of a large sparse random graph can be used as a Hamiltonian for electron hopping on a disordered medium and the study of its eigenvalue distribution is a preliminary step towards understanding whether the medium behaves like a metal or an insulator at different energies. The second part of this proposal deals with a model which was introduced by Hatano and Nelson to study the motion of magnetic flux lines in semiconductors. This can be thought as a non-Hermitian analogue of the famous Anderson model in one dimension. Hatano and Nelson observed contrasting localization behaviors of the eigenvectors associated with the real and the complex eigenvalues. The PI proposes to investigate this phenomenon rigorously and try to understand so-called 'delocalization transition' of the eigenvectors. The final part of this proposal involves a couple of combinatorial optimization problems on sparse random graphs. Each of these problems deals with a combinatorial structure that is connected to the spectra of the underlying graph, but they are interesting on their own. One of them is to understand the behavior of the minimum weight perfect matching on the Euclidean lattices. The variants of this optimization problem has received a lot of attention in the literature. Overall, this proposal consists of a wide range of problems whose solutions will include a combination of a diverse set of tools and ideas from random matrix theory, random Schrodinger operators, graph theory, statistical physics, additive combinatorics and probability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The research outcome of the project may be classified according to several topics. One topic is to understand the eigenvalue distribution of the adjacency matrices of several models of large sparse random graphs. This is intimately connected to the behavior of electron transport in disordered media, which is of fundamental interest to both mathematicians and physicists. The PI and his collaborators' contributions in this direction are to develop two graph-theoretic tools to show the existence of continuous spectra in the limiting eigenvalue distribution. Our first approach is applicable to a wide class of locally tree-like random graphs including Erdos-Renyi random graphs and the random graphs with a given degree distribution. Our second tool, based on finding certain unique minimal path matching, can be applied to graphs with loops like two-dimensional bond percolation in the supercritical regime.    In a different direction, the PI and the collaborators investigated double roots of random polynomials. Like the eigenvalues of random matrices, the roots of a random polynomial tend to repel each other strongly. In the setting of integer coefficient distribution, repulsion is related to the probability of a double root being negligible. It was shown that the probability of double root indeed goes to zero as the degree gets larger, in the case when the coefficients of the polynomial are taken to be independent Rademacher random variables. Later this result was extended to include a more general integer-valued coefficient distribution. The method exploits the algebraic nature of the roots of a polynomial with integral coefficients. Even though random polynomials is a very classical topic in probability theory, the study about such singularity event of a random polynomial is new.

During the funding period, the PI has been actively engaged in undergraduate research and mentorship at the PI's institution.
