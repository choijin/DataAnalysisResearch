<AbstractNarration>Learning how to most effectively prepare the next generation of science teachers is essential for improving science learning for all students. The Science Educators for Urban Schools Phase 2 (SEUS 2) project at Boston College aims to support a total of 20 Scholars who are enrolled in the Masters of Education in Science Education program to prepare for initial licensure in secondary science and preliminary licensure in middle school general science through the Noyce Teacher Scholarship Phase II program.  SEUS 2 is a comprehensive urban teacher preparation program in the sciences that: i) includes effective strategies to recruit highly qualified and diverse applicants, a rigorous STEM teacher preparation curriculum, established support programs for pre- and in-service teachers, and opportunities for professional development; and ii) prepares the scholars to become and remain science teachers in urban schools. By developing and supporting additional highly qualified and diverse STEM teachers with Sheltered English Immersion endorsement who will teach in urban schools, the SEUS 2 program will address the Nation's shortage of science teachers, as described in the National Academies' report Rising Above the Gathering Storm (2007) and the recent Teacher Shortage Area Nationwide List (2013).  Moreover, an emphasis on recruiting scholars from underrepresented minority groups to serve as role models as teachers and the emphasis on social justice, which can be critical in maintaining motivation working in high-need schools, provide additional ways this project has broad significance to society.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SEUS 2 project will contribute to the existing body of knowledge by implementing and studying a model for developing and supporting an urban STEM teacher preparation program and adding to understanding about science teacher education and retention.  The project will build upon a recent successful Noyce Scholarship Phase I award, in which all 20 scholars who were supported are currently remain teaching science in urban schools.  The project will also leverage the existing Donovan Urban Scholars Program, high-quality support structures for new teachers, and strong relationships with six urban school districts including Boston Public Schools through the Boston Higher Education Partnership and community partners through Boston Connects. SEUS 2 will feature a rigorous teacher preparation program that adds a required Behavior Management course into the curriculum, additional internal recruitment activities beyond existing internal and external recruitment strategies, scholar participation in classroom-based research to improve science achievement in an urban context, a classroom-based performance assessment via a Master's Comprehensive Examination, biweekly online discussions for previous and current SEUS scholars, and support for new teachers to participate in NSTA conferences. The mixed methods evaluation plan and research investigations that include qualitative case studies, as well as monitoring, semi-structured interviews and year-end surveys of all SEUS scholars will increase the likelihood that the SEUS model for developing and supporting an urban STEM teacher education program can be adapted at other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

All graduates except the most recent Scholar (2020) are teaching in urban public schools. This is a major outcome given that current attrition rates of urban, public, school teachers range from 58% to 78% for 3-year and 43% to 64% for 5-year teachers (Papay, Bacher-Hicks, &amp; Page, 2017).
