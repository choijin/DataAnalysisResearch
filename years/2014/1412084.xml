<AbstractNarration>Proteins in the cell membrane play a role in integrating the cell with its surrounding environment.  For example, the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (called RAGE) has many functions including a role in immunity. An important aspect of membrane protein function is the ability to move throughout the entire cell membrane to interact with other biological components, and characterizing this movement is critical to understanding how these proteins function. This project provides missing information to advance the understanding of how other biological components affect RAGE movement in the cell membrane. The award also enables the training of graduate, undergraduate and high school students. Partners in these endeavors include two programs: one pre-college program aimed to increase the number of ethnically diverse Iowa students who pursue science degrees and the other aimed to helps Iowans understand biotechnology developments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Emily A. Smith from Iowa State University to characterize the effects of chemically-defined ligand binding events, cytoplasmic interactions, and other membrane components on RAGE diffusion and clustering using fluorescence microscopy combined with live cell measurements. The primary microscopy techniques to be used include single particle tracking, fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Details of the molecular mechanism of a pattern-recognition receptor including the effects of ligand affinity, valency, and chemical composition on RAGE clustering and diffusion will be elucidated for the first time. This project provides missing information to advance the understanding of an important receptor associated with innate immunity and numerous pathophysiological conditions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

They have many functions, for example they allow certain species to pass into the cell while&nbsp;rejecting others. They also allow information to pass into and out of the cell via a process called cell signaling. While many details are known&nbsp;of how cell membranes function, there is missing critical information. For example, it is not known how the properties of diffusion and clustering are involved in cell signaling for a membrane protein called receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE). This receptor is involved in cell signaling and inflammation and is part of the innate immune system. Understanding diffusion and clustering of RAGE has been the focus of the research that has been supported by this award. Measuring these properties requires specialized&nbsp;microscopy techniques that allow, for example, signals from single molecules or particles to be measured and tracked over time. The role of Diaphanous-1 and actin, two cytoplasmic proteins, in altering RAGE diffusion and clustering has been measured. In addition, the role of advanced glycation endproducts, a&nbsp;binding partner&nbsp;for RAGE, in altering RAGE diffusion and clustering and the role of specific amino acids in altering receptor diffusion have been elucidated. This work serves to further our understanding of the factors influencing RAGE function. The fundamental studies on cell membrane biophysics, including the measurement of the molecular mechanism of&nbsp;RAGE diffusion, are critical to many aspects of biological function. The studies and the data collected as a result of this award will benefit many areas of biological sciences. For example, aberrant RAGE function is thought to result in detrimental inflammation (a serious consequence of many classes of disease), and the fundamental studies that have been performed may one day serve as the foundation for the development of interventional therapies to prevent this inflammation. Understanding the fundamental biophysical aspects of RAGE may provide specific routes to alter the function of this receptor, including aspects of its function that may results in detrimental inflammation. In collaboration with synthetic chemists, we have also developed new tools that can be used in cellular imaging. These include developing and understanding the properties of molecules that can localize to specific cellular organelles and provide a signal only under controlled experimental conditions. These tools help to advance the next generation of advanced microscopies. The results of this research have been presented in numerous peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and academic seminar presentations. As a result of this award, five graduate students in chemistry at Iowa State University were supported in full or in part, including three female students and one student from an underrepresented group in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). This project has enabled all students to pursue research leading to their doctorate in chemistry; two students earned their Ph.D. during this award period. In addition, seven undergraduate students participated in undergraduate research opportunities, five high school students participated in summer research internships, and one high school teacher participate in summer research and curriculum development in the Smith laboratory as a result of this award. All the high school students were underrepresented students in STEM or from low income families, five of the undergraduate students were from an exchange program with Beijing Normal University, and one of the undergraduate students was from an underrepresented group in STEM. The award also allowed visits to the Smith research laboratory by four different high school groups and, in some cases, the students to gain hands-on experience using the research equipment. This provided them the opportunity to explore career paths they may not have otherwise been aware of, promoted science advocacy to all participants, encouraged students to consider or continue in a path towards a career in science, and promoted the need for science research and&nbsp;infrastructure in a productive society.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/25/2018<br>      Modified by: Emily&nbsp;A&nbsp;Smith</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
