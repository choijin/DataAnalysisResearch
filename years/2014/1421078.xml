<AbstractNarration>Quantum computers use the peculiar properties of quantum mechanics---superposition, entanglement, and interference---to do new kinds of information processing.  Large scale quantum computers could solve certain difficult problems that are beyond the ability of standard classical computers.  Building quantum computers is challenging due to decoherence---quantum noise---which disrupts the needed quantum effects.  The solution is fault-tolerant quantum computation:  quantum information is encoded in quantum error-correcting codes, and shielded from the effects of noise.  Theory shows that this will work if the decoherence rate is not too high, but most constructions require a daunting amount of overhead to do computation.  The number of quantum bits (qubits) and basic operations (quantum gates) needed are multiplied by a very large factor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will minimize the overhead required by encoding the qubits of the computation in multi-qubit storage blocks that achieve higher rates than most codes that have been studied before.  A small number of additional processor blocks will also be constructed, using a different quantum code.  These different codes allow different types of quantum gates to be done efficiently, so by choosing the right combination of codes, any quantum computation can be done: such a quantum computer is called universal.  Qubits are transferred between the code blocks by quantum teleportation, and are protected from decoherence at all times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project also takes a somewhat different tack on fault tolerance.  Rather than study conditions that allow quantum computations of arbitrarily large size, this research will ask, for a fixed choice of codes and a given level of decoherence, how large a quantum computation can be done.  Since in reality only computations up to a certain size can actually be done, this is the most immediately practical question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support two Ph.D. students at USC, and will be an active strand of research at USC's Center for Quantum Information Science and Technology (CQIST).  CQIST, and the PI, support education and outreach in the Los Angeles area and elsewhere, and also organize and sponsor international conferences on quantum information science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major obstacle to realizing large-scale quantum computers (QCs) is quantum noise, or decoherence.  QCs rely on delicate quantum interference effects for their advantage over ordinary classical computers; but this interference is easily disrupted by accidental couplings to the environment, or imprecision in the quantum operations.  The solution to this is known, in principle:  quantum error correction.  If the noise rate is low enough, one can encode the computation in a quantum error-correcting code, and detect and correct errors before they can disrupt the computation.  This approach is called fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC).  The obstacles, however, are still large.  For FTQC to be possible, the noise rates must be quite low; and existing schemes in general have a very high overhead, with every logical qubit of the computation being represented by thousands or tens of thousands of physical qubits.  In the near-term such schemes remain impractical.  This project pursues a different approach to FTQC that, in principle, could greatly reduce the overhead.  Existing schemes, for the most part, encode each logical qubit into a separate code block.  This is not very efficient, but simplifies the design of the encoded circuits.  One could instead encode the logical qubits into multi-qubit block codes with much higher rates, resulting in lower overhead.  But fault-tolerant computation then becomes more difficult.  In this project, a method has been worked out for quantum computation in such code blocks, based on logical teleportation, in which logical qubits are transferred within or between code blocks.  This scheme is fault-tolerant, but it requires the efficient preparation of large entangled ancilla states.  In this project, this preparation is done by a technique called ancilla distillation, in which a large number of noisy copies of the ancilla state are prepared, and then these are reduced to a smaller number of clean copies.  This project has only looked at a limited number of quantum error-correcting codes, but so far the results have been encouraging.  This work continues in a new NSF project, and we are hopeful that schemes similar to the ones studied here my be possible in intermediate-scale quantum computers with a few thousand physical qubits.
