<AbstractNarration>The Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS) will host a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program located at the BIOS marine research station in Bermuda. The program is held during the fall semester (12 weeks) and introduces eight undergraduate students per year to the techniques, skills and intellectual processes required to conduct research in oceanography and the marine sciences. Many REU research projects fall within the framework of the numerous long-term oceanographic programs at BIOS, but students also have opportunities to focus on near-shore processes including coral reef ecology, marine biodiversity, molecular biology, marine and atmospheric pollution and climate change. All REU students, regardless of project, have the opportunity to join BIOS scientists for a research cruise aboard the R/V Atlantic Explorer.  BIOS has an active education program that insures a diverse graduate student population, providing REU students with opportunities to interact with visiting students from Canada, the USA and the UK. Students also meet local scientists from the Bermuda Government and from industry.  Students leave the program better prepared to pursue professional careers and/or graduate programs by virtue of conducting mentored research projects including the design, implementation, analysis, and final write-up.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS) has hosted an NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site since 1991. Over the three year period 2015 to 2017 a total of 23 students attended the REU Program at BIOS. During their 12 week tenure, the students conducted independent research projects based on a variety of oceanographic and marine science topics, ranging from the small scale of marine bacteria and viruses to the large scale of ocean dynamics and circulation (see accompanying images). Many of the research projects fell within the framework of the numerous long-term ocean science programs conducted at BIOS. Students also had opportunities to focus on near-shore processes (e.g., water pollution, coral reef ecology, marine biodiversity), and topics related to marine atmospheric sciences and meteorology. All of the REU students at BIOS, regardless of the focus of their own project, had the opportunity to join scientists aboard the institute's ocean-going research vessel, the&nbsp;<em>R/V Atlantic Explorer</em>, participating in a 24 hour oceanographic research cruise.</p> <p>REU students at BIOS were encouraged to take full responsibility for their research and largely were in charge of the day-to-day management of their projects, allowing them to learn valuable skills in sustaining a research project, meeting deadlines, troubleshooting, planning, and time management. Furthermore, BIOS is a multi-disciplinary institution and so students were exposed to a diverse range of research activities being conducted by BIOS faculty, visiting scientists, and other students. Since BIOS is a small campus, REU students had ample opportunity to get to know faculty and staff through a range of activities (e.g., research seminars and lectures, communal mealtimes, and sports and recreation activities hosted at BIOS). BIOS also has many active teaching programs during the Fall semester when REU students are resident; this ensured a diverse student population that included students from the US, Canada, Europe, and beyond. Thus, REU students were presented with an insight to the global and collaborative nature of scientific research.</p> <p>In addition to devising, conducting and analysing their own independent research projects, the REU students attended a series of workshops and seminars to promote their research skills, science communication, and career development. They also had to regularly present seminars describing the scope and progress of their work to their peers, mentors, and other students. At the end of the program, REU students presented a final seminar of their work to the entire BIOS staff and also submitted manuscripts in the format of an appropriate research journal. To date, one peer-reviewed scientific paper has been published by the 2015-17 cohort of BIOS REU students and their mentors, and 10 of the students have made presentations at national and international scientific symposia.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/07/2019<br>      Modified by: Andrew&nbsp;J&nbsp;Peters</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460686/1460686_10355548_1559936801062_2015-REU-class-photo01--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460686/1460686_10355548_1559936801062_2015-REU-class-photo01--rgov-800width.jpg" title="BIOS REU 2015"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460686/1460686_10355548_1559936801062_2015-REU-class-photo01--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="BIOS REU 2015"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The REU Class of 2015 at BIOS, students, mentors, and BIOS administrative staff.</div> <div class="imageCredit">BIOS</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Andrew&nbsp;J&nbsp;Peters</div> <div class="imageTitle">BIOS REU 2015</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460686/1460686_10355548_1559937059502_2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460686/1460686_10355548_1559937059502_2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU Student Diver"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460686/1460686_10355548_1559937059502_2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU Student Diver"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">REU students at BIOS have the opportunity to conduct fieldwork in a wide range of marine environments, including the surrounding coral reef system.</div> <div class="imageCredit">BIOS</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Andrew&nbsp;J&nbsp;Peters</div> <div class="imageTitle">REU Student Diver</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460686/1460686_10355548_1559937205808_2017-REU-Alex-Lundberg01--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460686/1460686_10355548_1559937205808_2017-REU-Alex-Lundberg01--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU Laboratory Work 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1460686/1460686_10355548_1559937205808_2017-REU-Alex-Lundberg01--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU Laboratory Work 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">BIOS REU students devise, conduct and analyze their own experimental research project.
