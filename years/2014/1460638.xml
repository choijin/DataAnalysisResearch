<AbstractNarration>Commutative algebra and algebraic geometry are the study of the algebraic and geometric properties of systems of non-linear equations. By contrast, linear algebra, a fundamental tool of the sciences, is the study of linear systems of equations. Often linear equations do not suffice to describe complex systems, and higher degree polynomials must be used. Commutative algebras provide models, called rings, of systems of polynomial equations where one can add and multiply. The rings studied in this proposal usually come from a system of polynomial equations.  By studying the properties of this model, one can then better understand the original system of equations. There are two main methods. One is to understand the theory of modules over such rings. Modules are a type of special representation of spaces where the equations hold. Studying these models has been an extremely effective way to study equations. The other main technical method is to study the same basic equations in rings which are reduced modulo a prime number. In such a system, arithmetic becomes easier. For instance modulo 2 means that every even number is thought of as 0, and all odd numbers as 1. This has a number of profound advantages which are used throughout this project. This project has a substantial educational component. The PI has served as PhD advisor and postdoc mentor to many researchers, and will continue this level of activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will investigate several aspects of commutative algebras which all fall under the rubric of uniformity.  Three fundamental questions on symbolic powers of ideals and their relationship to regular powers are proposed. Significant partial results have been obtained. The PI will also investigate a fundamental question of Stillman concerning the complexity of equations.  A variety of other problems will be studied, including classification of Golod rings, existence of rigid modules, the structure of iterated socles, and the development of Frobenius Betti numbers and their properties. Several of the projects are intended for collaboration with graduate students, postdocs, and young researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant was used to support graduate students, visiting researchers and myself doing research in the field of commutative algebra.   This field is the study of solutions of systems of polynomials equations. It can be thought of as a generalized and more powerful version of linear algebra, which studies linear polynomial equations. Linear algebra is one of the most basic areas of mathematics, used in virtually every area and application.  In commutative algebra one allows finer nuanced equations of higher degrees. The method by which I study these equations if by creating a type of generic solution and then by studying the properties of this generic solution as a way to understand general solutions.  Formally, one  creates an object called a "ring" which gives a type of genericsolution.  The efficacy of this method is that one can now use powerful homological tools as well as a method called "reduction to characteristic p". In this new arithmetic, the prime number p becomes 0. For example, characteristic 2 only distinguished between odd and even integers: all even integers become 0, and all odd integers become 1. Such reductions becomes extremely useful due to the unique properties of the Frobneius map which raises elements to theirpth powers.  Of particular importance is what happens near singular solutions. A singular solution is one where there are not well-defined tangent planes.   In this project, particular attention is paid to the uniform properties the space of solutions possess. Uniformity means effective bounds on homological invariants, or showing the existence of such bounds. Basic inequalities relating numerical measures of singularities were intensely studied.  I have disseminated the research through publications in refereed journals, through giving many talks, and through the organization of workshops which bring experts together.  The project supported the travel and work of graduate students. The PI also worked with many collaborators.       Last Modified: 05/06/2019       Submitted by: Craig L Huneke]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
