<AbstractNarration>Polymers find ubiquitous applications in modern civilization.  However, polymers are generally regarded as poor heat conductors, while many applications would benefit from polymer materials that are able to function as good heat conductors.  Recent studies have suggested polymer materials that have been significantly stretched could have substantially enhanced mechanical strength and heat conduction.  We therefore aim to study the mechanical and thermal properties of nanoscale fibers formed in a jet that induces significant stretching.  We expect that heat transport in these nanofibers may be profoundly enhanced compared to larger, unstretched versions of the same polymer.  We will study how the jet stretches the polymer molecules, and how the resulting molecular orientation in turn results in enhanced mechanical strength and heat conduction, which may eventually lead to exciting new polymer materials that are extremely strong, flexible, and good conductors of heat.  Such materials would enable a variety of applications, such as flexible electronics and displays, solar cells, and advanced structural materials integrated with high-power electronics, leading to significant future technological advancements.  The project has integrated research and educational components to train graduate students in an interdisciplinary environment, and to extend the impact to underrepresented minorities through collaboration between Vanderbilt and Fisk universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to correlate the manufacturing process conditions, structure, as well as mechanical and thermal properties of electrospun polymer nanofibers.  The approach is to integrate informed control of the electrospinning process, mechanical and thermal transport property measurement, thorough microstructural characterization, and theoretical analysis to achieve an in-depth understanding of how electrospinning parameters affect nanofiber microstructure, mechanical and thermal properties.  The structure and property characterization will be performed at an individual nanofiber level, thereby avoiding averaging over potential fiber heterogeneity.  Microstructure will be characterized using micro-Raman spectroscopy, a technique which is able to provide detailed information about molecular composition and orientation from a small sample volume.  Mechanical properties of individual nanofibers will be characterized using an atomic force microscope to perform a 3-point bend test.  Thermal properties of individual nanofibers will be measured using custom-built microdevices.  With an understanding of how electrospinning parameters affect microstructure, and the interplay between microstructure and mechanical/thermal properties, we will be able to optimize deposition parameters to achieve polymeric materials with tunable mechanical and thermal properties.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of the project was to correlate the manufacturing process conditions with the structural,  mechanical, and thermal properties of electrospun polymer nanofibers.  The proposed approach integrated informed control of the electrospinning process, mechanical and thermal transport property measurement, and theoretical analysis to achieve an in-depth understanding of how electrospinning parameters affect nanofiber microstructure, and how this microstructure affects the mechanical strength and thermal conductivity of these highly oriented fibers.  Initially, we explored the relation among the electrospinning voltage, resulted nanofiber structure, and the corresponding thermal conductivity.  Results show that electrospun PE nanofibers exhibit thermal conductivity that can be significantly higher than bulk values (~0.4 W/m-K), with the highest value measured as 9.3 W/m-K.  This thermal conductivity enhancement is due to the higher degree of molecular orientation and enhanced level of crystallinity, as evidenced by the micro-Raman spectroscopy characterization.  A general trend of higher thermal conductivity with larger electrospinning voltage was observed; however, it was also found that the thermal conductivity for fibers prepared with the same voltage could vary significantly, likely due to the ?whipping instability? in the electrospinning process.  Due to the limitations of our current instrumentation, the maximum electrospinning voltage achieved was 52 kV.  Given that electrospinning is a quick and low cost process to produce nanofibers with enhanced thermal conductivity, this study points to the potential of electrospun polymer nanofibers as materials with good thermal transport properties.     Expanding beyond PE fibers, we measured the thermal conductivities and Young?s moduli of three different types of vinyl polymer nanofibers, i.e., PVDF, PVA and PVC, fabricated by electrospinning, using the thermal bridge method and three-point bending method, respectively. These fibers have chain structure and alignments, with only one different unit attached to the carbon backbone in each monomer. Importantly, the molecular orientation and crystallinity of individual nanofibers were characterized using polarized micro-Raman spectroscopy to correlate with the measured thermal property&#12290;  Experimental data indicate that in addition to molecular chain orientation, the molecular composition and structure can also have important effects on the thermal transport properties. Side groups containing heavier atoms tend to reduce the nanofiber thermal conductivity.  PVA nanofibers have higher Young?s moduli than PVC due to the smaller chain cross section area. Young?s moduli of PVDF nanofibers are comparable to PVC because of the existence of &alpha; phase crystalline chains.     1) Successfully fabricated PE, PVDF, PVC  and PVA nanofibers  2) Conducted optical, structural and thermal conductivity measurements of different sized PE nanofibers  3)  Studied the side-chain functional group affects on ploymer crystal structure and thermal transport  4) Trained and awarded one female MS degree in single polymer nanofiber research  5)  Trained three undergraduate students in a) electrospun polymer nanofiber fabrication  6)  Trained  two undergraduate students to use PVDF nanofibers as the multifunctional material backbone for pressure and temperature sensory applications.  7).
