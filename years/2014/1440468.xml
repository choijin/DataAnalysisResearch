<AbstractNarration>One of the fastest growing consumers of Natural Gas (NG) is the electricity sector, through the use of NG-fired power plants. Already a large portion of the electricity portfolio mix in many regions in the US, NG-fired power generation is increasing even further with growing penetration of renewable energy due to the former?s fast, on-demand response capabilities, and latter?s characteristics of intermittency and uncertainty. As a result, NG and electricity networks are getting increasingly linked and interdependent. Tighter coordination and information sharing between electric grid operators and NG suppliers is therefore becoming highly necessary to have a resilient interdependent critical infrastructure of electricity and NG. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks to create computational models of this infrastructure, gain analytical insight into the existing infrastructure in response to system and policy changes, and design guidelines for a coordinated infrastructure with improved resilience. These models are based, wherever possible, on real data from industrial partners and incorporate scaled versions of the electrical and NG networks of the New England area.  Specific tools to reach these objectives include security constrained unit commitment, a powerful tool that provides optimal dispatch of power generation for a given network topology and policies, dynamic market mechanisms and hybrid network science,  that permit analysis of uncertainty on the infrastructure, and cyber-security based resiliency tools for malicious and non-malicious events.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The goals of this proposal was to create computational models of the electricity and natural gas (NG) interdependent critical infrastructures (ICI), and using these models, gain analytical insight into the existing ICI in response to security, system and policy changes, and design guidelines for a coordinated ICI with improved security and resilience.   Intellectual Merit  The objectives of the proposal were to develop (a) models of the electricity and NG ICI with focus on the New England networks and (b) strategies that will guide resiliency of the overall ICI. The model will be capable of identifying major anomalies (outages and malicious attacks) of the ICI arising from the interconnections, and quantify uncertainties, constraints, and operating conditions that engender these abnormalities. In particular, the model provided 1) analytical insights into the implications of having limited NG deliverability on the operation and reliability of electric power systems, and 2) helped identify NG infrastructure components that will be critical to support the flexible operation of NG-fired power plants as their share of the total capacity and generation mix grows alongside the increasing penetration of intermittent generation.   The fact that both the electricity and gas networks are large and are intricately interconnected introduces significant complexities. Also, the impact of policy/regulatory changes in NG-electricity market coordination are highly difficult to model as well. Characterization of malicious cyber anomalies at the infrastructure and market level is highly challenging as well. Our specific tools to reach these objectives include security constrained unit commitment (SCUC), it provides optimal dispatch of power generation for a given network topology and policies, dynamic market mechanisms and hybrid network science and equivalent dynamic models of the SCUC that permit analysis of uncertainty on the ICI as well as design guidelines and framework for resilience and cyber-security based on resiliency tools for malicious and non malicious events.   Our unique and highly interdisciplinary team allowed us to realize the proposed objectives, in complex dynamic systems, large-scale systems modeling, regulatory economics, market interactions, and cybersecurity.   Broader Impact         The proposed research provided the science and technology for a foundation in any and all interdependent critical infrastructure systems ranging from finance and energy to telecommunication and transportation. In addition to training the graduate and undergraduate students, and mentoring post-doctoral associates, who gained multi-domain expertise in dynamics and control, optimization, systems modeling, market interactions, regulatory economics, network communication and cyber- security, we developed a undergraduaet and graduate course on hybrid system modeling, power systems, regulatory economics, and market interactions.
