<AbstractNarration>Project title: Conformational flexibility in Beclin 1, an evolutionarily-conserved, key autophagy protein&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Autophagy is a critical cell survival pathway responsible for nutrient recycling due to degradation of unwanted, damaged or harmful cellular components.  Autophagy plays an important role in several key organismal processes including embryonic development, tissue differentiation, cell-growth, as well as surviving environmental stress and internal stressors like damaged organelles, mutant proteins, free radicals and intracellular pathogens.  Beclin1, a protein essential for autophagy, has been directly implicated in these processes.  This research will focus on understanding the atomic-resolution structure and flexibility of Beclin1 to provide a better understanding of its critical role in autophagy and cellular maintenance.  This project will provide graduate and undergraduate students in North Dakota an unprecedented opportunity to train in classical and cutting edge methods of biophysical and biochemical research, and also have a substantial impact outside the laboratory by educating high-school teachers about biomacromolecular structure and function.  Over the period of this project, 40 high-school science teachers will participate in a summer professional development course to help them instruct their students in understanding the structures of biomacromolecules such as proteins and DNA.  Thus, the educational activities outlined in this project are designed to educate and mentor students at all levels: high school, undergraduate and graduate; and will have a broader impact far beyond the grant funding period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beclin1 appears to be a protein interaction hub for autophagy as it binds to over twenty diverse cellular proteins.  The research goal of this project is to better understand how Beclin 1 interacts with so many different partners by establishing its structure and conformational flexibility and identifying residues that are key for function.  Circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy will be used to assess secondary structure content, backbone flexibility and dynamic conformational changes.  High-resolution structures will be determined by X-ray crystallography or NMR. Small-angle X-ray scattering will be used to obtain low-resolution structural information such as size, oligomerization and molecular envelopes.  Combined information from these methods will be used to derive a pseudo-atomic model of full-length Beclin1. The role of motifs and conserved residues in binding will be examined using isothermal titration calorimetry to quantify the thermodynamics of interaction and by cellular assays to assess the impact of mutations on cellular autophagy levels and binding of selected key autophagy proteins.  Last, but not least, this research will provide substantial information about poorly understood intrinsically disordered regions and help establish methodology essential for investigating such regions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>The goal of this research project</strong> was to elucidate the structural bases of the mechanism of Beclin 1/BECN1, which is highly conserved in all eukaryotes and is a key protein for autophagy, a critical cellular eukaryotic homeostasis pathway, responsible for the removal of unwanted cytoplasmic components to enable nutrient recycling.&nbsp; BECN1 is a required component of the autophagy nucleation complex and also plays a role in autophagosome maturation. Additionally, it has roles in vacuolar protein sorting and apoptosis. This research is potentially transformative as it advances our mechanistic understanding of BECN1 in all these homeostasis pathways.</p> <p>Our bioinformatics, biochemical, biophysical and structural studies enabled us to provide an understanding of BECN1 structure and conformational flexibility by systematically characterizing single and multiple-domain constructs, culminating in full-length BECN1. We have delineated four structural domains in human BECN1 (Fig.1): the intrinsically disordered region (IDR, residues 1-130), the flexible helical domain (FHD, residues 141-171), the coiled-coil domain (CCD, residues 175-265) and the b-a-repeat in autophagy domain (BARAD, residues 248-450). We established BECN1 oligomerization, structure, and conformational flexibilty, including intra-molecular and selected inter-molecular interactions, and elucidated the role of highly conserved BECN1 residues. We showed that BECN1 is a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding, conformationally-flexible protein. It undergoes multiple binding-associated conformational transitions, which appears key to the BECN1 mechanism as a signaling hub that integrates multiple signals to regulate autophagy in response to multiple stressors. This research is reported in 20 publications.</p> <p>Our research was accomplished using various molecular biology techniques, biochemical methods, as well as biophysical and structural techniques such as circular dichroism spectroscopy, Isothermal titration calorimetry, tandem size-exclusion chromatography and small-angle X-ray scattering, multiple-angle light scattering, Hydrogen-Deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and X-ray Crystallography.</p> <p>This research lays the groundwork for interrogating the diverse interactions of BECN1 and probe dynamic conformational rearrangements of BECN1 to better understand how different signals compete or complement each other to regulate autophagy. This will be facilitated by the reagents created by this research that enable us to reproducibly produce twenty different single and multi-domain BECN1 domain constructs, including full-length BECN1. Indeed, we have already probed interactions of BECN1 with autophagy inhibitors such as human and viral BCL2s and GAPR1, as well as ATG14, a key component of the autophagosome nucleation complex.</p> <p>The multiple <strong>educational activities</strong> funded by this award reached students at all levels: graduate, undergraduate. high school and also K-12 teachers; by providing didactic active-learning opportunities using level-appropriate pedagogical tools to foster interest in the molecular basis of life and unprecedented modern structural biology research opportunities in ND.</p> <p>11 graduate students were / are being trained in and performed research supporting this grant, and have benefitted from mastering the cutting-edge methods listed above. This includes 8 female, one African American, one Hispanic, and one first-generation student. The work outlined in this grant comprises a significant component of the dissertation research of 5 graduate students. Each one of these students has won awards and/or fellowships at departmental, college, university and state levels. All my students have opportunities to present their research at university forums, and at regional and national meetings. All my Ph.D. graduates obtained postdoctoral positions in prestigious universities or lead scientific teams at biotechnology companies.</p> <p>Over the course of this award we have provided research opportunities to 18 undergraduate students including 3 African-American, 2 Hispanic students, 8 first-generation students, and 10 female students. Each of these students was paired with a graduate student which had the dual benefit of providing undergraduates with easily-accessible mentors, and graduate students opportunities to develop invaluable professional skills in mentoring, teaching and leading. Almost all these undergraduates have successfully graduated and continued in scientific fields. Undergraduates trained in my laboratory are in high demand by local Biotech industries, and have been very successful in joining medical and graduate programs at R1 universities.&nbsp;</p> <p>This award also enabled K-12 outreach and education. During the award period we provided unique summer research experiences to 8 ND high school students, including 5 female, one African American, and one Hispanic student, sparking their continued interest in biochemistry/biophysics research.</p> <p>Lastly, I developed and taught a 3-credit, graduate-level, summer class for STEM teachers, providing a unique professional development opportunity enabling teachers to incorporate items listed in the National Science Education Standards in their instruction. The course goals were to ensure that high-school teachers are well-versed in principles of biomolecular structure, and provide pedagogical tools to disseminate this information. The 17 STEM teachers who participated in this course over the award duration found it very valuable. The pedagogical tools and hands-on modeling sessions, wherein participants built complex biomacromolecular models (Figs.2-4), were especially appreciated. This will impact each of these teacher?s numerous students far beyond the period funded by this grant.</p> <p>Thus, the integrated educational and research activities performed over this award?s funding period have had an unprecedented broader impact in the region.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/23/2021<br>      Modified by: Sangita&nbsp;Sinha</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1413525/1413525_10339366_1627076550961_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1413525/1413525_10339366_1627076550961_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1413525/1413525_10339366_1627076550961_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">BECN1 domain architecture.
