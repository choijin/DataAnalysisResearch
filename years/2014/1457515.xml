<AbstractNarration>Tropical forests are famous for their high diversity, as well as the large number of rare species they harbor.  Recent studies have found that, compared to common species, rare tropical tree species suffer more from pathogens that are specialized to a single host species that then spread rapidly through dense patches of seedlings of that single host.  This research will test the novel hypothesis that rare species are more strongly impacted by host-specific pathogens because they have lower diversity of resistance genes at the population level, such that all their seedlings will be susceptible to the same suite of pathogens, promoting rapid pathogen spread and increasing mortality rates.  This hypothesis will be tested using experimental greenhouse and field studies, combined with genetic analyses that will quantify the diversity of resistance genes for rare and common tree species in lowland tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Computer simulations will also be used to examine whether the measured differences in resistance gene diversity would impact infection levels, mortality rates and local abundance of tree species. Results of this study will improve understanding of plant-pathogen interactions, with potential applications for agriculture and horticulture (e.g. increasing pathogen resistance in crops). Hands-on training in cutting-edge genetic techniques would be provided to a wider audience through a summer workshop for students and faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will be the first to obtain large transcriptome datasets from a tree community and will provide gene sequence data that will be informative for future studies of genetic diversity in tropical forests. Examination of the effects of resistance gene diversity on forest dynamics will bridge the gap between molecular evolution studies that indicate ongoing selection for multiple resistance genes at many loci, and how this diversity functions in nature. Furthermore, this study is likely to bridge competing theories for tropical plant diversity by providing a genetic explanation for why rare tree species are more strongly controlled by their species-specific enemies, while simultaneously supporting dispersal limitation as a feature determining which species are locally dominant. Ultimately, the study should elucidate whether local rarity restricts local genetic diversity, which in turn reinforces local rarity, a cycle that can be escaped only by recruitment of new alleles via long-distance pollen or seed movement. Demonstrating such a coupling between the ecological and genetic features of populations would bring new perspectives and avenues for theoretical advances in evolution and ecology. The project will provide research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a postdoctoral researcher.</AbstractNarration>

Understanding how so many plant species can coexist, without one or a handful of competitively dominant species driving weaker species to extinction, has long been a challenge for ecologists. One explanation for how high numbers of plant species are maintained in tropical forests is that each species is kept in check by its host-specific natural enemies, such as fungal pathogens or insect herbivores. Such enemies can cause negative density dependence (NDD), where an individual has a lower chance of surviving when growing surrounded by neighbors of its own species rather than other species. NDD can prevent any one species from becoming dominant in the community because as a species becomes more common, its seedlings are more likely to be surrounded by high densities of their own species. This increases their chance of being attacked by their specialized herbivores and pathogens, thereby reducing seedling survival. Recent studies have revealed that tropical tree species differ in their sensitivity to neighbors of their own species, primarily due to differences in the impact of pathogens found in the soil beneath adult trees.
