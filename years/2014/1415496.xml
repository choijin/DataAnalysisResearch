<AbstractNarration>Motivation.  At the core of many societal challenges, particularly in view of sustainability and efficiency, there are hard optimization problems. While these underlying problems can be solved for smaller setups using optimization methods, realistic problem sizes are still prohibitive. Apart from the immediate challenges arising from sheer size, in today's fast-paced and intertwined economies we additionally face the challenge of addressing real-time aspects; otherwise, the obtained solutions might not apply anymore: the problem changed faster than it was solved. This EAGER addresses specific optimization problems arising from societal challenges and will motivate the study of the underlying optimization problems. For this, new methods at the intersection of continuous and discrete optimization as well as machine learning and randomization will be developed.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. PIs set out to investigate general solution strategies to address problem size, real-time requirements, as well as uncertainty aspects using recent developments from theoretical computer science and modern optimization theory. At the core of this proposal is the study of real-world challenges related to cargo-vessel routing, palletizing, vehicle and mobile bot routing and related problems. A main difference to classical approaches is that the real-time requirements will not be added on top but will be integral to the whole design process, which is likely to result in better algorithms. Apart from the challenges from the aforementioned problems, PIs intend to develop an online expert system - Ask Minmax. This platform will leverage machine learning techniques to make the theory of optimization methods and tools accessible to industry and other personnel that face challenging optimization problems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. A key objective of this proposal is outreach. This EAGER will develop a consulting tool that will allow industry and the broader society to learn about most useful methods in algorithms and optimization. In particular, this tool is geared towards helping the user to make a decision regarding which methods are most likely to be applicable to their problem: in an interactive way the tool will collect information from the user about their optimization problem. The system will then determine the most likely model and provide information. Large-scale challenges in palletizing and routing require the combination of various heuristics and algorithms. A second component that will significantly impact industry is the developing of key performance indicators for such algorithms. These metrics will help to gauge efficiency of a particular heuristic and/or algorithms, which will be important when algorithms are combined within a larger solution. Mentoring and collaborating with a graduate student, a shared postdoctoral student across multiple EAGERs, as well as hosting a workshop in relevant frontier topics at the Institute for Mathematics and Applications (IMA) are all parts of the broader impact of this EAGER.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project is one of three Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGERs) that was funded to jointly accomplish a challenging task.  The overarching mission was to develop novel algorithmic solutions to tackle 21st century?s computational challenges by bringing in multi-disciplinary strength from discrete and continuous optimization, machine learning, robotics, signal processing, statistics, and theoretical computer science.  The impetus arose from,  on one hand the challenges posed by the ubiquitous, noisy, large data, and on the other the realization that no one discipline could conquer alone!     More concretely, the aim was to identify specific optimization problems arising from societal challenges and to motivate the study of the underlying optimization problems. As such an important goal was to develop rigorous and systematic approaches to discrete optimization problems by combining insights and state-of-the-art methods from integer programming (e.g., cutting planes and branch-and-bound) and algorithmic ideas from computer science (including online algorithms and machine learning). Another goal was the development of continuous (particularly, convex) optimization methods in statistical inference and machine learning; and also the development of applications to modern challenges of large, uncertain and partially specified data sets and new applications.     The accomplishments included machine learning to learn objective functions in optimization problems, theoretical studies of the properties of polyhedra and developing branching techniques in search algorithms for solving large integer programs.  Research on various aspects of convex optimization, including faster algorithms for the general case and many special cases, compressed sensing, statistical measurement and inference and applications ranging from evolution to networks.     Other accomplishments were as follows. The investigators published a survey detailing the state-of-the-art methods (including practically useful heuristics) and outstanding challenges in multi-dimensional bin packing problems. These problems  arise in everyday palletizing and shipping (groceries and other items by human or autonomous vehicles), routing autonomous vehicles, traffic routing and routing data through networks, and more generally in scheduling tasks and resource allocation.     The PIs and students developed a basic version of an ambitious optimization platform titled, Ask MinMax. The interactive expert system, employing Bayesian learning as well as more recent machine learning techniques, attempts to help non-experts figure out the type of optimization problem they are confronted with. Currently the platform supports the diagnosis of combinatorial optimization problems, while plans are underway to enhance the scope and efficacy of this AI machine of sorts for optimization purposes.     Several algorithms were designed bringing in expertise from learning theory, game theory and optimization in solving mechanism design and auction related computational problems. Tools from dynamical systems and probability theory (Markov chain convergence) helped analyze the so-called replicator dynamics, of interest to researchers in population genetics as well as computational game theory.  The researchers identified the crucial role played by mutation in the survival of a population, by way of facilitating diversity to withstand a changing and potentially hostile environment.     Several undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral researchers were involved or exposed to the exciting aspects of this research project.  Interdisciplinary workshops were also organized in getting the larger community of researchers involved. The project also led to new collaborations between the PIs from different disciplines: Electrical Engineering, Operations Research, Robotics, Statistics and Theory of Computing.
