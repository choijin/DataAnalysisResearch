<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Gerald Meyer of the Department of Chemistry at The University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill will develop new classes of molecular materials with interesting optoelectronic properties.  The goal of this research is to understand the fundamental nature of interactions between light-absorbing, redox-active molecules anchored to metal oxide surfaces.  Optimization of desired interactions will enable applications for the conversion of sunlight to electrical power. The project required inorganic and materials synthesis as well as solar cell fabrication that is well suited to the education of scientists at all levels.  This group is also well-positioned to provide the highest level of education and training for students underrepresented in science.  Outreach activities for K-12 students involving presentations at the local library and Science Center will also be part of the funded project.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transition metal polypyridyl complexes display a rich array of photophysical and electron transfer properties when anchored to oxide surfaces.  The proposed studies focus on lateral intermolecular electron- and energy-transfer self-exchange reactions that provide a molecular basis for the transport of charge or energy across the oxide surface.  The redox activity will be exploited as a new class of 'hole-transport' materials for application in solar cells.  A newly developed time-resolved polarization anisotropy technique will be exploited to characterize lateral charge transfer reactions that may occur after excited state injection into wide band gap semiconducting oxides such as TiO2.  These studies will be complimented by thermal electron transfer studies and modelling through Monte Carlo simulations.  A fundamental goal is to establish how molecular structure influences the lateral self-exchange rate constants.  Particular attention will be placed on Cu(II/I) and Co(II/I) self-exchange reactions that involve transfer of an electron and a ligand, behavior that may result in what has been termed structurally 'gated' electron transfer.  The Marcus cross-relation will be tested to elucidate whether lateral electron transfer reactions that involve chemical change can be accurately predicted with the measured self-exchange rate constants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The quest for new materials with tailored interfaces that efficiently harvest solar energy and convert them to redox equivalents that can be stored as a fuel or converted to electrical power is of critical importance.  This project successfully created new materials with molecular-oxide interfaces that harvest sunlight, create redox equivalents through excited state electron transfer, and translate charge away from the injection site that impact this quest.  Specific emphasis was placed on the translation of charge wherein lateral self-exchange electron transfer reactions (termed hole-hopping) were characterized.  The importance of these reactions is that they provide a molecular basis to transport charge without a loss in free energy.  An unexpected finding linked hole-hopping to a deleterious recombination reaction that lowers solar-to-electrical energy conversion.  Furthermore, it was shown that synthetic design can be utilized to tune hope-hopping rate constants by order of magnitude. Hence the data provide new insights and a means by which the desired reactivity can be optimized.  In the long term, the results from this project will help provide an environmentally benign energy resource that promises a tremendous impact for generations to come.  A broad impact is assured as this project educated a diverse groups of scientists who have already become professionals and have forged interdisciplinary links between molecular coordination chemistry and materials science.  Outreach to grade school students in local and rural North Carolina was also successful in generating excitement about chemistry and renewable energy research.  The advances that resulted from this project were presented at colleges, universities, and national and international meetings, as well as in seven publications and two Ph.D. dissertations.
