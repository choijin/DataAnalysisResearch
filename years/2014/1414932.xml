<AbstractNarration>Over the past 150 years, human activities have doubled the concentration of reactive nitrogen (Nr) entering the terrestrial nitrogen cycle. Excess nitrogen in the environment is detrimental to human health and has been linked to soil acidification, eutrophication, and decreases in biodiversity. China's rapid economic development in the last 30 years has made it the world's largest emitter of Nr.  As a result, China is currently experiencing some of the worst pollution problems on Earth.  Since Nr affects the soil, water, and air, a better understanding of how nitrogen moves between point sources and ecosystem components is necessary in order to develop strong models for predicting the outcomes of mitigation efforts. This project will investigate the feasibility of using the nitrogen isotope signatures of tree rings, foliage, and soil as indicators of changes in pollution sources and nitrogen uptake of plants in the Yinchuan Plain, China. Due to high pollution levels within the study area, the research will serve as a good case study for testing these methods then potentially applying them elsewhere, including the United States, which also experiences the harmful effects of high reactive nitrogen emissions.  The research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Hui Qian at Chang'an University in Xi'an, China.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Differences in the delta15N signature of tree rings, foliage, and soil have been used to infer changes in the cycling of N in the surrounding ecosystem.  Tree ring 15N can indicate changes in the source of N deposition.  Additionally, stable isotopes of carbon (delta13C) and oxygen (delta18O) as well as dendrochronological methods will be used to determine if there are changes in the physiological functioning and growth rates of forests in the Yinchuan Plain due to increases in Nr emissions within the valley. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funding through an NSF East Asia and Pacific Summer Institute (EAPSI) fellowship was used to pursue a research project and strengthen collaborations with scientists at ChangÆan UniversityÆs School of Environmental Science and Engineering in XiÆan, China for two months in the summer of 2014.   The inexpensive manufacturing of nitrogen (N) fertilizer has greatly increased agricultural productivity.  This enables the production of food and the growth of human populations beyond the levels that natural N fixation could otherwise support.   However, the negative consequences of high reactive nitrogen (Nr) emissions are substantial. Strong models for predicting the outcomes of mitigation efforts require an understanding of how nitrogen cycles between ecosystem components, especially in forests where substantial gaps exist in our knowledge of N cycling following the long term deposition of Nr and acute deposition from deliberate fertilization. My research in the lab of Dr. Qian Hui involved the measurement of the stable isotope signatures (&delta; 15N and &delta;13C) of tree rings, foliage, and soil along a forested transect radiating out from a large N fertilizer plant 80km east of XiÆan.  The purpose was to determine if isotopic signatures reflect the change in N source and the physiological functioning of trees in response to increased air pollution over the past 10-20 years.  Results indicate that sites closer to the plant have higher soil pH and higher N concentrations.  The foliar biomass sampled had negtive &delta;15N signatures for all sites.  The sites closer the plant were significantly more depleted in 15N than the sites farther from the plant.  The higher pH at the closer sites is indicative of higher deposition from the fertilizer plant.  Unlike fertilizer factories in the United States which would typically produce urea N fertilizer (CO(NH2)2) which can acidify the soil, this factory produces ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) whose deposition could both increase soil N and pH.
