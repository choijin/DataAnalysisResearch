<AbstractNarration>This proposal outlines a Workshop for Aspiring PIs in Cyber-Physical Systems. The invitation-only workshop will take place over 1.5 days, and include early-career researchers with interests in cyber-physical systems who have not previously been funded by the NSF CPS solicitation but who have submitted proposals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will help aspiring PIs understand what NSF (and importantly, the panels convened by NSF) are expecting to see in a successful CPS proposal. The workshop will include exciting talks by CPS program grantees as well as NSF CPS Program Officers, along with panel discussions with researchers as well as program officers. The agenda also plans significant time for discussions between aspiring PIs and panelists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will enlarge the CPS research community. It will help early-stage researchers better understand CPS program goals, provide opportunities for interaction with program leadership, and result in significant improvement in the quality of CPS project ideas from the community and better alignment with program goals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The workshop was held 18-19 February 2014, and was sponsored by the National Science Foundation. Invitations were issued to researchers with interests and potential impact in Cyber-Physical Systems, with a special emphasis on participation by early career researchers, based on their responses to the call for participation. The goal of the workshop is to help aspiring PIs understand what NSF (and importantly, the panels convened by NSF) are expecting to see in a successful CPS proposal.  Talks by NSF Program Directors and currently funded CPS Principal Investigators provided the main program, and interaction was supplemented by time set aside for individual meetings between aspiring PIs and Program Directors.  The funded CPS investigators who spoke to the aspiring PIs were:  Andre Platzer (Carnegie Mellon, Computer Science) Sriram Sankaranarayanan (UC Boulder, Computer Science) Hadas Kress-Gazit (Cornell, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering)   The panels included the below topics:  How to develop a successful proposal? This was led by existing PIs in CPS. Common Mistakes in CPS Proposals, and Where do I fit in the solicitation? This was led by NSF Program Directors Dr. Theodore Baker, Dr. David Corma and Dr. Sylvia Spengler.   In all, over 80 participants attended, and each of them met individually with an NSF Program Director to discuss research ideas and become more familiar with the Cyber-Physical Systems program.   Videos of the workshop are available in HD (with closed captioning) on YouTube, and are referenced from the workshop website at http://cps-vo.org/group/aspiringPIs        Last Modified: 11/17/2015       Submitted by: Jonathan Sprinkle]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
