<AbstractNarration>This award supports travel for participants in the 2nd Lake Michigan Workshop on Combinatorics and Graph Theory, held at the Department of Mathematics at the University of Notre Dame on the weekend of March 7 and 8, 2015. The workshop will benefit graduate students and junior researchers in the field of discrete mathematics, working at institutions in the area around Lake Michigan. It will be built around two sets of three tutorial lectures, focusing on classical techniques and results that the speakers feel are under-represented in typical graduate sequences, and on emerging techniques on which the speakers are particularly qualified to expound. There will also be some short talks by students and younger faculty members. There will be ample unscheduled time during the weekend, which  will allow new research collaborations to commence, and active collaborations to be continued. Junior participants will establish valuable connections with more senior colleagues, and receive guidance from them in a relaxed and informal environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics and Graph Theory are two very active areas of research within the broader field of Discrete Mathematics, with important ties to disciplines such as statistical physics and network science. In the immediate vicinity of Lake Michigan there are a large number of researchers and students working on a variety of graph theoretical and combinatorial problems. This workshop will bring many of these workers together. Through tutorial lectures, short talks, an open problem session, and informal collaboration time, the workshop will train beginning researchers in important classical and emerging techniques of Combinatorics and Graph Theory. The tutorial speakers will be Dhruv Mubayi, University of Illinois at Chicago (who will speak on methods in extremal set theory) and Mark Daniel Ward, Purdue University (who will speak on analytic combinatorics and analysis of algorithms).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop web site:  http://www3.nd.edu/~conf/lmwcgt15/</AbstractNarration>
