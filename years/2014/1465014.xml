<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professors Helen O. Leung and Mark D. Marshall of Amherst College and their undergraduate student researchers to investigate the fundamental nature of the forces between molecules.  The ultimate goal of this research is to develop more fully the understanding of intermolecular interactions, how they are affected by, and in turn how they affect the first encounters between molecules.  The undergraduate researchers working on this project receive significant research experiences in an active physical chemistry laboratory as part of a their liberal arts and sciences education and are given the opportunity to present their work at scientific conferences.  This raises the scientific literacy and sharpens the thoughts of student participants, preparing them as future scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intermolecular interactions are investigated through the analysis of rotational spectra obtained using Fourier transform microwave (FTMW) techniques. The availability of two types of FTMW spectrometers (chirped pulse and Balle-Flygare) provides key research and pedagogic advantages as well as enhancing undergraduate participation in scientific research. The determination of the structures of a series of gas-phase dimeric complexes, in combination with ab initio quantum chemistry calculations, provides information regarding the nature of the forces responsible. Specifically, complexes formed between protic acids and haloethylenes reveal the effects of dispersion interactions on intermolecular association. The laser ablation technique is used to generate metal containing complexes in which electron transfer is expected to play a role, and effects of intermolecular interactions on the electron density of the hydroxyl (OH) radical are studied using complexes involving this open-shell species.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Although much weaker than chemical forces, the potential for a large number of noncovalent intermolecular interactions in chemical and biological systems makes them very important and gives them profound influence over these systems.  A deep understanding of these interactions is therefore critical in advancing chemistry at a fundamental level.  These forces, however, are subtle and are usually masked by the larger effects of the chemical bond.  To focus primarily on the contributions of intermolecular interactions, we study systems that owe their very existence to these forces   &ndash; gas phase dimers formed between two molecules (or an atom and a molecule).  Our work is conducted through the collection and analysis of rotational spectra obtained using a combination of broadband, chirped-pulse and narrowband, Balle-Flygare Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy and is guided by ab initio theoretical quantum chemistry calculations.  The systems we have chosen are complexes formed between olefins (simple hydrocarbons containing a carbon-carbon double bond) substituted with halogens and protic acids.  These olefins contain both electron withdrawing and electron donating functionalities while the protic acids contain a positive portion and an electronegative region.  The competition and cooperation of the various forces in each complex is revealed through its structure, which can be obtained from its rotational spectrum.  By a systematic study of a number of complexes, we have gained a significant understanding of the interplay between steric and electrostatic factors in these systems.  We have also begun using microwave spectroscopy to distinguish molecules that are mirror images of each other.  Such molecules form a chiral pair, each molecule with the same chemical composition and atomic connections, and indeed, even the same microwave spectrum.  However, when one member of the pair interacts with another chiral species, the handedness of the two species is of critical importance, much like trying to fit one's right hand into a left-handed glove versus a right-handed one (or vice versa).  The method we employ utilizes a molecule of known absolute configuration (the tag) to form non-covalent interactions to a chiral analyte, converting the two enantiomers (mirror images) of the analyte into spectroscopically distinct diastereomers (right hand tag with left hand analyte versus right hand tag with right hand analyte) that can be unambiguously characterized via microwave spectroscopy.  We have had identified several potentially useful tags, using them in several preliminary experiments in chiral analysis.  Our broader impact includes the continuation and enhancement of the research atmosphere in the Chemistry Department of Amherst College, an undergraduate institution with a diverse student body.  Specifically, the project allowed the co-PIs to provide 20 students with significant and meaningful research experiences in an active physical chemistry laboratory.  Through these activities, we raise the scientific literacy and sharpen the thoughts of future scientists and leaders. With NSF support, many of these students have attended the International Symposium on Molecular Spectroscopy at the University of Illinois where some have had the additional opportunity to present their results in a contributed talk.  Connecting in this manner with the greater scientific community provides further exposure for their work while allowing them to place it in a larger context as they broaden their knowledge.  In addition to oral and poster presentations at this and other local, regional, and national meetings, results are published in peer-reviewed journals.  Student work is also displayed prominently on campus where it serves to further encourage involvement with research among all students.
