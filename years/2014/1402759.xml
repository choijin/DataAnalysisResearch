<AbstractNarration>Abstract(Kaloshin,1402759): &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of 25 graduate students studying dynamical systems in the U.S and one of the proposed lecturers for an advanced  "Summer School in Dynamical Systems at Maryland" to be held on the campus of the University of Maryland in College Park from August 18-25, 2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be talks given by the PI, 2 other well-known faculty working at Maryland in dynamics, some postdoctoral fellows, and an outside research mathematician. All are established experts in the field.  There will be 4 mini-courses on topics of current interest, mainly drawn from hyperbolic and Hamiltonian dynamics. This program will train 25 U.S. graduate students in some important topics and problems in dynamical systems.</AbstractNarration>

At the end of most lecture days there was informal discussion session. Some of these discussions started joint projects, others shared their research interests.
