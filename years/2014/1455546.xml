<AbstractNarration>An award is made to Texas A&amp;M University refine an oceanographic data recorder (ODR) and work with a company to make them commercially available to the biological and oceanographic communities. This project will train graduate and undergraduate interns in the use of the ODR. The graduate students will also participate in field tests. The instruments will be used to teach undergraduate students, including underrepresented groups, about ocean science. The oceans are a key element in understanding global climate and its potential effects on human society. The development and commercial availability of these instruments will contribute to this understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ODRs can be attached to marine mammals, sea turtles, penguins and large fishes that range throughout the world's oceans and record detailed oceanographic data, especially in areas that are not frequently visited by research vessels. Data recorded by these instruments will provide valuable information on the world's oceans and climate. Most sub-surface oceanographic data have been obtained from ship-based surveys and the deployment of instruments that drift on the sea surface. Animal-borne instruments such as the ODR provide a low cost alternative for augmenting these data.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Fine resolution data for salinity, temperature and dissolved oxygen, when applied to large geographic areas, can provide critical information on ocean circulation and structure which influence climate and ecosystem processes over large areas. Marine mammals and other pelagic vertebrates (e.g., large fishes) that range throughout the world?s oceans and descend to depths of up to 2,000 m have the potential of carrying oceanographic instruments that record fine spatial and temporal resolution data at relatively low cost, especially in areas that are not frequently visited by research vessels and during the winter when sea ice and harsh weather pose severe logistical challenges. For example, ocean circulation and structure in the Arctic Ocean remain poorly understood, and the effects of climate change on all arctic and sub-arctic areas (North Atlantic, North Pacific and Arctic Ocean) will undoubtedly affect the oceans (i.e., the physical conditions, boundaries, flow, and related characteristics of oceanographic regions) and the species that occur in these regions. Predictive models with fine spatial and temporal resolution require detailed measurements throughout the water column. Data are needed from regions and seasons where traditional oceanographic data (e.g., ship-based measurements, drifters, etc.) are scarce or difficult and expensive to implement. In addition, some species of marine mammals penetrate deep into Polar Regions where cloud and partial or near-total sea ice coverage can limit the applicability of oceanographic remote sensing, and where most profiling floats and ships cannot operate. In this project, we refined a miniature Oceanographic Data Recorder and negotiated its commercial development with our industry partner, Wildlife Computers (Redmond, WA), so that it will be available to other scientists and professionals interested in high-resolution, long-duration monitoring of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and other environmental variables (Fig. 1). These instruments will enhance our understanding the oceans generate major benefits for both biological and oceanographic research. The commercial availability of ODRs will create a foundation for oceanographic research using many species of marine vertebrates throughout the world. The oceans are a key element in understanding climate change, and there is an increasing need for synoptic data on a global level. Most sub-surface oceanographic data have been obtained from ship-based surveys and the deployment of drifters. Animal-borne instruments provide a relatively low-cost alternative for monitoring ocean climate. In addition, the results from instruments that are deployed on large marine species attract an extraordinary amount of press coverage that effectively brings scientific research to the public. This coverage and the results generated by these instruments excite the imagination and help instill an interest in science in children and adults.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/07/2019<br>      Modified by: Randall&nbsp;W&nbsp;Davis</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1455546/1455546_10358708_1554663731930_Oceanographicdatarecorder(ODR)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1455546/1455546_10358708_1554663731930_Oceanographicdatarecorder(ODR)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Oceanographic Data Recorder"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1455546/1455546_10358708_1554663731930_Oceanographicdatarecorder(ODR)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Oceanographic Data Recorder"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Fig. 1.
