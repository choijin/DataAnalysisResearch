<AbstractNarration>The proposed work addresses a challenge central to the EarthCube program's success: How to employ state of the art technology for geoscience data discovery, access, and integration. The project brings together significant geosciences holdings in the ocean, earth and polar sciences to demonstrate how innovative technologies can be robustly applied to these facilities to enhance the capabilities for scientists to discover and interpret relevant geoscience data and knowledge. The end product, GEOLink, will lower barriers to cross-repository data discovery and access, while respecting and preserving repository autonomy and heterogeneity. They will demonstrate the approach through a portal that allows searching and browsing of integrated content from multiple repositories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key challenge for EarthCube is to enable data discovery, access, and integration in a sustainable way. Existing data repositories and networks must be linked, while retaining their independent missions and services to existing disciplinary communities. Cultural, conceptual, and infrastructural heterogeneities must be respected in order to maintain different perspectives and differing priorities and thus foster inclusivity in the EarthCube endeavor. In particular, individual choices made by providers of data or repositories will need to be respected in an inclusive manner, and approaches to integration must reflect this. At the same time, however, the diversity and heterogeneity of geoscience data presents a significant barrier to its discovery. In this project, the researchers involved will develop a demonstration called GEOLink based on: 1) digital publication of geoscience data and knowledge as "Linked Open Data"; combined with 2) semantic integration using design patterns and vocabularies shared among federated repositories; and 3) an underlying cyberinfrastructure extendable in both depth and breadth, that can become a central building block for EarthCube data harmonization. The cyberinfrastructure underlying the approach is extendable, sustainable, and affordable - leveraging state of the art developments in Linked Open Data and formal semantics, grounded through shared Ontology Design Patterns. GEOLink-enabled repositories will support discovery of related resources, including Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R), the Biological and Chemical Oceanographic Data Management Office (BCO-DMO), Integrated Earth Data Applications (IEDA), the Long-Term Ecological Research Network (LTER), DataONE, and the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP), as well content from other EarthCube Building Block projects and collaborators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The GeoLink project achieved its primary goal, demonstrating the use of leading-edge semantic  technologies to make research results more easily available to the public.  A network of collaborating data centers, representing a range of scientific disciplines from marine geology to marine ecosystems, biogeochemistry, and paleoclimatology, published over 45 million facts and figures from 10 different research collections on the Web.  The GeoLink team adopted a standard data format that can be easily discovered by search engines, as well as a consensus approach to uniquely identify individual researchers, and developed a new lightweight/modular vocabulary to describe essential research concepts for the purpose of data discovery.  By combining a standard format and unique identifiers with a shared vocabulary, GeoLink exposed thousands of new links between data centers in different scientific domains.    The GeoLink vocabulary was developed collaboratively by a team of researchers, students, and engineers with expertise in computer science, natural sciences, and library science.  The vocabulary describes a broad range of concepts including funding awards, conference abstracts, datasets, documents, geographic features, scientific instruments, persons, organizations, field platforms, expeditions, and physical specimens.  Each data center in the GeoLink network mapped its existing research collection to the GeoLink vocabulary, using an approach that suited its existing infrastructure, and published the result on the Web as "Linked Data" using standards developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).  These collections were harvested by a central data hub, which performed quality control checking and automatic detection of links between datasets.  A series of prototype activities demonstrated the ability to make search queries against the hub and display the results in Web portals.    Original research from the GeoLink project was published in reviewed journal articles and presented at NSF EarthCube community activities including annual meetings, technical workshops, and online webinars.  Ten post-secondary students participated in GeoLink-related projects, providing them with hands-on experience in semantic technologies and software development.  The students' work resulted in one Ph.D. thesis directly related to GeoLink and numerous presentations at IEEE and AGU professional conferences.
