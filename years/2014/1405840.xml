<AbstractNarration>Bites from blacklegged ticks are the cause of most human Lyme disease in the eastern United States.  This tick is found throughout the region, whereas most Lyme disease is reported from the Northeast and upper Midwest.  Over the past three years, field studies have revealed that this mis-match between the distribution of ticks and disease is the result, in part, of a surprising difference in the behavior of juvenile nymphal ticks.  In the North, nymphs looking for a blood meal often emerge from the leaf litter and climb a convenient twig to wait for a passing mouse or bird.  This puts a passing human at risk because the nymph can attach to a sock or skirt or exposed ankle and from there find a place to bite.  In contrast, Southern nymphs rarely exhibit this climbing behavior because they stay in the leaf litter, and so rarely have an opportunity to attach to a passing human. This behavior appears to be genetically determined, southern ticks continue to behave like southern ticks, even if they have been raised in the North. But what if northern and southern ticks breed with each other (which other researchers have shown is possible) and how will their offspring behave?  This study aims to answer that question by raising nymphs from various combinations of parents that either share or differ in their host-seeking behavior. The behavior of these hybrid offspring will be observed in order to learn about the outcomes to be expected if northern and southern ticks begin to mingle in the wild. This research question is important because northern ticks are presently expanding southwards in several states, including Ohio, Virginia, Illinois, and Indiana. Results from this research will be of value to health care providers and the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In prior work the PIs utilized a field reciprocal translocation experiment and found that there is a significant genetic basis to the differential host-seeking behavior of nymphs from the northern and southern parts of their range. Overall, the behavioral differences were so pronounced that they appear sufficient to explain the two-orders-of-magnitude difference in Lyme disease incidence between the northern and southeastern US. This award now allows the researchers to address a key question raised by their prior work: what questing behavior will be exhibited once northern and southern tick populations converge and hybridize? And, in what way will these host-seeking traits evolve? The PIs will conduct hybridization experiments between two northern and two southern populations, measure the fecundity of the crosses, and quantify host-seeking behavior of the resulting offspring in field arenas in both Michigan and Tennessee. The research aims to predict how Lyme disease risk will change in the South subsequent to invasion of northern tick populations into states currently occupied by southern populations. Furthermore, this project addresses classic questions regarding the role of genetics and environment on geographic variation of phenotypes and the ability of such traits to evolve.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nymphal blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis, are the key vectors of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causal agent of Lyme disease (LD) in the eastern United States.  There are pronounced differences in B. burgdorferi prevalence in northern v. southern I. scapularis populations.  These differences are highly correlated with the distribution of LD cases, which occur mostly in the North despite vector ticks being widespread in both the North and South. Nymphs rarely bite humans in the South although they readily parasitize wildlife hosts in both regions, suggesting important differences between the two regions in the host-seeking (= questing) behavior of these nymphs. Our hypothesis is that differences in questing behavior alter the eco-epidemiology of LD in the North v. South by affecting the host species upon which nymphal I. scapularis feed, which in turn affects transmission of the pathogen among wildlife, and also the probability that nymphal ticks will contact and infect humans.  Blacklegged tick populations in the Northeast and upper Midwest are currently expanding both northward and southward, so a key question is:  what questing behavior will be exhibited once northern and southern tick populations converge and hybridize? Here, Arsnoe (n&eacute;e Kuczaj) conducted hybridization experiments between two northern and two southern populations, measured the fecundity of the crosses, quantified host-seeking behavior of the resulting offspring, and measured the survival of hybrid offspring, all in field arenas in Michigan and Tennessee.  Intellectual merit:  Arsnoe found that hybrids of northern (high questing) and southern (low questing) blacklegged ticks were successful and support the predictions of the Biological Species Concept.  With regard to questing behavior, in general, when both parents were high questing, offspring also quested high.  Similarly, when both parents were low questing, offspring were low questing. Offspring (=Hybrids) of high and low questing parents displayed questing behavior more similar to offspring of low questing parents than to offspring with both high questing parents.  Finally, hybrid offsping exhibited survival rates similar to or greater than offspring with two high questing parents. Offspring with two low questing parents and one of the inbred high questing groups experienced reduced survival vs. all other crosses.  The results of this pilot study will provide baseline data from which future, more elaborate genetic studies may be conducted to understand the relative role of genetics on behaviors and other traits. These results emphasize the need for continued research regarding the variation in ecology of disease vectors in order to predict how human risk will change as vector populations expand. These types of studies will be essential for understanding the outcomes of blacklegged tick population shifts on human risk for vector-borne disease.     Broader impacts:  The P.I. is an Asian-American female, and the co-investigator is female.  One female undergraduate and one male international student received specific training within the project.  Arsnoe, the co-investigator and graduate student, was able to present her findings at an international meeting.              Improved understanding of the spatial distribution and abundance of infected LD ticks, especially in the South, will assist in more accurate human disease diagnosis, improved targeting of vector management funds, and better public understanding of regional variation in risk of LD and other tick-borne diseases.
