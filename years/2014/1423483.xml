<AbstractNarration>CBET-1423483&lt;br/&gt;Hrenya&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support a new conference titled Frontiers in Particle Science and Technology, which will be held in Chicago from April 29 through May 1, 2014.  The conference, which is organized by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, will focus on the interactions among particles and the bulk behavior of particulate systems.  It will feature a blend of keynote presentations, submitted talks, and poster sessions by researchers from academia and industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particulate systems are ubiquitous in manufacturing, especially in the manufacturing of advanced products such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and specialized polymers.  Despite their importance, particulate systems still pose challenges in manufacturing.  The conference will emphasize cooperation between scientists and engineers in academia and industry and will help bridge the gap between fundamental theory of particulate systems and industrial practice.  Support from NSF will be used to help young scientists and engineers, including postdoctoral and graduate students, attend the conference.  It will provide these young attendees with opportunities to meet senior researchers in the field from academia and industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview.  The purpose of this work was to solicit funds in support of participants to the first offering of the AIChE conference Frontiers in Particle Science and Technology (FPST): Particle Interactions (April 29 &ndash; May 1, 2014; Chicago; http://www.aiche.org/conferences/frontiers-particle-science-and-technology/2014).  Intellectual Merit.  Particulate solids are prevalent in a range of natural and industrial systems, yet a basic understanding of many phenomena is lacking  The FPST conference provided a unique forum for the exchange of fresh scientific ideas, with an emphasis on particle-particle interactions (van der Waals forces, liquid bridging, etc.) and their impact on bulk behavior.  A unique aspect of this conference was the ~50/50 balance between academic and industrial speakers.  All talks were invited.  A poster session was also held to allow all participants to showcase their work, particularly emerging scientists.  In order to move beyond incremental research, cross-fertilization of participants was encouraged, which involves not only bringing these scientists together, but also providing an environment that promotes their interaction.  The structure of the FPST workshop accomplished this task via a smaller number of participants (~70), poster sessions, and shared meals and on-site housing.  Broader Impacts.  Financial support was provided to ~15 emerging scientists (students, postdocs, and junior faculty) and underrepresented groups to ensure a diverse audience.  The diversity of disciplines and promotion of intensive discussions provided an environment in which young scholars can intermingled with established researchers.  Such interaction is critical in helping to address the national need for training of U.S. students in the area of particle science.
