<AbstractNarration>1440099/1440067&lt;br/&gt;Derry/Schreiber&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On February 2, 2014, the third-largest coal ash spill in the Nation occurred at Eden, North Carolina where a drainage pipe under a 27-acre Duke Energy Dan River Steam Plant waste pond collapsed, discharging coal ash and millions of gallons of contaminated water into the Dan River. The Dan River originates in Virginia and flows into North Carolina and then flows north back into Virginia crossing the state lines eight times. It eventually flows into the Roanoke River, and into Lake Kerr then Lake Gaston and eventually into the Albemarle Sound, NC. The waters serve as a highly used recreation system and as a source of drinking water for cities from Danville, VA to as far away as Virginia Beach. The toxic constituents of coal ash include various contaminants from metals such as arsenic (As), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg) to selenium (Se) along with a suite of organic compounds. While the element concentrations in impoundment water can exceed drinking water criteria and aquatic life water quality criteria, less is known about the fate of trace elements bound to ash in the new biogeochemical environment of the Dan River. Dissolution and changes in speciation can increase metal toxicity thus threaten wild life and water usability for years to come. To answer some of these questions a multidisciplinary approach is necessary. The proposed work should provide a clearer picture to environmental agencies and water managers of the extent, transport time scales, and removal processes of coal combustion residue-derived pollutants in this river system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide unique insight into the evolution of coal combustion residue-derived contaminants in the basin over longer time and spatial scales, and at levels that may be considered below immediate remediation targets but are still important for the overall biogeochemical function and health of the aquatic ecosystem. The development and application of novel and independent geochemical tracers for coal combustion residue input will help remove some of the ambiguity associated with data on contaminant concentrations, and identify the extent of coal combustion residue inputs even in the absence of action levels of contaminants. While the initial focus by the state/federal agencies and other organizations has been on identifying the levels of contaminants in the coal combustion residue pond outflow and the river, there are several techniques which allow scientists to trace the response of the system in time and length scales consistent with the transport of coal combustion residue to the Kerr Reservoir. This proposed research will provide tools to track the concentrations of major, minor and trace elements as well as the stable isotope S-34 (sulfur-34) in water and sediments in the Dan River in the post-spill period. Because germanium (Ge) is enriched in coals and should act as a conservative tracer, we expect Ge to be anomalous and Ge/Si (silicon) ratios to be a unique fingerprint for coal combustion residue input. It is thought that the As/Ge; (chromium) Cr/Ge and other trace element/Ge ratios should be a powerful tools for identifying coal combustion residue-related anomalies in those elements. The stable isotopic analysis of S-34 in dissolved sulfate will act as a second constraint on the coal combustion residue input that can be compared to the Ge/Si and trace element/Ge ratios. This RAPID funding is to provide funds to continue a sampling and analysis program begun in the immediate aftermath of the spill. Both river hydrologic process and biogeochemical processes are expected to significantly modify and attenuate the immediate impacts of the contamination event. It is vital to establish and continue a regular sampling program in order to assess the impact of transport and biogeochemical removal on contaminants of concern.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On Feb 2, 2014, a valve on a pipe connected to a coal combustion residue ("coal ash") holding pond at the Duke Energy Dan River Steam Plant in Eden, N.C. failed, releasing up to 82,000 tons of ash and related materials and 27 million gallons of contaminated water into the adjacent Dan River. "Coal ash" consisting of fly ash, bottom ash, boiler slag and flue gas desulfurized gypsum, produced in coal-fired power plants, pose a potential health hazard both as a source of fine particulates and because they are often enriched in toxic metals, including arsenic, antimony, and selenium, among others.  Our group worked with scientists from Virginia Tech to sample and analyze Dan River water for dissolved metals.  We found high concentrations of arsenic in the aftermath of the spill, but the levels fell below regulatory limits fairly quickly.  Our results for the period February to April 2014 were consistent with that reported by the EPA and other government agencies and researchers from around the same time.  We also focused on the element germanium as a potentially unique tracer for coal ash sources of metals.  Germanium is at low abundance in almost all natural systems but is strongly enriched in coal ash.  Because there are no other potential sources of high germanium to the Dan River we could use the germanium concentrations as an indicator of ash input.  We found that elevated levels of arsenic, antimony and selenium were almost always associated with elevated germanium, a strong indication that coal ash was the source of the high metal levels.  No other known source could provide high germanium as well as high arsenic, selenium and antimony. Germanium acts as a unique fingerprint for coal ash inputs.  Some coal ash was swept down to the Roanoke reservoir, while some accumulated at various locations along the Dan River.  One area where ash is believed to have accumulated is near AnglerÆs Park near Danville, VA, approximately 25 miles downstream from the spill site.  River water samples taken in the late spring and summer at AnglersÆs Park showed high levels of dissolved antimony, arsenic and selenium. The antimony concentrations were particularly elevated in May 2014, reaching 16 parts per billion.  For comparison, background levels in the Dan River are less than 0.05 parts per billion. The antimony concentrations declined but still were very anomalous in July and October 2014.  The high antimony levels are well correlated with high germanium.  This almost certainly means that the source of antimony was coal ash.  We do not know exactly what process was responsible for the large increase in contaminant metals in the water near AnglerÆs Park beginning in May. Our current working hypothesis is that warming river waters as the seasons progressed resulted in increased microbial activity in the river sediments.  The microbes could have dissolved some iron oxides that had adsorbed the toxic metals, releasing them back into the water.  Microbial activity is well known to be capable of dissolving iron oxides in sediments under certain conditions.  Similarly, iron oxides are known to adsorb the contaminant metals studied here.  If further work supports this hypothesis that would suggest that seasonal fluctuations in temperature and perhaps dissolved oxygen levels could result in continuing, episodic release of arsenic, selenium and antimony into Dan River water from ash-contaminated sediments. We do not yet know for how long these releases of contaminant metals from sediments to the river could continue.  There may be a long-term legacy of occasional metal release from ash-contaminated sediments in the Dan River.  We suggest continued monitoring of sites with significant ash accumulation.  Additional studies of the sediments and water should provide a better understanding of how metals are released over time and how much of a concern this may be going forward.
