<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project aims to investigate iridium-oxide superlattices, i.e. epitaxial multilayers, having the so-termed pyrochlore crystal structure, which are predicted to be prime candidates for realizing exotic topological states.  The exotic topological states are protected by the symmetry of the crystal and are robust against backscattering and energy dissipation.  Materials exhibiting such properties can contribute to new technologies in electronic spin-based devices as well as low energy-cost applications.  A critical drawback to the progression of these developments is the lack of high-quality samples.  This project's goal is to create artificial, two-dimensional meta-materials with enhanced quantum fluctuations, which allow their intriguing physical properties to be unveiled.  This project is intertwined with educating graduate students who will become the next generation of condensed matter physicists with strong expertise in advanced materials syntheses.  The principal investigator also engages his students with state-of-the-art characterizations of these materials through collaborations at National Labs and Synchrotron facilities.  Through summer research activities, undergraduates in pre-teaching concentrations are able to participate in various stages of the project.  All research findings are to be shared with the public through outreach activities involving local area high school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the exotic, nontrivial topological ground states that can be experimentally realized in the dimensionally-confined superlattices of pyrochlore iridates.  The inherent strong electron-correlations and spin-orbit interactions present in these compounds are ideal features for obtaining novel states such as quantum spin-Hall insulators and Weyl semimetals.  However, bulk crystal studies show these systems to have correlation-induced magnetic ordering and fully gapped insulating states, which render the topological states invisible.  The unwanted magnetic ordering can be suppressed by creating artificial, two-dimensional superlattices, and thus the hidden topologically nontrivial states can be revealed.  The goal of this project is to close the existing gaps between theories and experiments in the expanding field of strongly-correlated, spin-orbit coupled electrons in low-dimensional condensed matter.  To this end, this project develops various epitaxial multilayer structures consisting of pyrochlore iridates and wide-band-gap insulators.  The high-quality sample syntheses are performed using a custom-built pulsed laser deposition system that incorporates dual in-situ, real-time monitoring techniques.  By controlling interfacial interactions, dimensionality, and lattice-symmetry via epitaxial strain, it is possible to explore the phase diagrams of correlated topological states.  Experimental characterization for probing these novel electronic states includes infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry, scanning probe microscopy, and low-temperature transport measurements under magnetic fields.  The principal investigator engages his graduate students with research activities in state-of-the-art techniques of synthesis and characterization. The principal investigator also offers a research experience for undergraduates with secondary education concentrations, and outreach workshops for local high school students in under-represented areas.</AbstractNarration>
