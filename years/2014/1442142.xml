<AbstractNarration>All animals must sense their environment and other organisms to find food, avoid threats, and find partners. The ability of some individuals to locate food and mates more effectively than others can open opportunities for them to leave many more descendants. And yet, multiple advanced sensory systems seldom evolve in the same species despite the advantages they may confer, suggesting there are physical limits to developing several specialized senses. This project focuses on a diverse group of tropical bats in which various species evolved acute, specialized hearing, supersensitive eyes, the ability to smell subtle plant chemicals, or highly developed vomeronasal systems (thought to contribute to mating and social hierarchy). This project will compare approximately 2000 genes involved in vision, hearing, olfaction and the vomeronasal system in more than 150 bat species. To find out how some of these genes contribute to developing distinct sensory systems, their actions will be studied in the lab. This research will uncover the role of specific genes in the acquisition of specialized senses, test whether the size of the head limits the number of specialized sensory structures a species can have, and discover how sensory adaptations contribute to the diversity of species through time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will uncover the evolution of genes and structures of the auditory, visual, and olfactory and vomeronasal systems in a large superfamily of bats characterized by diverse sensory adaptations associated with specific diets. Analyses of gene evolution will be used to test the hypothesis that sensory innovations arise through gene duplication and positive selection. Measurements of gene expression from tissues collected in the field, and experiments to express key bat genes in developing embryos will be used to elucidate how genes shape adaptive sensory structures. Comparative analyses of detailed measurements of the size of sensory structures will evaluate trade-offs between sensory systems and the way these may limit diversity of diets or species. State-of-the art methods to quantify relationships between gene and trait evolution and species diversity will be used to discover the impact of sensory adaptation on species diversity through time. This research will illuminate the main biological forces in the genome, during embryonic development, and in anatomical structures that contribute to the success of species in adapting to their ever-challenging environment.</AbstractNarration>

In this project, we analyzed the diversity of specialized senses across a group comprising &gt;150 species of bats of the Americas --including bats that pollinate mezcal plants, disperse seeds in tropical forests, and even vampire bats-- to determine the genomic basis of this diversity and test its evolutionary limits. Specifically, we predicted that sensory trait adaptations would accompany shifts to new diets including nectar, fruit, small animals, or blood. While most genomic analyses have focused on evolution through adaptation in individual genes, we found changes through gene duplications and losses were important throughout the evolution of these species. Despite the size constraints imposed by flight, neotropical Leaf-nosed bats conserve a sense of smell specialized to detect pheromones (scent molecules important in communication), and bat species that include fruit in their diet have maintained diversity in their eye proteins that likely allows them to discriminate colors. We found frugivorous bats had larger olfactory bulbs in the brain and eye orbits, while nectarivorous bats had smaller cochleae. Contrary to expectation, many genes expressed in the eye and changes in the sizes of the eye and olfactory bulb do not show adaptation during shifts to new diets, but instead respond to a gleaning foraging mode wherein bats pluck insects off leaves instead of in the air. Therefore, many traits key to maintaining wild plant and even crop diversity evolved long before species committed to plant-based diets, providing evidence of preadaptation.&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Besides contributing to more than 30 scientific articles, this project helped educate the next generation of US scientists by supporting seven postdoctoral researchers, three dissertations, dozens of graduate students, and as many undergraduate students.
