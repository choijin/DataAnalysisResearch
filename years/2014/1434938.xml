<AbstractNarration>Subaqueous sediment dynamics impact on a large number of issues in the coastal zone and the marine environment, such as coastal erosion and evolution, marine slope stability, navigable water depth, stability of offshore structures, as well as the seafloor as a habitat. One of the unsolved questions with regard to subaqueous sediment dynamics is the thickness, density and particle distribution within the mobile seafloor surface layer. The project aims to develop a mobile seafloor sediment sampler as an add-on unit for portable free-fall penetrometers. The capability of sampling the density, thickness and sedimentological composition of the mobile seabed sediments would pave the way for new studies and insights in the field of subaqueous geomorphology and morphodynamics, sediment dynamics, marine geology, as well as coastal and offshore engineering and seafloor geotechnical engineering. It would contribute directly to the site-specific and systematic understanding of subaqueous sediment transport and scour, and would fill gaps in current knowledge regarding bedload transport. Thus, the resulting instrument will potentially initiate new interdisciplinary collaborations, and address a variety of modern environmental and societal issues. The development will also impact significantly on the career and following research path of the principal investigator whose work is aiming to bridge the gap between subaqueous sediment dynamics and geotechnical engineering. A graduate research assistant working on the development will be educated and trained in detail in sediment transport theories and practice, in-situ marine geotechnics, and coastal and offshore surveying. The fact that a major part of the testing will be conducted on Virginia Tech's campus will allow insight to other students, possibly full classes, and an easy transfer of the gained knowledge and procedures into the class room. Particularly, female students will benefit from the principal investigator as a role model for female researchers in the still male-dominated field of ocean technology and offshore surveying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mobile seafloor surface layer sampler will be developed as an add-on unit for portable free-fall penetrometers which have been applied for the investigation of sediment mobilization processes for several years. A sampling tube with sealing mechanism will be integrated in the steel tip of the free-fall penetrometer, building a sampling unit that will allow collection of small sediment samples while geotechnical profiling. The project will include the development, manufacture and detailed testing of the add-on unit. Test procedures will feature controlled laboratory tests in a soil test chamber, tests of the effects of impact velocity, and proof-of-concept in the field.</AbstractNarration>

Nevertheless, mobile and active seafloor sediment layers have still rarely been investigated in-depth, resulting mainly from challenges associated with the testing and sampling of the mobile seafloor layer. The overarching goal of this project was to address this gap in testing capabilities by developing a sampler of the seafloor sediment layer as an add-on unit for portable free fall penetrometers that will enable geotechnical testing and the physical extraction of sediment samples of seafloor top layers including active layers simultaneously. To achieve this goal, three prototype sediment samplers were designed and manufactured. They were then tested in the laboratory and in the field with regards to the extraction of quality physical sediment samples of the seafloor surface as well as with regards to the performance as an add-on unit for a portable free fall penetrometer. Out of the three prototypes, one was determined unsuitable as complex mechanical parts failed during sampling, and two were found suitable. The latter proved to collect high quality samples of sandy to muddy seafloor sediments and to preserve layering. They also performed well as an add-on unit of a portable free fall penetrometer, and geotechnical data was collected simultaneously to the sampling process. It was expected that the presence of the sampler would lead to bias of the collected geotechnical data. Therefore, correlations were determined that would relate the geotechnical data collected with one of sampler units to portable free fall penetrometer data collected with a standard tip geometry. Finally, the best performing sampler was re-manufactured with refinements based on the test results. This device is at this point, the conclusion of the project, ready for application in studies related to aquatic sediment transport processes (e.g., seafloor geomorphodynamics, scour, etc.). Thus study showed that the results can contribute to the site-specific as well as systematic understanding of sediment dynamics. It is also envisioned that the results can serve as validation and input for numerical or physical simulations in the future. The developed device represents a novel opportunity to investigate aquatic sediment transport processes and is suitable for application in various research projects. A graduate student has actively worked on this project, and has been trained in an interdisciplinary manner in geotechnical engineering, coastal sciences, sedimentology, and marine geology. Through the project, the student interacted with a number of researchers from different disciplines and presented at international research conferences. Results were published in peer-reviewed research journals, and are also utilized as class content and for outreach activities.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/07/2019<br>      Modified by: Nina&nbsp;Stark</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1434938/1434938_10327442_1562530178376_OR2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1434938/1434938_10327442_1562530178376_OR2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="C.
