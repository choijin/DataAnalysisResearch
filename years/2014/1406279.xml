<AbstractNarration>With rapid advances in information and technology, big data are now routinely collected in many frontiers of scientific research and technological developments. Various advanced techniques are needed to address the challenges such as computation, noise accumulation, and spurious correlations prominently featured in big data. New theoretical challenges arise in order to address probabilistic problems in high-dimensional statistics. This collaborative research project intends to combine the strength and expertise on probability and statistics of both investigators to address a number of emerging and challenging issues in high-dimensional data analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will focus on primarily two types of problems: (i) high-dimensional statistics on spheres and (ii) behaviors of eigenvalues of random matrices and zeroes of polynomials. The two topics are innately related since high-dimensional data are often expressed in terms of matrices. The project would create new theories and methods for high-dimensional statistics, interact and apply them to several different disciplines including mathematics, statistical physics, information theory, and computer science. The project also involves training of top notch mathematical scientists and engineers and to disseminate the research results and products broadly via the online media, conferences and seminar presentations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During this project we have published 14 peer-reviewed research papers, more than half of which were published in the journals of probability, statistics, number theory and theoretical physics. The following is a sample of the results.     1. Together with Yutao Ma, we solved a few open problems regarding approximating the entries of Haar-orthogonal matrices. This work and the PI's previous research results have been applied in quantum computing.     2. Together with Jianqing Fan, we solved the problem of maximum correlation coefficients from a sample of dependent random variables. We discovered that, unlike the known results, the limit of the maxima is a sum of two independent random variables, one has the Gaussian distribution and the other has the extreme-value distribution.     3. Together with Ke Wang, we investigated the number of restricted integer partitions, which generalized a famous formula by Hardy and Ramanujan.     4. Together with Yongcheng Qi, we completely characterized the limiting spectral distributions and limiting radii of random matrices of complex entries including products of Ginibre ensembles, truncated of Haar unitary matrices and F-matrices. Some new probability distributions are discovered.     5. Together with Yongcheng Qi, the PI studied high-dimensional of six statistical tests, which are the big-data analogs of the classical tests related to the characteristics of multiple multivariate normal distributions for their means and covariance matrices  The PI presented more than 20 conference presentations and spoke in nearly 30 seminars around the world. To promote and disseminate the interest and creativity of science, the PI gave many speeches for the general audience, elementary schools, middle schools, colleges and graduate schools. The PI advised two PhD students, four Master students and four undergraduates.  During the span of the support, the PI organized weekly seminars in the spring semester, summers and the fall semesters all year round. There are college students, graduate students, postdocs and professors in each seminar. Part of seminar speakers were from the participants and the other speakers were invited from different organizations. The topics run from High-dimensional statistics, machine learning, combinatorics and stochastic differential equations etc. The participants of the seminars exchanged their current research interests and products. The PI created two new graduate courses based on his research.       Last Modified: 06/09/2021       Submitted by: Tiefeng Jiang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
