<AbstractNarration>Light induced chemical processes play important roles in biological systems (such as vision of animals and photosynthesis for the conversion of sunlight to chemical energy stored in plants) and have potential applications in the capture and conversion of light energy to other forms of energy in solar energy devices.   The understanding of the fundamentals of light induced chemical processes will help towards efficient utilization of light for beneficial purposes.  To this end, Prof. V. Ramamurthy of University of Miami aims to gain a fundamental understanding of the light induced energy and electron transfer processes of small molecules confined in molecular containers on different types of material surface.  This interdisciplinary research project, which involves US and international collaborations, provides a unique environment for training graduate and undergraduate students on different aspects of photochemistry, supramolecular chemistry, and surface chemistry.  In addition, Prof. Rammamurthy develops special general lectures to help students and young researchers recognize the important role of basic science in everyday life.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Prof. V. Ramamurthy investigates the excited state behavior of supramolecular structures assembled on solid surfaces.  The specific objectives of this project are: 1) to study photoinduced energy transfer between organic donor and acceptor molecules which are separated and encapsulated in cavitands aligned on passive surfaces (e.g., saponite clay, alpha-zirconium (IV) phosphate and layered double hydroxide); 2) to investigate photoinduced electron transfer across the cavitand wall between an encapsulated organic molecule (as donor) and TiO2 (as acceptor) on which the cavitand container is anchored; and 3) to explore the use of gold clusters and nanoparticles as electron transfer sensitizers in triggering photochemical reactions of small organic molecules encapsulated in cavitands attached to the gold clusters and nanoparticles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit: Interaction of light with molecules and matter play an important role in our everyday life.  The chemistry that is of relevance to energy, materials science and chemical biology occurs where the reactive molecules are placed in a highly confined environment.  These prompted us to probe the chemical behavior of light activated organic molecules enclosed within a highly restricted nanometer sized capsules formed by an organic molecule known as octa acid (OA).  Our studies focused on three aspects: photorelease of active molecules, electron transfer between a capsule confined donor molecule and a free acceptor molecule, and ultrafast dynamics of excited guest molecules confined in a capsule. We have demonstrated that small molecules of chemical and physiological relevance can be released in water at will with a ?flash? of light from capsular confined photoprotected molecules.  Interestingly, the photoprotecting group that triggered the release of the molecule of interest is retained within the capsule.  Such has not been achieved under conventional conditions in aqueous solution thus far.  The proof-of-principle that combines supramolecular photochemistry and photorelease methodology is valuable in developing photoprotected systems to release drugs, polymer initiators and fragrant molecules in aqueous medium without interference from the undesired detached photoprotecting group.  Photoinduced electron transfer process plays a pivotal role in the conversion of solar into chemical energy by plants.  Unlike plants, humans have not been able to efficiently capture and store solar energy for use.  In this context, we have demonstrated that electron transfer can occur between an octa acid incarcerated guest and a free molecule outside in aqueous solution through the wall of the OA capsule. This study has been extended to capsules aligned on solid support such as TiO2 that is used extensively in dye-sensitized solar cells. Our studies have demonstrated the potential value for supramolecular photochemistry in problems related to solar energy.  The final aspect of the project concerned with addressing the question 'whether a confined space can influence the excited state dynamics of molecules?'.  Answer to this question has direct relevance to understanding light triggered events of biological and materials related phenomena.  Ultrafast (fs time resolution) time resolved experiments on the cis-trans isomerization of stilbenes and azobenzenes confined within OA capsule have demonstrated that the isomerization of stilbenes involving torsional motion is dramatically slowed within the capsule compared to that in solution.  Also, in the case of azobenzene the mechanism of isomerization is altered within the confined space.  These results caution in extending the isotropic solution behavior of molecules to that in a confined environment.  These observations have direct relevance to light initiated triggering process in biological events such as photosynthesis, vision, circadian rhythms etc. and in modern devices based on phototriggering methodology involving geometric isomerization and photochromism.     Broader Impact: With the help of NSF funding the PI has contributed to the growth of a new discipline namely, ?Supramolecular Photochemistry?, principles of which has pervaded several areas such as materials-, medicinal- and biological- chemistry.  During his research career the PI has directed and mentored 20 undergraduate students, 45 doctoral students, 15 post-doctoral associates and ten international exchange students.  Most of the doctoral and postdoctoral students remained in USA occupying positions at health care institutions, chemical, pharmaceutical and oil industries, government laboratories, high schools and universities.  The PI has demonstrated continued commitment to exchanging scientific knowledge among chemists from various continents by being chair, co-chair or a member of the organizing committee of nearly 20 major conferences including the PACIFICHEM, annual meeting of the Inter-American Photochemical Society, US-Japan Workshop, Gordon Conference on Photochemistry and IUPAC Conference on Photochemistry.  During the summers of last five years PI has offered short courses on photochemistry to students in Asian countries (Japan, China and India).  In addition, he is active in the community by being a Senior Editor for Langmuir (a leading American Chemical Society journal). In addition, the PI has accumulated considerable experience and knowledge regarding the qualifications needed to be a successful scientist.  The PI continues to pass on his long experience as a scientist to the younger emerging colleagues and students by giving general lectures such as(?Makings of a scientist?, ?Fame and shame?, ?Light and life?, Functional Knowledge from the life of a scientist?, ?Science and scientists: A missing link in our learning? at conferences and universities, within and outside USA.  The PI believes that such lectures enable young and future researchers recognize the importance, how and why one should do science and more importantly the less obvious role of basic science in every-day life.
