<AbstractNarration>Quantifying the rate at which surface waves dissipate energy is necessary to properly model upper ocean mixing, circulation and the waves themselves. A fundamental assumption for much of the work so far is that little to no energy goes from waves into turbulence as long as the waves are not breaking. This study will explore the limits of validity of this assumption using a novel instrument, the Optical Turbulence Sensor (OTS) that can measure turbulence over very short time periods, so that turbulence intensity over different parts of a wave can be resolved in the laboratory.  This project will result in a richer understanding of upper ocean turbulence under waves and lead to improved parameterizations to be used in models. The project will also support two graduate students, include outreach activities for the general public through ongoing community programs at both institutions, distribute wave and turbulence visualizations through the student-run video project Waterlust. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breaking of waves has been shown to be the dominant mechanism for dissipation in most circumstances, however it has also become clear that additional dissipation is required to match observations in non-breaking conditions. To address this, equations were derived for the dissipation of swell wave energy due to interaction of the sheared wave-induced Stokes drift with pre-existing turbulence. An alternative approach recognizes that water has finite viscosity and as such there must be turbulence and dissipation induced by the wave orbital motions. Unfortunately, it is essentially impossible to isolate these proposed sources of dissipation in the field where mean flows, wave breaking, sheared wind-drift currents and buoyancy effects co-exist. Some laboratory studies have confirmed the existence of non-breaking wave-induced turbulence. However, flow visualization studies did not see evidence of turbulence until the wave amplitudes were such that microbreaking could be important. Addressing this significant knowledge gap regarding the turbulent dissipation of non-breaking surface waves, will take a comprehensive laboratory study. Established measurement technologies will be used to calibrate and validate the OTS in the first year. The OTS can measure the temperature dissipation spectrum over temporal windows as short as 1 ms. This enables the measurement of turbulence in non-stationary conditions and can resolve wave phase dependence. The next experiments will quantify the temporal and spatial scales at which turbulence occurs when non-breaking waves propagate over a fluid that is initially at rest. Additional instrumentation will be used to observe mean flows, wave heights and wave slopes. The final experiments will quantify turbulence generation and amplification in the more realistic condition when there is significant pre-existing turbulence. First, monochromatic mechanical waves will be propagated over water containing grid generated turbulence. Then waves with energy distributed from ~0.2 to 2 Hz will be included. Finally, the wave fields will be forced with variable winds and will be sampled for longer duration to investigate the turbulence generation when sheared mean flows are present.  This study will resolve the role of pre-existing turbulence, address whether there is a wave related threshold for turbulence and determine the time, depth and space scales over which turbulence develops.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Temporal and spatial scaling of dissipation under nonbreaking  surface waves;   Accomplishments related to the intellectual merit of this research project were:  Nonbreaking surface waves magnify background turbulent      fluctuations. Nonbreaking wave enhanced turbulence is characterized      by a relatively low Reynolds number. The dissipation caused by nonbreaking waves can attain      values comparable to breaking surface waves. The dissipation caused by nonbreaking waves is      proportional to the square of the mean wave flow stress tensor.      The scientific impact of the project findings:   Considering that surface waves cover most of the ocean, the precise determination of the rate at which surface waves dissipate energy is necessary to properly quantify climate, weather, or ocean dynamic processes at the air-sea interface and within the upper layer of the ocean. The upper-ocean mixing intensity is often related to breaking surface waves while the turbulence generated by nonbreaking surface waves is poorly understood and thus not well represented. Our laboratory experiments used microstructure and optical measurements to observe micro velocity shears and temperature   fluctuations associated with passing nonbreaking solitary surface waves.  Our project documented, measurements of the energy dissipation associated with these nonbreaking surface waves. As a result of the project, we found an analytical approach to quantify the nonbreaking wave turbulence strength from large scale (energy-containing) flow measurements.
