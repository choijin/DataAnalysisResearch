<AbstractNarration>Plants are the ultimate food source for non-photosynthetic organisms. Many pathogenic fungi and oomycetes develop a feeding organ named the haustorium to extract nutrients from host plants. Such pathogens cause widespread and/or devastating crop diseases such as wheat powdery mildew and rust, potato late blight and sudden oak death, resulting in huge crop losses and tree damages worldwide.  In recent years, much has been learnt about the molecular mechanisms concerning plant immunity. However, how defense responses are executed at host-pathogen interfaces is poorly understood. Interactions between the model plant Arabidopsis (epidermal cell)and Powdery mildew (haustorium) provides a convenient single-cell system for addressing this challenging question. The project utilizes an Arabidopsis resistance protein that is specifically targeted to the plant-fungal interface as a unique tool to investigate the formation of the interfacial membrane, how that formation is coupled to immune signaling and protein trafficking to enable defense execution at specific subcellular sites. New information from this project should help elucidate the fundamental cell biology principles governing formation of and activities at host-microbe interfacial membranes, and yield new insight into novel intervention strategies to control plant diseases caused by haustorium-forming pathogens. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of the host-pathogen interaction is determined at the extra-haustorial membrane (EHM), the host-pathogen interface. However, both the origin and biogenesis of the EHM and the molecular host-pathogen interactions at this interface are largely unknown.  The long-term goal of this project is to understand the biogenesis of the EHM and its role in host defense and fungal development. These investigators have shown that (i) a host resistance (R) protein named RPW8 from Arabidopsis is specifically targeted to the EHM where it activates haustorium-targeted defenses via an unknown mechanism; and that (ii) RPW8 contains two putative basic residue-enriched motifs essential for EHM-targeting.  Therefore, RPW8 can be used as a unique tool to understand the host defense at the EHM, the origin and biogenesis of the EHM, and the EHM-oriented protein trafficking in the invaded host cell during haustorial development. Specifically, there are three major aims for this project. Aim 1 addresses how hydrogen peroxide is produced and accumulated in the host-pathogen interface during RPW8-mediated and basal resistance against haustorium-forming pathogens. Aim 2 is focused on characterization of a special protein (SNARE) complex that is engaged in the EHM-oriented vesicle trafficking. Aim 3 investigates EHM biogenesis and its role in host defense and fungal pathogenesis. A combinatory forward and reverse genetics approach, aided by chemical genetic assays and state-of-the-art confocal imaging will be employed to achieve the above three specific objectives. Novel and important knowledge from this project will significantly advance our current understanding of the cell biology and molecular interaction between plants and haustorium-forming pathogens, which should help design new strategies to control plant diseases caused by such pathogens in the future. The investigators will also continue to produce short videos of their work that can be disseminated and used for teaching.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>With support from this NSF award (IOS-1457033), the research group used the Arabidopsis-powdery mildew interaction as a model pathosystem to investigate how plant defense is executed at the host-pathogen interface?the extra-haustorial membrane (EHM), how the broad-spectrum resistance protein RPW8.2 is targeted to the EHM, and the potential mechanisms concerning EHM origin and biogenesis. In the meantime, this research project offered training opportunities for next-generation plant scientists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Genetic and molecular evidence generated from this project demonstrated that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;production in the host-pathogen interface and in the fungal haustoria (Image 1) can be attributed to the enzymatic activity of Xanthine Dehydrogenease (XDH1), along with that of NADH oxidases D and F. More interestingly, XDH1 plays dual and opposing roles in protecting plants from haustorium-invasion and reducing oxidative damage in chloroplasts (Featured Article in The Plant Cell 28 (5), 1108-1126) (Image 2). Through the research on the functional origin of RPW8.2, it was found that the EHM-targeting capacity of RPW8.2 was shared by all RPW8 family members. Interestingly, the progenitor of the RPW8 family, HR3 was found to be localized to the plasma membrane, the fungal penetration site (the papilla) and the EHM, creating an excellent opportunity to investigate the origin of the EHM. By using HR3 as a reporter, it was found that the EHM is most likely synthesized&nbsp;<em>de novo</em>, thus correcting the misconception that the EHM is formed via invagination of the plasma membrane (Plant Physiology 173, 600-613). Through a forward genetic screen,&nbsp;a Qb-SNARE protein (VTI11) known to be engaged in the Trans Golgi network (TGN)-Vacuole trafficking pathway, was identified to be required for RPW8.2-mediated resistance to powdery mildew. Further analyses showed that VTI11 is required for efficient EHM-targeting of RPW8.2. Similar results have also been obtained for SYP22, a Qa-SNARE (syntaxin) known to form a SNARE complex with VTI11 (manuscript under preparation). These results indicate that a VTI11-containing SNARE complex is engaged in targeting RPW8.2 to the EHM and suggest that re-orientation of the TGN-Vacuole vesicle traffic towards the haustorium is critical to EHM biogenesis in the host epidermal cells invaded by powdery mildew. The new information from this project contributes to the elucidation of the molecular basis of the haustorium-targeted (thus broad-spectrum) anti-fungal resistance and provided cell biological evidence for the origin of the extra-haustorial membrane interface. Results from this project have also laid a solid foundation for future understanding of the molecular composition and the role of the EHM in the plant-fungal interaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;This project has also supported other related work in the PI?s lab, resulting in publication of 10 research articles and one review article, in addition to two manuscripts under review/revision.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Attracting, training and inspiring young students to join the field of plant science is critical to continuous agricultural innovations that are required for ensuring global food security of a growing population in the face of climate change. Results of this project have not only stimulated research in the relevant science community but have also been used in classroom teaching and other public education events (Image 3). Moreover, the project offered training opportunities for more than 20 young people ranging from high-school interns to postdocs.
