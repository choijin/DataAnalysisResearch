<AbstractNarration>Changes in dissolved oxygen availability strongly influence biological and geochemical processes in marine systems. However, marine oxygen concentrations often co-vary with other environmental factors, such as organic carbon flux, confounding paleoceanographic proxies for dissolved oxygen concentration in most deep-sea settings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project, involving researchers and students from Indiana State University and Duke University, seeks to develop a proxy for bottom-water oxygen levels based on the shell morphology of benthic foraminifera. The research will include a sea-going expedition off San Diego, CA, to collect samples. The researchers will use Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and image analysis tools for quantitative analysis of both archived and newly collected samples to calibrate the relationship between dissolved oxygen and pore densities of living epifaunal deep sea taxa. Specifically, they will determine: 1) how sensitive pore density is to small changes in oxygenation, 2) how pore characteristics change within and across obvious taxonomic boundaries, and 3) the range of dissolved oxygen that is best for each species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding supports students at both institutions, including their participation on the cruise. The research team will also develop a cruise blog that will be featured in an interactive exhibit at Indiana State University.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Benthic foraminifera are microfossils found throughout the oceans and have been used to reconstruct past oceanographic conditions.  These fossils have been used to better understand environmental conditions in the past, including climatic conditions during intervals when the planet?s climate was radically different from the present time.  Although a number of environmental variables have been reconstructed (water temperature perhaps being the best example), dissolved oxygen of oceanic waters has been difficult to assess.  In this study, the porosity of live benthic foraminiferal shells that live on top of the oceanic sediments in contact with the overlying bottom water was compared with dissolved oxygen levels to determine if a relationship exists.  The results from the study show that there is, indeed, a relationship, with high porosity of the shells found with low oxygen values and decreasing porosity with increased oxygen levels.  These results suggest that the relationship may be due to gas exchange between the foraminifera and the bottom water, with greater porosity enhancing gas exchange.  These results indicate that porosity of fossil specimens of benthic foraminifera may be used to reconstruct past dissolved oxygen levels of oceanic waters.  This information will be useful in understanding how the earth?s climate and the different oceanic environments evolved through time, which in turn will be helpful in predicting future oceanic conditions as the climate changes.  In terms of broader impact, this study involved a number of undergraduate and graduate students and was the basis for one Master of Science thesis.  Students learned about oceanic fossils and methods used to sample and analyze oceanic sediments.  One scientific publication was submitted to a professional journal and is under review and a number of presentations by students were made at national and international scientific meetings.
