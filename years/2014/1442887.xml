<AbstractNarration>From writing an encyclopedia, to developing software, to folding proteins, more and more problems that used to be solved by small groups of experts are now being solved by much larger "crowds" of people using the Internet. For many complex problems, however, the creativity, energy, and diversity that crowds bring are not enough to solve the problems. Various kinds of specialized knowledge that only experts have are also needed. This project focuses on creating the cyber-infrastructure to combine these two kinds of resources--experts and crowds--in solving complex societal problems. The project will address this question in the context of what many people believe is one of humanity?s most important sustainability challenges today: how to deal with trending environmental dynamics. Much of the proposed work includes developing and testing ideas on the team's CoLab, a software platform and online community focused on this issue, which was developed with prior NSF and other support.  More specifically, the project will investigate how experts and crowds can work together to perform four key problem-solving activities: decomposing the overall problem into smaller pieces, generating potential solutions for the pieces, integrating the pieces into overall solutions, and evaluating the solutions. For example, the project will study (a) whether crowds generate better ideas when they start with "seed" ideas from experts, (b) how certain kinds of expert knowledge can be encoded in computer simulation models that crowds can use on their own, and (c) to what degree expert evaluations can be approximated by combinations of semi-experts, novices, and software tools.&lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;The results are expected to include (a) open source software applicable to many sustainability and other challenges, (b) a set of processes and methodologies with which communities can effectively use this software, and (c) a diverse community of tens of thousands of people using this approach to address issues associated with trending environmental changes.  The primary intellectual contribution of the proposed work will be better processes and computer tools for creating on-line communities that combine the best features of both experts and crowds to solve complex societal problems. Many aspects of the technical and organizational approaches to be studied should be of interest to researchers in a variety of fields, including collective intelligence, computer-supported cooperative work, human computer interaction, computer science, engineering, organizational design, psychology, and public policy.  By engaging students and the general public to come up with credible ideas for what people can do about complex problems, this project will help educate a much broader community about the actual issues involved. If successful, the work will likely lead to the development of better approaches for complex societal problems than any that would otherwise have been developed. Many aspects of the results will be applicable to a wide range of domains such as education, healthcare, and business problems like strategic planning and budgeting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this project has been to develop an approach to online problem-solving that combines contributions by large numbers of people from all around the world (crowds) and people with deep knowledge in relevant domains (experts). The primary area in which we pursued this goal was the problem of what we humans can do about global climate change.   To do this, we developed an online platform called Climate CoLab and an online community of people using this platform that includes some of the world?s leading experts on climate change as well as over 120,000 other members from many different occupations and from all over the world.  Together these community members have developed and evaluated proposals for how to solve various aspects of the climate change problem, from how to generate electricity with fewer emissions to how to change public attitudes about climate.  Since the beginning of the project, over 1,000,000 people have visited the site, and the members have participated in over 80 online contests about different climate change topics in which they developed over 2,000 detailed proposals about actions that could be taken. From these proposals, over 100 were selected as winners by over 500 expert judges.  For example, the proposal that won the 2015 Grand Prize was about a device called the SunSaluter.  This device was a solar panel that rotated during the day to follow the sun across the sky, thus generating more electricity than fixed solar panels.  And the rotation was powered by dripping water which was filtered to produce about four liters of clean drinking water per day.  Thus, a single low-cost device produces both electricity and clean drinking water, two critical needs for millions of people around the world.  This innovative idea came from a young, female entrepreneur who had the idea when she was only 16 years old and later dropped out of Princeton to pursue the idea full-time.  Her idea is just one of the many examples of potential solutions that were found using our crowd-based approach but that would almost certainly not have come to light using more conventional expert-based approaches to problem-solving.  Another important result of our project was a very general approach to using online crowds to solve complex problems.  A key issue in doing this is how to divide a problem into parts and then combine the solutions for the parts into a solution for the whole problem.  We called our approach contest webs.  Inspired by complex supply chains for physical products like automobiles, a contest web is a family of related online contests for solutions to different parts of the overall problem.  But, importantly, some of these contests are integrated contests in which people compete to see who can best combine the solutions from other contests into integrated solutions for a larger part of the problem.  For instance, we had basic contests for ideas about how to reduce carbon emissions in various sectors of the economy (such as buildings, transportation, and electricity generation).  We also had integrated contests for how to combine these ideas into overall plans for different regions of the world (such as the US, China, and Europe). And we had one more integrated contest for how to combine these regional plans into an overall plan for the whole world. The potential of this approach was demonstrated in one of the winning global proposals where 25 proposal authors, many of whom had never interacted before, worked together to create a single integrated global proposal.  We also investigated how our overall approaches to large-scale problem-solving could be used to help solve other complex problems such as cancer legislation and climate philanthropy. For example, in one project, we developed a platform that engaged the general public of Chile in reacting to proposed legislation about government programs related to cancer.  In just 3 weeks, this platform generated over 800 comments on the 24 sections of the proposed law, and the results were presented to the Chilean Senate while it was debating the legislation.  In addition to our dissemination of research results to academic audiences, our research has also been featured in a variety other media, including Discover Magazine, Forbes, Vox, National Geographic, and BBC World Service.
