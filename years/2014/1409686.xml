<AbstractNarration>Dust in the atmosphere has important impacts on clouds, precipitation and climate.  This is due to how the dust interacts with cloud particles and solar radiation.  One of the dustiest places on Earth is the Atlantic Ocean just west of the Sahara Desert.  A number of researchers have studied the effect of this "Saharan Air Layer" on tropical cyclones and other cloud systems.  However, research under this award will look at the issue in reverse, asking the question:  How do clouds and precipitation affect the Saharan Air Layer?  The importance of this work is the discovery of how dust is transported and redistributed by clouds and precipitation, which may have a significant impact on climate.  The removal of dust from the atmosphere through precipitation may also impact ocean fertilization.  In addition, the research will provide training opportunities for the next generation of scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objective of the project is to study how convection impacts the temporal and spatial distributions of dust through cloud processing and transport.  The amount of dust and the impacts on the Saharan Air Layer will be assessed through a combination of regional cloud modeling, existing aircraft data sets and existing satellite data sets.  The research team poses three main scientific questions that will be addressed in this award:  1) Relative to pre-storm amounts, how much dust is removed from the atmosphere and deposited to the ocean through the action of precipitating storms?  2) Where do convective storms preferentially redistribute dust in the atmosphere, and how is the vertical distribution of dust changed by the passage of convective storms?  3) What are the potential effects of the removal and redistribution of dust on ocean fertilization, and the impacts on direct and indirect radiative effects both locally and downstream of the storm development?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Broad Summary  Throughout the year, vast quantities of soil-dust particles embedded in the dry Saharan Air Layer travel from Africa westward over the tropical Atlantic Ocean. These particles can act to seed droplets and ice crystals in storms that form over the Atlantic and may develop into hurricanes. Through these microphysical changes, dust particles can influence how strong and deep storms are, how much they rain, how long they last, and how they absorb heat and scatter light.

Training was included for 18 graduate students who were deeply involved in field work, data analysis, and the dissemination of results. Several presentations and publications in major geoscience journals were produced, with a summary of research outcomes given below.     Modeling Studies  Numerical simulations included a case study of the 2006 Tropical Storm Debby. The modeling work was unique in its ability to track dust mass throughout the cloud system, from dust regenerated upon hydrometeor evaporation to its removal to the ocean surface. In this simulation, the track and characteristics of the storm were better reproduced when dust particles were included.  While some Saharan dust is transported and deposited in the upper troposphere by the storm, two orders of magnitude more dust was predicted to be deposited to the ocean surface than transported to the upper troposphere. A substantial amount of dust was also transported and deposited at middle levels which has implications for mid-level cloud development. The results of these modeling studies have been found to be highly consistent both with those obtained using aircraft data and satellite observations (see the next two sections), thereby suggesting a robust signal.     Aircraft Data  Using aircraft data taken in and around convective storms over the Atlantic, an aerosol enhancement zone was found at the bottom edge of tropical storm anvils. Particle number concentrations in dust size ranges were enhanced by four to sixty times over background concentrations, depending on the storm and particle size. The enhancement zone was also observed in data from the onboard lidar instrument.

These results were used to estimate concentrations of heterogeneous ice nucleating particles lofted by storms to the upper troposphere. A comparison with measured cirrus concentrations showed that lofting of dust is likely important for cirrus formation downstream.     Satellite Analysis  Four years of satellite observations were used to assess the influence of tropical storm systems on dust transport over a broad area of the Atlantic Ocean. A novel compositing technique used geostationary cloud observations together with the polar orbiting CloudSat and CALIPSO satellites to track aerosol optical depth changes throughout a typical convective storm lifecycle. It was shown on average that tropical convection accounts for about 15% of dust deposition into the Atlantic Ocean, where it can provide a rapid influx of nutrients for ocean life. Convection also lofts a small amount of dust mass from the Saharan Air Layer to altitudes greater than 6 km. Both of these results were also evident in our modeling studies. Saharan dust is an efficient ice nucleating particle at cold temperatures and so this is likely important for the formation and lifecycle of clouds downstream of deep convection.     Field Campaigns  Numerous features of convective storms facilitate the transport of dust including the updrafts and the cold pools. A local field campaign focused on measuring updraft and cold pool characteristics using a novel combination of instrumented UAVs, radiosondes, surface stations and radar was conducted in order to assess the scales of variability associated with these storm features, as well as how well such features and their associated transport are represented in numerical models. Analysis of the field campaign data has demonstrated a wide range in the spatial and temporal scales of cold pools, that turbulent mixing along the cold pool edge has a strong impact on temperature profiles and subsequent cold pool dissipation, and that estimates of updraft strength range considerably based on the techniques being used to estimate it. All of these findings have significant implications for the transport of dust by storms, as well as the evaluation of numerical simulations.
