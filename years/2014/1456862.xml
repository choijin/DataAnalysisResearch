<AbstractNarration>Brain function is dependent upon proteins that allow ions to pass across neuron cell membranes (called ion channels) to create currents that mediate the electrical activity of neurons. Protein channels that permit potassium ions to pass through neuron membranes are generally thought to quiet excessive neuron activity.  However, there is a growing list of examples indicating that these "BK-type" potassium ion channels may also increase neuron excitability. The fact that BK channels are expressed throughout the nervous system suggests that understanding such paradoxical effects is important for understanding brain function in general.  The investigators will record the activity of neurons in mice to learn the conditions that cause BK channels to quiet or excite neurons.  The results will be used to make computational models that predict the anti-excitatory or pro-excitatory behaviors of BK channels.  The project will train graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow to use state-of-art methods for studying brain function and anatomy and to make computational models, and will support the development of an integrated online virtual laboratory, "The Ion Channel laboratory," to teach users about ion channels and the electrical excitability of neurons. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The mechanisms underlying how slow- and fast-gating BK channel types either depress or paradoxically enhance a neuron's likelihood for firing an action potential (AP) will be studied in dentate gyrus neurons of the hippocampus. Using wild type neurons that express slow-gating BK channels, and transgenic neurons (BK beta4 knockout) that express fast-gating channels, the investigators will directly measure the cause-and-effect relationship between BK-regulated AP shape, activation of spike-triggered bulk and local calcium, recruitment of interspike conductances, and AP frequency. These data will be used to generate a computational model of dentate gyrus neurons that predicts the context in which BK channels reduce or enhance neuronal excitability.  The model will then be experimentally tested in hippocampus CA1 pyramidal cells and cerebellum purkinje neurons to determine if pro-excitatory effects uncovered in dentate gyrus neurons are features observed in other neuron types that express BK channels. The findings of this study will create new understanding and new neuronal computational models of spike-influenced conductance and its effect on intrinsic excitability.</AbstractNarration>

Opening of voltage-dependent sodium and potassium channels generate voltage changes, called "action potentials" or "spikes", which relay information within nerve fibers. Historically, scientists have regarded action potentials as binary signals. As such, their frequency encodes the relative strength of the signal conveyed. Thus, one action potential is a weaker signal than two or more action potentials. However, there is a great diversity in the spike-to-spike&nbsp;<em>shape&nbsp;</em>of action potentials that belies their function as simple binary signals. Our hypothesis is that the shape of an individual action potential, regulated by selective activation of various ion channels, can influence the frequency of action potentials. Our goal in this project was to understand how one type of potassium channel, the BK-type voltage- and calcium-activated potassium channel, affects action potential shape and frequency. Our approach was to use genetic manipulation of BK channels to influence the shape of action potentials in the same neuron, and therefore allow us to understand the relationship between action potential shape and frequency.

Our findings are as follows. 1) We find that BK potassium channels promote an increased action potential frequency by increasing the afterhyperpolarization phase of the action potential. The action potential afterhyperpolarization is mediated by ryanodine receptors that activate BK channels. We also show that pharmacologically blocking ryanodine receptors, reduces BK channel activation, and reduces action potential frequency. These findings provide a mechanism by which humans who have ryanodine receptor gain-of-function mutations have seizures, and suggest that BK channel antagonist might be a therapy for these individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;2) We also find that dentate gyrus neurons contain a mixture of BK potassium channel subtypes, each with a distinct role in regulation of membrane excitability. The subtypes of BK channels change, from type II to type I subtypes, in response to previous neuronal activity. The reduction of the type II subtypes are correlated with lower threshold for action potential activation. These findings suggest that previous neuronal activity causes a positive feedback change in BK channels that promotes further increase in excitability. We speculate that this may be a mechanism to reinforce learning, and also may contribute to maladaptive changes in these neurons that contribute to epilepsy development. 3) We have been successful in creating a computation model of dentate gyrus neuronal action potentials to investigate the mechanism by which the afterhyperpolarization increases action potential frequency.&nbsp;&nbsp;We identified a novel mechanism for this increased excitability.

In conclusion, the study highlights the unconventional role that BK potassium channels may have in promoting the generation of action potentials, and provides an understanding of how it may occur.
