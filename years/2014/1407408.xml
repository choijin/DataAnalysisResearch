<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of U.S.-based graduate students and new Ph.D's at the "Tenth AIMS International Conference on Dynamical Systems, Differential Equations and Applications", which will be held on July 7-11, 2014, hosted by the Instituto de Ciencias Matematicas (ICMAT) and the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM) in Madrid, Spain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be plenary talks given by 12 international experts who are already confirmed as speakers, mainly from the U.S. and Europe.  There will also be over 1000 shorter invited talks and 200-300 contributed talks.  There will be a Student Paper Symposium for the winners of a student paper competition, to encourage graduate students to write up their new results.  The topics covered will include all areas of the important and diverse fields of differential equations, dynamical systems, and many applications of these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site:  http://www.aimsciences.org/conferences/2014/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The American Institute of Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) founded and has been organizing the Conference Series on "Dynamical Systems, Differential Equations and Applications," biennially, that provides a vital international forum for mathematicians and scientists working in the ever growing field of analysis and applied analysis, including dynamical systems, differential equations, and real-world applications.  Each conference takes place in a different region of the world to benefit most people.  The following six features make the Conference Series unique and outstanding.     (1) Its plenary speakers of the highest caliber, invited by the scientific committee consisting of some world-renown mathematicians and scientists; (2) its high quality and broad coverage in the field so that each participant will be able to find numerous stimulating talks; (3) its well-organized symposia with presentations by the leading experts in the chosen areas; (4) its capacity of arranging each conference in a different region of the world to benefit most people; (5) its organizer, AIMS, which is backed up by thousands of enthusiasts and supporters.  Its proceedings is published, with open-access, by AIMS; and (6) its financial support for and broad participation by, young researchers and graduate students.    The 10th AIMS International Conference on Dynamical Systems, Differential Equations and Applications was held at the Universidad Aut&oacute;noma de Madrid, Spain, July1-5, 2014. It was participated by 2,200 mathematicians and scientists, a new record, from 100 countries. The five-day conference featured the Keynote Speakers: Nalini Anantharaman, Diego C&oacute;rdoba, Ingrid Daubechies, Weinan E, Charles L.

There were 126 special sessions, 6 contributed sessions, and a poster session.  For the first time, Competition of Best Student Papers was introduced.  See http://aimsciences.org/conferences/2014/2014_students.html  The NSF grant supported partial travel expenses for 40 graduate students, post-doc trainees and young faculties to attend the Conference. 21 of those recipients are from the groups of graduate students, women, and minority.  The Conference at Madrid was saluted by an article at Dynamical Systems Magazine, http://www.dynamicalsystems.org/ma/ma/display?item=517  The peer-reviewed proceedings of the Conference, edited by Manuel de Leon, Wei Feng, Zhaosheng Feng, Xin Lu, J.M. Martell, Javier Parcet, Daniel Peralta-Salas and Weihua Ruan, will be published in summer 2015.  The first Conference took place at Southwest Missouri State University, Springfield, MO, USA, in May 1996, with 250 participants.  Twenty years later, the 10th Conference at Madrid grew 10 folds in size, marking the Conference Series the most attended international conference in the fields.  Therefore, the Conference Series has proved itself to be a much needed and anticipated grand event.  The Conference Series has been financially supported by the United States National Science Foundation.          Last Modified: 03/27/2015       Submitted by: Yaw Chang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
