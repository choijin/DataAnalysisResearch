<AbstractNarration>PI: Narayanan, Ranga &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: CBET - 1402151&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Florida &lt;br/&gt;Title: Travel Grant for the Seventh International Conference and Workshop on Interfacial Fluids and Transport Phenomena Processes, Vienna, Austria, June 23-26, 2014&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on past conferences in Italy, Israel and other countries, this conference will promote the rapid dissemination of the latest research results and encourage research collaborations from around the world in the cross-disciplinary areas of interfacial fluids and transport processes. In addition to the personal contacts that the U.S. participants will make with people from the other countries, it will be beneficial to U.S. interests to foster exchanges of research and teaching ideas and of personnel, and establish research collaborations between chemical engineers from the U.S. and chemical engineers from the international community. The use of the travel grants for young faculty and researchers will ensure that the connections and collaborations made at the conference will have a long-lasting effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year?s conference focuses on areas such as materials processing in bio-transport and environmental applications, interfacial nano-structures, drug delivery, and fundamental transport issues of interfacial bubble and drop stabilities.</AbstractNarration>
