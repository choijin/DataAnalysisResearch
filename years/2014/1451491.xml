<AbstractNarration>This project is supporting the first in-person meeting of the Global Learning Council (GLC).  Started in 2013, the GLC includes members from industry, academia, non-profits, and government.  At this conference they will discuss technology-enhanced learning, focused on the application of learning science to the development of learning tools, data on learning gains, and the science of how students learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific conference sessions include a) Best Practices, b) Big Data, and c) K-16.  Working groups will focus on additional topics such as a) funding for educational research in the era of online courses and other technology-enhanced learning tools, and b) policy challenges related to scaling research-driven outcome-based learning. The conference will lead to several deliverables which include case studies that demonstrate the importance of data in improving technology enhanced learning, recommendations on the next steps and processes in using student outcome data across different sectors (such as educational, workforce, company, and philanthropic), announcement of a new collection of learning outcome data donated by a number of the institutions represented in the GLC, the announcement of a set of tools that make learning analytics accessible to an increasing number of the stakeholders involved in the development and dissemination of effective teaching.  These and other deliverables will be made available through the Global Learning Council site and the site for the Simons Initiative at Carnegie Mellon.  Conference attendees will provide evaluation feedback.  This project is funded by the Division of Undergraduate Education through the IUSE program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major activity supported by the award was the inaugural symposium of the Global Learning Council (GLC), which brought together thought leaders from industry, academia, non-profits, and government to explore the new landscape of technology-enhanced learning, and how to ensure that knowledge about how people learn drives the development of learning tools, while supporting continued advances in our understanding of human learning.  The project also provided support for disseminating findings and products from the meeting (including new online educational tools and a white paper on best practices in technology-enhanced learning), thus building a foundation for ongoing, cross sector collaboration.  An overarching goal of the GLC meeting was to broaden the nature of the educational-technology dialogue to include "post-MOOCs" and other kinds of innovative technology-enhanced learning tools, to connect learning scientists, education organizations, technology providers, major funders of work in this area, and government officials, all of whose day-to-day work is being fundamentally changed by this new landscape.  This need to move from whatÆs currently a one-dimensional approach involving universities and MOOC providers to the multi-dimensional, cross-sector collaboration facilitated by an organization such as the GLC  is clearly seen by reviewing some of the most prominent convenings that were held in the months preceding the GLCÆs inaugural meeting.    As a result of this project, the symposium successfully brought together GLC members, thought leaders and guests to address these key issues.  Held on September 4-5, the event saw over 200 participants, representing 55 higher educational institutions, government groups, non-profit organizations and companies.  Sessions for the meeting included:  Opening Remarks from leaders of hosting institutions President Subra Suresh (Carnegie Mellon University) and Chancellor Patrick Gallagher (University of Pittsburgh) Keynote Addresses by leaders including: Tom Kalil (Director for Technology and Innovation, Office of Science and Technology Polic, The White House); Luis von Ahn (CEO, Duolingo); Joan Ferrini-Mundy (Assistant Director, U.S. National Science foundation, Directorate for education and Human Resources); and James Shelton (Deputy Secratyr, U.S. Department of Education). Panel Discussions on topics: "The Role of Learning Science in Learning Gain: TEL Best PRactices &amp; How to Practice Them"; "Big Data in the Service of Better Learning"; and "K-12 TEL: REadiness for Life and Learning". Demo/Poster Session Working Group Sessions: GLC member sessions; Meeting of Representatives from Government and Private Funding Agencies; "Lowering barriers ot evidence-based educational innovations" open session.   This mix of session types helped to achieve the multiple goals of the conference: improving collaboration across sectors; increasing collaboration within sectors (particularly among the members of the GLC, the attendees from foundations, and government representatives); laying the groundwork for an international learning data infrastructure with contributions of learning data, policy, and learning analytic methods and tools from across the sectors.  One specific outcome beyond the meeting is the development of a white paper covering "Best Practices" in developing and deploying Technology Enhanced Learning. The white-paper was subsequently presented to university leaders at meetings of the Association of American Universities (AAU) and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU). Feedback and case studies resulting from these presentations and subsequent activities are being used in the development of a website that will act as a repository and ongoing resource for educational practitioners and leaders on how to best integrate technology, data and evidence based approaches for improving learning outcomes.
