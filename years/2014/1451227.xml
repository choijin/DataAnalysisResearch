<AbstractNarration>The 10th International Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and Technologies (CoNEXT) will take place December 2-5, 2014, in Sydney, Australia. This award provides support for 10 US-based graduate students to attend this conference. Participation in conferences such as CoNEXT forms a central part of the graduate school experience, providing students with an opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and exposing them to leading-edge research in the field. ACM CoNEXT stands unique in its emphasis on interactions between networking researchers at an international level, and attending CoNEXT presents an excellent opportunity for US graduate students to connect with the thriving international research community. As in past years, CoNEXT 2014 will include a special student workshop, allowing students to present present their work in progress, receive feedback on their work, and obtain valuable experience in writing and presenting technical papers. The support enables students, who would otherwise be unable to attend to participate in the main conference and associated workshops at CoNEXT 2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project integrates research and education of students through exposure to a premier technical meeting in computer networks and communications. Students will have the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in their field, both in the main conference and the associated workshops, and their inclusion will have a positive impact on the quality of their research. Women and other minorities will be especially encouraged to participate. The CoNEXT conference has developed into a top-tier international conference, presenting a tremendous opportunity to students to expand their knowledge of the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The CoNext student travel grant was developed to provide a wide range of student with the opportunity to attend CoNext 2014, a premier networking conference.  The CoNext conference is especially unique because it includes an all day student work geared towards nurturing future researchers.  In selecting awardees, special care was taken to coordinate with the organizers of the student committee to ensure that students were aware of funding opportunities and to eliminate scheduling conflicts between our respective deadlines. As a result of this travel grant, many awardees were able to enroll and engage in the workshop.  The CoNext student travel grant had a transformative impact on the CoNext workshop.  Due to the creation of the travel grants, many US-based students were able to attend this premier conference in Australia.  The grant helped enable an environment to foster the development of junior graduate students. This environment facilitated interaction between junior and senior researchers. A key outcome of this interaction is the development of junior researchers through practical and instructional activities.  The long term impact of the travel grant is to expose future researcher to effective research strategies, create synergies between the next generation researchers; and educate students about career choices, and expectations.   Furthermore, the travel grant provided students with an opportunity to better understand the science of good research and to participate.
