<AbstractNarration>Broader Significance and Importance:  The proposed project is devoted to providing reliable models and the state-of-the-art numerical methods for studying the wave-matter interactions as in geometrical optics and nano optics with practical applications arising from seismic imaging, medical imaging, nanotechnology, nanosciences, and so on. The proposed models and numerical methods are based on knowledge of geometrical optics, physical optics, nano optics, computational chemistry and scientific computing, aiming to provide numerical tools and guidance for applications.  Interdisciplinary collaborations will be pursued to extend the practical applications of the proposed methods.  The project also involves the integration of research and education in computational mathematics. Graduate and undergraduate students, and members from underrepresented  groups will be encouraged to participate in the project  to enhance their knowledge and research. The proposed project will further the training and education of students and encourage them to pursue  future career in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The PI will develop reliable models and efficient numerical methods to simulate the wave-matter interactions as in geometrical optics and nano optics.  When the size of the matter is much larger than the wavelength, the interactions are equivalent to simulating high frequency waves in nonhomogeneous media with the  effect of matter averaged and embedded continuously as medium constants.  The PI will combine geometrical optics  and physical optics along with scientific computing to design  and analyze efficient numerical methods.  When the  size of the matter reaches nanoscale, the interactions  require to simulate the motion of the matter and the  evolution of  the waves simultaneously as in the study of the optical  responses of nanostructures in nano optics,  where the quantum  effects of the matter must be considered. The PI will use the  semi-classical theories as the  guideline to derive simple models  to characterize the interactions  and propose multiscale methods to  simulate  the interactions.   The proposed models and methods  consist of  the following core ideas: (1) for simulating high  frequency waves, the  Huygens-Kirchhoff integral with  the Green functions serves as the formulation and mechanism for  advancing the  wave propagation, where geometrical optics provides  asymptotic approximations of the Green functions. The phase  and  amplitude to approximate the Green functions can be computed  efficiently with accurate methods for  Hamilton-Jacobi equations. The oscillatory Huygens-Kirchhoff integral can be evaluated  efficiently with  multilevel algorithms based on low-rank matrix decompositions.  And data compression techniques to compress  the phase and  amplitude ensure the feasibility of building the waves in  both two and three-dimensional spaces.  And  (2) for studying the optical responses of nanostructures,  the semi-classical theories that treat the waves  classically  with the Maxwell equations and retain the quantum mechanical description of the matter provide  characterizations  of the light-matter interactions. The Born-Oppenheimer  approximation and the ab initio molecular  dynamics  can be utilized  to resolve the difficulty of  dealing with the many-body system quantum mechanically,  which  results in simple semi-classical models that are numerically trackable with proposed multiscale schemes.</AbstractNarration>
