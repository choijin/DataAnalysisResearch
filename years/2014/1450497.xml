<AbstractNarration>This project explores the foundation for innovative uses of the emerging consumer technology Google Glass in scientific fieldwork applied to polar regions. The new and disruptive Google Glass wearable computing device presents a unique opportunity for researchers to engage in the early development stages of a device poised to heavily impact the course of technological innovation. Glass? hands free operation gives the device particularly strong potential as a research tool in remote, harsh regions, such as the North Slope of Alaska. As proof of concept, this project will produce several&lt;br/&gt;small Glass specific software applications that align with research projects currently in progress. It will also lay framework the development of supporting cyberinfrastructure activities, such as innovative network approaches for remote fieldwork, cost effective&lt;br/&gt;sensor integration, new methods of communication for remote classroom programs, and smarter data collection methodologies through technology. The project directly addresses the development of a polar cyberinfrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:   This project aimed to strategically align new consumer-grade technology with research investigators best positioned to make use of the new capabilities. The proposal targeted Arctic Glass - wearable imaging technology being brought to market by Google at the time of approval of this grant.  In particular, the Arctic Glass project sought to augment and enhance existing methods of field work in the Arctic through the use of Google Glass and related consumer-grade technologies.  The project's original objectives to employ Google Glass were forced to be modified by Google's decision in early 2015 to withdraw the Glass product from the market.  The project focus then turned to: i) developing robust wireless network infrastructure for deployment in the field at Toolik, and ii) exploring the imaging capabilities of consumer-grade drones equipped with off-the-shelf optical and infrared cameras.      For task i), we designed, tested, and fielded WOLF (Wireless Operational Link for the Field), a hardened, $700 wireless network instrument deployed in the arctic field at Toolik.   For task ii), we designed, tested and fielded implementation of a $2000 drone-based arctic environment surveyer: a commercial drone enabled with multiple optical and near-infrared video cameras with data capture and analysis powered by Amazon Web Services components.      Broader Impacts:   The project exposes the risks associated with developing science projects around new consumer technologies, like Google Glass, that may not be sustainable a business.   The pivot to WOLF and drone-based imaging demonstrates the flexibility associated with innovative, cutting-edge research.     Aspects of the project's development are exposed on a publicly available website hosted at http://arctic-glass.blogspot.com/.
