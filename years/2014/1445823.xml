<AbstractNarration>High-Performance and Distributed Computing (HPDC) has made significant impact in simulation and modeling of many domains, ranging from understanding&lt;br/&gt;fundamental physical processes to designing new and functional materials. With the growing richness of capabilities, increased ease of access and availability of high-performance and distributed computing resources, the opportunity to employ such resources to novel problems types and domains arises. The aim of the proposed workshop is to bring the HPDC and the Polar Science communities together to collectively explore, examine and identify the opportunities and barriers in the use of high performing computing techniques and resources for polar science studies. The workshop has the potential to bring advantages to both fields, where NSF has been investing considerable resources over the past years. Outcomes from the workshop will benefit science and society through the laying of the foundation for collaborative efforts aiming at improving the understanding of the variability of the polar regions at different timescales, and their connection to climate and other Earth systems. Moreover, it will contribute to the building of a polar cyberinfrastructure, one of the goals of the Polar Cyberinfrastructure Program at the National Science Foundation. &lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be held at the Rutgers Climate Institute and will host approximately 40 participants, lasting two and a half days, at the end of October or early November. A broad group of scientists from the polar science and HPDC communities, both broadly defined, will be engaged as members of the organizing committee to identify major challenges, opportunities and questions such as: What HPDC/CI support is already available to the Polar Science community? What HPDC/CI capabilities are missing? Unsatisfactory? Insufficient or Incomplete? What are the cyberinfrastructure barriers beyond availability that limits further advancing Polar Science? The workshop participants will be also asked to create a ranked list of scientific challenges that the community aims to tackle on a 1-year, 5-year and a decadal time frame. The final outcome of the workshop will be a report that defines and conveys a community-based vision for the Polar Cyberinfrastructure Program at the National Science Foundation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[         Intellectual Merit: Climate change in the 20th and 21st century is dramatically changing the polar regions. This is documented by numerous studies, for example as thawing permafrost, retreating Arctic sea ice and accelerating mass loss from glaciers and ice sheets. These changes may have widespread consequences for many aspects of the earth systems, e.g. carbon budget, food and water security, sea levels, and freshwater input to oceans. To understand the changing polar regions and their global impacts, scientists are increasingly using very large datasets derived from high-resolution satellite imagery, airborne missions, and computer modeling. However, advanced cyberinfrastructure, and in particular, high-performance distributed computing (HPDC) remains an underutilized resource within the polar science community.   Broader Impact: In addition to the societal impact of the topics covered, the project also provided training activities and engagement opportunities for several graduate students, post-doctoral researchers and early career scientists.  To explore the opportunities increasing the collaboration between the polar science and HPDC communities, the workshop "HighPerformance &amp; Distributed Computing for Polar Sciences: Applications, Cyberinfrastructure and Opportunities" brought together polar scientists, HPDC experts, and data practitioners. This project resulted in a workshop at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey on December 4 and 5, 2014. Approximately thirty U.S.based researchers gathered for two days of presentations and discussions centered on two questions: 1) How can polar science benefit from HPDC? and 2) What are the challenges in bringing HPDC and polar sciences together?    Through workshop discussions, participants agreed that processing the ever expanding catalog of high-resolution digital satellite imagery, and running model simulations of polar region dynamics, provide key opportunities for polar science and HPDC collaboration to advance both fields. Despite the potential of these opportunities, a number of challenges currently exist preventing progress. Some example obstacles to collaboration are the knowledge gap, simple access mechanisms to HPDC resources and lower barriers to access HPDC.      Workshop participants discussed many ways to close this gap, inter alia including how to increase data discovery and make connections between data repositories with computing and data processing facilities. Articulating and addressing the heterogeneity of HPDC solutions, whilst improving the simplicity of HPDC resource use (and understanding) were recurring themes. Greater adoption of HPDC might be facilitated by making software products commonly used among polar scientists available on HPDC platforms. Additionally, there are sociotechnical and cultural barriers that need addressing.                          Last Modified: 11/24/2016       Submitted by: Shantenu Jha]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
