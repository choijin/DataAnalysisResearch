<AbstractNarration>Humans have a fundamental need to feel they are respected by others. In some cultures (termed "honor cultures"), the concern for having others' respect and positive moral standing is so central to individuals' identity that it can take primacy over other motives. As a result, serious conflicts can arise if individuals feel that they have received an insult or threat to their honor. In such cultures, the importance of defending one's honor can lead to behavior that can seem irrational and excessively aggressive to outsiders, with members of honor cultures striving to assert and protect their honor even when it leads to costly consequences such as injury or death. The objective of the proposed research is to understand and attempt to reduce the dangers that arise when those from honor cultures feel their honor has been threatened by an insult or false accusation. The proposed studies compare members of honor cultures within and outside the U.S. to members of cultures that lack strong honor norms. The research tests the hypothesis that concern over maintenance and protection of honor among members of honor cultures can interfere with other goal-related behavior, and that these behavioral consequences can be reduced by interventions that restore honor. The proposed research seeks to develop a better understanding of the seemingly "irrational" ways that members of honor cultures respond to perceived affronts and is therefore relevant to people involved in public policy and economic interactions with members of  honor-based cultures. Moreover, a better understanding of honor with respect to goal-related behaviors has important implications for organizational behavior, negotiation, and conflict management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research involves a collaboration of researchers based in different regions of the U.S. and researchers from a non-U.S. honor culture. Two studies test whether individuals from honor cultures are more likely to use economic incentives to punish someone who impugns their honor (by calling them dishonest) even when such punishment is costly for the actor. Three studies examine whether honor threats derail goal attainment by creating a distraction which affects goal setting, initiation, and persistence. Two final experiments examine whether an honor threat's negative consequences for goal pursuit can be reduced by brief experiences in the lab that allow participants to behave honorably and receive recognition for doing so, or by recalling experiences when they were accorded honor by others. By understanding these honor-related processes, this research will help U.S. businesses, governmental agencies, and non-governmental organizations deal with conflict and miscommunication when working in honor-based cultures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The international component of this research was supported by co-funding from the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cultural groups differ in the degree to which they emphasize the importance of a person?s reputation.  In cultures of honor, maintaining one's reputation as honest, trustworthy, and worthy of respect is vital for one's current and future well-being and success (as well as the well-being and success of one's family).  If a person's reputation or honor is challenged or maligned, the person is obligated to respond quickly and vigorously to the affront, for fear of losing others' respect.  Honor cultures are found in the U.S. South and Mountain West, in the Mediterranean region, and in other African or Latin American contexts.  In contrast, in what are called "dignity" cultures of the U.S. North and Midwest, and Western Europe, individuals are assumed to have inherent worth that cannot be diminished or taken away by others.  Insults and threats can be relatively easily dismissed, as expressed in the childhood saying "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me."  Consequently, affronts and insults may be more easily dismissed or discounted without an overt response.  In cultures of honor, when an individual's reputation is impugned, they must quickly act to restore their honor.  This goal may over-ride other important goals, and may even be costly to the individual.  The results of this research project showed that compared to members of a dignity culture (from Northern or Midwestern states in the US), members of an honor culture (Turkey) responded to a threat to their reputation by delaying or derailing from other goals.  They made decisions that punished the person who attacked their honor but were costly to themselves. This research also distinguished between different kinds of threats; we found that members of honor cultures responded differently to threats to their reputation (i.e., being told they were dishonest) than to threats to their competence (i.e., being told they performed poorly on a task).  Threats to one's competence did not result in the same levels of goal delay or derailment as threats to honor.   Intellectual Merit  This project brings a novel theoretical lens -- goal pursuit -- to the study of how honor values, beliefs, and ideals shape behavior.  This research lays the foundation for further investigation into motives and goals in diverse cultural contexts, and it contributes to the growing depth of knowledge of the ways that cultures vary and the consequences of that variation.     These results are relevant to a variety of fields, including social and personality psychology, decision science,  organizational behavior, and business management.  In particular, the field of organizational behavior and business management quite frequently investigate performance goals within interdependent contexts.  Much of the existing research has been framed by the single distinction between individualistic and collectivistic cultures, but this research contributes to the scientific recognition  that there are varieties of collectivism (such as the distinction between collectivist honor cultures and East Asian cultures that emphasize face and harmony).  Understanding honor dynamics with respect to goal-directed behavior gives researchers in the field of organizational psychology or business management theoretical tools for investigating teamwork, negotiation, and conflict management in multi-cultural settings.   This project has also resulted in the development of novel methodological paradigms that can be used in future research to believably create an honor threat in the laboratory or online.   Broader Impacts  Policy makers, business people, educators and others will benefit from an understanding of the goals and motivations of members of honor cultures, such as those found in the Middle East, Latin American, and southern U.S.  This work uncovers the attitudes and beliefs behind seemingly irrational behaviors sometimes seen in those contexts, such as blood feuds between families.  We have communicated existing research for a broad audience of psychological researchers, practitioners, and therapists, to articulate how honor norms and values among Americans in the South and Mountain West may contribute to intimate partner violence, school violence, and poor mental health.   This project has contributed to the development of several graduate students and post-doctoral researchers.  Of these, most have been women; many are members of under-represented ethnic groups in the US (Latinx or African American) or are from Turkey.  Thus, this project has played a role in the development of a diverse group of young scholars who are prepared to address important social and global issues.
