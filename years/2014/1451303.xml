<AbstractNarration>Young people's participation in informal STEM learning activities can contribute to their academic and career achievements, but these connections are infrequently explicitly recognized or cultivated. More systemic approaches to STEM education could allow for students' experiences of formal and informal STEM learning to be aligned, coordinated, and supported across learning contexts. As part of NSF's Advancing Informal STEM Learning program, Science Learning+ (SL+) is a partnership among US and UK foundations. SL+ funds projects that take transformational steps to inform, improve, and advance the knowledge bases, practices, and design of informal STEM learning experiences and environments.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This specific planning project brings together stakeholders in two digital badge systems--one in the US and one in the UK--to plan for a study to identify the specific structural features of the systems that may allow for the alignment of learning objectives across institutions. Digital badge systems may offer an inventive solution to the challenge of connecting and building on youth's STEM-related experiences in multiple learning contexts. When part of a defined system, badges could be used to represent and communicate evidence of individual learning, as well as  provide youth and educators with evidence-supported indicators for other activities in the system that might be interesting or valuable. Properly designed and supported badge systems could transmit critical information within a network of informal STEM programs and schools that (1) recognize context-dependent, interest-driven learning and (2) provide opportunities to explore those interests across multiple settings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project advances the field of informal STEM learning in two ways. First, the project documents and analyzes the processes by which two small groups of informal science education organizations and schools negotiate the meaning and value of badges, as proxies for learning objectives, and how they decide to recognize badges awarded by other institutions. This process builds capacity within the target systems while also beginning to identify the institutional, cultural, and material capacity issues that facilitate or constrain the alignment process. Second, the project conducts a pilot study with a small number of youth in the US and UK to investigate factors associated with an individual youth's likelihood of: a) identifying badges of interest; b) connecting the activities of various badge systems to each other and to non-badging institutions, such as school or industry; c) determining which badges to pursue; and d) persisting in a particular badge pathway. Findings from this pilot study will help identify institution- and individual-level factors that might be associated with advancing student interest and progression in STEM fields. Deepening and validating the understanding of those factors and their relative impact on student experiences and outcomes will be the focus of investigations in future studies.</AbstractNarration>

A digital badge system, in this context, was defined broadly as a network of formal and informal education institutions with human resources and technological infrastructure to enable youth to document their experiences and, with the assistance of educators at multiple sites, build "STEM learning pathways."  The planning partnership did not achieve the goal of creating a research program beyond the planning phase, for four reasons we summarize below. Briefly, however: the UK-based team was more successful in convening out-of-school learning organizations and planning a badge system than was the US-based team. It is likely that four main factors influenced whether the UK and US partnerships were able to plan for the creation of badge systems, which could have implications for future efforts: leadership; stakeholder engagement; funding and resources; and social context.  While these four factors are likely germane to many types of partnership building, we find that there are aspects of each of these factors that are particularly important with respect to building digital badge systems. Further, we suggest that future collaborators consider these factors when deciding to create a partnership that includes a digital badge system.  1. Leadership  A leader&mdash;or champion&mdash;at each organization within the partnership is necessary to ensuring that organizations begin and persist with partnership and badge system planning.  2. Stakeholder engagement  Closely related to leadership, we found that it is very important that a shared value proposition is established for the badge system, and that key stakeholders are engaged in defining and delivering this from the outset. Key stakeholders include learners, educators, content providers/endorsers and employers/consumers.   3. Funding &amp; Resources  A significant level of funding and staff resources are required to effectively set up a digital badge system. It is essential that there is staff time allocated to the design and implementation of a badge system. When resources are not available, the badge system is unlikely to be setup or managed effectively, leading to poor engagement and/or outcomes for learners.   4. Social Context  Finally, social context is fundamental to creating the right conditions for badge systems to thrive. Badge issuing organizations tend to demonstrate an open mindset and are confident as innovators, comfortable working in partnership with others to build capacity and expertise. They typically have existing programs they are delivering and are looking at badges as a way to enhance and scaffold this activity through validating skills and achievements and connecting learning opportunities together.  If digital badge systems continue to proliferate, then there is a need to collect data about the processes that partnerships of organizations and individual stakeholders use to create the systems.
