<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description: This project investigates the growth of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), as well as their heterostructures in the lateral directions, on thin metal films. Both of these two-dimensional materials are one-atom-thick crystals with their atoms arranged in a honeycomb structure. They have novel electronic, photonic and magnetic properties that can be exploited in next-generation technologies. The size and shape of individual graphene and h-BN crystallites are manipulated through variations in growth conditions to achieve desired properties for specific applications. Using the edges of existing crystallites as one-dimensional substrates for lateral growth of the other material enables formation of a wide variety of laterally heterostructured films including interleaved arrays of graphene and h-BN nanowires and graphene quantum dots in a h-BN matrix. This project trains one PhD student in fabrication and characterization of these unique materials. The principal investigator is collaborating with the "Science is Fun" program at Arizona State University to develop age-appropriate curriculum modules for Phoenix area K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: This project employs cold-wall chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to grow single-layer monocrystalline graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) lateral heterostructures onto thin metal films. The size and shape of isolated graphene and h-BN crystallites are tuned in order to use their perimeters as substrates for lateral heteroepitaxy of the other material. The research develops a capability that enables engineering of single-layer graphene/h-BN nanocomposites with controlled shapes, sizes and interface structure (i.e., zigzag or armchair) and with desirable properties. Graphene and h-BN are grown atop thin metal films deposited on refractory metal supports that are heated to temperatures both below and above the metal-film's melting temperature to assess the efficacy of CVD onto liquid metals for growth of the target structures. A variety of thin metal and alloy films are investigated to assess their effects on graphene, h-BN and heterostructure morphology. Real-time imaging during the growth in an environmental scanning electron microscope elucidates growth mechanisms. In combination with systematic investigation of films and heterostructures grown using cold-wall CVD, a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental science underpinning graphene, h-BN and heterostructure growth on both solid and liquid metal films is developed. Films and heterostructures are also characterized at the atomic level using aberration-corrected (scanning) transmission electron microscopy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported the completion of 3 graduate degrees.  Shantanu Das completed a PhD in Materials in June 2018, Chad Lunceford completed a PhD in Physics in June 2019 and Emanuel (Manny) Borcean completed a Masters in Passing in Physics in June 2018.   Shantanu's main accomplishment was to develop a cold-wall chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method for graphene growth on supported Cu films that enabled elucidation of the growth mechanisms.  Detailed analysis of scaled graphene island size distributions showed that method used for H2 pretreatment of the Cu substrates was crucial for tuning the rate-limiting step for graphene growth from edge attachment limited to diffusion limited growth.  Graphene crystallites that follow attachment-limited growth exhibit monotonically decreasing scaling functions characteristic of Avrami growth kinetics.  In contrast, those that follow diffusion limited growth exhibit bi-modal scaling functions that were interpreted to indicate enhanced detachment of C from the edges of larger crystallites.  On higher-quality recrystallized Cu substrates, the nucleation density was too low to perform a statistical analysis of the graphene nuclei for those that followed diffusion limited growth.  He obtained films with less than 30 nuclei/cm2. He is currently employed at Intel in Portland, OR.   Manny's main accomplishment was to develop a cold-wall CVD method for growth of h-BN from BH3-NH3 + H2 diluted in Ar onto Cu substrates.  While he dramatically improved the repeatability of the method, the level of run-to-run consistency required to correlate variations in growth parameters with variations in film morphology (as characterized by nucleation density and average nucleus size) was not achieved.  Consequently, we were unable to systematically investigate the growth mechanism of h-BN from diborane using cold-wall CVD.  This fact precluded us from achieving the overarching goal of the project, which was growth of lateral graphene/h-BN heterostructures.  Despite these challenges, he was able to obtain isolated h-BN nuclei with lateral dimensions in excess of 50 &mu;m.  Manny is currently employed by Intel in Chandler, AZ.   Chad investigated the growth of WS2 onto sapphire (c-plane 0.2&ordm; toward the m-plane) via cold-wall CVD from W(CO)6 (WHC) and either diethyl sulfide (DES) or H2S.  His objective was to correlate growth conditions with film morphology with a view toward controlling the size of single-layer triangular WS2 crystallites.  He initially employed DES until he determined that films grown using this S precursor were plagued by multi-layer growth at conditions that yielded larger triangular crystallites.  Since many of the exciting properties of this material are manifested when it is in its single-layer form, he then switched to H2S, which we initially avoided due to the difficulty of handling this toxic gas.  Using H2S as the S precursor resulted in repeatable growth of single-layer WS2 for a range of growth conditions.  He was able to determine that WS2 island ensembles coarsen during growth temperature anneals if the H2S flow employed during growth continued throughout the anneal.  In contrast, annealing at the growth temperature without H2S had no effect on the WS2 island ensemble.  He is currently employed at ASM in Tempe, AZ.
