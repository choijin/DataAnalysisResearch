<AbstractNarration>This research will investigate strategies for protecting maize, the major U.S. food, feed and fuel crop, from environmental stress. Maize can perceive and respond to adverse environmental conditions through a process called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Folding is a critical, but delicate step in the biosynthesis of proteins, and it can be easily upset by adverse conditions, such as high temperature. When this happens, misfolded proteins accumulate and activate a cascade of stress response genes. One of the objects of this project is to characterize in depth the cascade of genes to better understand how they protect maize from stress. Investigations in other plants has revealed that stress conditions eliciting the UPR also activate a process called autophagy in which plant cells repair stress damage. Therefore, another aim of this project is to discover how stress signals activate the autophagy machinery. In response to stress, other plants slow down protein synthesis to prevent overburdening the process of protein folding. In this project an investigation will be conducted to determine whether maize does this by degrading some of the messenger RNAs encoding proteins. Finally, attempts will be made to modify the UPR and probe more deeply into its operation by using new gene editing techniques. In parallel, there will be a focus on links between learning and research at the undergraduate level. This will be done through the development of easily accessible training on line and peer-support learning communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, it is expected that new gene targets involved in ER stress responses in maize will be revealed through extensive transcriptomic analysis. It is anticipated that those targets may provide a clearer picture of both cell survival activities and cell death mechanisms in response to stress. In addition, these analyses will aid in uncovering the signaling pathways by which stress elicits the proliferation of the ER and activation of autophagy. While some UPR responses involve the upregulation of stress response genes, other responses result from the degradation of specific RNA transcripts brought about by Regulated IRE1-Dependent RNA Degradation (RIDD)and microRNA action. In this regard, the degradome as well as the transcriptome will be used to determine the role of selective RNA transcript degradation in maize stress responses. This research project is also expected to reveal through 'translateome' analysis whether ER stress is also mitigated in maize by selective and/or global regulation of the translation of RNA transcripts. A compelling reason for the selection of maize as a model for these studies is that the UPR has already been demonstrated in maize in the field. Therefore, variation in stress response in different lines of maize will be studied both in the laboratory and in the field with the goal of identifying genetic determinants that condition the UPR.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             The Intellectual Merit component of this project had a goal to determine the role of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) in protecting maize from adverse environmental conditions.  In response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, we characterized the transcriptome and the network of transcription factors associated with the stress response.  When ER stress persists, the UPR transitions from an adaptive response to cell death.  We identified genes that are activated during the adaptive phase and during the transition cell death.  In addition to a transcriptional response, we discovered what happens to the control of translation.  The translational control is an important part of the UPR, because the UPR is elicited by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER.  Translation is down regulated in response to ER stress in mammalian cells to prevent the piling up of misfolded proteins in the ER.  However, we found using the technique of riboprofiling that the general rates of translation are not attenuated in response to ER stress in maize, although there is a decline in the efficiency of translation on a per RNA basis.  The decline in translation efficiency was largely due to a surge in RNA accumulation in response to ER stress.  Instead of being loaded onto polysomes, some of the RNA transcripts were sequestered in stress granules.  We also characterized the UPR in response to adverse environment conditions, in particular, heat stress.  Unexpectantly, we found a link between the UPR and heat stress response (HSR).  That link was unexpected because the UPR and the HSR occur in different subcellular compartments.  The UPR occurs in the ER while the HSR is a nuclear/cytoplasmic response.  Nonetheless, a major transcription factor, bZIP60, upregulated by the UPR targets and activates the expression a key HSR transcription factor.                 Much our work on the heat activation of the UPR made use of a facility at Iowa State University called the Enviraton.  The Enviratron is a controlled environment that can simulate different environmental conditions.  We found that the UPR was upregulated and autophagy was induced during the virtual afternoon of a simulated hot summer day. This was surprising because we had thought that maize plants might have acquired heat tolerance during the virtual morning and would not activate the HSR in the afternoon.  Not only did we find that the afternoon temperatures upregulate the UPR and autophagy, but also they enhanced alternative RNA splicing.  Alternative RNA splicing is an important response because it potentially expands the plant's repertoire for stress responses. The enhanced RNA splicing targeted some of the RNA splicing regulators themselves.  We focused on the splicing of the transcripts for the splicing regulator, SR45a, and found that the splicing pattern is temperature dependent and even varies during the day as the temperature rises.  Non-productive SR45a RNA transcript isoforms were produced in the cool morning, but then productive  RNA transcripts were produced in the warm afternoons.  Thus, the environment protective machinery in maize tunes itself even to the temperature variations in a single day.              The Broader Impact component of this proposal was aimed at providing case studies for graduate teaching assistants in undergraduate laboratory courses.  To obtain information about what was needed, a survey was conducted among graduate TAs to find out what challenges they faced in laboratory classes.  The survey information was compiled and presented in a CIRTL workshop and ultimately in a paper published in bioRxivs and which is in review in the Journal of Microbiology and Biology Education.
