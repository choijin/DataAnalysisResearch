<AbstractNarration>The proposal seeks funds to partially cover travel expenses of invited speakers and student participants and organizing expenses related to the conference entitled, "American Physical Society, Division of Fluid Dynamics, 67th Annual DFD Meeting 2014" in San Francisco, CA, November 23-25, 2014. This is the largest international annual meeting of fluid dynamicists in the world, with 2,500 anticipated attendees. The meeting has been successfully run for over sixty five years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The priorities of the travel grant program are to partially fund students, young scientists, and, in general, scientists from under-represented groups. The APS DFD Executive Committee plans to contribute $20,000 and the American Institute for Physics plans to contribute $10,000 to the overall budget for travel awards. This total amount expected is $55,000 to facilitate travel subsidies and registration fee coverage for about 65 participants. The chief intellectual merit of this conference lies in the exchange of scientific ideas, presentations of cutting edge research, and exposure to a richly diverse array of topics in virtually every sub-discipline of fluid dynamics. The broader impact will be to increase participation of students and young scientists who would not otherwise be able to afford to travel to the meeting and pay associated costs. Preference is given: (i) to those presenting talks at the meeting, (ii) to students, (iii) to those who have not received such an award in the past, and (iv) to no more than one applicant from a given research adviser. Since the awards are meant to supplement participant travel funds, not to cover these entirely, the committee takes into account the travel budget entered on the application. Special effort is made to achieve diverse participation from underrepresented groups in engineering, including women and members of minority groups. Even though the conference is attended by worldwide attendees, the NSF support will fund individuals from the US.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PROJECT SUMMARY     Funding was requested to facilitate participant travel to the American Physical Society, Division of Fluid Dynamics (DFD), 67th Annual DFD Meeting in San Francisco, CA, November 23-25, 2014.  This is the largest international annual meeting of fluid dynamicists in the world, with nearly 3,000 attendees.  The meeting has been successfully run for over sixty years.      The application and selection process is under the auspices of the DFD External Affairs Committee, chaired by Dr. Charles Henoch of the Naval UnderSea Warfare Center, with Vice Chair Prof. Beverley McKeon of the California Institute of Technology serving as the process coordinator. The American Physical Society (APS) served as the P.I. on this grant application.  The travel grant program has traditionally prioritized meeting attendance by students, young scientists, and, in general, scientists from under-represented groups.  Consideration is also given to the availability of funds to complement the travel award, clarity of the abstract, and the perceived quality of the scientific work described in the abstract. This year, we instituted a new, enabling category of support covering essentially full travel costs for six researchers who would not otherwise have been able to attend the meeting.      Briefly, each member of the External Affairs Committee reads the applications and ranks them according to the criteria stated above. The individual committee member rankings are averaged, and the awardees are chosen based on the strongest overall scores.  Offer letters are sent to the awardees, and those who accept are sent follow-up invitation letters that may be used for visa applications, as appropriate.     A total of $25,000 in funding was received from NSF.  The APS DFD Executive Committee contributed $20,000 and the American Institute for Physics contributed $10,000 to the overall budget for travel awards.  This total amount of $55,000 facilitate travel subsidies and registration fee coverage for 69 participants.  The NSF support funded 50 individuals from the U.S. only.  Awards were $500-$1000, with some larger, enabling grants also awarded.     The chief intellectual merit of this conference lies in the exchange of scientific ideas, presentations of cutting edge research, and exposure to a richly diverse array of topics in virtually every sub-discipline of fluid dynamics.      The broader impact of the grant was to increase participation of students and young scientists who would not otherwise be able to afford to travel to the meeting and pay associated costs.  Preference was given: (i) to those presenting talks at the meeting, (ii) to students, (iii) to applicants from other than US, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Russia, (iv) to those who have not received such an award in the past, and (v) to no more than one applicant from a given research advisor.  Special effort was made to achieve diverse participation from underrepresented groups in engineering, including women and members of minority groups.    OUTCOMES FROM THIS YEARS TRAVEL GRANTS     November 2014; San Francisco, CA     APS/DFD received a total of 271 on-time applications for the traditional travel grants (compared with 235 last year). 62 applications were also received for the new enabling grants and 23 for childcare (compared with 9 in 2013). Of the 271 applications relevant to NSF funding, the top 50 applications from domestic researchers as ranked by the External Affairs Committee were funded with the overall $25,000 travel award budget from NSF. The remaining funds ($10,000 from The American Institute of Physics, and $15,000 from the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics) were used to award 19 international travel grants, 5 enabling grants and 13 childcare grants. Overall, the awardees represented 13 different countries (USA, Canada, Mexico, Australia, France, India, Ireland, Israel, Scotland, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom).
