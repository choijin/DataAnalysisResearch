<AbstractNarration>This broadening participation research project will contribute to foundational knowledge about the hidden threats to mathematics performance that undergraduate students who are deaf and hard-of-hearing experience.  There is a significant need to determine how to better educate deaf and hard-of-hearing college students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).  This group of students represents an untapped potential for contributing to the STEM workforce and for better learning the STEM skills needed to work in our technology-driven society.  Deaf individuals represent 3.5% of the eligible workforce in our country, but only 0.8% of deaf undergraduate students major in STEM and less than 0.2% of doctoral recipients in STEM are deaf.  It is essential to understand the threats these students experience in college STEM education and, eventually, to implement the appropriate educational practices and interventions that will result in more deaf and hard-of-hearing undergraduate students majoring in STEM and working in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project leaders at Rochester Institute of Technology and the University of Rochester will investigate the nature and existence of negative stereotypes towards deaf and hard-of-hearing college students, and study the impact of stereotype threat on the mathematical problem solving of this student cohort.  Using social identity theory as the grounding for their work, the researchers will conduct three studies.  The first investigation will involve the use of a modified implicit association task to study the stereotypes of the deaf and hard-of-hearing related to mathematics among both hearing and deaf subjects.  The second experimental study will involve testing stereotype threat conditions during performance of mathematics problems involving logic, estimation and actions that inhibit the tendency to perform calculations.  The third study will examine how stereotype threat in deaf and hard-of-hearing subjects may degrade working memory as it relates to completing mathematics problems.  Results of these studies are expected to be shared with education researchers and the public in professional publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Stereotype threat effects have been previously unexplored in a deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) student population. DHH individuals demonstrate a consistent underperformance and lack of representation in STEM majors and careers. An important component of academic success in STEM is achievement in high-stakes performance situations, including finals, placement exams, and standardized tests. Stereotype threat has been shown to exert negative effects on achievement by specifically harming performance in high-stakes situations (Beilock, 2008). Given the well-documented underperformance of DHH students in mathematics, this research grant examined whether stereotype threat effects further degrade the math test performance of DHH college students.   During year 1 of this grant, research was conducted to confirm negative stereotypes of DHH individuals' mathematical ability among college students (including both hearing and DHH) and among the general public. During years 2 and 3 of the grant period, 500 research participants were individually assessed for their mathematics performance on three types of mathematical problems -- arithmetic, modular, and GRE-type.

The theory of stereotype threat (Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995; Steele, 1997) suggests that stereotype-relevant evaluative situations place members of stigmatized groups at risk of confirming a negative stereotype as self-characteristic of their identity, contributing to their under-performance on the knowledge, skills, or abilities under evaluation. Social identity is at the core of stereotype threat. How individuals self-identify with a stigmatized social group influences their susceptibility to stereotype threat effects. The identity aspect of hearing loss is central to the present study.

In addition to an individual's primary social identity (for purposes of this research, hearing loss as deaf or hard of hearing which has a negative stereotype for math performance), DHH individuals are also members of multiple social groups that attract double negative stereotypes or mixed negative and positive stereotypes for mathematics (e.g., DHH identity negative/gender identity either positive or negative; DHH identity negative/ethnicity identity either positive or negative).   The college student participants self-identified as deaf (Didentity) or hard of hearing (HHidentity) were randomly assigned to either a stereotype threat or no-threat experimental condition and tested on arithmetic, modular, and GRE-type math problems. The experimental procedures explicitly activated the stereotype threat condition based on the DHH-based negative stereotype that "hearing students perform better than deaf and hard of hearing students on math tests" or a no-threat condition that "hearing students do not perform any better than deaf and hard of hearing students on math tests." The findings showed that Didentity and HHidentity participants tested under the negative stereotype threat condition underperformed compared to those tested under the no-threat condition. However, the Didentity and HHidentity participants tested under the no-threat condition still did not perform equivalently to a sample of their hearing college peers.   With respect to dual-identity stereotype threat effects on DHH college students' math test performance, the findings demonstrated that double negative effects tied to multiple social identities can have an even greater negative impact on math test performance and can compromise some students' performance more than other students' performance. This was observed in association with female DHH students' degraded math performance resulting from dual-identity negative stereotypes compared to male DHH students who have a mixed positive/negative dual-identity for math.
