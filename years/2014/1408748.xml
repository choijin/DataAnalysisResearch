<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative recruitment and retention strategies and experiences in support of groups historically underrepresented (URM) in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oklahoma State University (OSU), lead institution for the Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (OK-LSAMP), will double the recruitment and retention numbers of URM students in STEM fields over the five years of the project.  The activities will strengthen scholarly participation in research and international experiences preparing students for global success.  Activities are dedicated to building the skills and collegial relationships scholars will need to pursue successful careers in research, teaching, government, and the private sector.  As scholars progress through the programs, including the associated Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) activities, they will be provided opportunities to develop collaborative leadership skills by working with peers and senior researchers, performing primary research for presentations at national and international conferences and publishing research papers with a multicultural perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The STEM activities will result in increased numbers of a wide range of minority groups in the STEM workforce, not only in the United States but globally.  The Alliance will provide an important national model for promoting the success of all minorities including Native Americans.  Results from this research will be disseminated widely to inform understanding of how to encourage and support minority STEM education.  Building on well-established relationships with local, state, and tribal nation authorities, OK-LSAMP will expand its impact into all diverse communities.  OK-LSAMP institutional members include OSU, the University of Oklahoma (OU), the University of Tulsa (TU); Langston University (LU), an Historically Black College or University (HBCU); East Central University (ECU), Northeastern State University (NSU), University of Central Oklahoma UCO), Northwestern Oklahoma State University (NWOSU),Southeastern Oklahoma State University (SEOSU), Southwestern Oklahoma State University (SWOSU), and Cameron University (CU).</AbstractNarration>
