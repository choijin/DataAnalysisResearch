<AbstractNarration>The 2014 International Conference on Mathematical Methods and Models in Biosciences and Young Scientists School (BIOMATH 2014) will be hosted by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences during June 22-27, 2014 in Sofia, Bulgaria. The BIOMATH 2014 conference focuses on the interplay between modeling, mathematical analysis, and numerical simulation in epidemiology and cancer modeling, among other mathematical biology fields. Mentoring and training of junior faculty and advanced graduate students is a central part of the BIOMATH 2014 conference.  This award supports participation by US-based advanced graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty without access to other grant support.  Priority will be given to the support of students and new doctorates from groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many U.S. graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty working at the interface of mathematics and biology. The award will enable such US-based researchers to attend the BIOMATH 2014 conference. The BIOMATH 2014 conference will provide a unique opportunity for their participation, an excellent educational experience, and mentoring and interaction with some of the most active and leading researchers in mathematical biology. The meeting will serve as a vehicle for enhancing and supporting their career developments. It is expected that the conference will catalyze many successful interdisciplinary collaborations between the BIOMATH participants from the United States and Eastern Europe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information about the BIOMATH 2014 conference is available at http://www.biomath.bg/2014/index.php.</AbstractNarration>
