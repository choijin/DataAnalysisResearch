<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Clemens Krempner of Texas Tech University examines the use of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) as replacements for expensive, less abundant, and toxic precious metals used in the catalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated organic species.  FLPs are sterically-encumbered Lewis acid-base pairs of unquenched reactivity due to their inability to form classical Lewis-acid-base complexes. Novel combinations of Lewis acids and bases, capable of reversibly cleaving dihydrogen, are identified by a combined computational / experimental approach.  Attractive weak Lewis acids include boronic and boric esters, as these compounds are readily synthesized from inexpensive starting materials or are commercially available at low cost. Phosphazenes and guanidines are used as the base components. Progress in catalyst development is amplified by the combination of modular FLP synthesis, detailed catalytic testing, and computational investigations on novel catalysts and the underlying catalytic mechanisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is performed in collaboration with Professor Shuhua Li (Nanjing University, Nanjing, China) and Professor Juergen Klankermayer (RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany). Together, these three groups combine their separate areas of expertise to produce transition metal-free hydrogenation of imines, ketones and olefins - important substrates in the pharmaceutical industry.  The broader impacts of this work include leadership training for postdoctoral fellows and graduate and undergraduate students and an international exchange of ideas and expertise.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the past, the catalytic hydrogenation of organic molecules ranging from fine chemicals to natural products and pharmaceutical drugs, has been a classical domain of precious metals. Despite their excellent performance in these transformations, they are toxic, expensive, and less abundant.  In this collaborative research project, a team led by Prof. Clemens Krempner and his group (Texas Tech University) together with Prof. Shuhua Li's (Nanjing University, China) and Prof. Juergen Klankermayer's group (RWTH Aachen, Germany) demonstrated that precious metals catalysts can be replaced with more abundant, less expensive and non-toxic main group element catalysts for the catalytic hydrogenations of organic unsaturated compounds with molecular hydrogen.

An extensive screening of a various boron-containing Lewis acids showed that in the presence of organosuperbases such as phosphazenes and Verkade's base molecular hydrogen could readily be cleaved with the weakly Lewis acidic boranes BPh3, HBMes2, BEt3, 9-H-BBN, 9-Hex-BBN and 9-phenyl-BBN.  With these FLP systems in hand, highly active catalysts were developed by combining modular FLP synthesis, detailed catalytic testing and computational investigations of the underlying catalytic mechanisms. The most efficient FLP catalyst systems were combinations of various aryl-substituted borabicyclononanes, 9-X-aryl-BBN (X = OMe, Me, H, F, CF3, OCF3), easily synthesized from inexpensive starting materials, and commercially available organic phosphazenes as base components. This conceptually new approach resulted in highly active and easily tunable FLP catalysts that selectively hydrogenated imines to amines and ketones to primary alcohols and showed a broad substrate scope including successful hydrogenations of challenging S-, O- and N-functionalized ketones.
