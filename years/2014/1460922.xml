<AbstractNarration>1403750&lt;br/&gt;Hinds&lt;br/&gt;University of Kentucky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current membrane technology is based primarily on pore size and chemical functionality. Naturally occurring protein channels far exceed any man-made engineering pores with selectivities exceeding parts per million and flow rates 10,000 fold faster.  The PI proposes to imitate natural protein channel structures and  nanometer scale electrode geometries to increase flow. If successful, this could potentially revolutionize membrane function by providing a solution to the long standing trade-off between high chemical selectivity and high processing rate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two promising material platforms are Carbon Nanotube (CNT) Membranes and nm-scale electrode multilayers on anodized aluminum oxide (AAO). There are three key attributes unique to Carbon Nanotube (CNT) membranes: 1) atomically flat hydrophobic graphitic core that induces a near perfect slip layer for dramatic fluid flow 2) functional chemistry by necessity is at the cut entrances to the CNT cores for gatekeeper activity and 3) CNTs are conductive allowing for electrochemical transformation and application of electric field. Needed is a method to generate fluid flow (with chemical interaction or selectivity) in the entrance to CNT pores and have the plug flow rapidly transfer down the fast CNT core. Electro-osmotic pumping is found to have similar flow enhancements as pressure driven pumping and can accelerate selectively bound species within plug flow Peptide libraries allow the screening of 109 peptide combinations to find highly selective affinity chemistry far beyond what is achieved with simple coordination chemistry. However, strong binding coefficients result in kinetics too slow for monolayer-based pumping cycles. The PIs have found that modest voltages are sufficient to release cationic bound rare-earth ions, from high surface area conductive AAO surface. Multilayer electrodes allow for pumping cycles to direct strong electric fields in a high porosity AAO system. This allows for a very general separation system based on rapid cycles of binding targets to specific peptides at the pore entrances followed by electrostatic release pumping across the membrane. &lt;br/&gt;Due to the large breadth of peptide affinity libraries, this concept is applied to a large number of commercially relevant applications in energy storage, energy processing, chemical sensors, selective pharmaceutical separations, drug delivery and water purification. Support of this research area will enable many educational opportunities related to novel nanometer scale materials fabrication, characterization and application into separations science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit Outcomes:  The key intellectual goal of ?Engineering Membrane Platforms Based on Active Transporter Architectures? was to invent new membrane material systems that can actively pump important chemicals across selective barriers.  The approach was to take advantage of a) atomically flat nanofluidic channels that allow near perfect flow across engineering membranes and b) placement of electrodes at pore entrances and exits with selective chemistry that can be actuated with voltage pulses.  Major outcomes with anticipated publications are:  1) The mechanism of ions under electric field used to induce highly efficient electroosmosis was studied in atomically smooth Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) for the important application of drug delivery in addiction treatment was studied.  In particular electroosmotic and electrophoretic components have been isolated, with ~80% of nicotine delivered by electrophoresis.  The power consumption is very low where CNT membrane can pump therapeutic doses for 21 days with a single watch battery.  Importantly, dosing is switched between conventional transdermal patch and nicotine gum levels.  2)  Used unique geometry of an Au-electrode film at porous alumina (AAO) membrane entrances that generated a strong plasmon to activate H2O2 which is critical for many environmental reactions.  Quantum efficiencies of 10 reactions per incident photon were seen.  3)  A study to control of nanofluidics flow through graphene oxide (GO) membranes was studied for water/alcohol separations.  A new mechanism of alcohol oxidation to reduce channel spacing was discovered as well as the formation of water selective channels developing osmotic pressure.  Based on NSF sponsored membrane research, the Hinds lab has received 3 years of funding for 1 post-doc and 1 student from the Northwest Kidney Center to make membrane technology to enable portable kidney dialysis.  The focus is to selectively return ?good? biochemistry in the dialysate to the blood and remove toxins.   Broader impact outcomes:  By making voltage activated gatekeepers we can reinvent how engineering membranes work by actively pumping desired products across a membrane barrier thereby mimicking the mechanisms of protein channels seen in biological cell ?walls?.  This is contrast to current pressure driven sieving techniques with limited chemical selectivity.  New forms of membranes have broad application in pharmaceutical separations, drug delivery, energy separations, energy storage and water purification/remediation.  Training of 2 PhD and 3 MS students in important STEM areas will to lead careers as independent scientists and engineers benefitting the national workforce.
