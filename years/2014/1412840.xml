<AbstractNarration>Many materials designed for high-tech applications today are engineered at the micro or nano scale.  The physics of how these materials behave in applied electric fields or boundary treatments is still being worked out through experiments and simulations.  An important challenge in this area is that the small-scale structure of these materials inevitably contains defects that make their responses even more complex.  Physicists have proposed mathematical models to explain this behavior.  It is important to investigate the nature of solutions in these models to better understand their structure under outside influences, to obtain greater predictability of their behavior, and to develop effective applications for them.  That is the goal of this project.  The project includes the training and participation of graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator and his colleagues study the formation of defects in soft matter systems, including liquid crystal materials and layered superconductors.  Physicists describe stable states of these materials using vector fields and scalar or tensor-valued order parameters that minimize a free energy.  Pattern formations under external influences, as well as defects and other topological characteristics, are studied using the calculus of variations and nonlinear partial differential equations associated with the free energy.  In nematic liquid crystals, the Landau-de Gennes and Maier-Saupe Q-tensor models form the basis of the investigation.  Of special interest is the nature of configurations obtained in the limit of vanishing elasticity.  Geometric influences, such as flat or curved, thick or thin liquid crystal materials, are considered.  In layered high-temperature superconductors, the Lawrence-Doniach model is the basis for this investigation.  The nature of defects and behavior of solutions in applied magnetic fields of various intensities and orientations is investigated.  The above work includes the training and participation of graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  In this project,  the PI's characterized defects and pattern formations in soft matter systems of materials through an analysis of energy minimizers and/or stable solutions of the systems of nonlinear partial differential equations that describe them. New analytic techniques in nonlinear partial differential equations and the calculus of variations were developed to obtain detailed information about the behavior of solutions. The systems  explored include liquid crystal materials and superconductors. These findings provide an analytic exploration of the models proposed by materials scientists and serve as a validating link between theory and experiments.   In particular, existence and qualitative behavior of solutions in models for smectic liquid crystals were obtained.  Liquid crystal materials in a region between two plates have a bookshelf layered structure. When stressed, sharp bends called chevrons appear in the layers. The PI's obtained the chevron structure for energy minimizers as well as the transition between two chevron patterns via a gradient flow. In contrast to this setting, if the smectic material is formed into a thin membrane, the appropriate model  is an anisotropic Ginzburg Landau energy and the defects are short  lines running between the membrane's faces. When viewed from above the defects appear to be points with degree plus or minus 1. We determined the structure near these defects, their number and location, both theoretically and through numerical simulations.    In the case of a nematic liquid crystal material in a region between two parallel plates, the defect structure of energy minimizers was shown to be determined by the relative values of the energy's elasticity constants and the distance between the plates. If the ratio of these quantities is large, it was proved that the defects are disclination lines running between the top and bottom faces. When viewed from above these appear as point defects with degree plus or minus 1/2.  In contrast, it is shown that if the ratio is small then a second type of defect appears in the form of a pair of surface singularities (one on each surface) which when viewed from above appears as a giant point defect with degree plus or minus 1.  Qualitative features for minimizers  for a mean field based, Q-tensor model for a nematic liquid crystal material are found. This is a constrained minimization problem. Minimizers for constrained problems are much harder to analyze, however in this investigation it is proved that these minimizers are globally Holder continuous. This is a necessary first step toward the investigation of defect formation. The second principal result  has to do with the "physicality" of minimizers. The point is that minimizers could take on values that are on the boundary of the physically constrained range. If this happens the solution is deemed as "unphysical". This work shows that the latter possibility does not happen under certain assumptions on the elastic energy density.   The outcomes for superconducting materials concerned minimizers of a Lawrence-Doniach energy modeling a layered high-temperature material with N+1  two- dimensional superconducting layers and Josephson coupling between them in an applied magnetic field. This model has been proposed by physicists for certain high-temperature superconductors.  The values of the energies and the nature of their  vorticities were computed depending on material constants and the distance between the layers.     Broader Impacts:  During this project, one graduate student of the PI's completed her Ph.D. thesis on the behavior of chevrons described above.  Her work was prepared and published with one of the PI's. Another PI worked with a   former graduate student who had just finished his Ph.D. to prepare and publish their work together on the Lawrence-Doniach model.   In addition the PIs published their findings, presented these in conferences, organized conferences on the project's research topic.  The PI's  gave an invited mini-course in  a summer school at U.C. Berkeley with a focus on  training graduate students on recent advances in nonlinear partial differential equations and the calculus of variations.
