<AbstractNarration>Cascading refers to the process by which dense continental shelf waters pass onto the continental slope and then sink to an equilibrium depth. This is the way that much of the ocean's deepest waters are formed, for example in the Weddell Sea off Antarctica. As such, it is important for shaping the global meridional overturning circulation, and thus it is influential for climate in general.  It is argued that in most cases, cascading occurs in settings where current variability is dominated by the eddy field. This study seeks to understand cascading in the presence of wind and/or topographic effects.  This work will support the PhD research and career preparation of a graduate student.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When water becomes denser over the shelf (due to cooling, brine rejection or evaporation), the resulting convection and cross-shelf density gradient lead to an eddy field that drives cascading across the shelf edge. This process is well understood in simple geometries when there are no complicating effects due to winds. Also, the behavior of dense slope currents (and their related eddies), such as those generated at the Denmark Strait or at Gibraltar, is also well-studied. This project will focus on two other aspects of the cascading problem. 1) A shelf-edge alongshore current is found off East Greenland, and these flow features are not uncommon globally. This project will address the stability of these currents, and, more importantly, the ability of the resulting eddy field to expedite cascading. 2) Winds are an important driver over much of the coastal ocean, so it makes sense to ask how they affect cross-shelf transports in a region where intense surface cooling creates eddies that contribute to cascading. It appears likely that wind and buoyancy forcing will couple nonlinearly, so that we should not think about a simple linear superposition of the two effects. Thus, this project will attack the question of how these two important forcing agents (plus irregular topography) affect each other.   The approach used to address these problems involves multiple runs of idealized (meaning, for example, simple geometries, but using a realistic range of parameters such as forcing amplitude) numerical models, followed by a dynamically based scaling analysis that encapsulates the results quantitatively and that clarifies the processes involved.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the major ongoing problems in coastal oceanography is cross-shelf exchange. The problem involves how waters and material are transported from near the coast out to the open ocean and vice versa. This issue is critical to practical issues such as contaminant distributions or the supply of nutrients that make continental shelf waters so biologically productive.     This problem sounds simple, but it is made complicated by difficulties of sampling, odd statistical properties of the flow field, and the need to eliminate strong but not-always-important ?noise? such as tidal currents. Further, we know that one size does not fit all: different processes are important at different times and places.     In this project, we sought to understand two important, but insufficiently understood, mechanisms of this exchange.     First, we examined how winds and/or surface cooling act to affect cross-shelf exchange.

The results of these and other studies were published in peer-reviewed journals, so that they were quality-controlled and permanently archived.
