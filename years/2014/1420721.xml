<AbstractNarration>U.S. social movements in the latter half of the 20th century have increasingly used litigation as they worked to broaden legal rights. Yet we know little about how they pursue cases in the courts, particularly when and how they litigate strategically and whether and which litigation strategies are successful. This study will examine litigation in the federal courts by the U.S. women's movement from 1970 until the present, asking a) whether and how they develop and deploy litigation strategies and b) whether strategic litigation is successful in winning court cases and influencing broader social policy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will draw on qualitative case studies of key legal advocacy organizations and a quantitative data set of federal court cases. The work will further our understanding of how social groups gain greater legal equality in the judicial arena.  The project will give greater agency to actors by moving "inside" movement advocacy organizations, through interviews with litigators and organizational archival data, to assess the development and deployment of litigation strategy and whether such litigation succeeds in winning legal cases and influencing broader policy.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will bring wider understanding of social science research and advocacy lawyering and litigation to broader audiences in two ways. First, through Vanderbilt University's Center for Science Outreach, the project will recruit four high-school students for summer internships, mentoring them in social science inquiry and study of advocacy litigation. Second, the PI will share research findings with two broader audiences, a) high school, college, and law students in Nashville and at Vanderbilt University, and b) national and local legal professional groups and litigation advocacy groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Sociology Professor Holly McCammon of Vanderbilt University has completed the research for her project, titled "Litigation Strategies in U.S. Social Movements."  The scholarship involved substantial data collection, analysis, and report writing, focusing on the litigation strategies of the U.S. women?s movement, particularly in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.  Feminist legal activists since 1970 have used the courts to vigorously seek both broader rights for women and legal doctrine supporting gender equality.   This research traces their efforts from the formation of legal organizations, such as the American Civil Liberties Union?s Women?s Rights Project, to strategizing case selection, formulating legal arguments, filing case and amicus briefs, and designing overarching incremental strategies to promote law protecting women?s rights.  Legal cases pursued by feminist litigators include workplace discrimination, reproductive health, and equal protection in a variety of areas.  The goal of the research is to understand how these "cause lawyers" mobilize the law and to analyze the circumstances in which they are able to win legal cases, in federal circuit courts and at the level of the U.S. Supreme Court.  The data compiled for the project include: interviews with attorneys, organizational and other archival documents, and information from a variety of court cases.  Public interest lawyers and other legal and social movement actors are likely to find this research helpful in discerning how cause lawyering can aid social movement activists in strengthing laws to provide greater equality and justice.
