<AbstractNarration>This 3-year collaborative SHINE project will provide new physical insights into the energy release in solar flares, which is an important component of space weather research and is of high importance to society at large.  The project will explore the physical processes of magnetic reconnection spreading and particle energization, which have applications beyond the SHINE program.  Thus, the expected outcome of this project should be of use for applications in the Earth's magnetosphere, and potentially laboratory and fusion experiments.  The project activities will promote training and learning through the funding of two graduate students.  The lead PI will continue to supervise undergraduate students' research through an NSF-sponsored REU program at the MSU.  Thus far, the lead PI has supervised 13 REU students, with six of them being female students.  The non-lead PI will continue his productive partnership with the Children's Discovery Museum of West Virginia as part of this project.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative SHINE project will explore a novel and independent technique to estimate magnetic fields at reconnection sites high in the solar corona.  This region of the solar atmosphere is currently inaccessible to direct observations, and therefore of great interest to the SHINE community.  The project team will determine observationally and numerically whether there is a correlation between the guide magnetic field strength and particle acceleration; a link between the two would provide a novel way to estimate particle acceleration from observations of solar-flare ribbon spreading.  The problem of magnetic reconnection spreading is of broad interest to the SHINE community for a number of applications, including prominence eruptions, and greatly expanding the region of reconnection in the turbulent solar wind.</AbstractNarration>

Previous work on the spreading of reconnection addressed current sheets of uniform thickness along their extent. Our study addressed how reconnection spreads in a current sheet where its thickness changes as a function of distance along its extent, which we call a fluted current sheet.  A reason studying how magnetic reconnection spreads is important is that reconnection is the mechanism allowing large-scale energy release in solar flares, so knowing how it evolves in time feeds into an understanding of how much energy is being released and how many particles get accelerated during the solar flare, which is an important aspect of space weather.  One of the results of the observational portion of this study was that the spreading of ribbons in solar flares was often slower than the typical velocity scale expected in a magnetized plasma, the so-called Alfven speed.  We investigated what can make reconnection spread more slowly than the Alfven speed.  By systematically varying the thickness of a uniform current sheet, we confirmed our expectations that reconnection spreads more slowly for thicker current sheets.  Then we studied spreading in fluted current sheets and found another mechanism for slower spreading. We found the surprising result that spreading occurs more slowly at a current sheet of a given thickness if it is fluted, i.e., if the reconnection begins in a region where the current sheet is thinner. We performed a systematic parametric study for a number of different fluted current sheets, and found that the spreading speed in a fluted current sheet follows a predicable and quantifiable pattern.
