<AbstractNarration>There has been a paradigm shift in the design of communication networks due to the content revolution: the focus has shifted from making a connection to delivering content.  Content Distribution Networks carry much of the data of the modern Internet, with video alone occupying nearly 80%, consuming a massive amount of resources.  The energy cost of data centers rivals that of medium sized countries. Traditional content distribution network designs have involved centralized capital-intensive infrastructure. For scalable performance, next generation content distribution networks will have to harness the "edge-cloud," consisting of vast numbers of highly capable end user devices such as smart phones, tablets, and e-readers. In this project we address the issues of models, fundamental limits, and storage and delivery algorithms associated with the distributed nature of next generation content distribution networks.  The main goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive theory for characterizing the fundamental capacity and performance limits of such networks, and to design the associated content storage and distribution algorithms to achieve these limits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content distribution networks generate the vast majority of all internet traffic, and we expect our results to guide the next generation of such networks.  In particular, we explore ways to support robust and efficient distributed storage and delivery of content over heterogeneous networks. An integral and key aspect of our proposal is to closely tie the theoretical and conceptual aspects of the project with the practical and real-world engineering issues. This approach is highlighted by building testbeds at each of the universities of the investigators as well as specific to each of the main topics (storage, centralized delivery, and peer-to-peer delivery) of the proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As multimedia content consumption becomes the centerpiece of today's on-line experience, the results of this work are expected to contribute to a seamless end-user experience, while freeing up significant backhaul resources and avoiding the saturation that would otherwise plague today's network infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An important aspect of distributed content distribution networks (CDNs) is identification of  clusters of peers and or clusters of content, in order to optimize distributed cache policies.   In this research we addressed a particular clustering problem called the  community detection problem. It is assumed that a graph is observed and the goal of the clustering algorithms is identify dense subgraphs.  We focused on stochastic block models, under which, the graph vertices are  partitioned into communities. Each pair of vertices is independently connected with some probability that depends on whether the vertices are in the same community or not. In practice an edge could denote a high degree of similarity.   The goal in our research is  to identify (1) when is it information theoretically possible to identify the dense subgraphs and (2) when is it computationally feasible (i.e. with polynomial time algorithms) to identify the dense subgraphs. It is also desirable to have algorithms that are robust to noise, such as the addition or removal of a small number of edges at arbitrary locations.    There is currently a substantial gap between the information theoretic threshold for recovery and the threshold for computational recovery when the sizes of the dense subgraphs are sublunar in the number of vertices.   In [1] and [2] we established that semidefinite programing (SDP), which is a robust polynomial recovery algorithm based on convex relaxation, can recovery communities up to the information theoretic limit in a large number of cases, when the community sizes are linear in the number of vertices.   In contrast, in [3], we proved that there is a gap between the information theoretic threshold and what can be achieved by SDP as soon as the size of a planted community on the order of n/log n, where n is the number of vertices.   While papers [1]-[3] address the performance of the semidefinite programing formulations of community detection, we provide in [4] the complementary information theoretic limits.    In [5] we consider detection of communities in the stochastic block model in the regime such that the community size is sublinear in the number of vertices with size n to the power 1+o(1).  It is shown that the belief propagation algorithm achieves weak recovery if the signal to noise ratio is greater than 1/e, which is better by a factor of 1/e than can be achieved by spectral methods (characterized by the Kesten-Stigum limit).   The main analysis tool is density evolution and new bounds.  In the complementary paper [6] we address the problem of recovery of a K ? K principal sub-  matrix of elevated mean &mu; in a large n ? n symmetric matrix subject to additive standard Gaussian noise, or more generally, mean zero, variance one, subgaussian noise. This problem serves as a prototypical example for community detection, in which the community corresponds to the support of the submatrix.
