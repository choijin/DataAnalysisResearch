<AbstractNarration>As human populations grow and settle in formerly remote regions, questions about how hunting can be managed to provide long-term access to animals for local people without loss of biodiversity are becoming increasingly urgent.  This project is an opportunity for archaeology to contribute to this important current issue. The project will investigate how human populations in the US Southwest (AD 750-1280) adapted their hunting and raising of animals in response to changes in population density and the environment. The investigators will chemically analyze animal bones from a number of archaeological sites in the Mesa Verde area to see where the animals that people ate came from and to understand what people were feeding those animals. This will allow the investigators to examine whether farmers traded domesticated turkeys with other villages or raised their own birds for meat, whether the amount of domesticated maize (corn) people fed their turkey flocks changed as villages grew and as food became harder to produce in the face of documented climate fluctuations, and whether people responded to local declines in large game abundance by getting animals from more distant places. Understanding the balance between human demands and animal populations in this study will provide valuable information about how different patterns of hunting and raising animals are sustainable at different spatial and temporal scales. These patterns therefore have important implications for modern-day wildlife management and conservation of species. The project will also include support and training of a graduate student in stable isotope analysis and significant public science education and outreach efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Mesa Verde region of the US Southwest, increasing human population aggregation and shifting settlement locations from AD 750 through 1280 were accompanied by growing pressure on local food resources that are thought to have led to heightened social tensions, episodes of violence, and subsequent regional depopulation. This project uses strontium, carbon, and oxygen isotope analysis to examine the extent to which transport of fauna took place and whether animal source areas changed over time.  The analysis of local rodents, plants, and water samples will establish spatially diagnostic isotopic signatures for a large region that will allow archaeological faunal samples to be linked with likely procurement regions and assessment of whether source-sink dynamics (an important component of hunting sustainability in some modern cases) operated archaeologically, allowing sustainable long-term access to large game despite centuries of localized human impacts on these animals. Understanding these processes will provide valuable insights into the sustainability of certain patterns of hunting, animal provisioning, and transport.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the Mesa Verde region, a period of increasing human population aggregation and shifting settlement locations from AD 750 through 1280 was accompanied by growing pressure on local food resources, including wild animals.  Previous studies suggest that over time, declining availability of animals important for both nutrition and social practices contributed to heightened social tensions which eventually culminated in episodes of violence and subsequent regional depopulation.  Our research uses isotope analysis to test this idea, assessing whether declines in local large game availability were compensated for by acquiring animals from more distant sources, and whether domesticated turkeys were traded between villages and/or provisioned with maize at different rates as farmers dealt with anthropogenic landscape change, droughts, and an increasingly challenging social climate.  Archaeological chemistry, specifically strontium, carbon, and oxygen isotope analysis, allows critical examination of the extent to which transport of fauna took place and whether animal source areas changed over time.  Our analysis of local rodents, plants, and water samples establishes spatially diagnostic isotopic signatures for a large region that allow us to link archaeological faunal samples with likely procurement regions.  Isotopic analysis of turkey bones will indicate the extent to which villages were self-reliant in turkey production, and whether shifts in the social and natural environment were accompanied by changes in inter-village turkey exchange and in the degree to which turkeys were provisioned with maize.  Isotope data will indicate whether earlier hunters relied more heavily on local deer (artiodactyls) than later hunters, and whether long-range transport of large animals increased over time to mediate local shortfalls.  They will also allow assessment of whether source-sink dynamics (an important component of hunting sustainability in some modern cases) operated archaeologically, allowing sustainable long-term access to large game despite centuries of localized human impacts on these animals.  This collaborative project is composed of two components: one focused on archaeological sampling, and one focused on environmental sampling and isotopic analysis. The results of these components will be published together. All sampling of archaeological bone has been completed.  These archaeological samples were drawn from over a dozen archaeological contexts, focusing on five sites covering a 500-year time period.  Rodent, turkey, and deer elements were sampled in order to examine whether certain patterns of hunting, animal provisioning, and transport are sustainable at different spatial and temporal scales.  All of the environmental background data have been collected, and a publication outlining analytical methods, baseline data, and research potential is nearing completion.   We have observed a pattern in the oxygen isotope analysis that is revealing some unexpected differences between the two species of rodents sampled.  This may be a function of the fractionation occurring in the different plants comprising their diets; investigation is ongoing.  This project examines how changing access to animal foods was linked to a highly visible series of social transformations, a topic of interest both to archaeologists and to scientists interested in animal conservation and sustainable development.  We combine a long-term perspective on trends in animal use over time with unusually precise dating for faunal assemblages and for changes in human population sizes and aggregation in order to analyze how access to desirable large game animals and locally produced domesticated animals changed as human populations grew and settlement locations shifted.  Understanding the relationships between these processes will provide valuable insights into whether certain patterns of hunting, animal provisioning, and transport are sustainable at different spatial and temporal scales.  For archaeologists, this study will provide a model of ways in which archaeological chemistry can complement traditional zooarchaeological approaches to distinguish between local hunting, long-distance hunting, and animal migration in a case in which the zooarchaeological evidence alone is unclear.   For scientists in other fields, this study represents an opportunity to evaluate possible source-sink dynamics with long-term data of a type not available in modern case studies.  As human populations worldwide grow and settlements spread in formerly remote regions, questions about how hunting can be managed to provide long-term access to animals for local people without risking animal extinctions or loss of biodiversity are becoming increasingly urgent.  This project represents a chance for archaeology to contribute to an important current issue while simultaneously addressing an interesting archaeological problem in the US Southwest.
