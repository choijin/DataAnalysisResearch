<AbstractNarration>Fifty undergraduate students (10 per year for five years) will be recruited to participate in a 10-week summer residential research experience in Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University. Their research will include understanding and prediction of weather, climate, and air pollution. Established partnerships with a network of minority-serving undergraduate institutions will be used to ensure that participating students are recruited from a broad range of demographics representing the US population, including groups that have previously been underrepresented in meteorology and atmospheric science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REU participants will go through the full research process of choosing a topic, developing a research idea, conducting a literature review, writing a final report, and giving a presentation in a conference setting. The culmination of the summer research experience is a symposium where REU participants will present a scientific poster and give an oral presentation on their summer research projects. By the conclusion of the summer research program participants will be well prepared to conduct scientific research, have a deeper understanding of the graduate school experience. Through the REU Site, students will establish a network of individuals and mentors, who will not only be future resources, but mentors who will play an important role in the development of participants as scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The evaluation team, in collaboration with the REU program manager, developed a REU survey for in-person distribution at the beginning and at the end of each summer from 2015 - 2019. Forty-six participants completed the surveys. Analysis was conducted on open-ended survey questions using quantitative content analysis (Krippendorff, 2012), which focuses on the manifest meaning of each response. Means and standard deviations were calculated for each pre- and post-REU survey response, and significant differences were determined using a paired, two-tailed Student&rsquo;s t-test. Below are key findings from the evaluation of the REU from 2015-2019, along with a conclusion.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Characteristics of Interns:</span></strong>&nbsp;Predominately, participants for the summer REU program had a physical sciences educational&nbsp;background and attended geographically dispersed public universities (80%) The different&nbsp;types of institutions are illustrated in Table 1. The majority of participants self-identified as White (68%), followed by Hispanic/Latino (12%), Black/ African American (10%), Asian (4%), Mixed Ethnicity (4%), and American Indian/ Alaskan (2%). Gender: &nbsp;Participants who identified as (62%) &nbsp;vs. those who identified as men(38%).&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Motivation &amp; Intentions:</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong>Participants rated &ldquo;explore my interest in science&rdquo; and &ldquo;gain hands-on experience in research&rdquo; as the most important reasons for pursuing the summer REU program. The most important motive ] for driving their post-graduate choices was to get work or financial independence followed by a desire to continue their education.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Academic and Career Plans:</span></strong>&nbsp;The majority of participants (94%) planned to obtain a graduate degree in a STEM field prior to their involvement in the REU and reiterated this plan following the program (96%). &nbsp;Of the 25 participants that responded, 19 had stated an earlier plan to obtain a graduate degree, and 14 of these are either currently enrolled in graduate school or have obtained a graduate degree. On our evaluation survey, three participants stated they would work after graduation, then obtain a graduate degree. Two of these participants are currently enrolled in graduate school, while the other is working in a STEM position. These preliminary results indicate participants&rsquo; self- described intentions following the REU are accurate indicators of their actual plans. The alumni of the program have followed a variety of career tracks after participating in our REU program. Currently, 15 alumni are still completing their UG program, 16 are currently M.S./Ph.D. students (12 studying Earth System Science and 4 in other STEM disciplines), and 4 have positions in private sector companies (see Table 2).&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Self-Reflection:</span></strong>&nbsp;Participants perceived knowledge about, and confidence in scientific processes and the nature of science prior to the REU program, on average, fell between &ldquo;not confident&rdquo; and &ldquo;confident&rdquo; on our Likert scale. After the program, participants significantly increased their knowledge and confidence in 20 of 28 areas (p &lt; 0.05). The most striking increases in confidence and knowledge occurred in their understanding what everyday research work is like (p &lt; 0.0001), preparing a scientific poster (p &lt; 0.0001), programming or coding with computers (p &lt; 0.0001), analyzing data for patterns (p &lt; 0.0001), and figuring out the next step in a research project (p &lt; 0.0001). Participants also went from having little confidence in being able to visualize a career in science, to a very clear idea.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Experience With Mentors:</span></strong>&nbsp;All participants indicated a primary mentor, a person described as someone familiar with the details of their work and who oversaw their day- to-day activities, and a secondary mentor, a person described as someone who stands out as highly influential during the course of their REU. The relationships were highly influential, increasing participant confidence as a researcher and solidifying their academic and career intentions.</p> <p>REU Experience: Interns overwhelming had positive experiences with the overall summer REU program, specifically with the people involved in the program, and being able to conduct research.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusions:</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong>Quantitative and qualitative data collected from the participants between 2015-2019 indicate that participants at this REU site developed strong relationships with their mentors, gained significant knowledge and skills in the areas of graduate school and scientific research, all of which are strong indicators that this REU program will have lasting impacts on participants and Earth System Science.&nbsp;</p> <p>Although this data shows most participants were planning to obtain a graduate degree in an atmospheric science field prior to the REU, the experiences during the REU significantly increased their awareness of science careers and graduate school, and their confidence and knowledge in scientific research.
