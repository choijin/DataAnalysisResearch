<AbstractNarration>The Electrochemical Society Symposium on GaN and SiC Power Technologies 4 will be held in October 5-10, 2014 in Cancun, MX. The symposium will foster advances in the leading research on various types of Gallium Nitride (GaN) and Silicon Carbide (SiC) devices by gathering a diverse group of experts, researchers and students. There will be invited talks and contributed presentations. The Symposium encourages graduate student participation and provides them with the opportunity to gain exposure to new wide bandgap power semiconductor technologies. Topics to be addressed include materials and fabrication technology, power semiconductor switching devices, power packaging and thermal management, reliability engineering and device, circuit modeling. The Symposium will promote interactions between leading researchers in power device technologies and will focus on the technical challenges of these materials and their applications. The highlights of the symposium will be accessible worldwide through the Electrochemical Society's Proceedings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Wide bandgap (WBG) power electronics industry is highly fragmented and is going through a major transition process. The WBG industry supply chain consists of industry segments engaged in materials, devices, packaging and power converters. There is little interaction, if any, among these industry segments &ndash; most of the information is considered proprietary. There is a high degree of distrust and suspiciousness on the accuracy of product data sheets published.  Two Special Sessions on WBG Workforce Development were organized at the Fall 2014 Meeting of the Electrochemical Society in Cancun, MX as part of the GaN and SiC Power Technologies IV symposim on October6 and 7, 2014. These sessions were attended by more than 25 people from industry and academia including graduate students and early career faculty. A total of 6 papers were presented by industry experts and leading academic researchers. The academic researchers were asked the following questions:  Do you think your current curriculum adequately addresses the needs of the WBG power electronics supply chain? If not, what plans you would like to have in place? It has always been difficult to train students in all areas of WBG power electronics supply chain. How do you propose to address this daunting challenge and meet all accreditation requirements? How do you plan to encourage and promote community college graduates and undergraduate students to engage with the WBG power electronics field?    The practicing engineers were asked the following questions:  Are the universities producing graduates adequately trained to meet the challenges in the WBG power electronics supply chain industries? If not, what recommendations would you like to make? How can the WBG power electronics supply chain industry assist the academic community so that they can develop adequate curriculum and training programs in this field? What is your recommendation for the National Science Foundation (NSF) on developing adequate academic training program to address the needs of the WBG power electronics supply chain industry?    These questions were vigorously debated at these two Special Sessions, and the deliberations of these discussions were published in the following archival publication:   Gallium Nitride and Silicon Carbide Power Technologies 4, edited by K.
