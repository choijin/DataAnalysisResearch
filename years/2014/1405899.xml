<AbstractNarration>The project aims to study two nonlinear analogs of the heat equation: evolution of surfaces by mean curvature, and Hamilton's Ricci flow.  Evolution by mean curvature has been studied for decades as a natural model for evolving surface interfaces.  Ricci flow describes an evolving geometry, and was used in Perelman's solution of the Poincare conjecture.  The primary objective of the proposed research on these equations is to study singularities and show that they have a very special form.  Another component of the research program is an investigation of spaces which have a self-similar or fractal character, using analytic tools that have been developed in the last few years.  Here one of the goals is to deform the space into an optimal form, if possible, in order to reveal hidden symmetries,  and otherwise show that no hidden symmetries exist.  This is very useful for understanding the asymptotic shape of infinite groups, and is part of confluence of several research trends over the last 10-15 years.  Another application of similar ideas is to  embedding problems in theoretical computer science: Cheeger, Naor,  and the PI were able to substantially improve the previous best known results on the embedding of spaces of negative type, in connection with the quantitative version of the Goemans-Linial conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is in geometric evolution equations, embedding problems, analysis on metric spaces, and geometric group theory.  The evolution equations in the proposal are mean curvature flow and Ricci flow.  The proposed research in analysis on metric spaces clusters in three areas: (1) bilipschitz embedding problems and related issues, (2) the structure of spaces satisfying Poincare inequalities, (3) the structure of boundaries of Gromov hyperbolic spaces.  Common themes in all three areas are spaces satisfying Poincare inequalities, and rescaling arguments leading to singular limit spaces.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Fifteen years ago, Perelman solved the hundred year old Poincare conjecture by using a geometric process --- Ricci flow with surgery --- to deform arbitrary 3-dimensional geometries into geometries with constant curvature.  At the same time, he conjectured that his process, which was somewhat ad hoc, could be refined into unique process, which he called a "Ricci flow through singularities". In joint work, Joht Lott and Richard Bamler, I have been able to prove Perelman's conjecture.  This has several applications to the shapes of three dimensional spaces, and leads to the solution of a long-standing conjecture.  In joint work,  Jeff Cheeger and Andrea Schioppa and I developed a new type of differential calculus (metric differentiation) that remainds valid even in a large class of of fractal metric spaces.  This technique can be used to study the problem of mapping one space into another while minimizing distortion of the metric features.  It has been applied to mapping problems arising in theoretical computer science.  We have also given examples of fractal spaces with unexpected geometric and topological properties.  In joint work, Stefan Muller, Xiangdong, and I studied rigidity phenomena for mappings between self-similar groups.  Our approach is based on a delicate new anisotropic smoothing process.   The project has provided research and mentoring opportunities for graduate students and postdocs.       Last Modified: 10/26/2017       Submitted by: Bruce Kleiner]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
