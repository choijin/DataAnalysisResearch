<AbstractNarration>High Performance Networking (HPN) and other components of advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) are key enabling technologies vital to a college's ability to prosper in a rapidly evolving scientific and technical environment.  All components of CI, especially advanced network infrastructure, are swiftly changing, making it challenging to maintain currency, agility, and competitiveness. Smaller institutions are at a severe disadvantage, lacking in capital and personnel who know how to deploy, optimize, maintain, and sustain such technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colorado State University, the Idaho Regional Optical Network, the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, the University of Colorado Boulder, and the University of Utah have partnered proactively to train and mentor faculty and staff from smaller institutions in the region to enhance their use of advanced technologies, emphasize their advantages, and highlight their critical role as campus, regional, and national scientific infrastructure. This project educates in an effort to drive adoption and expansion of advanced networking and CI technologies to smaller colleges and universities in Colorado, New Mexico, Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming. The project conducts four regional workshops, as well as site visits to smaller institutions to support network engineering activities and sharing knowledge and best practices in deploying and applying network-based cyberinfrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The Rocky Mountain Cyberinfrastructure Mentoring and Outreach Alliance (RMCMOA) is a highly successful NSF-funded project that includes a supplement called Women in IT Networking at SC (WINS).

Direct outcomes of the RMCMOA project are to continue a networking component as part of the Rocky Mountain Advanced Computing Consortium HPC Symposiums (RMACC) and to encourage participation by small schools in the region in the Westnet meetings.  Women in IT Networking at SC (WINS) was a supplement to the RMCMOA project for a workforce development program. The program fosters gender diversity in the research and education (R&amp;E) community?s network and computer systems engineer occupations. Specifically, this supplement provides travel support for early to mid-career women to further develop the skills and expertise needed to be successful in this area of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).  Currently, there are a lack of resources and opportunities to support training, travel, and community building for women who pursue careers in networking and cyberinfrastructure.

The primary goal of the project is give U.S. women professionals in their early to mid-career the opportunity to build expertise and business connections, while at the same time fostering diversity in the overall network and computer systems engineering workforce.  WINS also raises awareness of the diversity issues facing the US through presentations at conferences to multiple communities.  The WINS project was extremely successful in meeting its goals, and a follow-on three-year WINS program began in the summer of 2016.
