<AbstractNarration>The College of St. Scholastica proposes to develop, implement, and evaluate TeachIT-CSP, a CS10K project designed to provide computer science education professional development to high school teachers throughout the nation. This project will adapt the Mobile Computer Science Principles (Mobile CSP) curriculum developed by Trinity College and offer it to teachers via a summer online course, complemented by ongoing online mentoring and support during the school year. TeachIT-CSP will scale the Mobile CSP professional development to reach at least 180 teachers over three years, and possibly many more. The planned online format will be particularly helpful in allowing teachers from rural and underfunded schools to participate in professional development and a supportive learning community, as they achieve mastery of new teaching content and methods.  This project will prepare participants to teach the Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) curriculum in their classrooms and provide support to them in this process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TeachIT-CSP goals include (1) bringing teacher professional development to scale with an engaging and effective open online course that focuses on computer science concepts using Mobile CSP curriculum, (2) providing pedagogical support to help teachers incorporate best practices that improve student learning outcomes in computer science and support underrepresented populations, and (3) developing an open and sharable repository of video exemplars of computer science teachers demonstrating evidence-based practices. The evaluation will compare results between online and face-to-face PD focusing on the significant areas identified by the Mobile CSP project and the CSP framework.  The project will  evaluate teacher performance using videos and teacher reflections instead of classroom observations. An external evaluator will adapt surveys for use with teachers engaged in online PD.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr">Computer science has traditionally been a field dominated by a few, but it is critical to our nation?s future that students of all identities and backgrounds understand and participate in computing. The Computer Science Principles (CSP) course was designed to engage all students through a breadth-first introduction to computing, covering not only programming but also data, the internet, and how technology has impacted our society. Mobile CSP is an effort to broaden participation in computing by supporting efforts to teach the CS Principles course. The TeachIT project builds on the success of Mobile CSP, initially by providing online curriculum and professional development (PD) to high school teachers across the country. Currently, the project is maintaining the online curriculum and providing PD in several formats (e.g. online, hybrid, in-person) and lengths (45 and 65 hours) to meet the needs of teachers. Of note is that the online PD achieved similar teacher and student outcomes to other PD formats (hybrid and in-person). This grant had three main goals.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr">Goal 1 - Online Teacher Professional Development (PD): Bring to scale the Mobile CSP curriculum for teachers and students in an engaging and effective open online course format focusing on CS concepts.</p> <p dir="ltr">The Mobile CSP curriculum and teacher materials are available for free to anyone online and can be reused through a Creative Commons license. The project team provided Mobile CSP PD to 476 teachers, including academic year support. As the project grew, a PD facilitator training was created to prepare and support facilitators as they led teacher PD with over 47 facilitators trained. Through the PD, teachers gained CS content knowledge and learned how to use evidence-based pedagogies for supporting students historically underrepresented in computing. Teachers completed a final exam at the end of the PD with average scores of 80% across all years of the project. Teachers reported high confidence in using evidence-based pedagogies such as pair programming (76%), growth mindset (92%), welcoming environments (92%), and actively recruiting students (77%). Over 60% of teachers who completed Mobile CSP PD taught the course in their schools, and even more teachers have used the curriculum and resources to teach the course without the PD.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr">Goal 2 - Student Learning: Provide effective online professional development and ongoing support to help teachers incorporate best practices that improve student learning outcomes in CS and support underrepresented populations.</p> <p dir="ltr">Students taking the Mobile CSP course often complete the Advanced Placement (AP) CSP exam, where they regularly outperform the national average of all students (Table 1).

The project team developed a rubric for identifying evidence-based pedagogy in the videos, analyzing a sample of the videos; rubric categories included inclusivity, growth mindset, collaboration, welcoming physical environment, accessibility, CS content knowledge and understanding, and effective classroom management. While teachers rated their use of the pedagogy higher in the reflections, researchers found less evidence of them in the videos and identified areas of improvement for the PD. Some of the classroom footage was used to create videos to support the professional development, including one on pair programming. The team worked with PD facilitators to gather additional footage and created four additional videos on Student Collaboration &amp; Engagement, Classroom Culture, Brainwriting, and Classroom Management.
