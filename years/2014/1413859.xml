<AbstractNarration>The special session "Computational Differential and Difference Algebra" will be part of the conference Applications of Computer Algebra (ACA) 2014 to be held at Fordham University, July 9-12, 2014.  Th subject of differential and difference algebra concerns the study of differential and difference equations from an algebraic point of view.  These types of equations have many applications to real life problems, including biology (population dynamics and cellular biology), chemical reactions, and physics.   The aim of the special session is to bring together researchers who develop theory for these types of equations and those who develop algorithms for working with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The annual ACA conference series started in 1995. The aim of this special session is to bring together researchers who develop theory and algebraic algorithms that solve or simplify systems of linear and non-linear differential and difference equations. This group includes researchers in differential and difference Galois theories, differential and difference elimination, symbolic computation in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, and model theory. This special session will foster the interaction of researchers in differential and difference algebra with researchers in model theory, algebraic geometry, and commutative algebra at a new level. The schedule will be designed to make this interaction particularly convenient and will include time for informal discussion. Moreover, special attention will be paid to mentoring the participants in the special session who are young investigators. In addition to the talks in the conference format, it is planned to have several longer lectures to foster in-depth discussions.  Additional information can be found at the website of the special session: http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/~aovchinnikov/ACA2014/index.html</AbstractNarration>
