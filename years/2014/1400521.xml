<AbstractNarration>SciTrends advances the mission of the ATE program by illustrating the multiple educational and career pathways that begin at the certificate, associate, and baccalaureate levels and that may be pursued throughout the United States.  The web-based video series is designed to motivate high school students to learn about and become interested in pursuing careers as science and engineering technicians in six manufacturing areas - additive manufacturing; agricultural and environmental technologies; biotechnology and chemical engineering manufacturing technologies; mechatronics and electronics, including optical and photonics technologies; semi?], micro?] and nanotechnologies; and supply chain, logistics and transportation technologies.  Each video has three segments: an episode using a science news magazine format to engage students; a segment highlighting the educational pathways for achieving careers as technicians and a segment exploring career opportunities.  Although this series is produced specifically for the Web, each episode and individual segments are downloadable in high resolution video format for organizations and users.  The six complete episodes will have a total running time suitable for video broadcast.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large group of stakeholders from industry, educational institutions, and students participate in all aspects of developing and testing the videos.  A diverse team of teen ambassador/advocates are convened to assist in promoting and assessing the use of social media in promoting viewership and dissemination of the videos among their peers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key outcome of the research is to determine what aspects or components of the project were most effective in motivating student behavior or changing perception of a technician career.  The project follows the research guidelines in "The Common Guidelines for Education Research and Development" to measure how these videos change student perceptions of technical careers and technician education and the actions students take as a result of the videos.  Focus groups of 8?]10 high school students at locations around the country complete a pre?]treatment survey and engage in a group discussion to assess their interest in, knowledge of, and intent to pursue a career related to a STEM/ATE field.  They then watch one or more videos produced as part of this project. Afterward, they again complete a companion survey to assess changes in attitudes, understanding, and intent.  In addition, 2?]3 months later, these same students are asked to complete a follow?]up survey to further assess the ongoing impact of the videos.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pellet Productions has previously developed videos about ATE projects and centers.  The videos are posted on YouTube, iTunes and Vimeo and on YouTube alone there have been 375,000 views with 858 subscribers.  More than 300 colleges and other educational organizations have requested and downloaded the ATETV videos.  ATE projects, ATE Centers, The National Technical Institute for the Deaf, and the American Association of Community College report that they embed ATETV videos directly on their Web sites.  PBS has incorporated all of the ATETV videos into PBS Learning Media.  More than 120 cable access stations in 42 states are currently airing ATETV videos.  The knowledge attained is used to develop videos to help high school students and their parents understand careers in the middle skill technical occupations that make up the majority of available jobs and the preparation necessary to be employed in them.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Capturing STEM interest begins in the formative years. The more awareness of STEM careers that can be generated, and the more interaction with younger audiences related to the field of STEM, the more likely it will be to result in an increase of learners choosing educational pathways and technician career pathways in STEM.  This project continues to extend the innovations and successes of existing ATETV material to teenage audiences in the US, by creating SciTrends, a website and series of videos intended to generate interest and enthusiasm in and build understanding of scientific research among youth ages 13-17. SciTrends combines novel program design with social networking media to deliver high-quality STEM content that includes educationally stimulating and interpersonal investigations of the scientific process in real-world labs and research settings. SciTrends also provides educational pathway and career opportunity videos aimed to increase the number of young people intending to pursue STEM careers, providing insight into these STEM educational and career pathways.  This series allows teens to explore the educational requirements for specific technician careers, develop a knowledge of what it's like to work as a technician, become familiar with typical employer expectations and earnings potential of specific technician careers, help them meet the challenges facing students who want to pursue STEM education, inform on course choices and curriculum requirements in STEM, and increase awareness of support provided at colleges and community organizations to assist students navigating the path to STEM education to ensure student success, and develop an understanding of the high school preparation required to succeed in STEM programs in college.  The goals of the project were:  - To increase interest in science among teens;  - To increase knowledge of STEM careers among a teen audience  - To increase teens' intent to pursue post-secondary education leading to careers in STEM fields;  To increase teens' understanding of how to access STEM careers;  -  To explore and employ the use of an outreach strategy through social media to engage teens.  We achieved these objectives by creating 18 curated videos under the framework of Robotics, STEM in Disguise, Wearable Technology, Drones, Water Treatment and Connected Cars. Additional video and web content was produced by SciTrends and its teen advisors and ambassadors. This is an audience for whom social media usage is a primary means of communication and outreach.

The final outcome of this project based on input from our audience effectuated an increased awareness of technician education and career pathways for our audience and generated increased interested in STEM topics.
