<AbstractNarration>This mathematics research project focuses on problems in harmonic analysis and partial differential equations, with an emphasis on the study of elliptic boundary value problems for second and higher order operators and for systems in non-smooth domains. A non-smooth domain refers to a domain with either isolated singularities or a Lipschitz domain. While elliptic boundary value problems for the Laplacian have been well understood for over twenty years, the theory for second order elliptic systems and higher order elliptic equations is incomplete. Another generalization of the classical Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems that is not yet fully understood is the mixed boundary value problem. This project addresses open problems that are categorized by the following research themes:  boundary value problems for higher order elliptic operators; the spectral radius conjecture on Besov spaces; well-posedness of the mixed problem in Lipschitz domains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This mathematics research project is motivated by problems that naturally arise in mathematical physics and engineering. In this regard, the non-smooth setting in which the problems are posed is fundamental since most realistic physical models involve irregular domains. For example, boundary value problems for higher order elliptic operators have applications to engineering in the context of modeling shallow shells, beam bending, and clamped plates. Mixed boundary value problems model the behavior of several physical quantities such as the temperature in a metallurgical melting process, the thermo-elastic potential of an elastic solid punched or stamped by a heated object, or the seepage through a porous material. This mathematics research project will contribute to the aforementioned disciplines as well as produce new mathematical techniques.  While pursuing the research directions outlined above, Ott will initiate activities aimed at increasing the participation of women and other under-represented groups in mathematics. These activities will include outreach activities with local middle and high schools, and research and networking opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The focus of the project titled "Topics in the Theory of Elliptic Boundary Value  problems" is the study of a series of boundary value problems under minimal   smoothness assumptions on the domain. A boundary value problem is a partial  differential equation or a system of partial differential equations, coupled with  additional constraints known as boundary conditions. The study of boundary value  problems under minimal smoothness assumptions on the domain has been a  driving force behind many of the fundamental developments in the area of partial  differential equations. The research themes of this project are motivated by  problems that naturally arise in mathematical physics and engineering. Thus, the  non-smooth setting in which these problems are posed is fundamental as most  realistic physical models involve irregular domains.            Under the support of this award, the PI studied the existence and behavior of  solutions to a series of boundary value problems modeling heat, elasticity and fluid  flow. The results addressed well-posedness (meaning existence, uniqueness and  continuous dependence on the data of solutions) for boundary value problems in:  domains with isolated singularities, such as  sectors and curvilinear polygon in the plane,       Lipschitz domains in n dimensions, where infinitely many singularities are allowed.  The research conducted involved tools from harmonic analysis, Mellin transform  techniques, and validated numeric techniques. The results obtained under this  award potentially have applications in engineering and physics, as the  underlying partial differential operators come from these disciplines.  The three main areas of inquiry of the project were:       Well-posedness of the mixed boundary value problem for the Lam&eacute; system of elasostatics and the Stokes system of hydrostatics,      Sharp well-posedness of boundary value problems for the Laplacian, the Lam&eacute; system of elastostatics, and the Stokes system of hydrostatics on domains with isolated singularities in the plane,      Mapping properties of solution operators associated with inverse scattering problems.            In addition to research activities, the PI is actively involved in efforts to  increase the participation of underrepresented groups in mathematics.  During the duration of this award, the PI authored a bi-monthly column in the  Association for Women in Mathematics Newsletter that profiles women with a dvanced degrees in mathematics. Since 2015, the PI is also the Director of  GirlsGetMath@ICERM, a week-long summer program for high school women  focused on mathematics and computing. The program is hosted at the  NSF-sponsored Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in  Mathematics. GirlsGetMath@ICERM is ongoing and there are plans to  expand the program nationwide.                 Last Modified: 07/06/2016       Submitted by: Katharine Ott]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
