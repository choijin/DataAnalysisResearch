<AbstractNarration>Researchers have long sought to understand how and why interaction among widely dispersed and mobile communities coalesced into larger and more complex and stationary sociopolitical entities.  Previous scholarship on this topic has focused on the ecological and demographic factors that necessitated a more sedentary lifestyle.  Population growth and the adoption of agriculture, in particular, have been frequently cited as key factors in this evolutionary process.  Archaeology is now well positioned to achieve a more nuanced understanding of this critical transition by focusing on the actual movements and convergences of people and artifacts across ancient landscapes.  In this project, Dr. Kenneth Sassaman and Dr. Zackary Gilmore, of the University of Florida, examine the shift from broadly distributed social and economic networks to relatively circumscribed place-based communities by tracing the circulation and accumulation of vessels representing North America's oldest pottery technology.  Key questions guiding this research are: Was the shift to place-based communities anticipated by the spatial organization of existing regional networks? Or, alternatively, were existing regional networks contradicted or superseded by the organization and structure of place-based communities? Although geared explicitly toward past societies, this research bears relevance to the understanding of communities affected today by large-scale processes, such as globalization, neoliberalism, and global climate change, that challenge local autonomy and the persistence of tradition. Arising out of modern networks of communication, for instance, are virtual communities of practice that enable local access to knowledge hitherto restricted to those with the political and economic capacity to channel and control access to nonlocal information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sassaman and Gilmore use chemical and mineralogical sourcing techniques to investigate how the organization of preexisting interaction networks enabled and constrained the emergence of durable place-based communities (i.e., villages).  Neutron activation analysis (NAA) and petrography will be conducted on large samples of pottery sherds from Early (5150-4100 B.P.) and Classic (4100-3800 B.P.) Stallings period sites in the Savannah River valley of Georgia and South Carolina in order to test alternative hypotheses on pottery and clay variation as a function of changes in community scale and organization.  To the extent that variations in Early Stallings pottery was differentially distributed in space, the place-based communities of Classic Stallings times likely emerged out of existing social distinctions.  Conversely, inasmuch as Early Stallings pottery lacks detectable subregional variations, place-based communities emerged as novel social arrangements.  In addition to helping to address a fundamental anthropological question, this research will create an educational and training opportunity by supporting a post-doctoral research position. It will also have an immediate positive impact on the research value of collections housed at six different repositories in the southeastern U.S., perhaps bolstering public and government commitment to the long-term curation of archaeological collections.  In addition, the NAA and petrographic data collected will be made available to other researchers and thus enhance the capacity for comparative and synthetic research in the future.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of this research was to achieve a more nuanced understanding of how and why interaction among widely dispersed and mobile communities coalesced into larger, more complex, and more stationary sociopolitical entities in pre-Columbian North Amreica.  With this ultimate goal in mind, the project was geard toward examining the shift from broadly distributed social and economic networks to relatively circumscribed place-based communities by tracing the circulation and accumulation of vessels representing North America?s oldest pottery technology, the Stallings wares of Georgia and South Carolina.  Key questions guiding this research were: Was the shift to more permanent, place-based communities anticipated by the spatial organization of existing regional networks? Or, alternatively, were existing regional networks contradicted or superseded by the organization and structure of entirely novel place-based communities?    To address thes questions, more than 400 pottery sherds from 13 sites along the Savannah and Ogeechee Rivers were analyzed using methods that revealed their chemical and mineralogical composition.  A total of 20-30 clay reference samples were also collected and subjected to the same analytical techniques.  In addition, 10 radiocarbon dates were budgeted to help refine the regional chronology.  Together, these analyses permitted the tracing of pottery movements (along with those of the people transporting them) across the Late Archaic landscape and into and out of various interactive contacts.  Based on preliminary interpretations, the results of the chemical and mineralogical analyses indicate that Classic Stallings sites contain pottery from a wider diversity of clay sources than the Early Stallings sites that preceded them.  Based on comparisons with clay reference samples. it appears as if at least some Classic Stallings sites attracted materials and perhaps people from across a larger geographic area.  This is especially true of vessels with unusual carinated forms, which appear to have been imported from sites upriver and downriver from where they were ultimately deposited.  These results suggest that the social conditions associated with the region's first place-based communities may have constituted a truly novel arrangement, unanticipated by earlier patterns of interaction.  The sourcing results are still being analyzed and are expected to lead to more nuanced interpretations in the near future.  Radiocarbon dating of the fiber temper from Stallings pottery sherds from the Ogeechee River valley has yeilded the first absolute age estimates for ealry pottery in this context.  As expected, these dates situate the Strange and Chew Mill sites within the Classic Stallings period.  Radiocarbon assays from the Early Stallings components at two Coastal Plain sites (Rabbit Mount and Cox/Fennel Hill) yielded age estimates that are substantially later than expected for incipient pottery in the region.  More testing will be required to verify these results.   This project yielded important new data related to a critical period of pre-Columbian history in the southeastern United States.  These data provide significant new insights into the origins of settled village life, the innovation and spread of the continent's first pottery technology, and the social and ritual lives of Late Archaic period hunter-gatherers.  Beyond archaeology, these data are have important potential implications for perceptions and interactions with living hunter-gatherer societies, as well as broadly relevant issues of community formation and diversity.   This project also provided substantial opportunities for training and professional development for Zackary Gilmore, the postdoctoral scholar who was funded.  In carrying out the analytical aspects of the project, Gilmore further developed his skills in the scientific techniques of ceramic petrography and neutron activation analysis. Gilmore also built professional relationships with curation professionals around the eastern U.S. and was closely mentored by the principal investigator.  Gilmore has presented prelimary results from this project at national and regional conferences and is in the process of turning these into publications.  Together, these experiences helped Gilmore advance as both a professional and a scientist.  Preliminary results of the pottery sourcing and radiocarbon analyses have been disseminated at national and regional conferences and muliple publications are in preparation.  Results of the chemical neutron activation analysis (NAA) are now publically accessible on the Univeristy of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) Archaeometry Lab website.
