<AbstractNarration>This project involves basic research of controls on nitrogen (N) weathering rates from bedrock across an array of terrestrial ecosystems and conditions ? spanning molecular techniques to global scale modeling. This study is motivated by the need to understand how biogeochemical cycles shape integrated Earth systems and has key implications for the pace and magnitude of climate change in the face of rising fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Bedrock lithologies house &gt;99% of all reactive N compounds (i.e., all N forms other than N2 gas) on the planet; yet, the biogeochemical importance of this vast N reservoir has been overlooked. Textbook paradigms hold that new N enters ecosystems solely from the atmosphere via biochemical fixation or as N in deposition. However, these N input pathways are incapable of explaining the high rates of N accumulation observed for many terrestrial ecosystems, constituting a major unknown in the global N budget.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an alternative, the principal investigators suggest that the geosphere plays a major role in terrestrial N biogeochemistry ? imparting large effects on terrestrial carbon (C) cycling and climate change. They propose research to test the hypothesis that rocks of sedimentary origin represent a broadly significant source of N to the terrestrial biosphere. The research team includes geologists, biologists, pedologists, biogeochemists, and Earth system scientists. They will examine bedrock N weathering at molecular-, soil pedon-, watershed-, regional-, and global-scales. The proposed combination of state-of-the-art tools, involving lab, field, and modeling components, is novel. The molecular-scale research is focused on geobiology;  it emphasizes ?rock-eating-fungi?  effects on N weathering reactions, using controlled laboratory  experiments and NanoSIMS (Nanometer-scale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry) across field sites. The soil pedon, watershed and regional analyses will estimate physical and chemical weathering of nitrogen across an array of lithologies, tectonic conditions, and climates.  Linkages between weathering rates and the terrestrial nitrogen cycle will be empirically investigated regionally through measures of natural nitrogen stable isotopes, and carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus chemistry. The global analyses will emphasize a new modeling scheme that couples a global biogeochemical model with a weathering model to scale the amount of rock-derived nitrogen that is available to store terrestrial carbon worldwide.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The  project was designed to enhance our understanding of how erosion affects the proportion of N derived from rock sources. In a steady state landscape erosion is a process that removes surface horizons while at the same time stimulating weathering into rock in the deeper parts of the soil profile. A reasonable hypothesis would be that loss of N from the surface horizons during erosion is at least partly balanced by N injected into the profile from weathering at the bottom, but lowered N in the surface is also likely to stimulate N fixation by organisms in the surface so that some of the N will be replenished by biological processes. Many landscapes today are far from steady state because of human-caused degradation of soils that has rapidly removed soils in a way that leaves surface soils depleted in N . Loss of N from the surface is more rapid than rock weathering release.  Little is known about the balance of rock-derived N and biologically produced N as a function of climate and both short-term and long-term erosion. Knowing the magnitude of N-form fluxes given changing erosional regime is imperative to understanding the relative importance of rock-derived nitrogen. This requires assessing rock-N in a baseline condition and also within an accelerated erosional setting as well.  To address this question, our work fell into 3 distinct but interlocking segments.  1)    Measurement of long-term erosion rates through the use of 10Be measured on stream channel sediments to establish background rates in the semi-arid grasslands and chaparral on Santa Cruz Island, the Santa Inez mountains draining to the Santa Barbara Channel, and the Santa Inez valley on the interior side of the Santa Inez Valley.  2)    Quantification of short-term erosion rates by reconstructing landscapes to their pre-anthropogenic state using Lidar point cloud data. This effort includes both development of the point cloud analysis code and an interpretation of how different rocks (with different amounts of N) respond to anthropogenic forcing.  3)    Tracing rock-N through landscapes. This was tricky because there is no fully established tracer for rock-N. 15N has been used effectively as a tracer in some environments but its use is almost entirely empirical ? there are many ways N isotopes can be fractionated and it is not clear why it should act as a tracer separating rock-N from biologically fixed N within soils.  The grant primarily supported PhD student Nina Bingham to conduct the pieces summarized above under the direction and active participation of Bodo Bookhagen and Oliver Chadwick.
