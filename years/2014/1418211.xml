<AbstractNarration>The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) identify an ambitious progression for learning energy, beginning in elementary school. To help the nation's teachers address this challenge, this project will develop and investigate the opportunities and limitations of Focus on Energy, a professional development (PD) system for elementary teachers (grades 3-5).  The PD will contain: resources that will help teachers to interpret, evaluate and cultivate students' ideas about energy; classroom activities to help them to identify, track and represent energy forms and flows; and supports to help them in engaging students in these activities.  Teachers will receive the science and pedagogical content knowledge they need to teach about energy in a crosscutting way across all their science curricula; students will be intellectually engaged in the practice of developing, testing, and revising a model of energy they can use to describe phenomena both in school and in their everyday lives; and formative assessment will guide the moment-by-moment advancement of students' ideas about energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop and test a scalable model of PD that will enhance the ability of in-service early elementary teachers to help students learn energy concepts by coordinating formative assessment, face-to-face and web-based PD activities.  Researchers will develop and iteratively refine tools to assess both teacher and student energy reasoning strategies. The goals of the project include (1) teachers' increased facility with, and disciplined application of, representations and energy reasoning to make sense of everyday phenomena in terms of energy; (2) teachers' increased ability to interpret student representations and ideas about energy to make instructional decisions; and (3) students' improved use of representations and energy reasoning to develop and refine models that describe energy forms and flows associated with everyday phenomena.  The web-based product will contain:  a set of formative assessments to help teachers to interpret student ideas about energy based on the Facets model; a series of classroom tested activities to introduce the Energy Tracking Lens (method to explore energy concept using multiple representations); and videos of classroom exemplars as well as scientists thinking out loud while using the Energy Tracking Lens. The project will refine the existing PD and build a system that supports online implementation by constructing a facilitator's guide so that the online community can run with one facilitator.</AbstractNarration>

The Focus on Energy Project team members were successful in soliciting, listening to, and engaging with teacher ideas. The result was a truly collaborative effort with far reaching impact and significance. The project directly impacted several cohorts of participating teachers who:   Are better prepared to engage their students in the study of energy as envisioned in the Next Generation Science Standards.   Are empowered to teach science as a process of inquiry which builds upon the experiences and intellectual resources of their students.   Can provide their students with representational strategies to track the flow of energy in multidisciplinary contexts.   Have demonstrated a readiness to take on leadership roles as science educators. One teacher in particular is now teaching a science methods course for a local university.   Have online access to curricular resources which support ambitious energy learning at the elementary level.   These impacts and findings extend beyond the participating teachers to their students and their colleagues. The project also added to scholarship on teacher education by:   Analyzing elementary student ideas about energy conservation and energy dissipation   Developing and testing a new energy curriculum for elementary learners   Providing energy-specific instructional strategies for teachers at all levels   Articulating the need for professional development that attends to and builds from teachers? own science ideas   Identifying barriers and pressures which make responsive instructional practice challenging for teachers to enact.
