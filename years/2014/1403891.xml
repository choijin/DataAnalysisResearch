<AbstractNarration>One of the most difficult unanswered problems in nuclear and particle physics is how to understand systems in which the components are so tightly bound together that it is impossible to separate them, as occurs inside the proton and neutron and many other particles.  This project is designed to explore several methods of obtaining definitive information from such complicated systems, so that one can understandand how they are put together and why they interact the way they do.  For most of the approaches to be researched, the investigators initiated the development of the methods used here. This project emphasizes collaborative work with researchers at several other universities and laboratories. The educational component represents an important part of the work to be performed here. The project allows for the training of graduate and undergraduate students both on the analytical aspects of theory, and will also make possible the mentoring of these students for success in their future carreers in industry or academia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes six specific problems that will be studied, three each for the PI and co-PI in areas of their respective expertise, all related to the question of how to understand systems in which the component particles are so tightly bound that it is difficult or impossible to separate them, such as inside protons and neutrons. These specific problems are 1) how the proton and neutron would be assembled if the strong nuclear force that holds them together had a different number of interaction charges than the three in our universe; 2) how best to extract the maximal amount of information about their detailed internal structure from experiments; 3) how to compute their actual dynamical interactions in a strong-force theory that is a realistic simplified model of the one studied experimentally, and 4) how closely this idealized theory appears to mimic the real one, since much more can be computed exactly from the ideal than from the real theory; 5) how to simulate the structure of an atom, much smaller than conventional atoms, formed from particles (muons) that appear in cosmic rays, which is guaranteed to exist but has not yet been experimentally observed; and 6) using a connection between strongly-interacting theories and gravity in curved spacetimes to study systems in which the strongly-interacting particles have such a high ambient energy that they can be said to have a finite temperature.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant funded the research of Principal Investigator Richard Lebed and Co-Principal Investigator Andrei Belitsky for a three-year period (plus contributed to funding Lebed?s research for an additional year via a no-cost extension).   Included in this funding were support for Belitsky graduate student Yao Ji and Nikhil Monga, and for Lebed graduate student Henry Lamm.  A number of other students were mentored by Belitsky and Lebed on research related to this project, including graduate students Jesse Giron, Elena Drobnykh, Brandon Sumner, Jyotirish Das, and Omer Albyrak, and undergraduate Honors Thesis student Curtis Peterson.  Lebed and Belitsky both specialize in (but are not limited to) research to unravel the nature of the strong nuclear force responsible for holding atomic nuclei together, which operates according to a theory called Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).  Among other work, they are noted, respectively, for advances in QCD on the nature of ``exotic?? hadrons (which fit neither into the ``hadron?? category of two-quark ``meson?? nor three-quark ``baryon??) and generalized parton distributions (which are the most fundamental observable quantities inside hadrons like protons).  Lebed?s primary accomplishments include studies to apply an entirely new dynamical picture for describing exotic hadrons and developing a number of insights into and experimental predictions of this picture, as well as developing a formalism for working models based upon this picture, which will be the start of the PhD research for his new student Giron.  He was the lead author of a well-cited review article on the exotic hadrons, and an author on a white paper detailing future opportunities in exotics studies.  In addition, Lebed's PhD student Lamm (graduated May 2016) became an expert on the physics of muons, including papers with Lebed on high-precision numerical simulations of the yet-undiscovered "true muonium" atom. He then independently published papers on both true muonium and the use of muons to distinguish precision known physical effects from those of novel theories.  Lebed returned to studies of model-independent bounds on the observable decay rates of heavy-quark hadrons, (a topic for which he was known in the 1990s with collaborator Ben Grinstein) and discovered new effects in papers with Grinstein.  Most recently, he has taught Lamm, now a postdoc at U. Maryland and longtime collaborator Tom Cohen these techniques, and they have developed a number of model-independent constraints to test whether these decay rates depend, for example, upon whether an electron or a muon is present.     In a series of papers with Hohenegger (Lyon), Korchemsky (Saclay), Sokatchev (Annecy) and Zhiboedov (Harvard), Belitsky proposed a new approach to computing infrared finite observables, known as event shapes which are familiar from collider physics studies, was presented.  A major thrust of Belitsky's research over the past several years was the study of scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric gauge theory. They receive a dual description in terms of the expectation value of the superWilson loop stretched on a null polygonal contour. This makes the analysis amenable to nonperturbative techniques. Within the refined form of the operator product expansion (OPE) in terms of the so-called pentagon transitions for all helicity configurations (MHV and nonMHV) were addressed in the past three years. Pentagons encode the physics of excitations propagating on the color flux tube ending on the sides of the four-dimensional contour of the loop. They are built from three components, the dynamical one that depends on the ?t Hooft coupling, the helicity form factors responsible for the type of excitations that is coupled to the contour, and a purely kinematical one that reflects nontrivial SU(4) group structure. Starting with the first, a novel derivation of scattering matrices starting from Baxter equations for flux-tube excitations propagating on magnon background was given. A set of axiomatic equations obeyed by transitions were solved for all possible sets of excitations and allowed one to determine them to all orders in ?t Hooft coupling. Factorizability of multiparticle transitions in terms of single-particle ones were shown to be a consequence of integrable flux-tube dynamics, which at lowest order in ?t Hooft coupling was mapped into noncompact open spin chains. This completed the basic set up of the program.     Lebed was involved in several outreach events related to his research field, such as giving public lectures to nonscientists and interviews to newspapers and magazines.  In addition, as the Director of Undergraduate Programs at Arizona State University, he applied for and helped to host a regional Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics in January, 2018. Belitsky was involved in project mentoring of high school students as well as giving public outreach lectures on the topics of his research.
