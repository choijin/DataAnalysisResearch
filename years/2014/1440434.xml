<AbstractNarration>This grant will provide partial support for American postdoctoral, graduate, and advanced undergraduate students to participate in the 4th Graduate Summer Institute on Complex Plasmas, an international educational workshop which will be held from July 30th to August 8th, 2014 at Seton Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey. The project objective of this summer school is the educational dissemination of the current knowledge of this new field, the advancement of the current scientific challenges, and the promotion of the potential technological opportunities provided by complex plasmas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 4th Graduate Summer Institute on Complex Plasmas will focus on dusty and strongly coupled plasmas, reactive plasmas, microplasmas, quantum plasmas, and plasmas in contact with surfaces. The summer school will provide a broad overview yet rigorous curriculum that will lead to further advancement in this emerging field by seeking to attract young American researchers in significant numbers since they will encounter scientific challenges as well as technological opportunities upon which they can build successful academic or industrial careers. A further benefit of this program is that complex plasma applications appear to be a potentially very fertile field for small, high-tech start-up companies which will perceive this subject as a encouraging innovation source for marketplace realization of new plasma technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award grant provided partial participation support for American postdoctoral, graduate, and advanced undergraduate students to attend the 4th Graduate Summer Institute on Complex Plasmas, an international educational summer workshop which was held from July 30th to August 8th, 2014 at Seton Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey, USA. The project objectives of this summer school was the educational dissemination of the current scientific discoveries and understanding in this emerging field, the advancement of resolving current research challenges, and a reflection on potential technological applications of complex plasmas.     Similar, to the previous installments of Graduate Summer Institutes on Complex Plasmas series, this fourth installment focused on dusty and strongly coupled plasmas, reactive plasmas, microplasmas, quantum plasmas, and plasmas in contact with surfaces. The summer institute provided a broad overview, but rigorous curriculum that strived to anticipate further advancements in this emerging field by seeking to educate and attract young American researchers into this scientific area. New researchers of complex plasmas as a result of this educational program, encountered some of the scientific challenges as well as explored some of the technological opportunities upon which they could build successful professional careers in academia, public sector, or industry. A further benefit of this program is that complex plasma applications are a very fertile field for small, high-tech start-up companies seeking out favorable innovations for marketplace realization of new plasma technologies.  As a direct result of previously mentioned efforts of the 4th Summer Institute on Complex Plasmas and the previous series of institutes, the publication of a second reference textbook for complex plasmas was achieved. The title of the book is "Complex Plasmas - Scientific Challenges and Technological Opportunities"  edited by Michael Bonitz, Jose Lopez, Kurt H. Becker, and Hauke Thomsen. This book was used at the 4th Summer Institute on Complex Plasmas along with a prior published book entitled "Introduction to Complex Plasmas" edited by Michael Bonitz, Norman Horing, and Patrick Ludwig. This very successful educational series on complex plasmas is scheduled to continue with a fifth installment at the 5th Summer Institute on Complex Plasmas from August 8 to August 12, 2016 at the University of Kiel in Kiel, Germany.
