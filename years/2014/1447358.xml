<AbstractNarration>Cyberphysical systems, systems which combine computing and physical components, are at the core of our modern infrastructure yet are known to have significant vulnerabilities to natural and malicious disasters. These vulnerabilities are not amenable to the simple technological solutions attempted in the past because they are caused by a very wide range of causes from theoretical to technological to economic to psychological. We are exploring new and novel approaches to mitigating these vulnerabilities so that our society and economy can remain secure and prosperous. We anticipate researchers will proceed to develop solutions for use across the entire range of our national infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ensuring security and personal privacy is a key component of our vast cyber-physical infrastructure; yet we have no good consensus on how to do so. Thus research into possible approaches is vital to our society. Research requires novel approaches - exactly what the Ideas Lab approach has been developed to facilitate.   Accordingly, 52 researchers were invited to participate (after a preliminary round to submitted pre-proposals) in an Ideas Lab to develop new and novel approaches to security and privacy in our age of cyber-physical infrastructure. Not all of the researchers specialized in computing as the intent was to find approaches that spanned the entire technical-social space. This approach also required participants to expand beyond their normal context.  The participants self-divided into a number of core areas of the research space, some aligned with specific areas (connected cars) and others more broadly focused (CPS invariants). As in all Ideas Labs, participants moved from one area to another as their interests and contributions varied.  A key component of this workshop was the active particpation of a team from Intel - which has strong interests in cyber-physical infrastructure.  Ultimate determination of the success of this approach will come only over a considerable time period as relationships and ideas are allowed to develop and turn into proposals and research. The in-workshop feedback from participants was very positive and all eagerly await the ultimate results.          Last Modified: 08/30/2016       Submitted by: Andrew Bernat]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
