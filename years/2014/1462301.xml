<AbstractNarration>Thermoacoustic instability can disrupt the operation of gas turbine combustors. The study of these instabilities is a long-standing problem in combustion science, that is still widely investigated towards a better understanding of power generation systems, and their design and operations. This interdisciplinary project addresses the prediction of thermoacoustic instability by using mathematical tools developed for the analysis of dynamic systems with multiple time delays.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will attack the important problem of predicting thermoacoustic instability using tools for the analysis of neutral time delayed systems. This approach provides exact and exhaustive descriptions of stability maps for the particular class of systems under study in the parametric space of the dynamics. This project will specialize this tool to the equations of thermoacoustics in order to create new design tools for the prediction of instability in combustors.  A simple benchmark combustor, called the Rijke's tube, will be taken as the test platform during this research, in order to demonstrate the validity of the project's mathematical paradigm.</AbstractNarration>

They are "Prediction of Thermo-acoustic instability (TAI)" and "Stability of neutral class systems with multiple and rationally independent delays". TAI is at least 1 &frac12; century-old phenomenon which is still widely investigated by combustion specialists for a better understanding.  By and large the archival findings in this area are confined to "emprical discovery" category.  This research created the first analytical and rigorous treatment of prediction of TAI as well as experimental validations of the findings.  Furthermore beyond the prediction of the instability we also provided both analytical and experimental pathways for its control.  Some scientists arguably regard these objectives as the "holy grails" in the power generation industry including aerospace and energy generation fields.  The underpinning dynamics of TAI lends itself in Neutral class systems with multiple delays.  This class of differential equations are notorious for their extraordinary stability postures. Interestingly, this class of mathematical constructs offers some unexpected and extremely surprising opportunities which are now available. The marriage of TAI and Neutral Time Delayed Systems formed the transformative contribution of the research project.  they can be traced in the relevant publications.   Beyond the general scope of the project, the PI and his research team also explored into an exciting new frontier: Non-collocated vibration absorption, which indeed was a by-product from passive Helmoltz Resonators mitigating the TAI  phenomenon.  This very lihghtly explored topic has resulted in some crucial findings in publication # 6.  This conceptual novelty is expected to provide broader research topics in the coming years to both combustion science (where TAI resides) and systems science (which houses the time-delayed phenomena) communities and beyond.
