<AbstractNarration>Part 1&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary partnership between the University of Central Florida and the Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technology (FIDMT) in Ilmenau, Germany is focused on adaptive conversational avatars, the rapidly emerging field crossing computer engineering, computer science, education, communications, and social science.  Immediate applications of this research field include artificial intellegence and national security (including cyber-security), interactive robotics, improvement of quality of life for disbaled, and health and caretaking for children and elderly.&lt;br/&gt;This project will place students from the University of Central Florida under the mentorship of the PI (Dr. A. J. Gonzalez) and of Dr. Klaus Jantke, the counterpart at FIDMT in Ilmenau, Germany. Dr. Jantke is the director of the Children's Media Department of FIDMT located in Erfurt, Germany and has a long and illustrious history in research in computing media. The international aspect of innovative and advanced research is essential in modern research hence the PIs will work with three cohorts of students, one during each year of the project's existence. Each cohort will include one graduate student and either two undergraduates (the first year) or four (in each of the subsequent years).  The research period for each cohort will be 16 weeks - eight weeks in the US and eight weeks in Germany for each year of the grant period.&lt;br/&gt;This research project is motivated by an ancient art of storytelling. In our pursuit of an artificially intelligent computer agent, the IRES project seeks to build a capability to autonomously synthesize possible scenarios for the system development and to modify them dynamically upon listener request. More specifically, the topic of the research in this project is the creation of an avatar-based system that can synthesize and adapt a scenario according to the user's request in real time and without any pre-scripted pathways. Good storytellers were treasured in medieval times, given the lack of other media through which to relate a story to a mostly illiterate population. Therefore, the project seeks to embody the storyteller in a lifelike avatar that resembles an actual person. This avatar will tell the story to the listener in spoken natural language, and interact with her/him when the latter requests changes to the story. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2&lt;br/&gt;Storytelling media have evolved over time, from oral stories to modern E-books. Since the development of the computer, storytelling systems have become a science of their own, and have evolved from simple systems that can only generate a single short story to systems that respond to the listener's actions by modifying the story dynamically in real time. Digital storytelling has therefore become a growing field within artificial intelligence. The project seeks to take this evolution of storytelling media one step further by doing research to create a virtual storyteller who tells a dynamic story. The story is modifiable through a request by the listener (typically a child, a student, or an elderly person), yet will seek to remain realistic as well as interesting. Every story has a story space. That is, only so many things can happen in a story. We use contextual reasoning to represent the story space. In the real world, courses of action are influenced by the current context, making some conversational avatars very attractive while others unattractive when addressing the current situation within the story space. In a similar manner, the situation faced by the protagonist in the dynamic scenario will limit the choices of actions that he/she would otherwise have, thereby taking the story in various directions, none of which need be specifically pre-scripted.  The PIs base the proposed research on the use of formal methods to manipulate the story space within the main theme of the story. By formal methods the PIs mean that one represents the story knowledge formally in terms of strings, interaction sequences such as storyboards and graphs, formulas (for conditions), and the like. Formal methods, therefore, will give the ability to reason with formal methods (string comparison, unification, anti-unification and the like) in the story space. Formal methods have been used in the literature to manipulate contextual information.</AbstractNarration>

Thus, the primary objective of this project was to train American computer science and engineering students in how to perform world-class research in an international setting.&nbsp;</p> <p>This grant provided opportunities for 16 undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Central Florida (UCF) to perform world-class, state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence research in Germany on context-based automated narrative generation. The students participated as members of one of four cohorts, each of which had four students (except the last which had five). The students in a cohort worked together as a team over the course of 18 months. Two of these months were spent on location in Germany, at the Technical University of Ilmenau (TUI), while the remaining time was spent on research activities at UCF before and after their time in Germany. &nbsp;Activities of successive cohorts overlapped by a few months.)</p> <p>Without exception, the students were scientifically and culturally enriched by their overall experience in this project, but in particular, while living and doing research at the Technical University of Ilmenau in Germany. During their time in Germany they were guided and mentored by our two German academic partners,&nbsp;Prof. Rainer Knauf and Prof. Klaus Jantke. We sincerely thank them for their self-less collaboration. Prior to and after their time in Germany, the students were trained and mentored by the PI and the Co-PI at their home institution (UCF). The participating students were: <strong>Cohort #1</strong> - Josiah Wong, Josh Wade, Max Waldor and Lucas Pasqualin; <strong>Cohort #2</strong> - Vera Kazakova, Lauren Hastings, Andres Posadas and Lucas Gonzalez (no relation to the PI); <strong>Cohort #3</strong> - Rebeca Amaya, Jordan Martin, Kyle Benko and Matthew Alvarez; <strong>Cohort #4</strong> ? Kyle Benko, Brooke Bottoni, Thomas Anchor, Yasmine Moolenaar and Anthony Hevia.</p> <p>With regards to our second set of objectives - those related to scientific research - advances in computing over the last few decades have led to computerized storytelling systems that have sought to compensate for a decline in human storytelling, all with varying degrees of success. Our research was directed at improving the ability of computers to automatically generate interesting stories, specifically for fairy tales directed at children. Our general scientific research objective was to create a state-of-the-art automated narrative generation system that used context manipulation to automatically create fairy tales for children. Furthermore, every story generated would be fundamentally different. Therefore, our resulting artificially intelligent system called <em>fAIble </em>had three specific technical objectives: 1) generate fairy tales that would interest 6 to 8 year old children; 2) generate diverse tales to avoid repetition of story lines; and 3) require minimal background effort by the human ?author? who would use the fAIble system to create stories.</p> <p>For stories to be interesting, the plot must unfold in unexpected ways. To accomplish this, fAIble uses a stochastic process that selects the next context to occur through a probability density function that depends partially on the skills and personal qualities assigned to the main characters, as well as on the context in which the character already finds itself. Character development is also important in fAIble, as the probability density functions on which the plot depends are designed to be changed over time as the character and/or its goals evolve over the course of the story.</p> <p>Several advances were made in automated narrative generation as a result of our research, the most notable of which is the integration of contextual reasoning in story development. Four generations of the fAIble system were developed, one by each of the four cohorts. They are called <em>AESOP</em>, <em>fAIble I</em>, <em>fAIble II</em> and <em>fAIble III</em>.

The 2020 conference was cancelled because of the Covid-19 pandemic, but our (fourth) paper was nevertheless published in its proceedings.&nbsp; Additionally, a state of the art review paper and a capstone article about the entire project will be written and submitted to the Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence (JETAI), a venue that regularly publishes research on automated narrative generation. Besides producing children?s fairy tales, our fAIble system could be used to create stories for general entertainment (e.g., short films, video games) as well as for military and first responder simulator-based training, which typically require a back story to be effective.</p> <p>Our project outcomes met and exceeded the objectives that we originally proposed to NSF.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br>
