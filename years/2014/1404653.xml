<AbstractNarration>A three-dimensional polymer network may absorb a large quantity of water and form a hydrogel. Familiar examples include jello and superabsorbent diapers. Hydrogels are under intense development for biomedical applications such as scaffolds in tissue engineering and carriers for drug delivery. Most existing hydrogels, however, are weak, brittle, and not very stretchable. They also dry out as water evaporates. These issues have severely limited the scope of applications of hydrogels. This project will develop stretchable, tough, and water-retaining hydrogels. Hydrogels of enhanced mechanical properties and environmental stability will open new applications. Examples include stretchable, transparent, ionic conductors; fire-retarding blankets; swellable seals; and environmentally responsive actuators and sensors. Large-scale use of hydrogels is attractive for a number of reasons. Many kinds of polymers can form hydrogels; this diversity enables suitable polymers to be selected to achieve specific functions. Hydrogels consist mostly of water, and can be formed by naturally occurring polymers; many hydrogels are inexpensive and environmentally friendly. The mechanical behavior of hydrogels will also serve as a vehicle to bridge the gap between research and education: Fresh insights that arise from this project will be incorporated into graduate courses; the project will offer research opportunities to high-school students, and will use Internet sites such as iMechanica and YouTube to bring recent developments in the mechanics of materials to readers worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent findings highlight a significant opportunity: hydrogels of enhanced properties may achieve much broader applications, well beyond those envisaged so far. This opportunity poses new scientific questions concerning the development of stretchable, tough, water-retaining hydrogels. The project will draw upon concepts of nonlinear fracture mechanics, as well as polymer science, to investigate the mechanisms that control multiple mechanical properties of hydrogels, including stretchability, stiffness, strength and toughness. The project will examine approaches that enhance the mechanical properties and environmental stability of hydrogels, by introducing energy dissipation mechanisms to toughen hydrogels, by embedding fibers to stiffen and strengthen hydrogels, by modifying weak bonds to enable healing after deformation, and by adding hygroscopic components to alter the chemical potential of water inside the gels. Energy-dissipation mechanisms of two broad types will be investigated: recoverable dissociation of weak crosslinks such as ionic bonds and crystallites, and frictional sliding between hydrogels and embedded fibers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Stretchable, Tough, Water-Retaining Hydrogels for</strong><strong> Non-Traditional Applications</strong></p> <p>Hydrogels are soft materials that consist of a hydrophilic cross-linked polymer network and water. Jelly and tofu are common examples. Hydrogels have many applications, most notably in contact lenses, as scaffolds in tissue engineering, and as absorbent in diapers. Most hydrogels are mechanically weak and fragile, which prevents their use in load-bearing applications. We have developed a class of hydrogels that are strong, stretchable and tough, opening up a vast array of engineering possibilities and pushing the limits of where these materials can be used. As part of this project, we have 1) developed novel methods to improve the mechanical properties of hydrogels, 2) explored the limits of their physical properties in potential applications, and 3) developed hydrogels for use in stretchable electronics.</p> <p>Multiple approaches were pursued to enhance the mechanical properties of hydrogels. One approach relies on the fine-tuning of existing hydrogel chemistries. For example, we discovered that it is possible to independently optimize the stiffness, strength, and toughness of hydrogels that contain a double network of polyacrylamide and alginate by altering the distribution of alginate chain lengths. Novel chemistries were also explored &ndash; this effort yielded hydrogels with improved chemically stability and hydrogels capable of extremely large stretchability and fast self-healing <strong>[Picture 1]</strong>. Physical reinforcement through the incorporation of steel fibers or by laminating hydrogel and fabric layers was made possible by using tough polyacrylamide-alginate hydrogels, yielding enhanced stiffness and strength <strong>[Picture 2]</strong>.</p> <p>Because hydrogels consist mainly of water, they are prone to drying out during extended open-air exposure or prone to freezing at low temperatures, thus limiting the application of even the most robust hydrogels. We have discovered that the evaporation of water is greatly reduced if hygroscopic salts are incorporated into the hydrogels. This makes it possible to use hydrogels in applications that require long-term open-air exposure. A similar approach can also be used to prevent hydrogels from freezing. By incorporating calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>), the salt used to control snow and ice on roads in wintertime, it is possible to create a hydrogel that remains stretchable and robust down to near Antarctic temperatures (-51&deg;C or -58&deg;F). These CaCl<sub>2</sub>-containing hydrogels even remain temporarily stable at temperatures as low as -70&deg;C <strong>[Picture 3]</strong>. In some cases evaporation can be used to good advantage. For instance, by exploiting the evaporation of water that occurs when a hydrogel is heated, we were able to develop a fire-resistant fabric-hydrogel laminate capable of protecting an individual from fires far more effectively than either material alone. This concept led to a patent application for an inexpensive fire-retarding design with commercial applications <strong>[Picture 4]</strong>.</p> <p>&nbsp;A promising application of hydrogels is their use as stretchable electrical conductors, thus allowing one to construct soft and highly stretchable electric devices. We have shown that hydrogels with a high concentration of ionic salts can transmit electrical signals over long distances and that they remain functional while being stretched [<strong>Picture 5a</strong>]. We have also developed a stretchable hydrogel-based device capable of electroluminescence, potentially setting the stage for inexpensive display technologies [<strong>Picture 5b</strong>]. We have also developed a successful 3D extrusion printing protocol for the printing of hybrid hydrogel-elastomer devices [<strong>Picture 6</strong>], allowing rapid prototyping of electric devices with improved resolution and greater complexity. Moving from manual assembly to integrated extrusion printing highlights the importance of soft materials interfaces, particularly the interfacial adhesion of materials as different as hydrogels and elastomers. We addressed this issue by developing an adhesion measurement technique specifically for soft and stretchable materials and quantified the adhesion of printed hydrogel-elastomer interfaces.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/06/2017<br>      Modified by: Joost&nbsp;J&nbsp;Vlassak</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1404653/1404653_10301113_1496769690377_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1404653/1404653_10301113_1496769690377_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Picture 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1404653/1404653_10301113_1496769690377_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Picture 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Picture 1: We discovered a novel hydrogel chemistry capable of a) extremely large stretch and b) extremely fast self-healing after scission, with a healing time of only 30 seconds.
