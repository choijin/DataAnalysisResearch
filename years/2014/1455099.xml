<AbstractNarration>With this CAREER Award, the Macromolecular Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division is funding Professor Christopher J. Ackerson of Colorado State University  to develop a better understanding of metal nanoparticle surfaces.  Metal nanoparticles have dimensions of 1 billionth of a meter.  At this small scale, metallic particles have properties that are different than those of familiar bulk metals. Understanding what the surfaces of nanoparticles look like, and how these surfaces behave pose special challenges for scientific study. This project aims to produce an improved picture of metal nanoparticle surfaces, with improved understanding of how these surfaces behave.  This improved understanding may yield dividends in applications of nanoparticles for catalysis, medicines, and research enabling tools.  The educational goal of this project is to enhance undergraduate scientific education by developing a nanoscience teaching laboratory course that covers the synthesis and characterization of nanostructured materials.  The majority of the class uses methods that are not part of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum, but are widely used in the research science setting. The broader impacts of the project developing a gold nanoparticle outreach activity at the Fort Collins Museum of Science and Discoverys annual 4th Grade Rendezvous, where Ackerson and team members will relate the history of gold mining in Colorado to the modern scientific study of gold chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this project is to improve understanding of the structure and reactivity of metal nanoparticle surfaces.  The Ackerson group will endeavor to establish the structural basis of ligand exchange on inorganic nanoparticles, beginning with thiolate protected gold nanoparticles.  The research team will use the surprisingly low symmetry nanomolecules Au102(SR)44 and Au25(SR)18 as starting points to establish a mechanistic understanding of ligand exchange.  These studies are also directed at understanding weak ligand binding and how multivalent weak ligands can create dynamic assemblies of nanoclusters with emergent optical and spin properties. The broader impacts of this work include the generation of atomisitic models of mixed ligand shells that will underpin theory work done by others, as well as the dissemination of materials and expertise into disciplinary labs in biological electron microscopy and nano-biomedicine.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This is the Project Outcomes Report for the NSF Award CAREER: Structure of Inorganic Nanoparticle Surface Interfaces Plus Multidisciplinary Nanochemistry Undergraduate Teaching Lab to Christopher Ackerson, from 1-Aug-2015 to 31-July 2020. The award supported Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts activities, described below.   Metal nanoparticles are pieces of metal with dimensions on the order of 1 billionth of a meter.  At this size, metals behave in ways that are notably different from bulk metal.  One area of understanding that is incomplete is the appearance and reactivity of the surfaces of nanoparticles.     From a scientific standpoint, this grant supported research that was aimed at understanding how the surfaces of nanoparticles look, how they behave, and what they react with. This research could result in better chemical reactions, completely new molecules, and new ways of seeing things in biology.  In a set of 10 peer-reviewed scientific publications and one patent that resulted from this award, we described: (1) The spatial location of molecules that bind to nanoparticle surfaces; (2) New reactions involving molecules on the surface of nanoparticles; (3) How light interacts and is changed by interacting with nanoparticles that have different surface properties; (4) How molecules on the surface of nanoparticles move and flex.  Part of this grant supported the participation of the PI in the ERC/NSF research opportunities for NSF CAREER grantees in Europe.  The PI spent 3 months at the Oxford Particle Imaging Center, using electron microscopes to advance the goals of this work.  This grant also supported the development of an undergraduate teaching laboratory experience on nanoscale chemistry. This course focused on synthesis and characterization of nanoscale chemistry products.  It allowed undergraduate student exposure to methods that are not usually part of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum, such as lithography (sculpting solids at the nanoscale), colloidal synthesis from chemical precursors.  Students were also exposed to characterization methods such as electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering that are not usually part of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum.   This grant resulted in broader impacts to society. It contributed to the training of 9 PhD students and one MS student.  Four of these PhD students have earned their PhDs and are working in various areas of scientific endeavor (startup companies, biotech, academic postdocs).  The graduated MS student works in a science museum.   This grant resulted in outreach activities / demonstrations at the Fort Collins Museum of Science and Discovery.  The activity demonstrated how 'small is different' for very small (nanoscale) pieces of matter, in a way that gradeschool children could understand. This grant also resulted in a patent that is licensed by AEMS, inc., which was founded by one of the PhD students who was previously supported on this grant.  AEMS inc., is currently pursuing anti-fungal coatings for potato tubers, which is expected to improve potato farming.
