<AbstractNarration>Unfettered digital communication, as provided by the Internet, has fundamentally changed the world in countless ways. Businesses, organizations, and citizens have benefited from the Internet's global reach.  However, the Internet was not designed to be resilient to censorship, and governments have restricted communication to advance their social and economic agendas. Worse, network equipment providers have shown a willingness to commoditize and profit from censorship by selling interception and filtering devices.  The desire for uncensored access to the Internet has motivated the development of techniques such as one-hop proxies and anonymizing networks, but existing techniques have multiple limitations, ranging from low performance and intermittent availability to reduced levels of security and application flexibility.  This project will develop and deploy a censorship resistant peer-to-peer system that overcomes the limitations of existing systems and provides unrestricted access to popular web sites and Internet services.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advent of social networks provides researchers with an opportunity to take a fresh look at peer-to-peer systems for censorship resistance. The focus of this project is to use social trust relations as a foundation for achieving highly secure and blocking resistant overlays for supporting network services, while also approaching the ease of use, performance, and reliability typically associated with direct communications.  Specifically, the system will use social overlays wherein participants form a peer-to-peer overlay network bootstrapped based on real-world trust relationships.  Participants of the social overlay would be able to directly communicate and share content, without having to expose their actions and without being blocked.  A key design choice is also to develop the system to operate completely within a web browser, leveraging newly developed technologies that provide support for peer-to-peer communications inside the browser.  Browser-based end-user solutions are easily deployable without requiring significant infrastructural costs.  There are several key, interrelated challenges that the system will overcome.  Principal among these are: performance, flexibility, trustworthiness, and robustness.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Unrestricted communications on the Internet are not possible today.  Many regions, ranging in size from small ISPs with restrictive policies to entire countries, restrict or control certain forms of Internet communication through filtering, packet translation, and deep packet inspection.  The desire for uncensored access to the Internet has motivated the development of techniques such as one-hop proxies and anonymizing networks, but existing techniques have multiple limitations that reduce their effectiveness.  First is availability and performance -- existing mechanisms for circumventing censorship are easy to block and have either significant security weaknesses or poor performance. Second is flexibility -- existing approaches are application agnostic, and thus the censorship circumvention system may play to the least common denominator of all applications, rather than provide flexible support for diverse applications ranging from the Web to IM and VoIP. Third is trust -- users within censored regions will may have little reason to trust naive approaches for censorship circumvention.  And fourth is the ability to bootstrap the process -- if a censor can prevent users from accessing the censorship resistance system, then the censorship resistance system becomes ineffective.  Our goal was to design, build, and widely deploy a censorship resistant peer-to-peer system providing access to popular web sites and Internet services.  We argue that the advent of social networks provides an opportunity to take a fresh look at peer-to-peer solutions for censorship resistance. The focus of this project was to use social trust relations as a foundation for achieving highly secure and blocking-resistant overlays for supporting network services, while also approaching the ease of use, performance, and reliability typically associated with direct communications.  Specifically, we advocate the use of social overlays wherein participants form a peer-to-peer overlay network bootstrapped based on real-world trust relationships.  Participants of the social overlay would be able to directly communicate and share content, without having to expose their actions and without being blocked. A key design choice is to develop the system to operate completely within a web browser, leveraging newly developed technologies that provide support for peer-to-peer communications inside the browser.  Browser-based end-user solutions are easily deployable without requiring significant infrastructural costs.     This research project developed a social-overlay based system that can provide highly resilient, high performance uncensored and anonymous internet communication.  For the broader community of users and the society at large, we hope that our publicly released software can enable unfettered network access to users in censored regions:   information on uProxy is available at http://uproxy.org  downloads      of uProxy are available on the Chrome and Mozilla webstores Satellite      data has been made publicly available Metasync      system has also been publicly released      We aimed to develop a censorship-resistent peer-to-peer platform based on social overlays.  There were several key, interrelated challenges that we had to overcome.  Principal among these were: performance, trustworthiness, and robustness.  First, the system must cope with the availability and performance challenges associated with social network topologies that often suffer from both sparse connectivity and hotspots.  A second challenge was trust: how can users know that their communications are being handled by trusted parties rather than by agents of the controlling region?  Finally, as there is no centralized control, our solution had to robust to threats from adversaries that have infiltrated the system and carried out attacks aimed at compromising the security and availability of the system.  Simply stated, the impact on the discipline is to explore the fundamental strengths and limits of a censorship resistance system built using social overlays.
