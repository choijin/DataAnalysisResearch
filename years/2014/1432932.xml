<AbstractNarration>Washington State University, the University of Montana, the University of Idaho and Montana State University are collaborating to create the Pacific Northwest Alliance: Collaborative Opportunities for Success in Mentoring of Students (PNW-COSMOS). These alliance schools also partner with Salish Kootenai College, Montana Tech of the University of Montana, Northwest Indian College and Heritage University. This project was created in response to the NSF's Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program solicitation (NSF 14-505) for the AGEP-Transformation (AGEP-T) track. The AGEP-T track targets strategic alliances of institutions and organizations to develop, implement, and study innovative evidence-based models and standards for STEM graduate education, postdoctoral training, and academic STEM career preparation that eliminate or mitigate negative factors and promote positive practices for URMs. &lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Pacific Northwest AGEP-T Alliance is to increase the number of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) students who complete STEM graduate programs with specific emphasis on doctoral degrees, by developing, implementing and studying a model of culturally congruent STEM graduate education and academic STEM career preparation.  This project is contributing to foundational knowledge about the recruitment, retention and graduation of AI/AN graduate students in STEM. The emphasis on culturally-relevant and culturally-immersive activities is a unique intervention approach for graduate students and their mentoring faculty in STEM.  PNW-COSMOS has the potential to provide results that may transform the way the field engages and works with URM graduate students in rural environments and in regions of the country where there are AI/AN in STEM. The lessons learned as this project progresses, and the ultimate results from the work, will provide information that will be beneficial to educators, administrators and policymakers, as well as the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The PNW-COSMOS Alliance accomplished the following. An Indigenous Mentoring Program (IMP) was developed for STEM faculty interested in mentoring American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) graduate students. The findings were used to design and implement a 9-module workshop series centered around culturally relevant mentoring practices, which was piloted at the four Alliance institutions in Montana. The 9-module IMP, workshop outcomes and lessons learned were shared, published and adapted by the partner institutions to their particular contexts. The Alliance developed and implemented additional activities, including the Indigenous Knowledge Field Camp (IKFC) faculty mentor-student mentee cultural immersion experience, campus recruitment visits for prospective graduate students, Alliance research and networking summits, summer research opportunities for AI/AN undergraduates, and NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) application workshops. To capture the scope of COSMOS activities and understand their impact and effectiveness, the external evaluator conducted extensive interviews with PNW-COSMOS personnel and participants. The scope and impact are captured in a five-dimensional model that reflects: a) theory of change, b) project management, c) AI/AN student recruitment, d) Indigenous mentoring, and e) institutional support.&nbsp;<br />Project Impact: Since the initiation of the grant, 28 PNW-COSMOS undergraduate students have pursued STEM graduate degrees, either at PNW-COSMOS institutions or elsewhere. Alliance institutions have successfully recruited 70 AI/AN (American Indian/Alaska Native) Master's and PhD students to participate in PNW-COSMOS activities. Five have completed PhD degrees and 20 completed a Master's degree. Twenty-one PhD students and 32 Master's students are currently making progress toward their degrees, and three Master's recipients are pursuing PhDs. To date, 323 faculty, staff, graduate teaching assistants, and administrators at the Montana institutions have participated in the IMP program.&nbsp;<br />Intellectual Merit: PNW-COSMOS has filled a gap in knowledge about how to broaden and strengthen the pathways for AI/AN students to earn STEM graduate degrees. Partnering with Tribal communities and Native-serving undergraduate institutions was key to building trust and long-term relationships. PNW-COSMOS revealed how predominantly white institutions need to become more accessible and empowering for AI/AN students, and how faculty, staff, and administrators can re-envision mentoring and enhance the role of Indigenous knowledge and methodologies in STEM research.&nbsp;<br />The social science research team utilized surveys and case-studies to uncover the types of college environments that are supportive of STEM graduate students across race/ethnicity and citizenship. Findings revealed that the success and well-being of AI/AN and other STEM graduate students depend on the extent to which they perceive their institutions and programs are meeting their needs (environmental fit) and accepting their culture (culturally congruity). Furthermore, building a critical mass of AI/AN STEM professionals/academics requires early identification of students, access to multiple mentors, and prioritization of hiring AI/AN faculty.&nbsp;<br />PNW-COSMOS disseminated results about mentoring AI/AN students in STEM fields and its social science research in peer-reviewed journal articles. In addition, faculty and graduate student researchers presented at numerous conferences, including those organized by Native American professional organizations, on higher education research, student affairs, and graduate enrollment. The Alliance also authored a compendium devoted to sharing PNW-COSMOS outcomes. The five-dimensional model developed by the external evaluator also provides a comprehensive construct for replicating and evaluating similar programs.<br />Broader Impacts: Faculty, staff, and administrators from both STEM and non-STEM disciplines found that participating in the IMP or IKFC, helped them become better mentors, benefitting all their students. In addition, as PNW-COSMOS graduates continue their studies or pursue their professional and academic careers, they carry with them the project ethic: they become advocates for culturally congruent mentorship and inspiring the next generation of AI/AN scholars. Lessons learned inform initiatives at partner institutions focused on culturally responsive education, collaborations between tribal colleges and universities, and faculty mentoring. Team members continue to engage with other AGEP alliances and colleagues at institutions interested in adapting this mentoring program to support their underrepresented STEM graduate students. The Indigenous Mentoring Program Facilitator Guide is a user-friendly document for those interested in creating a mentoring program on their campus: http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1473888.<br />Sustainability: The IMP will continue at 1) the University of Montana through the Faculty Development Office, 2) Montana State University through its Center for Faculty Excellence, 3) Montana Tech where a self-paced course on Indigenous Mentoring is accessible anytime to faculty and staff, 4) Salish Kootenai College where a professional learning community is being developed for faculty and staff to meet regularly to explore ways to better mentor Indigenous STEM undergraduates, and 5) University of Idaho through the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning. The University of Idaho will host the IKFC until 2022, and the Montana institutions are exploring ways to adopt the IKFC model and offer Indigenous Knowledge Field Experiences in collaboration with tribal communities in the State. Washington State University has revamped the Center for Native American Research and Collaboration Affiliates and Associates Program, which offers the IMP and other resources for research, instruction and outreach.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/31/2021<br>      Modified by: Lori&nbsp;M&nbsp;Carris</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent"
