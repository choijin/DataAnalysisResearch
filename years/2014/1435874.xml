<AbstractNarration>PI: Henry, Theodore B.   &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1435874&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture   &lt;br/&gt;Title: Effects of ingestion of manufactured nanoparticles on endogenous microbiota and pathogen resistance in rainbow trout&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to understand changes induced in the gut microbial community and on the host responses by nanoparticles (NPs). The overall hypothesis is that ingestion of nanomaterials, especially those that have anti-microbial properties, will change the microbiome (the community of microorganisms that share the body space) of trout resulting in adverse health outcomes. The investigators plan to investigate the changes in the microbiome resulting from the NP challenges, hypothesizing that these changes would lead to immunosuppression and increased opportunity for pathogen infection. The hypothesis will be tested with a bacterial pathogen challenge. The results of this investigation will provide new insights into the impact of NPs on the gut microbiome, which will have relevance not just for trout, but for humans and other organisms as well, since these fundamental host-microbiome interactions are conserved across all vertebrates. The data obtained from the proposed investigations can also be helpful for both industry and regulators as industry formulates new NPs with lower toxicity or regulators look to reduce exposure of humans and wildlife to NPs. The proposal includes excellent outreach and training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as the involvement of high school students, in research. The research results can potentially guide regulatory agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The model used will be the environmentally relevant and commercially significant rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. The investigators will use high throughput sequencing to understand the changes in the microbiome, specifically, the effects of dietary exposure to NPs will be determined by global genomic sequencing of the microbial communities and quantitative PCR to target specific microbial species. Changes in abundance of the specific microbes will be evaluated among treatments and over time. In the same fish, gene expression profiling will be conducted to identify biomarker genes that respond to alterations in the microbial community composition. A subset of NP treatments will be selected to conduct longer-term exposure in fish that will subsequently be exposed to Y. ruckeri and the outcome of this bacterial challenge will be evaluated.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Manufactured nanoparticles (NPs) have unique properties because of their small size (10,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair), and these properties have become very useful in numerous consumer and industrial products.  An unintended consequence is release of NPs into the environment and potential for negative effects on human and organism health.  Some NPs, for example silver and copper NPs, have antimicrobial properties, are among the most frequently used NPs, and are released into the environment in substantial quantities worldwide.  Ingestion of NPs is an environmentally relevant route of exposure, and NPs with antimicrobial properties may cause changes in the healthy microbial community present in the gut leading to negative effects on organism health.   The objective of this project was to investigate effects of NPs on the microbial communities of juvenile rainbow trout gut and then evaluate whether fish were more susceptible to infection and disease after exposure to a bacterial fish pathogen.  Fish feeds were prepared with silver, copper, and carbon (fullerene C60) NPs, with parallel bulk controls for each NP, and fish were fed in experiments ranging from 14-60 days.  During and at the end of experiments, fish were sampled to assess growth and condition, and tissues were collected to determine toxicology associated with dietary NP exposure and changes in gut microbial communities.    After five weeks of exposure to feeds, some fish were then exposed to a bacterial pathogen (Yersinia ruckeri).  Overall, despite NP concentrations that were considerably higher than likely environmental exposures, there were no NP-related effects on fish growth, condition, blood (haematology), or behaviour.  Fish gut microbial communities were composed of many species of bacteria and there was considerable variation in the communities among individual fish.  The most prominent effects on gut microbiota were observed in fish exposed to a bacterial fish pathogen (Yersinia ruckeri), and this pathogen caused clinical signs of disease and ~30% mortality across all feed treatments.  Clinical signs of disease were not associated with NP (or other feed treatment); however, the proportion of fish infected by the pathogen (i.e., pathogen detected by molecular techniques within fish tissues) was reduced in fish that ingested silver feed (both NP and bulk silver) and also in fish that ingested copper NPs.  It is possible that antimicrobial effects of the silver and copper NP-feed treatments had antimicrobial effects that reduced pathogen infection.  Ongoing analyses of the large data sets obtained from these experiments are focused on changes in gut microbial communities in individual fish over time, and assessment of global changes in expression of genes of the fish intestinal mucosae to determine if subtle effects on intestinal function are evident.  Overall, the analysis of data from this project to date (some analyses are ongoing) provides new information to indicate that the NPs investigated did not cause toxicity in rainbow trout, only minor and inconsistent NP-related alterations in gut microbial communities were evident, and there was not an NP-associated effect on clinical signs of disease in fish after bacterial pathogen exposure.  Significant reduction in pathogen infection found after fish exposure to silver and copper NPs merits further investigation and perhaps has implications on potential effects of dietary NP exposure in other vertebrates.  The concentrations of NPs tested included environmentally relevant levels and amounts that are considerably higher than levels likely to be encountered by fish, and results indicate that risk of negative effects on fish are low from environmental exposure.  Although not a primary project objective, significant effects of pathogen exposure on gut microbial communities should be investigated further in the context of fish pathophysiology within the context rainbow trout aquaculture.
