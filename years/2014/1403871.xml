<AbstractNarration>DNA molecules are building blocks of the genetic code and are detected frequently to diagnose a range of diseases from cancer to infections.  Understanding of how DNA organizes on the surface of the biosensor is important in order to develop better, more sensitive and specific diagnostic assays.  This project will gain such understanding through a combination of theory and experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description:&lt;br/&gt;This project will combine experimental and theoretical efforts to study interactions of DNA helices with gold nanoparticles. Nanoparticles emerge as promising new tools for experimental biology and nanomedicine because of the unusual surface chemistry and effect of shape at the nanoscale on the nanoparticle-DNA interactions.  This collaborative project is designed to fill the existing void of data by combining experimental spectroscopic and biophysical studies with atomistic-level theoretical simulations.  Specific efforts will be applied to systematic investigation of the effects of surface chemistry, DNA sequence, and presence of ions on DNA-nanoparticle interactions and binding.  The experimental studies will provide an essential feedback for the theoretical models. Taken together, these studies will provide fundamental knowledge of DNA-nano-interface thus, enabling further development of nano-biosensors, DNA-based materials, and novel approaches for gene therapy, ultimately, contributing to improving quality of life.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary outcome of our collaborative theoretical and experimental project was to understand the role of molecular interactions and physical forces responsible for packing nucleic acids on surfaces of ligand-protected nanoparticles.   Our initial hypothesis was that electrostatic interactions between DNA or RNA and the surface ligands of Au nanoclusters should play the primary role in stabilizing nucleic acid nanoparticle (NC) complexes.  Because both DNA and RNA possess significant surfaces charges of the negative sign, we have focused on positively charged NPs to promote electrostatic interactions.  By using all atom molecular dynamics simulations we have shown that the complexation indeed depends mostly on the nanoparticle charge and, to a lesser extent, the sequence and the type of the nucleic acid. For cationic nanoparticles electrostatic interactions between the charged ligands and the nucleic acid backbone dominate the binding regardless the magnitude of the charge.  While cationic nanoparticles are being capable of bending and wrapping the double-stranded DNA, their interactions with RNA exhibit a different behavior. We have shown that free volume of nanoparticles ligands controls their ability to bind internally to the RNA?s major groove.   Other outcomes of this project include development of experimental methodology for synthesis of organic ligands and functionalized nanoparticles capable of DNA and RNA binding, the first experimental observation of DNA bending by nanoparticles using biophysical spectroscopic methods, and improving sensitivity and the distance range of biophysical methods to study DNA bending by nanostructures.   Overall, the results provided a clear demonstration that the nanoparticle and particular ligand design are the most critical factors for the interactions of nanoparticles with nucleic acids.
