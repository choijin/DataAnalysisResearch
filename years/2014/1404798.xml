<AbstractNarration>This CNIC project supports a planning visit that will allow the PI, Samantha Wisely, co-PI, John Stepp, and other colleagues from the University of Florida, to meet with new colleagues from the University of Swaziland and Kruger National Park in South Africa to develop a multidisciplinary research project that evaluates the interrelationships between biodiversity, ecosystem functions and human wellbeing. As ecosystems are changing around the globe, especially with expanding land use for agriculture, it is important to understand how rapid changes in land use alter biodiversity and ecosystem functions, and how in turn altered ecosystem functions impact the health and livelihoods of people. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning visit will prepare to test a conceptual model linking the causes and consequences of ecological and sociological interrelationships in ecosystems. The team plans to study links among different components of the system, the dynamics of the feedbacks, and the scales at which the components interact to test a general hypothesis that high biodiversity improves the wellbeing of people. They will perform the planning for research to evaluate the interrelationship of three triads: a) plant diversity, medicinal resources, and human health and nutrition, b) mammal diversity, disease prevalence, and human health, c) pollinator diversity, agricultural productivity, and human nutrition and wealth. The team plans to conduct work across three different countries where they will survey for biodiversity across agro-ecological gradients looking focusing on three components: rodents, pollinators, and vascular plants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will bring together sociologists and ecologists from Africa and the US, including two US graduate students and several African students, to collaborate on a compelling socio-ecological system in a biodiversity hotspot, the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany Biodiversity Hotspot in southern Africa, which is currently in danger of losing its high species diversity and endemic biota due to rapid land conversion to industrialized agriculture. An improved understanding of the relationships among biodiversity, ecosystem function and human wellbeing will impact land use governance and personal and cultural valuations of ecological resources, helping to promote environmental sustainability while the planet prepares to feed a projected 9 billion people by 2050.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Over the next fifty years, expansion of commercial agriculture is projected to have a major impact on the environment worldwide but particularly in developing countries. The resulting biodiversity loss not only threatens species with extinction, but diminishes the livelihoods of people who are reliant on natural resources for their health and well being. There are considerable knowledge gaps in understanding the linkages between biodiversity and human well-being, but future conservation and development efforts must consider them both if we are to sustain people and the environment. We conducted an intensive 5 day research planning workshop in order to catalyze a collaborative endeavor among academic social scientists, ecologists and engineers in the US, Botswana, South Africa and Swaziland. Our geographic focus is one of the world's biodiversity hotspot with many rare and endangered plants and animals known the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany region of southern Africa. The region has a rapidly expanding economy in sugarcane production which is converting native savannas used by the rural poor for a large proportion of their livelihood. This National Science Foundation grant supported six scientists and two graduate students from the University of Florida to organize and participate in the workshop that was held in Magadavane, Swaziland from 14-19 June, 2015. We visited rural households and protected savannas in the region, and we held community discussions and household interviews to assist us in determining the most important research questions that need to be addressed. In collaboration with African colleagues from University of Swaziland, University of Cape Town, and two African conservation organizations, we devised a research plan to understand links between biodiversity and human-wellbeing. We also developed outreach programs designed to encourage community and government planning of natural resource and land use. The two UF graduate students remained in Swaziland and partnered with two University of Swaziland students to collect 10 weeks of pilot data based on questions developed in the workshop.&nbsp; This planning meeting allowed us to establish collaborations with African colleagues, helped train two US graduate students in research design and methodologies, and provided the group with a roadmap for future research. Products of this grant include a research proposal submitted to NSF Coupled Natural and Human Systems Program, a manuscript in preparation on the effects of land use on the biodiversity of mammals, and a white paper on integrating social science and ecology in biodiversity conservation in southern Africa. Broader impacts include empowering local communities to use natural resources in a sustainable manner that facilitates the conservation of biodiversity and elevates human well-being. The USA government spends in excess of $30M per year in economic assistance to southern Africa. This research aims to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of this assistance by working with local and government decision-makers in the region and providing quantitative data to policymakers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2015<br>      Modified by: Samantha&nbsp;M&nbsp;Wisely</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1404798/1404798_10328384_1447960435240_DSCN1580--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1404798/1404798_10328384_1447960435240_DSCN1580--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Works...]]></DRECONTENT>
