<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division is funding Professor Hairong Guan of the University of Cincinnati to design, synthesize and study catalysts using earth-abundant metals, such as nickel and iron.  Such metals are inexpensive and display promise as the basis for the catalysis of chemical processes that are industrially and economically important.  Examples include the conversion of a primary greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, to liquid fuels, the replacement of toxic reagents in pharmaceutical synthesis, and the release of hydrogen from a hydrogen-storage chemicals.   Professor Guan is also developing research-based materials for a laboratory course focusing on catalysis, and providing research opportunities to American Chemical Society Project SEED students as well as to students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, Professor Guan is studying pincer-ligated nickel complexes as catalysts for the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to methanol using dihydrogen and the cyanomethylation of aldimines and epoxides to beta-amino nitriles and gamma-hydroxy nitriles.  Related iron pincer complexes are being developed to catalyze the dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane, which exhibits desirable properties as a chemical hydrogen-storage material.  The mechanistic details of these catalytic processes including the kinetics and thermodynamics of the elemental steps are being studied so that more active and robust catalysts can be designed rationally.  Other broader impacts of the project include the development of a research-based laboratory course and collaborations with a primarily undergraduate institution and local chemical companies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has been focused on using earth-abundant metals such as iron, cobalt, nickel and copper for catalysis.  These metals are attractive as they are inexpensive and more readily available than the precious metals that are widely used today for producing chemicals and drugs.  During the funding period for this award, a number of important catalytic reactions have been developed by the PI?s laboratory.  Notable examples include: (1) the development of a cobalt-based, divergent catalytic system for the hydrogenation of nitriles, (2) the discovery of reaction vessels made of nickel capable of catalyzing alkyne tetramerization, and (3) the design of iron-copper heterobimetallic complexes as effective catalysts for the reduction of aldehydes under water-gas shift reaction conditions.  Several catalytic processes previously developed by the PI?s laboratory have also been improved during this funding period.  Examples include catalytic reduction of CO2to methanol derivatives and cross-coupling reactions. The mechanistic details uncovered and the novel ligands/complexes developed have laid the groundwork for the design of new catalysts based on earth-abundant metals.   The research activities have proven an effective training and outreach tool by involving ten undergraduate students including one NSF-REU student, one exchange student from the University of Bordeaux,and two visiting students from Rochester Institute of Technology, and then graduate students.  To further integrate research into undergraduate training, an honors inorganic laboratory course with an open-ended research project format has been further developed at the University of Cincinnati.  The PI has also used research to establish close ties with Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble Company.  In addition to graduate student support, such relationships have provided the University of Cincinnati students with invaluable technical training and career guidance.
