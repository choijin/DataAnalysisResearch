<AbstractNarration>To understand how natural populations of plants and animals will respond to climate change, one needs to investigate, not just the effects of climate on the mean rates of birth and death in a population, but also whether effects differ between important subgroups within a population, such as males and females.  Previous work in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado by the researchers on this project has revealed that the ratio of males to females changes greatly in response to climate in the widespread plant, edible valerian or Valeriana edulis: warmer or drier conditions favor males. This project will build on that discovery and investigate the mechanisms by which climate affects males differently from females.  The project will also test how the differential effects of climate on males and females affect the growth of whole populations.  For example, if females become very rare, birth rates may fail to match death rates, causing a population to decline. Results will yield improved tools for understanding how climate change may imbalance natural populations and diminish biodiversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will have four main broader impacts. First, the investigators will engage the local community in data collection. Volunteer citizen scientists will contribute data while gaining an appreciation for how ecological data can be used to address local and global challenges. Second, the data collected will be integrated into an interactive and publicly available online learning module aimed at undergraduate students. Third, this work will broaden the research training of a doctoral student and provide a research experience for undergraduates. Finally, the work increase societal capacity to manage economically and ecologically important species.</AbstractNarration>

Although the potential for sex-specific responses to climate change is strong, this study is one of the first to have focused directly on this problem.     The plant Valeriana edulis has offered unique opportunities to study the causes and consequences of sex-specific response to climate change. Historic data from the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (Gunnison County, CO) document sex ratios from multiple populations in the 1970?s. Modern re-surveys in turn show that climate change since has caused V. edulis populations to increase in male frequency.     This study documented the consequences of climate-induced changes in population sex ratio for the performance of this plant.  Specifically, it identified the relationship between sex ratio and fertility, a parameter known as the "mating function". Values for mating functions have been assumed (i.e., unmeasured) in the past, and this work collected the data needed to measure this parameter in the field. We in turn used demographic models to link these data on V. edulis mating function to the observed changes in population sex ratio.     We found that aridification over the past 40 years has shifted sex ratios upslope at 175 m/decade, a pace that will increase male frequency by 15-20% by the year 2100 (in relation to 1970?s). This increase in male frequency reduces the pollen limitation of female fitness and alters plant-dependent arthropod communities. Accordingly, climate change is driving previously unrecognized changes in sex ratios that govern fundamental evolutionary and ecological dynamics in this plant species.    This project makes a significant contribution to the study of ecological responses to climate change.  This work demonstrates how variation in traits within a species can lead to heterogeneous responses to climate change, and that this heterogeneity in turn can scale up with consequences for how whole populations and species respond.    This project also provided significant broader impacts.  It provided training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students.
