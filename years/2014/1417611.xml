<AbstractNarration>Title: Land Bridges, Ice-Free Corridors, and Biome Shifts: Impacts on the Evolution and Extinction of Horses in Ice-Age Beringia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study asks: How important was connectivity among populations of large arctic mammal species for maintaining genetic diversity, influencing evolutionary change, and mitigating extinction risk? What types of barriers affected this connectivity, and how permeable were these barriers to gene flow? The PIs will study how caballine horses, that inhabited ice-age Beringia (the biogeographic connector between Asia and North America), were affected by changes involving three different biogeographic barriers/corridors (1. the Bering Strait/Bering Land Bridge, which controlled dispersal and gene flow between Eurasia and Alaska; 2. the Ice-Free Corridor, which controlled gene flow between the Yukon and the Lower 48 States; and 3. biome shifts that periodically disrupted the spatial continuity of the Mammoth-Steppe, the unique ecosystem that stretched from France to the Yukon during the ice ages) during the last 30,000 years of the ice age. This study will evaluate the effects that each of these putative barriers to gene flow had on the abundance, distribution, and evolutionary trajectories of ice-age horses in the Arctic using new paleogenomic and paleoenvironmental data. The results will provide new insights into the roles played by environmental change and population fragmentation in determining extinction risk, and help predict how ongoing environmental changes will affect arctic ecosystems. This project will lead to advances in the rapidly developing field of paleogenetics and further the brand-new discipline of paleogenomic ecology. The Broader Impacts plan focuses on: a) research and professional development opportunities for graduate students, b) new training opportunities for undergraduate students who aspire to become STEM high school teachers, c) outreach to Native communities in rural Alaska, and d) outreach to K-12 students in Fairbanks, AK. At the end of each summer, the pre-service teachers, graduate students, and PIs will produce an inquiry activity module for grades 9-12 to be shared with local schools. Finally, the PIs will engage in both professional and public discourse, and use the results in media productions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The grazing animals now inhabiting the Arctic are a mere shadow of what lived there during the last Ice Age. Until 10,000 years ago, large numbers of woolly mammoth, steppe bison, and horses roamed northern Alaska. These megafaunal species were preyed upon by tundra lions and giant bears. For unknown reasons, these giant ice-age species became extinct as climate warmed and ice sheets melted. For the past 150 years, scientists have argued about the causes of this great extinction event. The goal of our NSF-funded project was to figure out why megafauna like mammoth, bison, and horse became extinct on Alaska?s North Slope, a place where frozen ground and slow-moving rivers have permitted the exceptional preservation of animal bones. The North Slope is also of particular interest because humans have never been numerous in this region, and therefore can be largely disregarded as an extinction cause. We were especially interested in the ice-age horses because the evolutionary history of horses is comparatively well-known. Part of our field work consisted of intensively collecting bones belonging to extinct megafauna. Back in the laboratory, we identified each bone to species and sampled them for radiocarbon dating. Samples of the horse bones were sent for analysis in Dr. Shapiro?s laboratory at the University of California. Our work has resulted in the largest, most closely dated collection of megafauna bones from any one area of the world. Analysis of the temporal patterns in the occurrence of megafaunal species reveals that species like horse, bison, and mammoth occupied the ice-age Arctic episodically. During the coldest, driest periods of the ice age, megafauna were sparse in Arctic Alaska. But for brief (1-2,000 year) periods when climate was becoming warmer and more moist, their populations exploded across the North Slope. The boom and bust nature of the ice-age Arctic finally offers a solution to the long-running controversy between paleobotanists, who insist the Arctic was cold and dry during the ice age, and paleontologists, who insist that the Arctic must have been relatively warm and moist in order to support large, grazing megafauna. It turns out that both sides are right ? during the ice age, cold, dry, inhospitable conditions alternated with warmer, wetter, more-megafauna-friendly conditions. Another part of our field work consisted of reconstructing the paleoenvironments experienced by North Slope megafauna during the final millennia of their existence. To accomplish this, we sampled river bluffs containing long records of deposition by air-borne dust (loess) and sand dunes. Our key stratigraphic section is located along the Titaluk River at what was once the edge of a dune field that covered hundreds of square miles. After weeks of digging, we were able to expose some 180 vertical feet of sand, silt, and peat. By radiocarbon dating plants rooted in the layers of sediment, we were able to reconstruct changing vegetation cover, along with changing rates of sediment deposition and organic carbon sequestration. Our results show that the landscape of northern Alaska experienced repeated, sweeping changes every 1-2000 years during the last 30,000 years of the ice age. Sand dunes advanced and retreated, to be replaced by organic soils, which were then buried under accumulating loess. We concluded that Arctic habitats were much more changeable during the ice age than they have been during the last 11,000 years of the present interglacial, warm period. These finding motivated us to write a new synthesis of the causes of megafaunal extinctions worldwide and to propose a new theory about what caused them. The idea is simple: Large-bodied species have a big advantage during periods of Earth history when climate keeps changing and ecosystems are in flux. When rapid changes in climate are causing plant communities to rapidly shift their locations, large animals (picture an elephant) have an easier time tracking their food resources than does a small animal like a mouse. For this reason, the ice age with its continually changing climate favored megafaunal species, while the present interglacial ? whose climate has remained remarkable stable in many regions for the last 11,000 years ? tends to favor smaller animal species and to disfavor megafaunal ones. &nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/27/2020<br>      Modified by: Daniel&nbsp;H&nbsp;Mann</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
