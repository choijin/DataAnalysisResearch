<AbstractNarration>In this project Dr. Ward and Mr. Murillo will investigate the spatio-temporal movements of birds within and between their territories and their extra-pair interactions.  The researchers will study the strategies that birds use to find and select extra-pair mates, how often females produce young that are not sired by their pair-mates, the influence of male quality on extra-pair mating and the fitness consequences of extra-pair mating. This information will contribute to the development of effective habitat and landscape management practices for protecting shrubland birds, like the Field Sparrows in this study. This study takes advantage of an automated tracking system allowing the researchers to follow the movements of birds.  It is often thought that because territorial birds compete for nest sites, food, mates, and other resources they should try to space themselves as far apart possible. This research tests an alternative hypothesis that birds (both males and females) benefit from being near one another. Therefore when trying to conserve this and other species the best approach may be to manage large areas that can accommodate many nesting individuals. In addition, Mr. Murillo, a Latino researcher, will develop "Go Wild Field Day" at a local nature preserve to encourage Latinos from high schools in the Champaign area to choose careers in science. During the field day, students and teachers will learn a range of field techniques for studying animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paternity studies revolutionized our view of avian mating and reproductive systems, yet, very little research has focused on understanding the behavioral mechanisms used by males and females to acquire extra-pair matings, how these behaviors vary among individuals and over time, and the relative contribution of such behaviors to an individual's overall reproductive performance.  The relative use of each active search and passive mating sit and wait tactics may depend on numerous factors, such as sex, age, and individual quality. Dr. Ward and Mr. Murillo will use a novel technology, automated radio telemetry, to monitor activity and extraterritorial forays in male and female Field Sparrows (Spizella pussilla) over larger areas, long periods of time and at night. The researchers will also examine the behavioral and morphological correlates of birds conducting these forays.  They will test the hypothesis that individual variation in foray behavior appears to be linked to male individual quality (based on song performance and body condition).  Using previously collected blood samples of offspring, the researchers propose to investigate the influence of mate and extra-pair mate quality and cuckoldry on male and female foray behavior. The data collected from this research will be archived within movebank (https://www.movebank.org/); a free, online data repository of animal tracking data hosted by Max Planck Institute for Ornithology.  The movement/activity, reproductive and acoustic data on Field Sparrows will also be archived at the University of Illinois' IDEALs (Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship) and in Dr. Ward's laboratory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We investigated extra-territorial forays (leaving one's territory to enter another's territory) and it relationship to extra-pair paternity.  Over the last couple decades many studies have documented that birds are often not monogamous, but rather within a female's nest, there is a good chance that at least one egg was not sired by her social mate. For this to happen individuals must be moving into other's territories.  Using Field Sparrows (a common bird throughout eastern North America) we used automated radio telemetry and genetic tools to investigate which sex, when, and why individuals were engaging in extra-territorial forays and how these forays correlated with overall extra-pair paternity.      We found that both males and females were engaging in large numbers of extra-territorial forays both day and night.  These forays, however were not correlated with extra-pair paternity. It appears that females are controlling with whom and when they engage in extra-pair copulations. In all cases in which data were available, it appears that the females are entering into another female's territory to copulate with a male who is not her social mate.  Another interesting finding is that females are not more likely to engage in extra-pair copulations with larger, older, or what we think of as "higher quality" males. The extra-pair sires were generally males that were either neighbors in the current year, had been a neighbor the previous year, or had been their social mate in the previous year. It appears that familiarity is the primary factor governing with whom females mated. We suggest that this familiarity which may develop over several years results in a social neighborhood where cooperative nest defense and sharing of resources on oneÆs territory may benefit both males and females within these neighborhoods.     This study has increased our understanding of the foraying behavior of birds and how females choose extra-pair sires.  Beyond the information gained on the behavior of birds, this study also highlights the needs to conserve and restore large tracts of habitat.  The Field Sparrow uses shrubland habitat and in locations with limited habitat a pair or two can be found in isolated patches.  The foraying behavior and extra-pair paternity data highlight how individuals are moving within habitats and potentially forming these social neighborhoods.  Without sufficient habitat it is unlikely these neighborhoods will form and if they do individuals will likely be using much time and energy to move between widely dispersed habitats.
