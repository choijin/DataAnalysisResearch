<AbstractNarration>This award will provide participant support for younger scientists to participate in Neutrino 2014, the XXVI International Conference on Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics to be held on June 2-7, 2014 in Boston, MA. Topics of discussion will be the new neutrino experiments, new experimental results and the new understanding of them. The Conference will emphasize all sub-fields of neutrino physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award has a particular focus on early career scientists and graduate students. The Conference is important in the education of such young scientists not only because of the presentations they listen to, but also because during the Conference they directly communicate with the leading neutrino researchers from around the world who are present at this International Conference. In addition, the international character of the Conference fosters the global interaction of the young scientists in this fundamentally global research endeavor. Furthermore, there will a week-long exhibit at the Boston Museum of Science which will include spectacular event displays, actual hardware and talks by leading neutrino physicists, intended for a general audience.</AbstractNarration>
