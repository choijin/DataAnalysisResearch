<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. Howard University will implement a Targeted Infusion Project entitled:  Integrating Innovation in Engineering Design.  The goal of the project is to strengthen engineering education by integrating innovation into the undergraduate engineering curriculum. This is accomplished by including design thinking in the introductory engineering course and through the establishment of a laboratory space where students will actively engage in innovation. The course will move from a stimulation model of instruction to authentic involvement in the learning experience. The shift to authentic involvement experiences, using design thinking, is an attempt to mitigate current attrition trends. Project efforts will enhance the quality of the undergraduate engineering experience, promote positive retention and achievement results, and broaden the participation of innovative engineers in the nation's workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innovative engineering design places focus on the cognitive processes surrounding creativity and the environmental contexts that optimize student engagement.  Redesign of the engineering course curriculum will incorporate a design thinking framework of designing, ideating, prototyping, and testing; as well as the establishment of an innovation space in which students can actively engage in innovation through design projects. Fundamental components of design thinking that distinguish it from conventional engineering design concepts are interdisciplinary collaboration, imagination, and questioning. The innovation space will be open and flexible so as to facilitate small group work, classroom-style instruction, and auditorium-style presentations and seminars that can be webcast out or in from global locations.  The project's objectives will be accomplished by engaging faculty, industry, and university partners as mentors and as facilitators of workshops in the newly-created innovation space. This project seeks to equip all engineering students at Howard University, most of whom are from groups severely underrepresented in engineering, with the skills and opportunities needed to become innovative engineers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Preparing engineering students to be creative, innovative and entrepreneurial has emerged as an important and vital component of engineering education. The Targeted Infusion Project, entitled Integrating Innovation (I2) in Engineering Design at Howard University,created innovation spaces in which students can actively engage in innovative and creative work using the design thinking framework of empathizing, designing, ideating, prototyping, and testing. The students who utilize these Studios are learning by doing and are better prepared to address the engineering challenges of the future.  These newly-created makerspaces, the Digital Studio and the Innovation Studio, are housed in the Downing Engineering building and the Interdisciplinary Research Building, respectively.  The Studios are equipped with state-of-the-art equipment including a Makerbot Replicator 3D printer, 3 Afinia 3D printers, a Stratasys Uprint 3D printer, two Laser Cutters, two Vinyl Cutters, Stratasys Objet 260, a CNC mill, Speed of Thought materials and a variety of common tools for construction.  The Studios support several engineering courses including Introduction to Engineering, Computer Aided Design, Introduction to Mechanical Engineering, Senior Project, and Manufacturing Processes Laboratory. Students also use the Studios in support of their extra-curricular activities and the undergraduate research projects across the College.   Curricular Activities   The creation of the Digital Studio and the Innovation Studio provided opportunities to enhance the curricular content of several courses and to introduce modern design techniques into the engineering curriculum and co-curriculum activities.  Students from first-year to seniors and precollege students use the Studios to innovate, create and learn by doing. Below we briefly highlight some courses that actively utilize these innovation spaces.  Introduction to Engineering   The Introduction to Engineering course serves as the core introductory course for all first-year engineering students. The course design promotes the development of students' self-efficacy, their non-technical skills and the promotion of their continued interest in pursuing an engineering career. The creation of the Studios prompted the redesign of the course content. It now features modules on design thinking and innovation and a required innovation project that encompasses about 40% of the course content. The project and other design activities allow the students the opportunity to innovate and make.   Notably, the end of the course survey, revealed that ninety-three percent (93%) of students thought that engineering was a creative and interesting field.  This finding supports the idea that increasing the opportunity for students to make and create helps to maintain and enhance their interest in engineering.   Introduction to Computer Aided Design  The Introduction to Computer Aided Design course, required of all first-year mechanical engineering students and serves as an elective for others, utilizes the Studios to support the course content. Working with state-of-the-art 3D printers, aids in the students' development of CAD skills, a much-needed skill in engineering design. These first-year students are prepared to use these skills in their advanced courses.  Manufacturing Processes Laboratory   The sophomore level Manufacturing Processes Laboratory exposes students to traditional manufacturing processes including milling, turning, and drilling.  The Studios give students access to state-of-the-art digital manufacturing processes where 3D printing, CNC milling, and laser cutting are used.   Senior Project  This senior level capstone course is a culmination of the students? training to become engineers. In this course, they demonstrate the skill sets learned throughout their engineering education and incorporate that knowledge into a major design project. Students work in the Studios to create 3D printed prototypes of their designs to enhance their presentation of their results.   Extra-curricular Activities:  CAM Summer Enrichment Program  Students beyond Howard University have opportunities to learn in the Innovation Studio and the Digital Studio. Howard offers a CAM summer enrichment program for pre-college school students annually. This two-week camp provides a design immersion experience with a curriculum that exposes children from elementary school through early high school to both the technical and entrepreneurial aspects of engineering. The campers and interns have access to state-of-the-art additive manufacturing tools including the Makerbot Replicator+, Afinia H480 3D Printer, and Stratasys Dimension 1200es 3D printer.  The camp also trains recent college-bound high school graduates who serve as interns while learning computer-aided design software and the use of the manufacturing tools. Howard has trained several interns from other institutions, primarily HBCUs, who return to their home campuses to train others. We share the creative use of the innovation Studios and the curriculum reforms that have enhanced our students? learning and sustained their interest in engineering. We anticipate that other campuses will build on our success.          Last Modified: 04/26/2019       Submitted by: Lorraine N Fleming]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
