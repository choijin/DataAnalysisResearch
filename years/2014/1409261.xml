<AbstractNarration>In a diverse range of application areas--including astronomical&lt;br/&gt;imaging, microscopy, wireless communications, radar, sonar, and&lt;br/&gt;many others--one must confront the problem of estimating or&lt;br/&gt;extracting information from a signal that is governed by a small&lt;br/&gt;number of unknown (continuous-valued) parameters. Customized to&lt;br/&gt;each of these applications, unique methods for handling these&lt;br/&gt;unknown parameters have been proposed in the past. This research&lt;br/&gt;involves the development of a unified framework for addressing&lt;br/&gt;problems in all of these areas systematically, efficiently, with&lt;br/&gt;awareness of the fundamental limits, and with provable accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two main components of this framework. The first&lt;br/&gt;component involves the development of models where the signals of&lt;br/&gt;interest lie within or close to a subspace or a union of subspaces.&lt;br/&gt;In the case where the underlying parameters for the signal are&lt;br/&gt;continuous-valued, this is a challenging task. Rather than attempt&lt;br/&gt;to simply discredit these problems (a program potentially fraught&lt;br/&gt;with difficulty), this research involves the development of finite&lt;br/&gt;approximations for a locally infinite range of subspaces using&lt;br/&gt;efficient local subspace fits whose dimensions match the effective&lt;br/&gt;number of local degrees of freedom. The second component of this&lt;br/&gt;framework consists of techniques for identifying the range of&lt;br/&gt;subspaces responsible for generating a signal from a set of&lt;br/&gt;discrete observations, confronting difficulties posed by the&lt;br/&gt;coherence, by the continuous nature of the parameter space, and by&lt;br/&gt;the fact that some signals may be synthesized from a narrow (but&lt;br/&gt;continuously-indexed and therefore infinite) range of subspaces.&lt;br/&gt;These components combine to enable the efficient acquisition,&lt;br/&gt;processing, and estimation of signals arising from the&lt;br/&gt;parameterized subspaces model.</AbstractNarration>
