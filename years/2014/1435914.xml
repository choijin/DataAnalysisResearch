<AbstractNarration>Global companies that produce a variety of goods (ranging from consumer products (such as items in health, personal and beauty care, food and beverages), pharmaceuticals, chemicals and electronics) are facing a triple threat: (1) increasing variety of products for an increasingly impatient and discriminating consumer base,  (2) shorter life cycles due to increasing speed of innovation and (3) shrinking profit margins due to intense competition from new on-line competitors.  The ability to plan for (and stock appropriately) the thousands of items across hundreds of locations has become an increasing critical aspect of the business, both to capture revenues (by not missing sales due to shortage of inventory) as well as to avoid costs of unsold material (including the costs on the environment). Unlike in the past where sufficient amount of data was available, and the planning horizons were more stable, today these decisions need to be made with low number of historical data  (albeit with complex interactions across  large number of products, locations  and time) on a more frequent basis. This research project will yield new methods to help these companies by bringing to bear previously unavailable methods developed from, and successfully applied in other areas of applied mathematics, statistics and engineering. The investigators have worked closely with several companies and have representative data on which they can test the performance of the new methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effective management of inventories in today's complex data environment of highly competitive global supply chains (fighting to delight impatient customers with a dazzling array of products, excellent service levels and low prices) is critical for business success across a variety of industries.  Competing on product availability has become a key strategic weapon. This requires new data-driven methods rather than approaches that rely on distributional assumptions (which are the mainstay in current practice). There are five aspects that make the data complex. First, having a limited amount of purchase history makes it difficult to have a complete picture of the already uncertain consumer; thus, the parameter uncertainty in the model has to be accounted for, in addition to data uncertainty. Second, items are bought in sets, or act as substitutes, and so a tractable multi-variate model is needed that can be built with limited amount of data. Third, there are temporal aspects of purchase behavior, with auto-correlations and lags, due to consumer trends. Fourth, not every item is bought in every period, nor are they bought in fixed sums; this sporadic (intermittent) demand modeling is crucial as well, in addition to correlations between the time between purchases and purchase quantities. Finally, due to seasonality and life cycle phases, the purchase behavior is non-stationary. The investigators will use a framework that accounts for parameter uncertainty, a multi-variate representation that is at once sparse and general, and develop fast algorithms starting from available limited data by making the least amount of assumptions on the data generation process. Prior work was very successful in dealing with the single-product, limited history situation with no intermittent demand, and early testing shows very good performance with intermittent data. Beyond research, the investigators also plan to provide tools for educators so that these can be made part of the next generation of teaching tools for senior undergraduates and Masters students (including technical MBAs).</AbstractNarration>
