<AbstractNarration>The PI proposes to work collaboratively with a scientist, in a continuation of a long-term publishing collaboration by the two, to produce an illustrated book that will combine popular art and science in an exploration of similarities between volcanic features in Antarctica, specifically those in and around Mt. Erebus, with similar features on other planets in our solar system, including Jupiter's moon, Europa, and Saturn's moon Enceladus. The work will draw parallels between the disparate landscapes to draw the reader into an understanding of Antarctica's unique features as well as encouraging an appreciation of the Earth as a part of a larger planetary system.</AbstractNarration>

Grantees Michael Carroll and Rosaly Lopes arrived at the summit of the volcano on December 23, after spending two nights on Fang Glacier for acclimitization. P.I.

They first ventured into several caverns - which build beneath the towers - with the guidance of their assigned mountaineer, Evan Miller. Miller helped the team enter Hut and Helo caves. But the focus of the project was the towers that build above them. These towers form over time as hot air issues from Erebus through the ice on the surface. Although conditions on the ice moons of the outer solar system differ dramatically from those on Earth, their "cryovolcanic" (super-cold) eruptions may create similar surface formations over time. Our study culminated in various comparisons of these elements on Erebus and on Enceladus, specifically.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some of the Erebus ice pillars rose as tall as a five-story building.

Many rose in lobes and blades of translucent ice, sunlight flashing along sharp edges sculpted by Antarctica&rsquo;s relentless winds. Curved vents crowned many of the towers, surrounded by warped lips of frozen water. Others stood erect or corkscrewed to one side, displaying whimsical shapes.</p> <p>&nbsp;Just how similar might the Erebus formations be to geyser vents in the rugged canyons of Enceladus? The geysers of the little ice moon erupt as multiple jets of icy material, rising hundreds of miles above the frosted surface. They emanate from a series of canyons and ridges which border a flat region in the southern hemisphere.

When viewing Earth formations that may be analogous to sites on other worlds, researchers must be careful. There are significant differences between conditions on Enceladus and Erebus. One obvious dissimilarity is air pressure. The air at the Earth&rsquo;s poles is thinner than that at lower latitudes (closer to the equator). The air pressure at the 12,500-foot Erebus summit is equivalent to a 14,000 foot high peak in Colorado. But the air pressure on Enceladus is essentially zero. How will cryovolcanic structures build and erode in the vacuum of near-Saturnian space? Some of the geyser vents appear to be linear, but others are focused, and may be pinched off by structures more like conventional cones, or perhaps even the pillars on Erebus' Tower Ridge.
