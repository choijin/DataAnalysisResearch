<AbstractNarration>Geospatial technologies are rapidly becoming a key part of many disciplines from energy distribution fields locating downed power lines to agriculture in optimized fertilizer placement on crop plots. Early exposure to career options increases the numbers of women and minorities in these key fields. The goal of this project is to increase the pipeline of technicians toward careers which are served by Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) technologies through professional development and outreach to educators.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is providing geospatial professional development training to Career and Technical Education (CTE) and high school (HS) educators.  As part of this training, MTI has provided curriculum and teaching kits so the educators can further provide the training to high school age students. These exercises include activities that are actual examples of current career opportunities from a variety of fields such as agriculture and energy distribution. This project is following plans that are similar to a national trend in geospatial professional development trainings and is backed by well-trained instructors. This project is Stage 1 of a 2 stage plan. It is the research and framework for larger scale dual credit curriculum development that encompasses established high school and CTE standards.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      In 2016, Mitchell Technical Institute (MTI) was awarded a three-year, $200,000 grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Advanced Technological Education (ATE) grant program.  The goal of this project was to increase the pipeline of technicians for careers which are served by Geospatial Technologies (GST) technologies.       Geospatial technologies (GST) have an ever-increasing presence in today's industries requiring workers to understand the operation and advantages of GST.  To increase the pipeline for student interest in geospatial studies, Mitchell Technical Institute (MTI) created curriculum and training for K-12 educators to implement GST into the classroom.       During the summers of 2017 and 2018, MTI provided four, four-day workshops with a total of 82 K-12 teachers participating.  The actual number of teachers participating in the project surpassed the targeted number of participants as MTI had anticipated serving a total of 75 teachers in the four summer workshops.  These 82 participants came from 45 different school districts within South Dakota.        These teachers learned the basic operations and theory behind Global Position Systems (GPS), Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and unmanned aerial system (UAS), commonly known as drones. The educators were provided curriculum and ideas to implement GST into STEM and other disciplines upon return to their own classrooms.   Along with providing resources, MTI saw a need to help teachers and schools attain geospatial technology, so each attendee received a GPS-enabled tablet and training during the workshop.  Additional workshop resources, training materials, and curriculum were also made available for download.         Of the 82 workshop participants, 46 completed surveys indicating their implementation of the curriculum kits in their classrooms to meet designated content standards related to GST.  A total of 791 students participated in these classroom GST activities.  Fifty-two percent of the implementations were in CTE classrooms.  Geography and science classrooms composed 29% of the implementations and 2-4% of implementations occurring in Art, English and Math classes.       Feedback from the instructors indicated that 94% plan to incorporate the kit again. Instructors felt the curriculum activities were engaging because of the challenge, collaboration, and high interest.   Instructors utilized the material to make connections to their curriculum or community.  Some examples include:  -          One teacher used a map to locate points with pictures of Ash trees, hoping to help monitor the community for first signs of the invasive Emerald Ash Bore species.  -          Another teacher used a basic lesson on using longitude and latitude to locate sculptures around the world.  Follow up plans include implementing drones and GPS into a photo curriculum.  -          7th Grade and 9th Grade students will collaborate and utilize the GPS planning tool, Collector, to gather information by plotting landmarks and taking photographs to create a story map to promote their town.       A no-cost extension to the grant was approved by NSF in March 2019 and extended the project through March 2020.  The final year focused on continued outreach activities to support GST Curriculum including a drone check-out system for participating teachers https://www.mitchelltech.edu/gps4k12.  This new program allows schools to check out a drone for a set time, as well as to receive additional training and resources.         As an NSF ATE Grantee, MTI was invited to participate in the 2020 STEM For All Video Showcase.  A three-minute video was produced and made available to the public through the Showcase from May 5-12, 2020.  During the seven days of this online event, the Principal Investigator responded to questions and discussion related to the video and project.  The video is available at https://videohall.com/p/1750  Intellectual Merit.  The project took a comprehensive approach to stimulating interest and increasing knowledge about geospatial-supported career opportunities to further help meet workforce demands. MTI demonstrated they increased student learning by giving educators training and hands-on curriculum about the latest geospatial technologies that they were able to bring to their classroom.      Broader Impact.  Geospatial technologies are rapidly becoming a key part of many disciplines from energy distribution fields locating downed power lines to agriculture in optimized fertilizer placement on a crop-plots. This project increased instructional capacity at MTI and other schools as project faculty and workshop participants were exposed to new technology, training, industry use, and new career options supported by GST.  The workshop educators have returned to their own school and have made the curriculum part of their science, math, or other programs. Early exposure to career options will increase the numbers of women and minorities in these key fields.      MTI further demonstrated our expanded capacity in the field of GST as through the completion of an articulation agreement in May 2019 between MTI and South Dakota State University for Precision Agriculture https://www.sdstate.edu/sites/default/files/file-archive/2020-04/MTI%20to%20SDSU%20Precision%20Ag%20Program%20to%20Program%20Articulation%20Agreement.pdf      Although the grant period has ended for this project, it will continue to have a positive impact on South Dakota teachers, students, and industry for years to come.
