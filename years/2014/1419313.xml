<AbstractNarration>This proposal will develop an educational link between the Yakama Nation and the University of Washington at Bothell to enhance Cybersecurity education for Native students using virtual laboratories. The laboratories will use scenarios to provide hands-on experience in the practical aspects of Cybersecurity. The project will use a new approach to Cybersecurity education that focuses on established success indicators for Native students. The project will focus on an educational design that appeals to the students in areas that are defined as key indicators of academic success. It will enhance students' experiences in these key indicative areas and will develop an architecture and software that can be utilized by other educational organizations to share resources via a virtual laboratory. The expected outcome of this project is a program consisting of two courses that can be taught at any level, but are focused on middle and high school students. These courses will utilize the Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes taxonomy developed by John Biggs to approach the material and validate the educational progress of the students. The project will provide a community-building and educational experience that will engage a diverse set of students and teachers focusing on the opportunity for success for student groups that have traditionally poor success rates in higher education. The Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program funds proposals that address Cybersecurity from a Trustworthy Computing Systems perspective; a Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences perspective; and proposals focusing entirely on Cybersecurity Education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will reach groups of students that have not had success in traditional higher education programs and will help to establish a community between existing students and future students from these groups. The courses and software developed in this project will be able to be reused for other Native student communities that want to establish virtual laboratories, regardless of their particular cultural backgrounds. This proposal will develop a model for Cybersecurity education that can be used to provide high quality and practical education at a low cost to Native students and is designed to encourage them to continue their education pathways.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes. The purpose of this project was to develop software to support the teaching of cyber security concepts in schools where there is a lack of teachers trained in cyber security and a lack of infrastructure to deploy virtual laboratories for hands on training.  This project funded two masters students and an undergraduate to conduct research and development tasks.  There are two main outcomes from this project.  The observable outcome of this project is the development of software that enables a non-expert with no experience in deploying virtual systems to create and deploy virtual laboratories in a variety of virtual machine platforms.  The qualitative outcome is a new relationship between the Yakama Nation Tribal School (YNTS) and the University of Washington (UW).  Descriptions of the software platform and lessons learned from the exchange of teachers and students have been published or are currently in preparation.  Likewise, the software is currently being tested and will be freely released with an open source license.  Intellectual Merit.  Our work produced a software platform for building and deploying virtual laboratories with a design goal of being easy to use for non-experts.  The platform includes a GUI for building and deploying a virtual lab along with monitoring software that allows for automated or manual monitoring of student progress in each scenario.  The system is extensible so that it is not tied to a specific virtual machine technology and can run on technology such as VMWare and EC2.  Broader Impacts.  Many colleges and high schools do not have personnel with the training to design or deploy cyber security laboratories.  Our work helps abstract away the technical challenges and provides greater opportunities to more students to receive hands-on training in cyber security.
