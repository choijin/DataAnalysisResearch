<AbstractNarration>Assessment, design, and monitoring of human activities involving reservoirs and aquifers in the Earth's subsurface require large-scale computer simulation of flow and transport processes over long time periods. Such simulations are used to guide scientists and engineers regarding, e.g., petroleum production, groundwater management, and secure storage of wastes such as carbon dioxide and nuclear contaminants. Computer simulation of the subsurface environment is especially important because it is largely inaccessible to direct observation and therefore also difficult or impossible to rectify human failures. The project involves fundamental research and education on immiscible, two-phase subsurface flow.  This project has the potential for significantly greater fidelity simulations by properly accounting for the nonlinearly coupled behavior of the physical processes embodied in the governing equations, and the numerical algorithms should work well on modern supercomputers.  Moreover, many models of scientific and engineering interest consist of similar nonlinearly coupled flow and transport systems, and so general progress here is likely to support efforts more broadly.  The project will fund the research of two STEM Ph.D. graduate students and involve at least two undergraduate students.  They will work in the Center for Subsurface Modeling of the Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences, which provides an interdisciplinary environment mixing expertise in mathematics, computational science, petroleum engineering, and geological science.  The students will be prepared for employment opportunities in academia, government laboratories, and industry. External collaborations will enhance the impact of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves fundamental research on and development of new algorithms for nonlinear, coupled systems of partial differential equations with algebraic constraints. The target system to be addressed is immiscible, two-phase subsurface flow, which is used for numerical simulation of the movement of underground fluids.  The project emphasizes the highly nonlinear physical processes of flow and transport, and how they influence each other. The objectives of the project are: (1) Improved numerical algorithms of mixed type for approximation of nonlinear flow within a multi-scale, heterogeneous porous medium when coupled to a transport model; (2) Development of Eulerian-Lagrangian Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory numerical algorithms for multi-dimensional, nonlinear transport when coupled to a nonlinear flow model; (3) Demonstration of the effectiveness of the algorithms in specific applications such as petroleum production, groundwater management, and carbon sequestration; and (4) Education and training of two graduate and two undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary setting. The project is expected to result in significantly better numerical approximations of subsurface flow and transport, even over very long time periods.  Project success will be seen by the development of numerical algorithms that preserve mass locally, produce little to no overshoots or undershoots, exhibit low levels of numerical diffusion, and are of high order and accurate on coarse computational meshes.  They will require a significantly relaxed CFL time-step restriction for stability.  Most importantly, the methods will be shown to work well for the nonlinearly coupled system, in that the two systems will complement each other in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ INTELLECTUAL MERITS  Significant progress was made on the underlying algorithms needed for successful computational simulation of underground fluid flow and transport.  Underground fluids, such as petroleum and groundwater, flow through small pore spaces between rock grains.  Their velocity is modeled by systems of differential equations.  These are approximated by partitioning the spatial domain into small pieces called elements, which form a computational mesh. One approximates the field variables, such as pressure or velocity, by simple functions defined over each element.  When pieced together appropriately, these functions are called finite elements.  Because subsurface rocks are highly heterogeneous, it is important to follow the subsurface geological layering.  That is, the computational mesh must consist of, say, quadrilateral and hexahedral elements, rather than rectangular elements. Existing finite elements that approximate pressures and velocities (called mixed elements) suffer from a loss of accuracy on such elements. New mixed finite elements were developed that overcome the limitation.  Chemical components are transported within the velocity flow field.  Such components might be groundwater contaminants in environmental applications, specific hydrocarbon species in petroleum applications, or carbon dioxide in carbon sequestration applications.  Transport is again modeled by systems of differential equations.  Two critical issues arise for accurate approximation of the solutions to the differential equations: mass must be conserved and the concentrations can develop shocks.  Numerical procedures were developed to simulate transport, which fall into two classes.  The first class are numerical schemes based on reconstructions.  The solution (i.e., species concentration) is approximated over each element by a constant value.  However, constants are not very accurate, so one reconstructs the solution by approximating it by a third or fifth order polynomial by relating the value on the element and its nearest neighbors in what is known as a stencil.  The reconstruction conserves mass.  To avoid shocks, a weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) average of polynomials defined for several stencils is used.  Stencils that cross shocks are weighted out of the reconstruction. Accuracy in the presence of shocks was studied and shown not to hold in all cases, and a new multi-level WENO reconstruction with adaptive order of accuracy was developed.  A new approach to WENO reconstructions in two and three dimensions on quadrilateral or hexahedral meshes was devised.  WENO reconstructions are used to solve the transport equations.  However,existing numerical schemes are well-suited only to handling transport in an explicit manner.  Natural systems usually also exhibit diffusive processes.  The explicit algorithms remain stable only when one limits the time step.  Four new WENO schemes were developed and analyzed, which better handle the nonlinearities inherent in the differential equations and allow much longer time steps.  Two of the schemes remain explicit.  Two new implicit WENO schemes were developed that can theoretically take very long time steps.  One of the schemes allows accurate approximation of systems of convection-diffusion-reaction equations, and so it handles the full range of physical processes observed in the subsurface. It is expected to lead to improved approximation of groundwater and petroleum flow and transport problems.  The scheme is a natural extension of low order finite volume methods, and so should be appealing to current practitioners in industry.  The second class of numerical schemes, called enhanced Galerkin schemes, involve serendipity finite elements.  Existing elements work well on rectangles, but suffer inaccuracy on quadrilaterals.  New direct serendipity finite elements were developed that remain accurate on quadrilaterals.  It was shown that these serendipity elements are related to the mixed finite elements used for flow, and new direct mixed finite elements were discovered.  The new families of direct serendipity and mixed finite elements and the new WENO schemes are likely to be very useful in a wide range of applications. They overcome shortcomings in existing techniques.  Eight papers were published in the technical literature after peer review, and four more manuscripts are under review.  Applications to related problems in mantle dynamics and geomechanics were also pursued.  BROADER IMPACTS  The project had a broader, positive impact on the technical workforce and its diversity.  Two female undergraduate students (one U.S. hispanic) were introduced to numerical simulation.  Two female graduate students completed doctoral degrees, and a third graduate student completed the bulk of her research under the project (she is expected to complete her Ph.D. in 2019). An hispanic graduate student from a Brazilian institution worked on problems related to the project and graduated with a Ph.D.  The project supported collaboration with researchers from a predominately hispanic U.S. institution and from Brazil and Taiwan.  The research results were discussed with representatives of several major petroleum companies at the annual Center for Subsurface Modeling Industrial Affiliates Meetings and several international conferences, including two SIAM Conferences on Mathematical and Computational Issues in the Geosciences and two meetings of the International Society for Porous Media (InterPore), which are attended by representatives of the petroleum and hydrology industries.
