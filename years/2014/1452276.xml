<AbstractNarration>The planned research introduces a new formulation of the categorical Langlands correspondence. It replaces the `naive' version of the Langlands correspondence, which is known to specialists to be inconsistent. The principal investigator proposes to study the new statement and verify that it passes natural consistency checks. He then plans to verify the new formulation, starting with some special cases. The investigator also proposes to study the compactified Jacobians of curves with planar singularities and show that they are self-dual. In his earlier work, the principal investigator established the autoduality in the case of reduced irreducible curves; he plans to extend his results to curves that may be reducible and non-reduced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Langlands program started as a series of conjectures proposed by Robert Langlands beginning in 1967. From its origins in number theory and representation theory, it developed into a framework connecting and influencing many areas of mathematics. In particular, the geometric Langlands program is formulated in terms of algebraic geometry, but can also be interpreted in physical terms as a duality in quantum field theory. This project introduces new geometric ideas into the Langlands program that should resolve some long-standing issues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research project focuses primarily on the Geometric Langlands Program. The Geometric Langlands Program takes its origin from the conjectures formulated by Robert Langlands in the late 1960's. The conjectures are very surprising in that they combine in a beautiful non-trivial way two branches of mathematics: number theory and representation theory.   In late 1970's, Vladimir Drinfeld and Gerard Laumon realized the importance of geometric methods for the Langlands conjectures. Thus, the Geometric Langlands Program was born. Ten years ago, Anton Kapustin and Edward Witten discovered deep connections between the Langlands Program and theoretical physics.  In summary, the Geometric Langlands Program is a major area of mathematical research, based on ideas from very different branches of mathematics (number theory, representation theory, algebraic geometry) and physics. In fact, Edward Frenkel, famous for his efforts to popularize mathematics, calls the Langlands Program (which is also his own area of research) "the Grand Unified Theory of Mathematics"!   Despite the major advances on the Geometric Langlands Program, there remained some gaps in the foundations. Perhaps the most serious issue was the formulation of the Global Geometric Langlands Conjecture, which is a key claim in the program. Very informally, the conjecture concerns two spaces constructed from an algebraic curve C (the space of local systems on C and the space of bundles on C). The spaces have very different nature: one is more 'topological', the other more 'geometric'. The conjecture predicts that, despite this, the two spaces are related by a kind of geometric Fourier transform.    However, it has been known to experts for several years that this naive form of the Global Langlands Conjecture is impossible: the two sides of the would-be Fourier transform have incompatible behavior.  The major results of this project are as follows:  Firstly, we (joint with Dennis Gaitsgory) resolve the contradiction in the Global Geometric Langlands Conjecture. We accomplish this by developing a new algebro-geometric theory: the theory of singular support for coherent sheaves. We then use it to correct one of the two sides of the 'Fourier transform'. We verify that the new formulation is free of the inconsistencies that plague the original 'naive' statement. These ideas are developed further in our joint project with Vladimir Drinfeld and Dennis Gaitsgory. We propose a strategy for proving the Global Geometric Langlands Langlands Conjecture in its new formulation. The strategy separates the proof into three major conjectural steps.  The first major step out of the three is then proved in our joint paper with Dennis Gaitsgory. We develop new methods for working with coherent sheaves and objects of the category of singularities. This allows us to prove a new `gluing statement' in the geometric Langlands conjecture. I then accomplish the second step by showing that every irreducible connection on an algebraic curve admits a rational oper structure.    The results achieved under this project represent a significant advance in the Geometric Langlands Program. Moreover, the techniques developped by us have general algebro-geometric nature, and should find applications in other areas of algebraic geometry, and mathematics in general.
