<AbstractNarration>Preparing a skilled technical workforce to meet regional workforce needs supports the Nation's competitiveness. Microtechnologies and nanotechnologies are needed in a broad range of products and industries. The primary purpose of the project is to broaden engineering technician education to prepare technicians to work in the microsystems industry. This project is designing and implementing a Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (Microsystems) Certificate for students enrolled in engineering technology or electrical engineering technology associate degree programs, as well as preparing them for LabVIEW certification (Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench, for data acquisition, instrument control, and industrial automation). Microsystems and LabVIEW certificates are supplementing and complementing associate degrees in engineering technology, creating broader employment opportunities for technicians and preparing a competent workforce for the microsystems industry. The Microsystems certificate and LabVIEW preparation created for this project are easily replicable in engineering technology programs in each of other regions in the state through the Ivy Tech System and in community colleges in other states. The college is continuing its partnership with SCME, adding a community college focus to their resources. This continuing partnership is assuring that the resources produced are being made available through the SCME national education and information dissemination channels. Project outreach activities include those specially designed to attract and retain to the program under-represented minorities, females, and veterans who already make-up a significant percentage of students at the college.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on an NSF ATE grant (1205138) to the Southwest Center for Microsystems Education (SCME). As a result, eleven hands-on educational course modules and kits produced by SCME are being integrated into engineering technology courses at the college. In this project the college and SME are co-developing three additional course modules and kits focused on building microsystems, which complement the learning modules developed by SCME. The college is also integrating preparation for the LabVIEW certification test into the new microsystems courses, providing technicians with the opportunity to graduate with two certifications in addition to an associate degree, which makes them more marketable. The new courses are increasing the capacity of community colleges to produce technicians for a wide variety of micro- and nano-technology related industries. An introductory microsystems course is being offered for dual credit in high schools to introduce high school students to microsystems concepts and careers. Students receive actual clean room experience each semester through field trips to either Norte Dame University or the University of Michigan, both located within a two and a half hour drive from the college.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Micro and nano-technologies are found in a wide range of products made by major employers in the state including Advanced Surface Microscopy, Bangs Laboratories, Delphi Corporation, Eli Lilly and Co, Guidant Corp, Exelis, J&amp;S Resource Management, M4 Sciences, Makuta Technics, MicroTechNano, MonoSo, Prosolla, QuadraSpec, Semafore Pharmaceuticals, and Sensor Advanced Development. Although the integrated circuits (IC) industry saw a two percent decline overall in 2012,  the research by Yole Development showed that the microsystems sector grew by 10 percent to become an $11B business. Analysts expect a 12-13 percent compound annual growth rate through 2018 to create a $22.5B microsystems market. The use of microsystems and integrated circuits is crucial to the design and development of new products. Common examples include accelerometers, pressure transducers, inertial sensors, micro fluidic pumps and flow sensors. The introduction of microsystems technology via the proposed course modules and kits, and those already developed by SCME, provides a unique opportunity for students to learn engineering concepts in an easy to see fashion while exposing them to design and fabrication techniques which are currently being used in many microsystems industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The mission of the Microsystems Certification Project (MCP), DUE 1400470, is to meet regional workforce needs that support the nation's competitiveness. In the development of emerging micro-technologies and nanotechnologies in a broad range of products and industries.   Goal 1: Develop a Microsystems Technical Certificate for students enrolled in an engineering technology or electrical engineering technology associate degree programs.   Objectives:  Co-develop, with SCME, three courses for a Microsystems Certificate: Introduction to Microsystems, Microsystems Characterization, and Microsystems and Electronics. Co-develop, with SCME, three Microsystems kits. Offer the Introduction to Microsystems course for dual credit at New Tech and traditional high schools in Ivy Tech Northeast?s region. Establish a local advisory committee with representation from local microsystems and related industries, K-12 schools and higher education to provide input on the current and future industry education needs and to connect microsystems with STEM education in high school, community colleges and four-year colleges.     Goal 2: Implement and adapt microsystems and Nano course modules and kits developed by SCME and other ATE Centers to meet the needs of Northeast Indiana.   Objectives:  Solicit industry input. Identify available microsystems course modules and kits relevant for community college engineering technology courses and integrate with Ivy Tech engineering technology.    Goal 3: Integrate LabVIEW certification preparation into microsystems courses to prepare students to earn a LabVIEW Certificate through the exam administered by National Instruments.   Objective:  Integrate LabVIEW, Multisim and ELVIS II into microsystems courses to prepare students to take the LabVIEW certification exam and provide industry with needed skills.      Outcomes  In year one, the college?s Associate Vice President of Applied Engineering and Technology Education has approved the development of three courses to be added to the technical certificate in Electronics and Computer Technology.  These courses together create a stackable credential.  Development of the three courses was completed and they were offered as a series in the summer of 2017 and the summer of 2019:  MEMS 101: Introduction to Microsystems,  MEMS 102: Microsystems Characterization, and  MEMS 103 Microsystems and Electronics    In addition, MCP developed the three planned electronic kits that can be used with current SCME MEMS kits.  The three planned kits were as follows:  Kit 1: Pressure sensor kit using a variable capacitance Kit 2: Pressure sensor kit with a variable inductance, and Kit 3: Surface acoustic wave (SAE) kit.      Enrollment in MEMS 101, 102 and 103 was reported by the project PI as follows (Table 1)            Total Students    Graduated    Male    Female    Black    White    Hispanic      Summer 2017    6    2    6    0    1    4    2           Summer 2019    7    4    5    2    0    6    1            Table 1:  Student enrollment, completion and demographics   100% of students completed the courses, which is an excellent result.   Of the six students in the 2017 courses, two graduated, one transferred to another program, one is finishing his program this year and two left the college.  Of the seven students in the 2019 courses, one graduated, four are on track to graduate spring of 2020, one has temporarily left school, and one was in high school and is now attending Ivy Tech.   With a 100% completion rate for the courses and a graduation rate of 46%, which is more than double the graduation rate for Ivy Tech Community College as a whole, the project produced successful results with students. It would be interesting to contact the students to see if the MEMS courses played a role in their retention and completion.   An Industry Advisory Board was formed in year four, and the first meeting was held.  The project reported in years three and four that it had very good relationships with Raytheon and Exelis , the City of Fort Wayne, Ivy Tech?s Northeast Indiana Public Private Partnership and it started to develop a stronger relationship with 80/20.  Further, the relationship with National Instruments was strengthened with the procurement of new NI Equipment that will be used in the new Remote Lab/Classroom.    Clean Room Experience for Students  The primary purpose of the fifth year no-cost extension was to provide students with the opportunity to have an immersive clean room experience.  This was accomplished, when, in June 2019, PI Bell took six students (2 females and 4 males) and another faculty member to Albuquerque, NM to the UNM cleanroom to tour the facilities and complete the Pressure Sensor Process Workshop.    The students were asked to rate the quality of the Pressure Sensor Process Workshop, using a five-point Likert scale.   Students rated all aspects of the workshop very highly, with the overall workshop rating as excellent at 4.50.  The lowest rating was pre-workshop communications at 3.33 and the highest was presenter knowledge, which received 100% excellent ratings for a perfect 5.00.  The average rating was 4.27, with 86.7% of ratings at excellent or good.             Last Modified: 10/30/2019       Submitted by: Andrew Bell]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
