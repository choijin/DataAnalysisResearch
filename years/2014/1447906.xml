<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is for the development of a color-based use-time indicator for intravenous (IV) needle-free connectors to prevent blood stream infections. By indicating to a nurse or health care provider when to change needle-free connectors, the technology will improve compliance with the Centers for Disease Control guidelines and prevent blood-stream infections (BSIs) that are the result of contamination introduced during the IV delivery of fluids and drugs. Simple and clear color-based use indicators on IV needless connectors will also standardize processes for changing connectors, leading to a reduction in associated mortality, and also lower overall healthcare costs. Additional impacts will include a decrease in the average length of a hospital stay, a reduction in workload for the already taxed health care industry, and an improvement in the quality of life during and after extended medical care. By increasing compliance in changing the connectors, the indicator will also translate to an immediate increase in the utilization of needle-free connectors, products that are manufactured inside the U.S. The total addressable market for this device is estimated at $90 million domestically and $180 million worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is the development of a novel nanotechnology-based indicator technology that will change color when critical medical components need to be changed. Research will be performed to i) fabricate and optimize the novel color change material, ii) characterize the color shifts, iii) integrate the color change material into the appropriate medical grade substrates and produce master batches of hybrid materials, iv) optimize the color shift process in one or more hybrid materials, v) produce a prototype IV-line connector, and vi) translate the indicator technology into existing IV line components. Anticipated results are the production of a novel hybrid colorimetric indicator material capable of a clear visual indication of the time-of-use of an intravenous line component, the realization of an indicator prototype, and the demonstration that the indicator technology can be integrated within existing IV line components.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project, we developed ActiBlu, an innovative color-indicating technology that provides a clear, inexpensive, and simple method for assessing the time-of-use of medical dressings and disposables.  By providing a reliable and easily recognized signal for when to exchange critical medical components, ActiBlu will address a market need for accelerating healing and minimizing infections in hospitals, doctorsÃ† offices, nursing homes and home care environments.   ActiBlu coatings consist of silver nanomaterials that have a widely tunable range of color that is correlated to the material size and shape; when exposed to a wound environment, the particles undergo a change in size, resulting in a color change from blue to red to yellow.  We demonstrated the ability to optimize the rate of the color change for specific indicator applications, with possible timeframes from minutes to several weeks, and incorporated the materials into a variety of medical dressings and coatings.  Since the ActiBlu particles can be integrated into virtually any material or coated onto any surface, this technology is a simple and cost effective visual method of determining the use-status of a wide range of medical dressings and devices.  The broader impacts of the ActiBlu technology developed under this SBIR project are significant and pertain to both the manufacture and integration of nanomaterials into a variety of consumer-related products, as well as a significant societal benefit related to reduced numbers of infection-related deaths and associated health care costs.  With over 35 million hospital visits a year, hospital-related care represents 29% of all US health care expenses, making hospitalization the largest component of the $3 trillion health care budget (17.1% of GDP).  One complication that extends hospital stays is health care-associated infections, which result in costs of $9.8 billion per year and lead to more than 90,000 infection-related deaths per annum, many of which are related to infection of traumatic wounds.  The ability of caregivers to change wound dressings at the optimal time &ndash; changing too early can disturb the wound bed and slow healing, while changing a dressing too late can lead to damage of surrounding tissue &ndash; would potentially reduce health costs and save lives, but there is currently no dressing that provides such feedback to the patient or caregiver. When integrated into wound dressings, ActiBlu indicating technology will provide an indispensable tool for infection reduction and accelerated wound healing, providing benefits for all stakeholders involved with wound care.
