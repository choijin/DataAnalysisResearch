<AbstractNarration>Around the world, a global anti-corruption consensus has taken root, supported by the World Bank, industrialized countries, NGOs, and theorists, with transparency and rule-of-law as the primary justifications and goals of new legislation and policy at multiple scales of governance.  At the same time, increasingly numbers of people enter the informal economy, especially in urban centers.  The research seeks to understand the relationship between these processes, critically engaging with literature from anthropology, urban theory, and sociolegal studies.  In order to shed light on the role that discourses and perceptions of law, illegality and corruption serve in shaping informal economic practices and social relations in the contemporary city, the study asks 1) what corruption means in the contexts of informal economies and 2) what is means for different actors when their everyday practices become reinterpreted as corrupt. The results of this investigation will be a dissertation thesis, academic articles, and conference presentations, which will be important to scholars from a variety of disciplines, as well as policy-makers working on issues of urban governance, planning, and economic development.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focusing on the daily lives and interactions between vendors, municipal authorities, and Mexico City residents, this study employs ethnographic methods including participant-observation, interviews, conversation analysis, and textual analysis to examine how participants in the informal economy make sense of the law.  It hypothesizes that legal strategies that target the informal sector lead to a fragmentation of existing social arrangements, increased perceptions of corruption, more frequent conflicts over the use of public space, and greater legal precarity for informalized workers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[                       The main goal of my dissertation research is to understand how the law is negotiated and understood in urban contexts where there are high levels of perceived and reported illegality and corruption. To study this topic, I look at how municipal authorities in Mexico City have attempted to "clean up" one particular neighborhood through diverse urban governance strategies, including the removal of informal street vendors from public spaces. Employing ethnographic methods including participant-observation, interviews, conversation analysis, and textual analysis, I asked: 1) How are ideas of legality and corruption mobilized to regulate the appropriate use of public space in this area? 2) How are these efforts understood and negotiated by different actors in the neighborhood, including informal vendors, formal merchants, and local authorities? I hypothesized that the legal strategies that local authorities used to target the informal sector, including removal and revoking provisional permits, would lead to a fragmentation of existing social arrangements within that sector, increased perceptions of corruption, more frequent conflicts over the use of public space, and greater legal precarity for informalized workers.  I conducted my research in La Central de Abasto, a Mexico City market neighborhood which was designed in the 1980s to modernize the cityÆs food infrastructure by replacing the chaotic downtown market district with a planned, rational commercial area in the city outskirts. Today, however, La Central de Abasto has high rates of crime and is widely seen as a dangerous, corrupt, and disorderly space. During the course of my research, I studied the ways in which local authorities endeavored to "clean up" the neighborhood through strategies that included the regulation of informal commerce, and the ways in which formal merchants, street vendors, and customers made sense of these efforts to turn the market into a safe and orderly space. In addition to spending time observing interactions between these different social actors, I conducted open-ended and structured interviews with them, attended meetings of merchantsÆ and vendorsÆ associations, and accompanied police and inspectors on some of their rounds.               Having concluded fieldwork and commenced analysis of my data, my preliminary findings are the following:   1)    Despite the rhetoric of enhancing "rule of law" and decreasing corruption cited by policy-makers and merchant elites to support the removal of informal vendors from public areas in Mexico City, these efforts instead make the state appear less consistent and more corrupt to diverse social actors by: a) rendering more visible contradictions between scales of law (municipal law prohibiting unpermitted commerce in public space, constitutional law guaranteeing the right to work); b) creating more complex legal categories (certain days/hours where vending is permitted; new categories of permitted vending) which are unevenly understood and applied by local authorities.  2)    Informal vendors, rather than actively avoiding interactions with legal authorities or "resisting" the state and its efforts to eliminate informal commerce, are among the foremost champions of regulatory measures which would regularize their legal status. In spite of this, they are rarely included in neighborhood assemblies or meetings between market district authorities and formal merchants, where decisions are made about permissible use of public land. Informal vendor associations are thus left to come to independent "agreements," often behind closed doors, with local authorities in order to secure permits for using public land.  3)    The legal standing and exact content of these agreements between municipal authorities and informal vendors, granting the former provisional use of public land, is poorly understood and differently interpreted by most of the parties involved. Local authorities invoke the language o...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
