<AbstractNarration>The work of science and technology (S&amp;T) policymaking agencies in the United States is important to building knowledge and economic growth. These agencies make decisions about how to structure policies and programs for funding science and technology development, how to promote technology transfer and innovation, and how to use scientific and technical methods in federal regulation and oversight. This project investigates role that gender plays in the creation of science and technology policy through a study of women's careers in US federal policymaking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research across the social sciences has investigated the advantages of including diverse perspectives in decision-making, including the perspectives of men and women leaders.  While there is much research on women in science and women in management or government, there is little previous research on the role of women leaders in science and technology policy. This project explores new ground by providing both qualitative and quantitative measures of women's participation and influence on science and technology policy at the federal level. Data collection focuses on leadership in S&amp;T policymaking agencies from 1992-2008.  Products include a multiyear, multiagency dataset of women's careers in S&amp;T policy at the federal level.  The research informs understanding of organizational processes from theories at the intersection of multiple social science disciplines and areas, including: science and technology studies; sociology; political science; public policy; management science; and economics. For example, whether variation in the organizational structures of S&amp;T agencies shapes women's participation in science and technology policy is a question of wide intellectual interest. To science policy studies, this work contributes important insights on how leaders at agencies that fund science view their respective roles in the knowledge production processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  Research funding is the lifeblood of science and engineering.  This project contributes to our understanding of that vital role of S&amp;T policymaking agencies by investigating the organization and leadership of federal level S&amp;T policymaking agencies in the United States. Understanding how women leaders have contributed to the S&amp;T policy agenda, how variation in the participation of women in different agencies has produced different outcomes, and what the anatomy of a healthy S&amp;T policy sector looks like are important outcomes expected in this project.  This project generates knowledge with practical implications for improving policy organization structures and practices, and a dataset that other researchers can use to investigate the relationship between gender and science policymaking.</AbstractNarration>

Federal S&amp;T policy agencies make decisions about how to: structure policies and programs for funding knowledge development, promote technology transfer and innovation, and use scientific and technical methods in federal regulation and oversight. This project investigates the organization and leadership of federal S&amp;T policy agencies, particularly the role of women in policymaking. It investigates the prevalence and influence of women in science policy by asking two main questions. First, what is the distribution of men and women in science agencies, and is there a pay gap? Second, what is the impact of women leaders in science policymaking?</p> <p>We take a mixed method approach to these questions, combining qualitative and quantitative research. Quantitative data are used to address the first question regarding the distribution of men and women in science agencies. In government agencies top leadership positions continue to be disproportionately held by men. The quantitative dataset of employment, compensation, occupation, job type, and personal characteristics was developed from information obtained from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. Our analyses focus on seven federal science agencies: Department of Agriculture, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Science Foundation. The second question in the WiSP project, about the impact of women leaders in science policymaking, is addressed by qualitative interviews and focus groups. In order to sample for the interviews, Plum Books for 1996-2008 were used to create a list of women and men at the agencies who were presidential appointees during the Clinton and GW Bush administrations. For both the qualitative and quantitative data, the period of analysis is 1994-2008.&nbsp;</p> <p>Initial results of the quantitative analysis show that similar to all other sectors and settings, a pay gap does exist between men and women working in federal science agencies. The gender pay gap is a common way to discuss inequality, however, national studies often compare apples to oranges because within the same broad occupation, men and women do different jobs within different organizations. The unique WiSP dataset allows this study to compare apples to apples: the federal employees in seven major science agencies. This path-breaking study investigates agency differences by scientific field. It asks: 1) Is the pay gap larger in agencies embedded in physical science fields? and 2) What processes lead to variation? Results show pay gaps differ by organization context: overall physical science agencies have larger gaps within jobs. The processes explaining the gap also vary: in interdisciplinary science agencies the gap is explained more by occupational segregation and human capital differences. Deeper understanding is gained by examining the dynamic relative contributions of human capital, segregation, and within-job disparities to pay gaps. The full analysis is given in: &ldquo;Gender Pay Gaps in US Federal Science Agencies: An Organizational Context Approach,&rdquo; by Laurel Smith-Doerr, Sharla Alegria, Kaye Husbands Fealing, Debra Fitzpatrick, and Donald Tomaskovic-Devey.</p> <p>Preliminary results of the qualitative data speak to women&rsquo;s leadership roles in science agencies. The high-level policymakers interviewed reported mainly focusing on the jobs they were asked to do, however, a few respondents initiated programs particularly important for women (e.g., women&rsquo;s health). Both women and men pursued appointments of staff members to advance women in the organization. Many interviewees worked with women heads of agencies. Some were the only woman in the higher echelon of the organization, while others worked in more balanced environments. Mentoring and networks were important to advancing both careers and policy agendas. Overall, women in leadership roles in physical science agencies were more likely to encounter open discrimination and report the need to be tough-skinned, while women in life science agencies organizations were more likely to be seen as collaborating internally and externally.
