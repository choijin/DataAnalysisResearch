<AbstractNarration>This proposal intends to use a variety of tools, with support and collaboration from IBM, to study the nanoscale mechanics of electrochemical codeposition in real time.  For the zinc-bismuth and bismuth-tellurium codeposition systems potentiostatic, galvanostatic, and pulsed control will be applied while simultaneously imaging the developing morphology of the deposited structure - in situ, within the liquid electrolyte - with good temporal resolution (30 images per second) and spatial resolution (better than 20nm). This will provide unique metrological information on the evolution of the deposit morphology at the nanoscale during electrochemical processing.  This study addresses a significant gap in current understanding of codeposition processes: how morphology and stoichiometry vary under different process control regimes and electrolyte compositions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two model codeposition systems outlined in this proposal have promise for use in energy related technologies. In electrochemical storage structures zinc anodes have long been attractive for reasons of 1) high energy density when paired with air or low-cost cathodes, 2) abundance, and 3) cost. To date secondary zinc anodes have been difficult to achieve due to a tendency toward dendritic structures. Bismuth is known to suppress hydrogen evolution in a working zinc battery and is added to increase shelf life, thus is an additive of interest to plated zinc structure. For another application, slight non-stoichiometries of bismuth telluride are the workhorse structures for thermoelectric devices, both cooling devices and electrical generators. The efficacy of the thermoelectric is determined by the relative chemistries of the complementary p and n type structures.  Outside the laboratory the proposed research will serve a core topic of in-situ microscopy and seed lectures, demonstrations and online media for high school and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     In what is our clearest contribution to date from this work, I tested our theory that zinc dendrites were a "nuisance, not a scourge". We looked to see what happens when zinc is formed well beyond the limiting current and found that the zinc takes on a "hyper&shy;dendritic" morphology that is seldom reported in the literature, and never used within a battery. This zinc grows in a manner that is at first glance counterintuitive: a nearly superconformal foam. TEM analysis indicates that true diffusion limited growth is taking place, but at the nanoscale. At the micron scale, what is observed is a collection of anisotropic dendrites growing in a controlled fashion as a "foam front". Most interesting is that this foam has a different electrochemical potential than "bulk zinc" (50 mV less reducing than bulk zinc), likely because the active surface is edge&shy;dominated as opposed to face&shy;dominated. When we repeatedly charge and discharge this "hyper&shy;dendritic" form of zinc to 50% of its capacity, the foam becomes progressively more compact, growing "inwards", instead of forming the usual large anisotropic protrusions. This performance compares favorably with zinc foams produced through other methods.   We believe this happens because every growth site is equally favorable (or unfavorable). In other words, when we form the zinc far from equilibrium conditions (high rate, well beyond the limiting current), and cycle the zinc close to equilibrium conditions (low rate, well under the limiting current), the zinc "cycles toward flat." This is in contrast to the prevailing wisdom that plate metal batteries need to be flat. In further studies that are in progress, we are confirming that the highly&shy;dendritic zinc formed in this manner cycles in a more predictable fashion than "bulk" zinc, and the even reaction rate across the surface of the foam retards ZnO passivation significantly. We have filed a provisional patent on this method for forming zinc, and are in talks with three companies about further uses for the anode in systems of varying pH.
