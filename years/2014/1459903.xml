<AbstractNarration>Extreme heat events are currently the leading weather-related cause of death in the U.S. and have numerous impacts on important social systems including food, water, energy and infrastructure. It is vital to understand how both the public at large and vulnerable populations perceive the risks of extreme heat, how they decide to take action to mitigate these risks, and how their prior experiences shape future responses. People can take action to reduce the health risks of extreme heat, including the use of fans and air conditioning, proper hydration, and avoiding overexertion, but they must first be aware of the risks and appropriate mitigation behaviors. This research project will identify the psychological, social, cultural, and geographic factors that are associated with public perceptions of extreme heat risks, map these risk perceptions at high resolution across the United States, and analyze how vulnerability to extreme heat events corresponds with public risk perceptions. The results will enable emergency managers and policymakers to precisely target preparedness efforts, risk communication strategies, and other resources to protect vulnerable populations from harm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little is known about the factors that influence risk perceptions of heat waves, even though such perceptions are known to be a key determinant of how people respond to environmental hazards. To investigate the factors and context that shape public risk perceptions and responses to heat waves, the researchers will conduct a nationally representative survey over the duration of the warm season (May-September) in the U.S. The data will be used to create a spatially explicit statistical model to identify factors related to heat wave risk perceptions, including personal experience with heat waves, local climate, land cover, and socioeconomic variables at the individual, neighborhood, and regional scales. Research on other hazards suggests that recent personal experience is likely to play a major role in risk perception, along with individual-level factors, such as age and gender. Contextual factors, such as location relative to urban heat islands, may amplify risk perceptions. Results from the statistical model will be applied to create a high-resolution national map of risk perceptions at the county and census tract levels, and model projections will subsequently be validated by independent surveys.</AbstractNarration>

Extreme heat events are the leading weather-related cause of death in the U.S. and have impacts on important social systems including food, water, energy and infrastructure. As a result, it is important to understand how both the public at large and vulnerable populations perceive the risks of extreme heat and how they decide to take action to mitigate these risks. We collected representative survey data on U.S. public perceptions of heat risks during the Summer of 2015, resulting in a data set of over 9,000 responses from all 50 states. We then conducted a follow-up survey in Fall 2015 of over 1,000 people, in which we asked additional questions about actions people took to respond to extreme heat. Using our survey data, we developed statistical models to identify factors that were associated with both an individual's risk perceptions and behavioral tendencies to protect oneself from heat. Both physical and social vulnerability factors were associated with heat risk perceptions and behaviors, including geographic location, gender, race and ethnicity, and previous experience with the health effects of extreme heat. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Based on our survey results and additional sources of demographic and environmental data we then developed a statistical model using multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to map public risk perceptions across all 50 states, 3,142 counties, and 72,429 census tracts in the U.S. This model advances methods to estimate social survey data at high spatial resolutions. To validate our model we collected additional survey data in two census tracts in 2016 (one in California and one in Illinois); these separate surveys showed strong agreement with our model. Using the nationwide heat risk perception estimates mapped using the MRP model we found that Texas, Nevada, and Hawaii have the highest heat risk perceptions of all states, reflecting the higher heat-related mortality risks that residents in warm climates face. However, we also found that risk perceptions within large metropolitan areas are as variable as they are across states. Extreme heat risk perceptions are higher in poorer neighborhoods and among minority populations, and lower in wealthier neighborhoods with more white residents, largely reflecting the variation in vulnerability across these populations. Risk perceptions currently lag heat-related mortality in the Mountain states, a region where heat exposure is projected to rise substantially as climate changes. Future exposure to extreme heat under projected scenarios of climate and demographic change may also place populations with currently low risk perceptions at greater risk.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Data from this project can now be incorporated into comprehensive models of extreme weather risks, exposure, and impacts as comprehensive estimates are provided at high spatial resolution.

Support also enabled the PIs to provide training and collaboration with a post-doctoral scientist who utilized the data to examine how socioeconomic vulnerability affects heat wave risk perceptions. The detailed risk perception maps produced by the project will facilitate urban and rural planning for heat waves, targeted risk communication, and resource management in local contexts. The methodological advances produced by the project provide a foundation for creating a wide array of social science datasets at the census tract level for the entire U.S.</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/29/2018<br>      Modified by: Peter&nbsp;D&nbsp;Howe</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1459903/1459903_10359822_1540840606865_Fig1riskp_county_state_vertical--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1459903/1459903_10359822_1540840606865_Fig1riskp_county_state_vertical--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1459903/1459903_10359822_1540840606865_Fig1riskp_county_state_vertical--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">State level (top) and county level (bottom) estimates of heat risk perception for the contiguous U.S. Values indicate mean estimated risk perception index for the population of each state (SD=3.8) or county (SD=4.2).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Howe, P.
