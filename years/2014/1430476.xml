<AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to provide financial support for students at US institutions to attend the 22nd International Symposium on Mathematical Programming to be held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 12-17 July 2015. This symposium is organized every three years by the Mathematical Optimization Society and spans virtually all aspects of mathematical optimization. The goal is to provide partial travel and local expenses support to students who otherwise might not be able to attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful outcome of this award is that it will provide an opportunity for students to attend an important conference that is held in the US less than 50 percent of the time. The conference is a particularly attractive one, due to the diversity of the covered topics as well as the geographical provenance of the attendees. Students have a strong interest in participating, as very recent and topical research is presented, and the possibility to network with and learn from researchers whose interests are similar to theirs is an important opportunity.</AbstractNarration>
