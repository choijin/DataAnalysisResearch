<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating our newly-developed upconversion inks and associated printing techniques into a complete system for printing, reading, and decoding covert markings that exhibit full red-green-blue (RGB) additive color upconversion luminescence upon excitation with near-infrared (NIR) light.  This system will constitute a new anti-counterfeiting and authentication technology to fill the need for fighting the staggering counterfeiting and intellectual-property losses suffered across a broad range of industries.   The project will result in a prototype of a complete Print-Read-Decode system for RGB upconverting inks.  This Print-Read-Decode system will have the following unique features: it will be based on inks activated with nanocrystals which are responsible for the upconversion luminescence; the covert markings are invisible under ambient and UV lighting, and only become visible under NIR light; it will be based on the only known print system demonstrated to fill the RGB color space using upconversion luminescence; and it will be a closed-loop system, in which the entire system, from printing, to encoding, to reading and decoding will be included within one system. These features provide advantages when compared to the leading competing security inks and marking systems due to increased difficulty to counterfeit. Specifically, the ability to replicate would require reproduction of not only the inks (which are intrinsically difficult to reproduce), but of the entire system. This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application, the development of a cyber-enabled, integrated reader; and adaptation of the current ink formulations to accommodate industry-friendly equipment and processes.  The project engages Midwest Micro-Tek in Brookings, SD to augment its research capabilities and to provide a suitable test environment in this technology translation effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Print-Read-Decode prototype for RGB upconverting inks is important because counterfeit goods cost U.S. businesses $200-$250 billion annually, and are directly responsible for the loss of 750,000 American jobs. Beyond the dollar costs, counterfeit drugs are a proven danger to public health and safety. Counterfeit integrated circuits and electronic components are a threat to the full functionality of national defense systems. In addition, the economic impact of the $2 billion mass serialization track-and-trace market is predicted to expand to $75 billion in less than three years. Success in combating counterfeiting will require numerous creative approaches; a single market-dominant anti-counterfeiting technology seems unrealistic and even dangerous. If the proposed system captures a mere one percent of the predicted market within three years, the economic impact would be $750,000,000.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Counterfeit goods cost U.S. businesses $200-$250 billion annually, and are directly responsible for the loss of 750,000 American jobs. Beyond the dollar costs, counterfeit drugs are a proven danger to public health and safety. Counterfeit integrated circuits and electronic components are a threat to the full functionality of national defense systems. The anti-counterfeiting and authentication system developed in this project has the potential to make a significant positive impact on the protection of intellectual property, public safety, and high-value products and documents.     A major outcome of the project is the development of three separate reader designs, which are part of a complete system for document authentication.  One reader is completely standalone and is intended for demonstration and marketing purposes.  The second design is a modification of the first and can be controlled by, and pass information to, a Smartphone.  These reader designs are made to be manufacture friendly and were developed to this stage under consultation with industry partners. These designs are protected under a provisional patent.     An effective business team was assembled and a company, NP Integrated Systems, was formed, dedicated to the commercialization of our technology. Our team entered the South Dakota Governor?s Giant Vision competition, in which South Dakota companies compete for the best new business idea.  This competition is held in Sioux Falls, SD, in conjunction with the Conference for the Governor?s Office of Economic Development. Our team won 1st prize in the Governor?s Giant Vision competition which includes a $20,000 prize.     The technology has been licensed to SecureMarking (www.securemarking.com), formerly NP Integrated Systems, which is currently conducting an NSF Phase I STTR project based on the technology.  Moreover, SecureMarking was selected to participate in the Techstars Air Force Accelerator in Boston in 2018, a program designed to help promising startup companies to succeed.   This is a highly selective program in which only the 10 most promising companies are chosen to participate.  Techstar companies have a very good record of attracting funding and becoming successful.     This project provided 6 months of support for a postdoctoral associate, who not only worked intimately with the project team on ink formulation / printing, but also participated in an intensive entrepreneurial training program (SDBTC Accelerator Program).  This associate, therefore, benefited from a unique training program combining science, business, and technology transfer.  This training paid off, as the associate is the PI on a current Phase I STTR grant based on this technology mentioned above.     This project has had an exceptionally strong impact on the training and professional development of undergraduate students.  Eight undergraduate students have been substantially involved in this project, and several of them have contributed enormously to the project?s success.  Three of the undergraduates are named as inventors on patent applications and three others are co-authors on articles published in high-impact international journals.
