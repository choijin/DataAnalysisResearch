<AbstractNarration>Moraine Valley Community College (MVCC) seeks to perform a feasibility study of replicating and refining the Brookdale Community College (BCC) CyberCenter Program (NSF funded as DUE-1331170). Both projects design, implement and evaluate an innovative pathway from cyber talent to cyber workforce. It includes a scalable, competition-driven, hands-on education model that has a potential to help with the nation's critical shortage of cybersecurity workforce. It will incorporate on-line courses, virtual labs and access tools to decrease overall per student cost in the CyberCenter program. The student cohort will include veterans and other underrepresented populations. The project will introduce significant modifications to the existing project that focus on maintaining student preparedness while reducing program cost. The students will be provided a 24-hour access to a virtual learning environment and will be required to complete a series of labs aligned with the NICE framework. If successful, the proposed competition-based model for developing the cybersecurity technical talent has a potential for dissemination and implementation in a large number of the 1,200 community colleges nationwide. Documenting that the available open courses are sufficient to obtain industry certifications will significantly decrease the overall cost of implementing or replicating this program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A comparative analysis will be performed between the project's participants and data collected on the first cohort of the BCC program. The team will specifically measure each participant's ability to pass industry certification exams, the scores they earn as well as their overall readiness for both industry residency programs and the permanent placement in the Cybersecurity workforce. The project team will redesign elements of the BCC program to utilize existing introductory level curriculum developed with funding from the NSF. Participants will then complete the advanced SANS courses. The original project is in the second year and this project is testing a variation of the approach to increase experiential learning and open course material for foundational courses. Both projects are considered a pilot of a possible large-scale implementation in multiple states and in collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The DHS Cyber Skills Task Force recommended creation of a community college program that would feed technical talent to mission critical cyber components of DHS. It is very likely that this pilot may be implemented widely to respond to DHS Task Force recommendations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award enabled Moraine Valley Community College and Brookdale Community College to collaborate in building a model fast track cybersecurity program.  This model is based on several high level rigorous industry certifications including SANS GIAC, CompTIA Security+, Cisco CCENT and CCNA Security, ISC2 CISSP, VMware VCP and LPI Linux Fundamentals. The project was successful in recruiting veterans and participants from underrepresented communities.  The project focused on maintaining a high level of retention through the use of a virtual teaching and learning environment. This type of environment provides students with continuous opportunity for experiential learning.  This environment was also abled to be shared with participants in the second cohort from Brookdale Community College. The program also encouraged learner collaboration, teamwork and leadership through the use of the cohort model.  The Moraine Valley project also experimented with garnering corporate and industry sponsorships to help defer cost and increase the diversity of the program content.  Finally, this program proved that students earning multiple industry credentials would be highly recruited by companies in the cybersecurity space.  The model also generated a high level of participant community service.  Many of the participants now volunteer to help operate cybersecurity competitions and serve on industry advisory boards for the programs at Moraine Valley Community College.  As a result of this project, several participating organizations put forward the idea of a corporate sponsored program that replicates the successes of this project.
