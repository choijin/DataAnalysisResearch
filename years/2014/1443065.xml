<AbstractNarration>This research will improve our understanding of the fundamental factors controlling the reactivity of fly ash in Portland cement concrete,  leading to  more accurate predictive models of performance that will enable the calculation of optimum cement replacement factors for fly ash/cement mix design,. The major innovation is the use of a simulated whole fly ash, which matches all the major properties of a real fly ash, as a model system for investigating systemically the individual factors that control its reactivity. These major properties include the glassy phase composition, the inert mass fraction and composition, and the particle size distribution (PSD). Each simulated fly ash will be a mixture of several types of synthetic glassy particles made with characteristic chemical compositions that match those of real fly ashes. These compositions will be based on analyses of individual fly ash particles using Computer Controlled SEM. The PSD, glass chemical composition and inert fraction will be independently varied among the simulated fly ashes. The mixing of the solid particles will be done using the novel Resonance Acoustic Mixing method to ensure homogenization. This research uses a combination of three measurement techniques to measure the reactivity at different length scales: wet chemistry, thermogravimetry, and standard tests of engineering properties such as compressive strength and durability. Also, the molecular structure of the gel hydration products will be characterized with solid state NMR.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This multiscale approach provides a bridge from individual particle data to macroscopic engineering properties. The results of this research will lead to a model of the reactivity as a function of the glass composition, PSD and inerts fraction.  It will accelerate the usage of fly ash as a replacement for Portland cement by the concrete industry. In terms of economic benefits, the increased use of fly ash will lower the cost of concrete structures. The environmental benefits include the reduction in the number of landfills otherwise needed for fly ash disposal, as well as reduced energy consumption and lower CO2 emissions from Portland cement manufacture. This collaborative project will enhance the research and education for undergraduate and graduate students between two institutions.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The rates of silica dissolution of two of the glasses were measured in pH 12 solutions prepared with either LiOH or Ca(OH)2.  The results showed that both glasses have lower normalized silica dissolution rates in the Ca(OH)2 solution.  Three simulated whole fly ashes were made by combining varying fractions of the Al-Si and Hi-Si synthetic fly ash glasses over a range of 5 % and Hi-Ca over a range of 10%. The reactivities of these simulated fly ashes in cement paste were measured on both the micro and macro length scales using an array of analytical techniques.

The result of the three samples are comparable. In addition the early hydration kinetics of these simulated fly ash /cement pastes was measured by isothermal calorimetry.  Comparison with the calorimetry data of pure cement pastes found no significant difference suggesting that there is no pozzolanic action of the glasses within the first 7 days.              The macroscale reactivity measurements consisted of compressive strength tests on 5 cm mortar cubes made with the simulated fly ash/cement mixes.  There was no significant differences in the compressive strength development among these samples.  This is consistent with the microscale test results.              The overall results suggest that the simulated fly ashes have similar performance at least within the 5% variation range in Al-Si and Hi-Si glass fractions and 10% variation range in Hi-Ca glass fraction investigated in this research.  This is because these glasses have such a low silica dissolution rate that they do not form enough C-S-H gel to cause any change in microstructure within the experimental timeframe.              An additional set of experiments have been initiated using single synthetic fly ash glasses in cement paste to investigate the performance of each single glass.  The reactivity of these samples is being measured by small angle neutron and synchrotron radiation scattering in addition to the set of measurements used in the previous phase.  This research will continue beyond the period of performance of this award.       Last Modified: 06/30/2016       Submitted by: Walairat Bumrongjaroen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
