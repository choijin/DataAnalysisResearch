<AbstractNarration>The transitions that began in 2011 in Egypt and Tunisia have had nearly opposite effects on the status of courts in the two countries.  Egypt's troubled transition has seen the country's courts, especially the Supreme Constitutional Court (SCC), rise to new levels of prominence.  In contrast, the Tunisian transitional regime - considered the most stable of the Arab Spring - suspended the Constitutional Council for the duration of the transition.  The status of the courts has important implications for the distribution of power within the transitional regime.  In Egypt, power was divided between the SCC and several elected legislative, executive and constituent institutions.  In Tunisia, power was concentrated in a single legislative-constituent Assembly unchecked by judicial review. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The focus of this study is on the origins of judicial power, but it will also touch on the problem of democratization.  The Egyptian and Tunisian cases are a challenge to the view that strong courts and democratization always go hand in hand.  The greater power of the Egyptian judiciary did not prevent the Egyptian transition from collapsing in the July 3 coup, and the absence of constitutional review in Tunisia did not result in a dictatorship of the National Assembly.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rule of law upheld by an independent judiciary is an essential part of any consolidated democracy.  Nevertheless, prior research has not adequately addressed the question of how the judiciary aids the democratic process or which forms of judicial power are conducive to democratization in the context of democratic transitions. This project assesses three alternative hypotheses to explain the divergent outcomes in Egypt and Tunisia.  These hypotheses address the role of majoritarian and counter-majoritarian institutions and interests in each country; the different institutional structures of the constitutional court, which may create different opportunities for interaction between civil society and the courts; and the different relationships between the constitutional court and the ordinary judiciary. Archival work and interviews in Egypt and Tunisia will assess these explanations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Harris Setzer Project Outcome Report NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant, Law and Social Science Section "Judicial Power in Transitional Regimes: Tunisia and Egypt since the Arab Spring" August 1, 2015   The transitions that began in 2011 in Egypt and Tunisia have had nearly opposite effects on the status of courts in the two countries.  EgyptÆs troubled transition has seen the countryÆs courts, especially the Supreme Constitutional Court, rise to new levels of prominence.  In contrast, the Tunisian transitional regime - the most stable of the Arab Spring - suspended the Constitutional Council for the duration of the transition.  The status of the courts has important implications for the distribution of power within the transitional regime.  In Egypt, power was divided between the SCC and several elected legislative, executive and constituent institutions.  In Tunisia, power was concentrated in a single legislative-constituent Assembly unchecked by judicial review.   The contrast between Egypt and Tunisia also raises broader theoretical questions about the situations in which a transitional regime would empower a constitutional court.  I suggest four explanations for the divergent outcomes in these two cases.  First, the presence of a strong politicized military in Egypt may have favored the creation of counter-majoritarian institutions, such as judicial review, as a check on the elected legislature and executive.  Judicial power may be produced by the interests of powerful actors guiding the transition and may exist primarily to check majority rule.  Second, the different institutional structures of the constitutional courts in the two countries may create different opportunities for interaction between civil society and the courts.  Judicial power could be produced by a history of interaction between courts and civil society before and during the transition.  Third, the different relationships between the constitutional court and the ordinary judiciary in the two countries may give the Egyptian SCC greater power in its interactions with other branches of government.  In Egypt, the SCC was able to act as a representative of the entire judiciary, giving it a powerful voice in transitional politics.  In Tunisia, the Constitutional Council was separated from the ordinary judiciary, and the judiciary is divided into different factions, preventing the Council from acting as a representative of the judicial branch.    The NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant funded field research in Tunis and Cairo to test these hypotheses.  I interviewed judges, lawyers, and political party representatives in the two countries.  The interviews undermined the hypotheses presented in the original research proposal.  The finding suggests that common wisdom about the role of the military, civil society or lower judges in empowering the high court in Egypt is flawed.  The interviews opened up further lines of research.  The project provides insight into the role of constitutional courts in democratization.   The fieldwork funded by the grant furthered the goals outlined in the NSFÆs Broader Impacts Criterion, including promoting teaching, training and learning; disseminating knowledge to the scientific community; and informing public policy.  The interviews collected in Tunis and Cairo will form an important part of my dissertation, "Judicial Power in Transitional Regimes," in the Department of Government at Cornell University.  I will work with the Qualitative Data Repository at Syracuse University to store the interview notes and recordings and to make them available to other researchers.  The cases of Egypt and Tunisia since the Arab Spring are of clear important to US foreign policy and national security.  The research also addresses two themes relevant to US foreign policy - democratization and the rule of law.  My dissertation investigates how the challenges of combining these two principles in a post-revolutionary environment. ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
