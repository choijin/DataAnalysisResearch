<AbstractNarration>Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Oregon State University propose to support technical services for research on the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Healy. Healy is a research icebreaker operated by USCG in collaboration with NSF and other agencies that fund research in the Arctic. SIO and OSU will provide or coordinate the long-term maintenance and improvements to science systems onboard. They will provide technicians to operate scientific instruments and data systems on the Healy. They will arrange the use of items from the shared-use pools of science vans, coring equipment and other pooled equipment that is part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS). SIO will provide one full-time person to act as a cruise planner and to coordinate the research needs for all cruises on Healy. The awardee will maintain updated content on the website http://icefloe.net. As needed the awardees will also assist the Arctic Sciences Section with coordinating science cruises on other national icebreakers to ensure safe and efficient operations. SIO and OSU will provide many coordination services including working with the USCG to perform upgrades to the ship for science and working with USCG and other ships operating in the Arctic to coordinate bathymetric mapping to ensure the most efficient and complete coverage is obtained each year to contribute to a more complete mapping of the Arctic Ocean, which is largely uncharted. Pending availability of funds, several system upgrades may be funded including the addition of a shallow-water multi-beam sonar for collecting bathymetric data in parallel with the existing multi-beam system that performs best in deep water. Each year of this five-year award will be funded based on the planned work at the start of each Arctic field season.</AbstractNarration>

STARC technicians supported all science cruises during the 2014-2018 time period. This included providing both shoreside and at-sea support as required.   STARC provided effective and efficient marine technical support aboard USCG vessels, promoted a culture of technical excellence that rewards continuous improvement of the methods for performing research at sea, shared improved methods, so that lessons learned are quickly integrated into routine operating procedures aboard USCG vessels and with the broader community of UNOLS marine technicians.  STARC hosted multiple MATE internships who sailed on almost every science mission cruise. Hosting these internships shows hoe STARC supports the Marine Technology community as a whole and reflects STARCs willingness to contribute to the growth of the new generation of Marine Technicians.   STARC hosted multiple training events including a transit dedicated to training other Marine Technicians in the ARF fleet. This successful at-sea training event proved STARCs capabilities to support these efforts.  The collaborative efforts of OSU and SIO cultivated an ideal environment for informaiton sharing and technical trainnig.
