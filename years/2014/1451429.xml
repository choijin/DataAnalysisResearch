<AbstractNarration>This award, funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program, will bring together 30 accomplished researchers from US and India to identify important problems in the area of systems and synthetic biology of relevance both scientifically and societally, to highlight educational requirements and best practices, and to identify bi-national collaboration opportunities that leverage the scientific expertise available in both nations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be held November 9-12, 2014 on the campus of Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, India.  Approximately 30 senior researchers who are experts in the fields of systems and synthetic biology from the US and India will be in attendance along with representatives from US and India funding agencies.  Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will also be included.  The outcomes of the workshop will be a roadmap for future US-India collaboration in this research area as well as a possible Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) proposal.  Research associated with a SAVI in systems and synthetic biology would build research infrastructure, create new educational opportunities, and potentially contribute to the bioeconomy in both nations.</AbstractNarration>
