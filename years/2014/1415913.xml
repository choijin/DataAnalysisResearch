<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in making structural simulation widely available to communities of makers, small businesses, and manufacturing enterprises, leading to dramatic improvements in performance, quality, manufacturability, and cost savings.  If successful, the proposed research will result in a cloud-based simulation service, a disruptive technology holding the potential to transform the simulation industry by making structural simulation widely available to both novice and expert users, as a low cost fully automated service that requires no prepossessing or data conversion.   Putting simulation technology into hands of makers and manufacturers is an important step towards further democratization of manufacturing and wider adoption of 3D printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish scientific, technological, and commercial feasibility of a fully automated and easy-to-use cloud-hosted structural simulation service to support tasks in advanced design and manufacturing. The service is intended to be used by a variety of users with widely varying levels of expertise, with particular focus on the additive manufacturing and the growing maker's movement.   Specific research issues include:  (1)  problems and simulation use scenarios in support of additive manufacturing, including reverse engineering, manufacturability and intended structural performance;   (2) system architecture, computational challenges, and prototype implementation of a cloud-based service for performing structural simulation of intermediate and final solid manufactured artifacts; (3)  investigation of user interaction modes and scenarios that enable use of the structural simulation service by a wide range of users, from novice designers and makers to experienced design and manufacturing engineers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project studied the technical and commercial feasibility of a cloud-hosted structural simulation service, identifying technical challenges that need to be addressed in Phase II of the project. Specific research issues addressed included:  Identification and formulation of common structural problems and simulation use scenarios in support of additive manufacturing, including reverse engineering, manufacturability and intended structural performance. Design of system architecture, computational challenges, and prototype implementation of a cloud-based service for performing structural simulation of intermediate and final solid manufactured artifacts. Investigation of user interaction modes and scenarios that enable use of the structural simulation service by a wide range of users, from novice designers and makers to experienced design and manufacturing engineers.   Broader Impact  Democratization of manufacturing requires democratization of design and simulation technologies. While geometric design systems and CAD tools are now widely available as standalone systems or cloud-based services, simulation technologies remain inaccessible due to high cost, tedious data preparation, and demand for expertise in structural simulation.  This project showed that structural simulation can be made widely available to both novice and expert users as a low cost fully automated service that requires no prepropressing or data conversion.  The experimental system for structural simulation resulting from this research is currently live at the following URL: http://scan-and-solve.herokuapp.com  A short introductory video can also be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pKvMlo5aMw  Project Results  The main goals of this Phase I SBIR project were: (1) to establish that a cloud-based simulation service is feasible technically, and (2) to demonstrate that it could achieve the stated goals of providing low cost simulation to a wide range of makers in an intuitive and simple to use fashion.  We developed and implemented an initial architecture for the cloud-based system, distributing client and server workload based on the competencies of each.  On this system the basic simulation scenarios were realized using a single remote server that hosted the web application, the user database, model and results storage, and a customized meshfree stress solver of our own design.  Experiments indicated that the implemented system was inadequate to support many users simultaneously, defeating the purpose of feasibility studies in Phase I of the project.  This realization necessitated complete redesign of the architecture that incorporated some of the critical elements of the scalable cloud architecture, originally planned for Phase II.  Our prior experience with Scan&amp;Solve technology suggested that the single biggest obstacle to wider acceptance of simulation tools is the difficulty of translating common real-world situations into the specification of a simulation problem.  This is often non-trivial even for expert users, but is particularly challenging for novices and less experienced users.  To attack this problem, a battery of basic structural tests usable by the maker community was identified and tested.  Experimentation with the initial implementation of these tests showed them to be insufficiently expressive except in the most trivial applications.  So to achieve the goals of Phase I project, we decided to focus solely on developing an intuitive general-purpose interface that would be accessible to most users.  This implementation is live and accessible at the following link:  http://scan-and-solve.herokuapp.com.  This Phase I research project clearly demonstrated that a low-cost cloud-based simulation service can be successfully deployed in a manner that is accessible to makers with little to no experience using simulation.  The fully automated system is also appealing to experien...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
