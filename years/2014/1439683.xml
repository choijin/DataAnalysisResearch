<AbstractNarration>This is a Phase III renewal for the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst) site to continue as a partner institution of I/UCRC for e-Design. UMass Amherst is one of the two founding institutions of the Center for e-Design. The mission and vision of the existing NSF Center for e-Design is to research and develop methods and tools that support the realization of a new design paradigm that can be used to design, develop, and manufacture new engineered products and systems. Research at the Center for e-Design is oriented to application areas where large scale, complex projects are being developed, often involving multiple collaborators at various locations. Application areas include transportation, manufacturing, information technology, and health and safety. Research is categorized into five thrust areas - New Design Paradigms and Processes, Visualization and Virtual Prototyping, Enabling Information Infrastructure, Design Optimization, and Design Education. Research projects address a diverse range of engineering challenges faced by high-tech companies and agencies competing in a global economy. UMass Amherst has a number of faculty and student researchers working in areas that directly support the research thrust areas of the center. The renewal will enable UMass Amherst to continue its research in the advancement of new methods and tools in conceptual design and product innovation, advanced engineering modeling and simulation, digital manufacturing, and medical devices design. UMass ongoing research projects involve projects dealing with integration and application of e-Design methods and tools into commercial design processes, as well as fundamental research projects on sustainability product design and engineering design innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center renewal will enable UMass Amherst to contribute significantly to the successful development and preparation of graduate and undergraduate students. Results from research effort will continue to be integrated into the educational curriculum to enrich the student learning experiences in conceptual design and product innovation, advanced engineering modeling and simulation, and digital manufacturing. Students associated with the Center will receive exceptional career development opportunities that include laboratory and field studies, participation at conferences and workshops, design colloquium series, and journal publications, as well as training in the ethical conduct of research. The PI and other UMass Amherst faculty will continue recruiting underrepresented students, including partnering with a number of university programs aimed at providing research opportunities for these students. Research and educational findings will be disseminated nationally and have significant broader impact through industrial collaboration and technology transfer. The industry partners will continue to benefit from first access to research, royalty-free use of the tools, and the opportunity to license and commercialize technologies. Research and educational findings will continue to be disseminated nationally and have a significant impact on U.S. industry as a whole.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During this phase three performance period, the UMass Amherst site of the NSF I/UCRC Center for e-Design sought to build on the established strengths of the center to address the evolving needs of industry. Over the years, the site completed dozens of projects available to industry members, published dozens of journal and conference papers related to project work, graduated several PhD and master?s degree students, and involved dozens of REU students on the projects. Work in the earlier phases included a novel e-Design framework for engineering knowledge management and a corresponding decision support system for distributed design using semantic web technologies to capture and communicate information related to design and manufacturing.  The latest projects in the portfolio advanced additive and smart manufacturing in some unique ways. One project conducted at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) facilitates characterization and prediction of melt pool size from a metal additive manufacturing process based on scan strategy more accurately than possible before. Another project done in collaboration with Raytheon Company enables acceleration of product development at reduced cost by earlier and more accurate predictions of product system test results, which can improve further new product development. A project completed recently with FTL Labs introduced and published a new AI-based technique to detect and prevent product defects.  An earlier project related to additive manufacturing with Raytheon Company led to new and usable information about causal connections between controllable and factors and resulting properties of interest by means of an experiment conducted with Vero material on a Connex 350 machine.  Such information shared with the industry partner can help to inform design processes about additive manufacturing capabilities and limitations and provide the basis for further experimentation.  Research on ASTM standard test methods generated equipment specifications needed by an industry partner to search for equipment to test additional material properties of interest. A new decision support engineering design process and software tool was introduced and copyrighted to help designers decide correctly at early stages when additive manufacturing should be used. That method published in Journal of Engineering Design.  An earlier project with NIST provided predictive metamodeling methods to facilitate estimation of results in advance when producing metal parts by powder bed fusion additive manufacturing processes.  Another earlier project with FTL Labs supported that industry partner?s development of new software.  The software alerts CAD operators to potential manufacturability problems with visual warnings in the virtual model in advance of production of the metal part by direct energy deposition additive manufacturing processes.  Another recently completed project with FTL Labs developed techniques to improve the fit of prosthetics to human tissue structures.  A project done during this period with Artaic, a producer of custom mosaics, addressed situations of a mixed model of products that require innovative ways to manage inventory that optimize costs and do not impact product delivery times.  The resulting approach was implemented with Artaic by a tool that combines automated forecasting of demand with stochastic representation of inventory to ensure safety stocks and optimization of transportation and inventory carrying costs.   Some other projects fell within advanced design and manufacturing topic areas. One such project addressed a need to develop novel prototype devices and systems that provide haptic feedback to a patient during rehabilitation exercises.  The haptic feedback introduced dynamic forces and motion that a patient can feel and sense for improved cognition rather than merely visual clues that are virtually rendered.  Such a development can be implemented broadly to a diversity of scenarios such as when stroke rehabilitation is necessary.  A recent project with Hill-Rom developed more accurate sensing devices for cases such as bed sores where a greater sensitivity than conventional is required.  Leaders of the UMass Amherst site also established a successful track-record of active collaboration with industry partners and university researchers at sister sites to complement and further enable intellectual contributions in advancing the engineering design field with a particular attention to their broader impacts to industries and engineering discipline. Research during this phase three period led to dozens more publications. Many of the projects received responses from industry members indicating a very high level of interest. These results suggest that significant impacts reached both industry and the academic research community.           Last Modified: 10/19/2020       Submitted by: Sundar Krishnamurty]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
