<AbstractNarration>Motion planning is fundamental problem that need to be solved for a robot to move from one location to another. This problem arises in many domains such as self-driving cars and automated assembly. Motion planning algorithms typically sample configurations of the robot to build a map of the space of robot configurations.  As more computational power becomes available, samples can be placed more quickly, building a better map, but at tremendous cost in memory.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the problem of finding low-memory approximate maps that allow rapid and accurate motion planning.  Methods include mathematical analysis of algorithms, and experiments applying algorithms in simulation. Expected results include new algorithms that allow generation of configuration space maps that require orders of magnitude less space than existing representations.  Expected results also include algorithms for motion planning that make use of these maps, and formal guarantees about quality of motion plans and computational costs of generating maps and plans. These results are expected to advance the understanding of fundamental theoretical characteristics of motion planning.   These results will also have direct practical impact in application areas, including automated manufacturing and self-driving vehicles, by allowing vastly greater computational power to be leveraged to generate maps that can be stored efficiently and transmitted quickly across a network. Results will be disseminated on new motion planning web pages devoted to the project, in international robotics journals, and at international robotics conferences. Anticipated broader impacts of the work include training of the next generation of scientists and engineers at both the undergraduate and graduate level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the central problems for robotics is to automatically plan the motions that allow a robot to achieve a desired task. As greater and greater computational power is applied to motion planning problems, memory becomes a bottleneck. The goal of this project was to capture the essential qualities of a motion-planning problem in a small memory-efficient representation that can be stored, or transmitted across a network.  The primary outcomes of this project are in three areas detailed below: the development of efficient grasp spanners, the study of optimal motion of vehicles among obstacles, and problems of the relationship between path diversity and survival of a group of robots in a dangerous environment.  Graph spanners. In the algorithms community, graph spanning algorithms have been developed that allow some edges to be removed from a graph while maintaining a constant approximation ratio between paths in the original graph and in the reduced graph (the spanner). Work supported as part of this project showed how online spanner algorithms can be adapted to PRMs, allowing sparse roadmaps to be generated very quickly, while maintaining approximation properties.  Optimal trajectories among obstacles. Early work by Xavier and Donald on kino-dynamic motion planning showed that requiring a robot to keep a certain safe distance from obstacles allows the problem of finding optimal trajectories to be well defined and provably solvable. Work under this project extends this idea to prove that even for more complex mobile robot systems, optimal trajectories that remain a certain distance from obstacles exist and can be approximated, if given a black box that can compute optimal trajectories without obstacles. While a fine-grained analysis of the space still requires very much memory, we expect that weaker approximation requirements will lead to much more efficient representations.  Diversity and survival. Even approximately representing all shortest paths in a space requires significant memory, since every point in the space is on the shortest path to somewhere.
