<AbstractNarration>The research group of Dr. Wenjun Du at the Central Michigan University develops new methodologies for preparing a new class of polymers by linking sugar units together and investigates the conditions for controlling the degradation of these polymers.  Sugar-based polymers are potentially compatible with biological systems and useful in biomedical applications.  The degradation of these polymers under controlled conditions to regenerate the monomers allows recycling of the polymer products and, therefore, is environmentally beneficial.  Outreach and educational activities of this project include developing an online course on sustainable polymer for high school teachers, partnering with the Central Michigan Science/Mathematics/Technology Center in organizing outreach activities for K-12 students and teachers, and mentoring graduate and undergraduate students in research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the support of Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of NSF, Dr. Wenjun Du aims to develop synthetic methodogies for preparing degradable polymers by connecting sugar units together via orthoester linkages, thereby circumventing the notoriously challenging syntheses of O-glycosyl linkages.  His research group studies the mechanism, scope and limitation of the polymerization process, explores the synthesis of high molecular weight sugar-based polymers by exploiting the reverse anomeric effect, and investigates the degradation of the sugar poly(orthoesters).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Thanks for the support from NSF, we have successfully accomplished the proposed research objectives and with many breakthroughs in the synthesis of sugar-based polymer from naturally occurring materials such as glucose and galactose.  The carbohydrate-based polymers, as expected, have demonstrated unique properties that are superior to most current polymers, including pH-sensitivity, degradability and biocompatibility. Additionally, to be "truly" sustainable, we have developed a technology that can directly convert the polymers into its original, polymerizable monomer, which can be used to synthesize its parent polymers. Thus we have successfully constructed a closed loop to use the polymers to achieve high degree of sustainability. The major technology breakthroughs include:  1)      Established a novel and efficient method for the synthesis of sugar polymers. The method is robust and can be used in varying sugars including glucose, mannose and galactose. We have also developed a new series of promoters that greatly boosted the efficiency and molecular weights, allowing for a very efficient and controlled synthesis of carbohydrate-based polymers.    2)      Demonstrated that the polymers are superior to current polymers in many aspects, such as biocompatibility, degradability.
