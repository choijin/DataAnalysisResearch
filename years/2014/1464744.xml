<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Patrick J. Walsh at the University of Pennsylvania is developing new reactions that form bonds between two carbon atoms and between a carbon atom and a sulfur atom.  Bonds between these elements are found in pharmaceutical compounds, agricultural products, and polymers, and therefore, the proposed research has the potential to impact their corresponding scientific and technological areas.  The overarching goal is to develop new catalysts and catalytic processes that are both synthetically useful and practical.   Professor Walsh is also studying the reaction mechanisms (i.e., how the reactions work) and the factors that control the chemistry of the catalytic reactions, which will help to optimize the outcomes of the catalysis and to add to our fundamental knowledge base about chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Walsh is specifically addressing the following catalytic transformations: 1) The arylation of sulfenate anions and the enantioselective synthesis of diarylsulfoxides, which are found in a number of commercialized medications, 2) the development of methods to prepare sulfoximines, including in enantioenriched form, and 3) the introduction of a new class of organocatalysts, sulfenate anions, which have potential applications in a number of C-C bond forming reactions.  The broader impacts of this research are in the following areas: 1) The new concepts and synthetic methods introduced herein are expected to have a positive impact on society as they may find application in the preparation of intermediates, medications, agricultural products, or materials in academics or industry, 2) Undergraduate students are gaining experience in chemical research, 3) The PI lectures for high school students about this NSF-supported research 4) The PI disseminates the findings of these investigations by publication and seminars at universities and conferences, and 5) The PI continues an international scientific collaboration outreach program with Mexican scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes: Novel Coupling Reactions     Overview:  The focus of this proposal was the development of new catalyst classes, advancement of novel reactions, and the delineation of their reaction mechanisms (determination of how the reactions work).  Much of the research accomplished in this work involves sulfenate anions (RSO?), which have recently evolved from chemical curiosities to important intermediates and even a novel class of organocatalysts.     The objectives of the proposed investigations were: Objective 1.  To develop the arylation of sulfenate anions and the first catalytic and highly enantioselective synthesis of diarylsulfoxides. Objective 2.  To develop the synthesis of sulfimides. Objective 3.  To develop and implement sulfenate anion organocatalysts.     Intellectual Merit: The making of C?S bonds via the arylation of sulfenate anions is a potentially powerful method to access sulfoxides, which are common in medications.  New methods introduced by the Walsh labs include use of functionalized aryl chlorides (readily available starting materials for the synthesis of organic compounds) for C?S bond formation catalyzed by palladium complexes.  Moreover, enantioselective routes to diaryl and aryl vinyl sulfoxides, which are present in a number of current medications, were developed.                  During this research effort, we realized that sulfenate anions have the potential to be organocatalysts.  Organocatalysts are organic compounds that do not contain transition metals, but yet can promote various bond-forming reactions.  Avoidance of transition metals is useful because some transition metals are very expensive and scarce, and they can be difficult to remove from the final products.  We demonstrated that sulfenate anions are a new class of organocatalysts and their ability to couple benzyl halides to trans-stilbenes under basic conditions was described in publications from this work.

The method is efficient and provides access to polymers that were previously difficult to synthesize.                 The objectives above yielded the following outcomes: 1) The first general method for the catalytic synthesis of highly enantioenriched diaryl sulfoxides 2) Introduction of a new class of organocatalysts, sulfenate anions, which have application in the synthesis of trans-stilbenes and diaryl acetylenes.
