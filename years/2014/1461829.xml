<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funds to support travel expenses for ten speakers and the organizer of a one day symposium on the Mathematical and Computational Aspects of Materials Science, see http://www.siam.org/meetings/cse15/symposium.php. This symposium will take place at the SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CS&amp;E), which will be held in Salt Lake City, Utah on March 14-18, 2015.  The goal of the symposium is to bring together leaders in applied and computational mathematics and materials science in order to develop collaborative projects that will advance the state of the art in materials design and analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In response to the multi-agency Materials Genome Initiative for Global Competitiveness, developed by the U.S. Office of Science and Technology Policy, and to advance their own research agendas, the materials science community has embarked on various large-scale computational projects. These projects offer challenging opportunities for materials scientists to collaborate with mathematical and computational scientists in order to advance the state of the art in materials research and design by developing mathematical models, computational algorithms, and tools for data analysis. The symposium will present an opportunity to look ahead and explore critical areas of materials research where mathematical modeling and numerical simulations can accelerate progress in technologically important areas, such as smart materials and design and evaluation of new ways to store and transmit energy.  In order to keep the focus on accelerating progress, the speakers have been instructed to give forward looking presentations, rather than presentations about their most recent research activities.</AbstractNarration>
