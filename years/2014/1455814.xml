<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation research project will focus on the complex interactions between harvesting practices of forest resources and changes in the quality and availability of the resource, which may engender changes to the ways in which the resource is harvested.  The project will focus on the impact of destructive harvesting of a fruit-bearing tree by felling the tree, a practice through which the destruction of female fruit-bearing trees from wild stands has led to overall population declines and unbalanced sex ratios.  The project will analyze the extent and distribution of the degradation of trees and the ecosystem they occupy, and it will determine whether harvesting practices constitute an artificial selection process that favors economically inferior fruit traits.  The project will assess the potential value of new remote sensing techniques for the analysis of land-cover degradation, thereby improving more general capabilities for environmental monitoring.  It will provide new insights into the role of harvest-based artificial selection on underutilized crops, which will expand knowledge of this general topic beyond its current focus on fishing and hunting and enhance general understanding of natural resource management, ethnobotany, and historical ecology.  Project findings will provide new insights regarding conservation and development in the study area and in many other locales, including those in the U.S., where resource extraction practices are being reconsidered in order to identify economically and environmentally sustainable practices.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The doctoral student undertaking this project will focus his attention on the harvesting of Mauritia flexuosa (Mauritia palm), which is economically and nutritionally important to residents of the Peruvian Amazon.  The study will focus on TWO research questions:  (1) What is the extent and distribution of Mauritia palm swamp degradation from unsustainable harvesting?  (2) Do these extractive pressures lead to an artificial selection in Mauritia flexuosa?  The student hypothesizes that the spatial distribution of resource and ecosystem degradation can be determined by the persistence of declines in the interannual Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).  As populations decline from overharvesting, a correlating drop in NDVI is expected.  Spatial statistics will be used to map hotspots of degradation, and the results will be verified through field surveys.  The student also hypothesizes that ecosystem degradation is decreasing the frequency of desirable phenotypes in Mauritia flexuosa.  The relationship between the expression of these traits and the level of degradation will be analyzed to ascertain whether destructive harvest practices are shaping phenotypic expression through a process of artificial selection.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction  Mauritia flexuosa is an arborescent palm from the flooded forests of the Amazon basin and adjacent regions.  The species is adapted to prolonged periods of inundation and thereby is able to form vast monotypic stands in depression swamps where other perennial species cannot survive.  The flavorful and highly nutritious fruit are extensively consumed in the Loreto region of northeastern Peru.  As the species can grow over thirty meters tall and has a wide and smooth trunk, climbing up to harvest the fruit is very laborious and potentially quite dangerous.  As such, the common practice is to fell the palm and gather its fruits from ground. The increased demand for these fruits in recent decades has led to an extensive degradation of the species in the region.   The consequences are severe for the ecological stability of Mauritia palm swamps, and for the local people who depend on the fruits for their nutritional security and livelihoods.  Prior studies have noted the severity of the degradation of the species from ethnographic reporting and surveys of select sites.  Yet, the extent and distribution of this process has yet to be comprehensively studied across the region.   Methods  The time series analysis is based on the MOD13Q1 dataset from MODIS?s Terra satellite.  These data include vegetation index products at 250 m spatial resolution, provided every 16 days from mid-Febuary 2000 to mid-July 2015.  A Seasonal Kendall trend was run that the combined results of a Mann-Kendall test for each of twenty-three annual periods of the MODIS data.  Specifically, the Mann-Kendall entails a pairwise comparison of EVI values in relation to values of the same period in every preceding year, so that the total number of pairs is equal to (n*(n-1))/2.  If the value of the later year were greater than that of the preceding, a value of 1 was assigned to the pair, -1 if the inverse was true, and 0 if the two were equal. A test statistic was then calculated based on the sum of the pair scores and their count. The presence of an increasing trend was determined by a z-score greater than or equal to 1.96, and a decreasing trend at or below -1.96.  The results were then mapped to show the location and extent of Mauritia swamp degradation over the past fifteen years.  To validate the results of the time-series analysis, a logistic regression model was conducted to determine if the areas of degradation were correlated to variables typical of extractive industries.  The dependent variable was based on the Seasonal Kendall test statistic for significant increasing and decreasing trends, while points falling below the 5% significance level where excluded.  The predictor variables included: distance to Iquitos, distance to towns, topographic position index (TPI), and slope.  The TPI was a proxy for the inundation level of the swamps, as more specific data were not available.   Results  Of the 59,300 km2 of Mauritia palm swamp in the Loreto region of Peru, 25.6% were found to have a significant decreasing trend in EVI from 2000 to 2015, while only 1.7% were increasing.  The logistic regression indicated that the decreasing trends were strongly correlated to accessibility variables (R2 = .195 (Cox &amp; Snell), .260 (Nagelkerke), n = 259161, &chi;2 = 433.9, p &lt; .001).  The most influential variables wee the TPI followed by the fixed effects variable for local variation, while distance to settlements and the central market of Iquitos held less predicative power. Based on these results it is probable that 12,715 km2 or 25.59% of Mauritia palm swamps in the region were degraded from 2000 to 2015.  Additionally, 24,723 km2 or 49.77% may have been impacted before 2000, while only 12,242 km2 or 24.64% remains intact.  Discussion       The study indicates that at least a quarter of the Mauritia palm swamps have been impacted over the past fifteen years.  Surprisingly, the distribution is less concentrated around the Iquitos, the central market for the fruit, than had been expected.  Even proximity to the communities that harvest the fruit was less influential of a variable than had been thought.  The reason is like that the availability of low cost transportation by boat along the network of rivers that cover this section of the Amazon.  Furthermore, the importance of the TPI was unanticipated.  The results suggest that the largest determinant of degradation is the relative elevation.  Extraction is concentrated along low rises, while the harvesters avoided the deeper sections of the swamps.  Though the findings show the serious impact overharvesting has had on M. flexuosa communities, there is a silver lining.  The degradation is fairly dispersed and harvesters are leaving intact less accessible patches.  As such, degraded populations should be more able to regenerate on their own from these reservoirs.                   Last Modified: 10/06/2016       Submitted by: Tyler Rundel]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
