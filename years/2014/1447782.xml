<AbstractNarration>Descriptive representation within the academic profession is important to perceptions of legitimacy, service to students, and development of knowledge.  Diversity in relevant characteristics across groups contributes to better deccisionmaking. Universities need to consider how best to retain excellent faculty and promote development across demographic groups.  Attrition from the profession varies by demographic characteristics.  One way to contribute to diversification within the profession is to evaluate the applicability of knowledge concerning what works in coalition building and what the outcomes might be.  This workshop will bring together scholars from different universities, at different stages in their careers to build coalitions to deepen intellectual engagement, develop intellectual cross-fertilization and collaboration, and to build coalitions to support excellence in diversifying the profession throughout careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By applying the scholarship on diversity within organizations, effective coalition building, and outcomes in agendas, this workshop will contribute to developing diversity across the career course in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project expanded knowledge and identified strategies that serve to increase the presence of underrepresented women social scientists in leadership positions in colleges and universities. The key findings of the project are that coalitions of women and other underrepresented groups in academe can come together, identify shared interests, and act on those interests so as to advance the place of women and members of other underrepresented groups. The project achieved those outcomes and established those findings in multiple ways: holding a 2015 workshop; organizing a short course at a 2015 national conference (of the American Political Science Association, APSA); developing a website enabling ongoing communication among academics and with the public; turning over a portion of its website to the APSA Committee on the Status of Women in the Profession; contributing a paper to a 2016 mini-conference organized by a longstanding leader in the political science profession; and hosting a dinner at the 2017 APSA Meetings for colleagues leading status committees and caucuses of underrepresented groups. In addition, the project offered professional development opportunities to its two graduate research assistants, both women. The 2016 conference paper will be published as a chapter in an edited book, thus further disseminating the project's findings. Broadly, by contributing to diversity in academe, this project served national economic interests.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/16/2017<br>      Modified by: Carol&nbsp;Mershon</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
