<AbstractNarration>This 2-year research project focuses on investigating the fate of oceanic crust and tectonic plates that dive into Earth's interior at subduction zones.  Earth's convecting mantle transports the former crust to the deep interior, and eventually back up to the surface.  This work specifically seeks to understand the chemistry, structure, and dynamics of oceanic crust in Earth's lower mantle. Plate tectonics and thus subduction-currents carrying crust into the deep mantle are an ongoing process; thus better understanding the distribution of, the dynamics of, and chemistry of deeply transported crust uniquely provides a window into the chemical and dynamical evolution of Earth's mantle as a whole. Past work clearly establishes how the mantle might convect, viable deep mantle minerals, and that there are seismically detected heterogeneities.  This work builds upon these ideas by seeking to connect them via studying a known input into the system of unique chemistry: the oceanic crust. This work has broad impact, since the mantle's evolution ultimately plays a role in the chemical and thermal evolution of the oceans and atmosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A multidisciplinary approach is adopted for this project, since (a) high pressure mineral physics in the diamond anvil cell can investigate the properties of former crust and sediments (e.g., melt) at conditions 1000's of km deep in Earth's mantle; (b) how former crust interacts with convective flow and structures, including deep compositional reservoirs, hot mantle plumes, and deep mantle chemistries can be explored with state-of-the-art numerical convection experiments; and (c) former oceanic crust may relate to structures observed with modern array seismology methods that have unknown mineralogy, including thin ultra low seismic wave speed zones at the bottom of the mantle, as well as massive continent-sized zones of low shear wave velocities beneath the Pacific  and Atlantic Oceans. The multidisciplinary proposed work will include a strong co-mentoring approach among the team of PIs for the graduate student and postdoctoral researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was a multidisciplinary effort focused on better understanding the destiny of ocean crust that is convected into the deep mantle as part of the plate tectonic process. The chemical composition of the mid-oceanic basalt has changed over the geological history because of secular cooling of the mantle.  Therefore, the subducting slabs have injected basalts in different chemical compositions over billions of years of time scale.  The funded investigators spanned the disciplines of seismology, mineral physics, and geodynamics. The seismology investigations involved mapping seismic wave energy that reflects from small scale heterogeneities.  This research with postdoctoral researcher Dan Frost identified small heterogeneities with tendency to group near large low velocity structures in the deepest mantle, similar to predictions of geodynamic calculations by Mingming Li that studied subducted oceanic crust. The mineral physics component to the research involved 9 trips to a synchrotron facility for in situ measurements of two ancient basaltic crust compositions.  The mineral physics experiments showed the physical properties of the subducting oceanic basalt layer should have changed with time because of differences in mineralogy.  The finding has important implications for the mantle dynamics and properties and therefore behaviors of basaltic layer in subducting slabs have been assumed to be independent of time in geodynamic simulations.  The different mineralogy we found in Archean basalts in the lower mantle will also alter the seismic properties of the subducted basalt materials.  Because they have been injected to the lower mantle and they should contribute to the seismic heterogeneities in the region.  In fact, the seismic findings found a broad spectrum of heterogeneities in size and strength, which is compatible with the mineral physics work.  The seismic mapping also noted that the small heterogeneities are found throughout the mantle.  This indicates that subducted oceanic crust can continue in the convection cycle and return to the upper mantle. This is consistent with geodynamic findings that find trace element signatures of subducted oceanic crust in some hot spot lavas.   Several research papers were published, with others in preparation, that summarize this work and acknowledge this funding.
