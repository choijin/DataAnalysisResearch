<AbstractNarration>The ability to respond and adapt to current environmental or social condition, depends to a large extent of the flexibility to make behavioral, physiological and neurological changes.  An area of great interest is the plasticity of the brain to change in response to new challenges. One of the greatest examples of this ability is seen in fish that are capable of switching from female-to-male or male-to-female either behavioral or phenotypically. This occurs when changes in the population, loss of males or females increase the ability to reproduce by changing. In species with socially-controlled sex change and/or role change, the brain perceives alterations in the social environment that indicate it is favorable for these changes and therefore "permissive". This is observed in the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), a Caribbean coral reef fish with a lek-like mating system in which territorial-terminal phase (T-TP) males defend spawning territories for access to females and breed with multiple females. Removal of a T-TP male from a spawning territory creates a permissive environment that induces sex change in the largest female or male role change in the largest non-territorial male, either an initial phase (IP) male or non-territorial-terminal phase (NT-TP) male. This research will examine the role androgen hormones in response to changing social influences to promote behavioral and phenotypic changes. These types of studies are important as they have the ability to demonstrate the constraint of social interactions and the brains ability to change to when constraints are left or there are major changes in the environment.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within minutes-to-hours of removing a bluehead wrasse T-TP male from its territory, changes in the brain of the largest female, IP male, or NT-TP male induce T-TP male-typical behaviors, such as courtship of females and agonistic behavior directed at other males. Changes in the brain also activate the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, causing transformation of female ovaries or IP male testes into TP male testes. Androgen production, particularly of 11KT, rises during gonadal transformation in both females and subordinate males during sex and role change. While previous studies show 11KT increases are not necessary for behavioral changes, other observations nevertheless suggest this androgen may play an important role. The neuropeptide vasotocin (homologue of vasopressin in mammals) appears responsible for early behavioral changes. However, could the presence of 11KT induce earlier onset of behavioral changes and increase the display of T-TP male-typical behaviors? NT-TP males have higher baseline levels of 11KT than IP males and females and appear to transition into the role of T-TP male faster. Is 11KT responsible for faster role change? The researchers hypothesize that 11KT promotes behaviors and gene expression profiles typical of T-TP phase males under permissive social conditions. Using a combination of capture/tag-and-release/recapture approaches, hormonal manipulations via gonadectomy and 11KT implantation, behavioral observations of tagged individuals, 11KT serum assays, and gene expression analysis via qRT-PCR, this study will test whether 1) significant differences exist in the timing, frequency, and duration of T-TP male-typical behaviors among females, IP males, and NT-TP males undergoing sex and role change under permissive conditions, 2) gonadal presence affects T-TP male-typical behaviors and gene expression of the vasotocin system and two other neuropeptide systems, kisspeptin and gonadotropin-releasing hormone, during sex and role change, and 3) 11KT promotes T-TP male-typical behaviors and gene expression of these neuropeptide systems during sex and role change. This study will help determine whether 11KT confers an advantage for individuals competing to become the territorial phenotype</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span>Two of the most dramatic and beneficial changes to have evolved in some animal groups, including in many families of marine fishes, are 1) the development of multiple alternative mating phenotypes, apart from just one male and one female phenotype, that can compete for mating access to individuals of the opposite sex in strategically different ways, and 2) the ability of individuals of one phenotype to change sex or role (if changing phenotype within the same sex) to another phenotype. When both of these characteristics are present within a species, the species is said to possess "plastic alternative mating phenotypes", also known as "plastic alternative reproductive tactics". A well-studied example of such a species is the bluehead wrasse (</span><em>Thalassoma bifasciatum</em><span>), a Caribbean coral reef fish that displays three phenotypes based on body morphology and reproductive strategies: yellow-bodied initial phase (IP) females, yellow-bodied IP males, and dominant blue/green-bodied terminal phase (TP) males. TP males can also be separated into two behavioral classes: nonterritorial TP (NT-TP) and territorial TP (T-TP).</span></p> <p><span>Bluehead wrasse T-TP males are the largest, most dominant individuals on the reefs and successfully defend spawning territories for access to females. The reproductive success per day of T-TP males is highest among behavioral phenotypes. NT-TP males are generally slightly smaller than T-TP males and are unable to defend spawning territories, but opportunistically court and spawn with females when T-TP males are briefly absent from their spawning territories. IP males look and behave like females in order to avoid detection by aggressive T-TP males, but will sneak-spawn (spawn with a female while a T-TP male is away from his spawning site) or streak-spawn (release sperm while a TP male and female are spawning) with females when possible, or, on larger reefs, group-spawn in large aggregates of 5-20+ IP males to one female. The reproductive success of IP males is lower than that of TP males and females on small-to-medium sized reefs, where TP males dominate access to females. Small-to-medium sized reefs were the focal reefs of this project. Females spawn two out of every three days on average, either with IP male(s) or a TP male. There is a strong selective pressure for individuals to increase their reproductive success by becoming T-TP male, and the bluehead wrasse is one species that has evolved the ability to change sex or male role to do so. When T-TP males permanently disappear from their spawning territories, the largest individuals on a reef (NT-TP male, IP male, or female) can replace the T-TP males, with a nearly 1:1 replacement. The first sign of sex change or role change upon removal of T-TP males is dramatic changes in behavior, including increased aggression directed at smaller individuals, and increased sexual behavior typical of T-TP males. These changes in behavior generally appear on the same day as T-TP male removal. For females that change sex, ovaries break down and are completely replaced by testis tissue with mature sperm by 8-10 days. Circulating levels of the potent androgen 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) from the new testis tissue start to rise at day 4-5 of sex change and produce blue and green coloration. 11KT levels also rise in IP males that change role to T-TP male, and are responsible for color changes from yellow to blue and green. Importantly, it was previously shown that behavioral sex change from female to T-TP male can occur in the absence of gonads, and gonadectomized females show similar behavioral frequencies on day 1 of sex change to that of females with intact ovaries. Thus, the brain perceives social conditions and can entirely and rapidly promote behavioral changes wit</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">hout the input of gonadal signals, including gonadal androgens.
