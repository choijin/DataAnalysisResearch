<AbstractNarration>The primary goal of the US Ignite is to break a fundamental deadlock: there is insufficient investment in gigabit applications that can take advantage of advanced network infrastructure because such infrastructure is rare and dispersed. And conversely, there is a lack of broad availability of advanced broadband infrastructure for open experimentation and innovation because there are few advanced applications and services to justify it.  US Ignite applications are focused on national priority areas of advanced manufacturing, clean energy and transportation, cyber learning, health IT, and public safety/emergency preparedness.  Many of the applications under development in this program build on NSF-funded advanced networking and computational infrastructure developed as part of the NSF GENI program.  All of the projects demonstrate the value of advanced networking.   This project supports the 2nd annual US Ignite Application Summit, an event which will demonstrate the next generation applications currently being developed, educate a broad community on the  potential for next-generation application capabilities and recruit cities and individuals for the next round of application development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Applications Summit is being held June 24-27, 2014, in Sunnyvale, CA.  This project supports academic and student participation in the Summit, and helps offset the costs of hosting the event and disseminating results.</AbstractNarration>

The eventÃ†s purpose was two-fold: education and community building.  The Summit hosted keynote speakers, panel presentations, BarCamp-styled education sessions, and showcased 30 demonstrations of advanced networking public benefit applications. Juniper Networks hosted the event at its facilities, and a special event was hosted at the Computer History Museum.  The diverse group heard from communities with deployed advanced networks and gave participants a "first" look at the transformative power of next-generation technologies. These "firsts" were "things" that had not previously been demonstrated or seen before, such as:  First deployed virtualization demos First gigabit wireless at a conference  First national demo of SightDeck for      telehealth  First workshop and demo of super-locavore      technology Paradrop  First demo of phone containers with secure      connection to apps (SeaCAT) Flying WiFi trunking to provide disaster      coverage (Drone-Carried On-demand WiFi) First coast-to-coast forensically-pulled      RAM (Cyber Security as a Service)   The highlights were the 30 application demonstrations. To recognize the greatest achievements, US Ignite presented the following Summit awards:  1.         Best App in Show: ChildrenÃ†s Mercy Hospital with SightDeck, which provides interactive collaboration with video, voice and graphics from several locations all layered together, visually organized into a real size, real time, intuitive work platform.  2.         Best App in App Expo: Foresite Health Monitoring by ProactiveSense, an application that uses advanced monitoring technology to analyze in-depth data to accurately predict and prevent health issues such as: falls, heart problems, depression, strokes, respiratory problems, urinary tract infections and more.  3.         Best App in Health:  Fitnet, a telefitness application connecting fitness coaches to clients with on demand and real time collaboration.  4.         Best App in Energy:  Secure WAMS, which demonstrated cyber-security mechanisms for wide-area monitoring and control of next-generation power grids.  5.         Best App in Public Safety: Cyber Security as a Service, which provides effective digital forensic / cyber security techniques from across the country.  6.         Best App in Education: Augmented Reality for Improved Training of First Responders  7.         Most Likely to Have a Big Impact: Virtual World Framework, which provides an HTML5 based virtual world collaborative environment and virtual world construction environment.  8.         Best Use of Software Defined Networking:  Paradrop,  a virtualized platform for home WiFi gateways that allows diverse third-party services (e.g., home automation) to be easily installed and managed.  9.         Best Use of Locavore Infrastructure: Timely Health indicators using Remote sensing &amp; Innovation for the Vitality of the Environment (THRIVE) can provide a daily global high resolution picture of environmental composition relevant to health.  10.       Best Use of Advanced Wireless - Drone-carried On-demand WiFi Networks provide in-time, reliable and high-speed WiFi access at emergencies, public events, and rural areas when such infrastructures are destr...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
