<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is in bringing the next generation of anticorrosion paints to market, with higher protection efficiency and greater environmental friendliness than the current anticorrosion paints.  The direct cost of corrosion accounts for 3-5% of a country's GDP worldwide.  To reduce the huge economic lost, it is highly desirable to develop more effective anticorrosion technologies. The most effective anticorrosion pigments in use today are heavy metal pigments, such as chromates, lead compounds, and zinc/zinc compounds.   Environmental, health, and safety concerns are driving the elimination of heavy metal pigments.  The coating is based on conductive polymer dispersion.  The use of conductive polymers has opened up a range of new applications.  But the poor processibility of conductive polymers has stymied the growth of applications such as electrostatic dissipation, electromagnetic interference shielding, static resistant fibers, conductive inks, toners, and adhesives, etc. Successful development of conductive polymer dispersion in this project may also enable these broader applications of conductive polymers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Corrosion of metals is an electrochemical reaction process that produces both cations and anions, and accelerates by the aggressive anions in the environment.   Generally it is assumed that organic coatings act as barriers to water and oxygen at the coating - environment interface.  We have determined that the limiting factor in barrier coatings is their resistance to the ionic current.  The present proposal suggests developing a heavy metal free ion barrier anticorrosion coating system:  conductive polymer nano-particle pigmented epoxy primer with a topcoat. The combination of the primer and topcoat constructs a barrier to both anions and cations, that inhibits the electrochemical corrosion reaction, therefore, provides efficient corrosion protection to the metal.  If present proposed research succeeds, it will demonstrate how an ion barrier coating works, and how to formulate an ion barrier anticorrosion coating, and lead to the next generation of anticorrosion coating - the ion barrier anticorrosion coatings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report   Uniform dispersal of conductive polymers in a coating formulation has been a long standing challenge.  Dispersing conductive polymers in an epoxy resin has been even a greater challenge.  This NSF phase I project successfully developed a uniform dispersion of polyaniline, a conductive polymer, in an epoxy resin.  The dispersion together with filers, additives, and solvents was formulated as polyaniline-epoxy primer coating that served as a barrier to cations.  The primer coating with a previously developed topcoat that serves as a barrier to anions, was then combined with it to develop our heavy-metal free anti-corrosion coating system.  The system was characterized by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and was tested by accelerated corrosion test following ASTM B 117 internationla testing standard.  Two commerical heavy-metal pigmented anti-corrosion coatings including an epoxy zinc phosphate system and an epoxy zinc rich systems were also tested as controls. The 2,000 hrs ASTM B 117 exposure test results showed that the heavy-metal free anti-corrosion system developed under this grant performed as well as the two commercial heavy-metal pigmented anti-corrosion system that  scribe, red rust, blisering ratings were identical or better.  The pore resistant Kp value from EIS experiments is over 109 Ohm for the ion barrier coatings, and 108 Ohm for the commerical coatings.  The higher Kp value indicate that our heavy-metal free system may provide a longer protection than the two commerical heavy-metal pigmented coatings.  The broader impact of this potential anti-corrosion coating is likely to be considerable.  Environmental, health, and safety concerns are prompting the elimination of heavy-metal pigments wherever possible.  this project initiated an environmentally-friendly anti-corrosion coating sytem for replacing the traditional heavy-metal pigmented epoxy based high performance anti-corrosion coating systems and beyond. When fully developed, the anti-corrosion coating product would not only reduce toxicity introduced by current heavy-metal based anti-corrosion pigments, but also provide much improved corrosion protection and coating efficiency.  In particular, it could serve as a replacement of the epoxy based zinc-rich primer coating systems that are widely used on highway, marine, and energy infrastructures with fraction of current coating thickness.  The capability of uniformly dispersing environmentally friendly conductive polymers should also enable open up a range of new applications beyond anti-corrosion coatings.  The application could include those for electrostatic dissipation, electronmagnetic interference shielding, static resistant fibers, conductive fibers, conductive inks/toners, conductive adhesives, sensors or bio sensors.
