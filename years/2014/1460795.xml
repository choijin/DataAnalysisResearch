<AbstractNarration>Over the last century, the northeastern United States has experienced significant warming (~1.1Â°C), and a number of record high temperatures have been set around the region in recent years. Despite the massive impacts given the dense populations in this region, we do not fully understand the extent to which the trends reflect radiative forcing versus natural decadal-scale variability. Paleoclimate data provide opportunities to observe the climate system at decadal time scales that are not available from instrumental data alone, but there are currently no long-timescale, high-resolution proxy temperature data from this region that might help discern the relative influence of these factors in determining decadal temperature trends. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research-- a collaborative effort between scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University-- will develop annually-resolved reconstructions of late Holocene temperature from the northeastern United States using living and subfossil Atlantic White Cedar trees. This species is temperature-sensitive, long-lived, and well-preserved in wetland environments. The resulting reconstructions will be used to characterize variability in regional temperatures at time scales from interannual to millennial, to evaluate climate model simulations over the last millennium, and identify the signature of internal, remote, and global forcing on the climate of the northeastern United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides long-term context for recent seasonal temperature extremes in the northeastern United States, and in particular along the coast and the very urbanized Boston-to-New York corridor, where high temperatures have important public health and ecosystem impacts. Funding supports student research at the doctoral and undergraduate level, as well as public outreach to regional citizen scientists and professionals focused on the environment.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Over the life of this reward, we have collected hundreds of samples of living trees to complete a network from the northern range margin of Atlantic whitecedar to populations in South Carolina. Additionally, we have recovered hundreds of tree samples buried in wetlands and coastal ecosystems that give at least 1000 years of history of tree growth, climate history, and ecosystem dynamics. Some of the more ancient samples represent the oldest-known individuals for the species, giving us the opportunity to better study an important species and ecosystem of concern that is embedded in the densely-populated region of the eastern United States.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Analysis of these samples have taught us important things about the climate history of the Northeastern US, climatic vulnerability, and natural history of the Atlantic whitecedar ecosystem. First, our reconstruction of temperature history from Atlantic whitecedar tree rings have revealed that the warming in recent decades is starting to create winter and spring temperatures that are above the long-term mean for the region. Due to its historical value as a commercial species, the current age of Atlantic whitecedar in the northeastern US landscape dates back to a period of heavy timber extraction, the late 1800s. As such, our current record of temperature history limits our ability to full understand the Little Ice Age and the transition from that period into the era of anthropogenic warming.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We discovered over the course of this research project that the combination of tree-ring records from Atlantic whitecedar and other tree species seems to potentially improve reconstructions of climate history. Species such as eastern white pine, tulip poplar, and pignut hickory add power to reconstructions of past temperatures. If our findings hold true moving forward, scientists can sample in species-rich regions, like east Asia, can make temperature reconstructions where temperature reconstructions using traditional methods have been more difficult. Records from other tree species have the potential to assist in making records of temperature history that could predate colonialization of eastern North America.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The collection of ancient Atlantic whitecedar samples from wetland sediments has improved our understanding regarding the natural history and longevity of this species. We simply do not know how long this species can live because of intensive logging in the 19<sup>th</sup>century. Ancient samples are now showing us this species can easily live 300-500 years, nearly twice as long as most living Atlantic whitecedar in today&rsquo;s landscape. This is important because, if this species is tolerant of future environmental change (as we describe in the next paragraph), Atlantic whitecedar trees that now live in nature preserves and other protected settings could be enjoyed by the children of our great-grandchildren as well as the wildlife, fungi, and plants that make up the Atlantic whitecedar ecosystem.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our analysis of individual Atlantic whitecedar growth from central Maine to central South Carolina indicates potential resilience in the face of climatic change. Growth of inland Atlantic whitecedar trees in New England might benefit from future warming. Atlantic whitecedar populations south of Maryland look to have substantial resiliency in regards to future warming: growth of some trees in each population might benefit from warming while others in the same population might decline with warming. Unexpectedly, populations in the Mid-Atlantic Coast region look to be the most vulnerable. While warmer winters would likely enhance growth of most Atlantic whitecedar in the region, hotter summer days might decrease growth by increasing the drought stress of these trees. Our analysis indicates that most of the Mid-Atlantic trees we sampled have the same climatic response, hypothetically making them more vulnerable to warming. This result, however, could be the result of several factors, including stand density and the legacy of past logging as well as an artifact of our sampling method. Future research is required to better understand why the Mid-Atlantic populations appear to be most vulnerable to future climatic change.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, our team, a combination of three senior scientists, two female PhD students, an early career scientist, and multiple technicians, joined forces to analyze these data and present how climate change is impacting the heavily-populated northeastern US to a wide range of audiences. Additionally, this team effort has identified and presented to a wide range of audiences ways to improve reconstructions of climate in regions similar to the northeastern US. Our team also determined that the populations of Atlantic whitecedar in the New York City region might be populations that the greatest concern on the impacts of future climatic change. All young scientists who worked on this progress are making strides in their careers. The two technicians are now Ph.D. students.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/03/2018<br>      Modified by: Neil&nbsp;Pederson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1460795/1460795_10266022_1538596643723_JessiePearlAtlanticWhiteCedarSaplingWestminster2015--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1460795/1460795_10266022_1538596643723_JessiePearlAtlanticWhiteCedarSaplingWestminster2015--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Jessie Pearl pointing to potentially old Atlantic white cedar"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1460795/1460795_10266022_1538596643723_JessiePearlAtlanticWhiteCedarSaplingWestminster2015--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Jessie Pearl pointing to potentially old Atlantic white cedar"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Jessie Pearl, Ph.D. candidate at the University of Arizona, pointing potentially old Atlantic whitecedar in Westminster Cedar Swamp in central Massachusetts.
