<AbstractNarration>The proposal seeks financial support for a Nanoscale Science and Engineering (NSE) grantees conference to be held at the Westin Hotel, in Arlington, VA, on December 9 and 10, 2014.&lt;br/&gt;Nano technology has grown over the years and diversified into a multitude of spin-off technologies. The yearly grantees conference helps evaluate the recent progress made in this discipline, and discuss current challenges, while bridging together this diverse research community.&lt;br/&gt;The conference is planned as a two-day meeting, and the agenda includes keynote speakers, poster presentations and roundtable panel discussions. This will promote dissemination of recent research results to the community, and enable discussions on the impact of the technology on society. The meeting enables networking between researchers and facilitate future collaborations. Specific focused areas include quantum effects, self-assembly, nanophotonics and nanobiology. Additionally the discussions will include potential technology transfer to the commercial sector.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This was a review and research networking workshop held Dec 9 and 10, 2014 that highlighted ongoing research and educational activities of the NSF NSE grant programs. The leading goals for this two day conference were to promote dissemination of innovative research progress, to facilitate research partnerships, and to identify future research directions. The conference consisted of two days of keynote talks and companion panel discussions in specific research areas, working lunches, posters presentations, and presentations from 8 center directors. The first day emphasized progress in Fundamental Concepts and Theories: Quantum Effects; Self Assembly, Nanophotonics; and Nanoscale Simulations. The second day emphasized  Progress in integration: NSEC Class of 2014; Modeling and simulation, nanoinformatics, nanoengineering; Societal aspects.  The keynote presentations and associated panels focused on six topics, Quantum Effects, Self-Assembling, Nanophotonics, Nanobiotechnology, Society Aspects of Nanotechnology, and Nanometer Scale Modeling and Simulation.  Broader Impacts - Intellectual, Industrial and Societal: Roundtable discussions promoted new interdisciplinary partnerships and identified future directions for research, education, networking, business interactions, environmental health and safety, nanomanufacturing, and societal impact. Broader Impacts - Educational: The posters included research currently being done by students and postdocs supported by various NSF projects. The conference format allowed these students to interact with other researchers, and gain a broader view of the NSF NSE activities through the various presentations. This workshop was followed by a companion workshop that focused on educational activities and issues.               Last Modified: 01/30/2016       Submitted by: Donald W Brenner]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
