<AbstractNarration>The PIs propose to address the difficulty of developing a small, low power, highly sensitive molecular biology tool for oceanographic work with the novel implementation of a sensor technology known as Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF). The TIRF provides rapid, sensitive, simultaneous, and cost-effective detection of multiple biochemical targets with minimal sample preparation.  This EAGER proposal seeks funding to explore the feasibility of modifying an existing technology developed by MBio Diagnostics, Inc., consisting of a cartridge and reader system in order to achieve either a smaller form factor, an increased sample capacity, or both. This modified TIRF technology will be designed for integration with an AUV-based sample acquisition/processing module that will provide for underway generation of biological data in support of oceanographic applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TIRF-based sensor is one of several emerging technologies that promise to transform ocean science by providing the ability to carry out interactive experiments and test hypotheses remotely at the molecular level. It has the potential for providing real or near-real time data revealing not only species? presence and abundance, but also the metabolic and physiological status of those organisms at the biochemical and molecular levels, can provide new insights into how populations are responding in situ to their environment over time as conditions change. This project will continue to build international collaborations with the UK and Ireland. It will include 4 undergraduate and 3 graduate student participation in both the US and Ireland. A workshop will be organized in Belfast as well as using these development experiences as part of an on-line module for a Masters in Diagnostics (University Arizona).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A goal in both biomedicine and environmental monitoring is to perform quick, inexpensive assays to identify organisms and/or organism products. Tests that look for multiple targets are even more valuable, as more information can be gleaned from a single sample.  The primary activity of this NSF-EAGER project was to explore the feasibility of modifying an existing technology used in biomedicine, Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF), and couple that to an instrument developed primarily for use in the ocean sciences, the third generation (3G) Environmental Sample Processor (ESP). The 3G ESP is being developed through leveraged funding to operate in a variety of environments, in particular, as a payload sensor in a long-range autonomous underwater vehicle (LRAUV). If the TIRF system, currently designed as a commercial product by MBio, can be made smaller and with increased analytical capacity (i.e., more sample processing), its incorporation into a mobile platform would provide analytical capabilities not seen before in oceanography.   The first part of this project was to understand the requirements of the current TIRF system, and create a preliminary engineering design that would allow the 3G ESP ?front end? and TIRF ?back end? to connect through an injection loop.  The ultimate goal is to create a merged system capable of deployment as an instrument within an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV).    The second part of this project was to modify components of the 3G ESP ?front end?, in particular, the cartridges that collect sample from the environment and prepare the sample for analysis.  Much was asked of these cartridges, as they were self-contained reagent delivery/waste systems, that must heat and lyse sample, as well as push the final product off cartridge and on to the analytical TIRF module.   They also must do this consistently regardless of sea pressure between 0m and 300m depth.  These cartridges were developed with other funding; EAGER funds were used to engineer modifications required for connecting to the TIRF sensor.   The final portion of the project was to demonstrate a working, end-to-end bench-top system.  This required multiple testing of the TIRF system to ensure compatibility with the preparation chemistry used in the 3G ESP.  The ultimate test came when raw seawater was filtered and processed by the 3G ESP cartridge and autonomously moved to the TIRF system.  These results were compared to those processed manually on the bench.  All tests showed equivalent results to bench standards. This equivalency was found for several harmful algae species (Alexandrium catenella, Pseudo-nitzschia spp, and Microcystis spp.), as well as for the algal toxins domoic acid and microcystis.   We now know that the sample preparation protocols used by the 3G ESP will work with MBio?s TIRF technology.  The next step will be development work to modify the TIRF form-factor so it will fit within the LRAUV. Having both a persistent presence unperturbed by sea-state or weather, and the ability to autonomously move around the sea, will transform both the questions we ask and answers we receive in the ocean sciences.
