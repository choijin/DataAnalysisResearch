<AbstractNarration>This award supports the conduct of an National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program Proposal Writing Workshop. The workshop will be held at the University of Maryland on April 7 and 8, 2014. It is expected that there will be about 150 attendees. The workshop will have a one-and-a-half-day format including a training session on good proposal writing practices, talks by previous CAREER awardees, a mock CAREER proposal panel review, and a review session during which the attendees will have a chance to obtain reviews on project summaries of their own draft CAREER proposals. The attendees will also have an opportunity to interact with NSF Program Directors both one-on-one and in mock panels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will help to prepare young faculty for careers in education by giving them tools and skills of good proposal writing and by preparing them to write and submit better CAREER proposals. The results of the workshop include training for young faculty, better opportunity for young faculty with an emphasis on women and minority faculty, higher award success rates for the attendees, and ultimately better research resulting from better written proposals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Outcomes of the 2014 NSF CAREER Proposal Writing Workshop Sponsored by the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation (CMII) of the National Science Foundation, the CAREER Proposal Writing Workshop was initiated in 2004 and has been held each year thereafter. The Workshop aims to provide future CAREER proposal submitters with proposal review experience and interactions with NSF program directors and recent CAREER awardees to improve their proposal writing capability. Since its inception, the Workshop has been widely recognized as an excellent venue for educating next generation academic researchers. Participation in mock panel review sessions and interactions with other workshop participants have been recognized as the major benefit to attendees of the Workshop.  The 2014 NSF CAREER Proposal Writing Workshop was held in East Hyattsville, Maryland on April 7 and 8, 2014.  The University of Maryland served as the local host.  The workshop attracted a total of 162 junior faculty members from 95 different universities. 93 of the participants were from underrepresented groups and 130 of the applicants planned to submit their CAREER proposal to CMMI.     During the Workshop, NSF program directors and recent NSF CAREER awardees shared their insight and experience on how to write a winning proposal. The participants were then grouped into individual mock review panels that are designed to simulate the actual proposal review process at NSF.  Through such intensive participation in the process and interactions with other participants, an environment was created to promote and facilitate collaborations among the Workshop participants. Such collaborations are likely to positively affect their future career development as researchers and teachers. This in turn helps develop the human resources of the nation, thus broadly impacts society at large.    Workshop Evaluation  A survey was conducted immediately after the workshop to gather participantsÆ evaluation of the workshop. 131 of the 162 attendees participated in the survey.  The following results are highlighted:  94 percent of the participants who rated the workshop rated what they learned from the workshop as either a four or five on a five point scale (5 is Very Satisfactory and 1 is Very Unsatisfactory). 109 attendees would "Definitely" recommend the Workshop to future CAREER proposal submitters and 20 more attendees gave a rating of 4 out of 5 on this scale.  Altogether, 98 percent of the attendees who completed the survey gave a very positive response to the question of whether they would recommend this workshop to future CAREER proposal submitters. 122 attendees (93 percent) gave an overall rating of the Workshop as "Very Good" or "Excellent."     Post Workshop Results Since the Completion of the Workshop Until May 2016  Of the 162 participants, 65 participants have earned at least one NSF grant as PI or co-PI within two years of the conclusion of this workshop.  Of this group, 20 participants have earned CAREER awards, 46 have earned other NSF grants as a PI, and 20 have earned NSF grants as a co-PI.
