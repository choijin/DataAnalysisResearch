<AbstractNarration>The 2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM) will be held in Toronto, Canada, April 27-May 2, 2014. This preeminent technical conference is the primary venue for presenting new research results in the area of computer communications, and is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the field. Attending conferences such as INFOCOM is very important for the career development of graduate students. Participants have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with hundreds of others performing leading-edge research in the field. This proposal requests funding to support approximately 20 graduate students in the United States to attend this premier conference. Graduate students, in particular women and underrepresented minority students, will be supported, since attending conferences is an important part of their educational experience and they often have limited travel funds.</AbstractNarration>
