<AbstractNarration>This project will document several dialects of Koryak, a severely endangered Chukotko-Kamchatkan language spoken in the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia by 1,670 speakers spread across at least eight dialects. The researcher will gather data that will greatly enhance our understanding of the Chukotko-Kamchatkan family and lead to cross-dialect and cross-linguistic comparison. The Chukotko-Kamchatkan language family is of interest because it shares features with languages on either side of the Bering Strait, which bridges the Old and New Worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the direction of Marianne Mithun from the University of California, Santa Barbara, Dibella Wdzenczny will document dialects of Koryak, including Paren, Achaivayam, Kamen, and Srednie Pakhachi, all severely endangered, under- documented, and surprisingly distinctive in their grammars.  Through comparative analysis of the grammar and lexicon of these divergent dialects, Wdzenczny will attempt a reconstruction of Proto-Koryak grammar and trace the historical spread of the Koryak language and people throughout the peninsula. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speakers are keenly aware of language loss and are very interested in preservation efforts.  To support these efforts, Wdzenczny is working with Kamchatkan-run institutions, such as the Palana Okrug Archive, to preserve and archive recordings of different Koryak dialects.  Her work will also provide data for pedagogical and reading materials being created for various Koryak dialects.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span>This project was created to gather and analyze natural discourse and other linguistic data of four dialects of the Koryak language, an indigenous language spoken across the Kamchatka peninsula of the Russian Federation. Through critical comparison of these dialects, the project examines how the Koryak language has diverged and changed over time. In addition, this comparative work will further and better inform accurate reconstruction within the Chukotko-Kamchatkan language family. These insights impact linguists' understanding of how human language shifts and develops diachronically, with particular attention to the role of everyday use within a community of speakers. Within the smaller &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo; of comparing multiple dialects, a more nuanced picture of language change within a small language family emerges, including rare and unusual grammaticalization patterns that challenge linguists&rsquo; current notion of how these new features develop. Koryak in particular presents fascinating questions regarding how it came to be the way it is due to several features that are present across all dialects, but are expressed and utilized in a multitude of different ways: unusual phonological patterns, polysynthetic morphology, a large grammatical case system and semantic animacy, extensive polygrammaticalization, ergative alignment and rich, dynamic transitivity marking in the verb.</span></p> <p><span>The project focused on four dialects in particular: Srednie Pakhachi, Achaivayam, Khailino, and Kamenskoe. During two three-month trips to the Kamchatka peninsula, the Co-PI spent time in Koryak communities gathering over 40 hours of new audio and video data, and worked with speakers to transcribe and analyze additional previously recorded data as well. The project has resulted in four corpora of spoken discourse in these four dialects, supplemented by additional word lists, grammatical notes,&nbsp;and detailed phonetic and phonological tests. Because of the geographic span of these dialects across the peninsula, linguistic features can now be mapped alongside other Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages which already have extensive and detailed documentation. Preliminary results show that several grammatical features differ significantly across dialects, and also differ from previous dialects of Koryak that are more widely spoken and have a longer history of documentation and analysis. In addition, photos, picture books, and cultural items were photographed and scanned to provide visual features for a Koryak language learning smartphone app, and to accompany a Koryak thematic dictionary which is composed of audio recordings of Koryak speakers in (Srednie Pakhachi) Koryak and Russian.</span></p> <p><span>Data from the project is being archived with ELAR, and has also been deposited with the speaker communities at the Koryak Autonomous Okrug Archive in Palana.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/30/2018<br>      Modified by: Dibella&nbsp;W&nbsp;Caminsky</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1451796/1451796_10359128_1535656053439_DSC_1150--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1451796/1451796_10359128_1535656053439_DSC_1150--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Koryak Contests"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1451796/1451796_10359128_1535656053439_DSC_1150--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Koryak Contests"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Koryak and Alutor people prepare for a cultural "relay race" during a celebration by the river - cleaning a fish, making traditional fish soup, making tea, reciting poetry, singing, and dancing</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dibella Caminsky</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Dibella&nbsp;W&nbsp;Caminsky</div> <div class="imageTitle">Koryak Contests</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1451796/1451796_10359128_1535655811883_DSC_0533--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1451796/1451796_10359128_1535655811883_DSC_0533--rgov-800width.jpg" title="A Koryak Dance Troupe"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1451796/1451796_10359128_1535655811883_DSC_0533--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="A Koryak Dance Troupe"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A Koryak dance troupe performs at a local Aboriginal People's Day celebration in Palana</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dibella Caminsky</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Dibella&nbsp;W&nbsp;Caminsky</div> <div class="imageTitle">A Koryak Dance Troupe</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1451796/1451796_10359128_1535655904415_DSC_0348--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1451796/1451796_10359128_1535655904415_DSC_0348--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Koryak Cultural Artifacts"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1451796/1451796_10359128_1535655904415_DSC_0348--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Koryak Cultural Artifacts"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Koryak cultural artifacts on display at the Koryak House of Culture in Palana</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dibella Caminsky</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Dibella&nbsp;W&nbsp;Caminsky</div> <div class="imageTitle">Koryak Cultural Artifacts</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1451796/1451796_10359128_1535655625890_DSC_0628--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1451796/1451796_10359128_1535655625890_DSC_0628--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Transcription Session with Valya and Di"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1451796/1451796_10359128_1535655625890_DSC_0628--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Transcription Session with Valya and Di"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Co-PI, Di Caminsky, works with Srednie Pakhachi speaker and Koryak language teacher Valentina Dedyk transcribing previous video recordings.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dibella Caminsky</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Dibella&nbsp;W&nbsp;Caminsky</div> <div class="imageTitle">Transcription Session with Valya and Di</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
