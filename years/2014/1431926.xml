<AbstractNarration>This IUSE project seeks to develop a new inquiry-based undergraduate laboratory curriculum for General Organic and Biochemistry (GOB) courses at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  The proposed courses are intended to prepare students for careers in healthcare professions by promoting critical thinking and connecting science to everyday life and human health.  This goal will be accomplished through the creation or revision of 12 experiments that will utilize conceptual learning, as described by the MORE (Model-Observe-Reflect-Explain) framework. This approach encourages students to create a conceptual model in a pre-lab exercise, observe chemical phenomena in lab that confirm or refute their model, reflect upon their original model, and explain the chemical phenomena.  The learning materials developed will be used by a diverse, urban commuter student body and should be transferrable to other institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key outcomes for this project will be twofold; (a) relevant lab procedures taught within the MORE framework and (b) associated training and support materials. Through formative and summative evaluation the investigators will analyze survey data of students related to their confidence and ability to understand course content objectives, as well as to the usefulness of an array of support materials and activities. Findings are expected to inform and broaden the knowledge base regarding how the contextualization of chemistry concepts aids student learning and the conditions that promote success for students. In turn, such results will help inform other institutions seeking to undertake similar efforts. Feedback from TAs (surveys and interviews) will also be used to adjust course implementation, to determine the role that teaching assistants play in delivering and implementing an inquiry-based curriculum, and to understand their influence on student learning. Dissemination will involve publication of manuscripts on the survey tool that has been created for this work and on the adaptation of the MORE pedagogy to the GOB sequence.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have developed an entire laboratory curriculum that relates chemistry to healthcare and uses a pedagogy that supports students in understanding foundational chemistry concepts. As nurses take on more complex roles in healthcare due to doctor shortages and an aging population, it is critical that they are provided a basic understanding of chemistry, but also an understanding of how chemistry relates to healthcare.  Prior to our work, a lab curriculum did not exist to support students in this way.  Further, chemistry courses are often not taught using methods that support students in relating macroscopic observations to molecular-level understandings, though this relationship is foundational to the chemistry discipline.  We have done fundamental work to understand how to better support all students in connecting macroscopic observations to the molecular level and applied the findings to our labs.     Our first publication on "Relating Protein Structure to Intermolecular Interactions" describes a lab we developed where students examine protein structures of gradually increasing complexity.  In each structure, students are presented ways in which protein folding is determined by intermolecular forces.  Taken together, students develop an understanding of how hydrogen bonding, the hydrophobic effect, and other forces work to dictate protein folding.  By examining the challenges students faced with this activity, we were able to not only improve student outcomes, but suggest improved pedagogical approaches that could be applied to other situations.       We recently reported on students? overall experience with the curriculum in the article "Relating Chemistry to Healthcare and MORE."  In this paper, we examined how intermolecular forces, equilibrium, and acid-base chemistry concepts build upon each other over the course of three labs.  Students relate their fundamental understandings to the problem of pH-dependent solubility, which is critical in the absorption of drugs and the passage of molecules across the placenta.  This article further explored the ways in which student-student discourse and student-teaching assistant discourse can lead to improved understandings and how partial understandings in developed in lab can be further improved with instruction in class.     The article "Dialysis, Albumin Binding, and Competitive Binding," describes three short experiments that support understandings of three important concepts in chemistry and healthcare.  Dialysis is critical in the treatment of kidney failure, and an understanding is consistently ranked as important for health students to learn in their chemistry course.  Drugs bind to albumin in the bloodstream, and only in the unbound form can it pass through small pores in the capillary.  Completive binding of drugs to albumin can lead to serious complications.  Each of these phenomena is modeled using short experiments, which challenge students molecular-level understandings.     We have developed several other labs that focus on how chemistry is used in diagnosis; including a lab to use chromatography in predicting neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, using knowledge of functional group chemistry to understand urinalysis (dipstick tests), and using carbohydrate chemistry to detect pancreatitis and sucrose intolerance.  Publication of these labs is forthcoming.     As we have worked to develop labs that incorporate diagnosis, we have encountered chemistry -related issues that require a more holistic approach. Disparity in access to healthcare resources, research, and culturally competent care lead to poor health outcomes for some communities and these disparities play an important role in diagnosing and treating patients.  Our attention has turned to the development of frameworks to support dialogue around these issues as they relate to chemistry.
