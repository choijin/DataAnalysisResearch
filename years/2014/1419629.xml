<AbstractNarration>The IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom), sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society's Technical Committee on Distributed Computing (TCDP) and Technical Committee on Computer Communications (TCCC), is the flagship conference of the pervasive computing community.  In addition to the main conference, the  PerCom 2014 meeting will also feature 12 workshops on cutting-edge themes, a PhD Forum, work-in-progress sessions, poster and demo sessions, a panel, and 2-3 keynote talks.  The conference's technical program also helps promote new directions of research in pervasive computing and communications.  Areas of interest including emerging areas like smartphone sensing, participatory sensing and social networks with applications to healthcare, security, energy and sustainability are all budding career learning experiences for students. Student participation in IEEE Percom 2014, offers opportunities in international collaboration, greater understanding of the field, and an exciting view across the landscape of pervasive computing.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit:   The supported students not only benefited from the keynote talks, technical presentations, panel discussions, PhD forum, demo and poster sessions at various events organized at the conference, but also had unique opportunities to network and exchange ideas with peers, international researchers, professionals, and application developers from academia and industry. Such experience motivated them to do high quality research and publish papers in top conferences and journals, thus further motivating them take up academic and research career.   Braoder Impacts:   Participation in the IEEE PerCom conference of the seventeen US-based graduate students (including four women) was an extremely valuable experience.
