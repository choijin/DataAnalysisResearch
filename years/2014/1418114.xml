<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Howard Georgi and Cumrun Vafa at the Physics Department of Harvard University, along with post-docs and students. The area of research covered by this project includes two broad classes: One in particle physics and the other in string theory. The particle physics side will involve the development of a new idea in describing the high energy scattering of particles using the idea that the aftermath of collisions involves a shell of energy which emanates from the collision site of the particles. This is an area which is currently being developed by Georgi and his students.  In string theory, the fundamental objects are strings, not particles.   All string theories exist in a higher number of dimensions, and the method of reducing these to four dimensions can lead to theories that can be compared with experiments.    Vafa will be continuing his work on better understanding of these theories, including the various methods of reducing the numbers of dimensions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Georgi's work in particle physics will involve the development of LSET (Light-Shell effective theory). The hope is that this approach will give a different effective theory involving high energy scatterings, of the type encountered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), complementary to the Soft Collinear Effective Theory approach currently used, and may lead to new methods of analyzing the large number of particles produced in these collisions.    On the string theory front Vafa will be continuing his work on better understanding of superconformal theories which have been discovered to exist in 5 and 6 dimensions. These theories involve tensionless strings. Computation of their partition functions have been developed recently and their relation to (twistorial) topological string is the major focus of this effort.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the past 5 years, the string theory research supported by this NSF grant has focused on elucidating the structure of possible new interactions and forces that can arise in the context of string theory.  These particles and forces have their origin from (two of the) extra dimensions of string theory and involve novel objects such as tensionless strings.  Major progress has been made including an atomic classification of all such possible forces and interactions.  This atomic classification involved, somewhat like one is familiar in the context of chemistry, finding building blocks of matter and the rules of how they can be combined together.  The particle physics research supported by this NSF grant has focused on the physics at the energy scale that is now being probed by the highest-energy collisions at the largest microscope ever built, the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, and its two magnificent lenses, the CMS and ATLAS detectors that allow experimental physicists from all other the world to make sense of the complicated images that emerge from these collisions.  Theorists help to get the most information out of this project, the most complicated basic science undertaking of all time, both by developing new tools to organize and analyze the data and by suggesting novel strategies to make sure that no corner is missed.  In this grant, we have worked on both, exploring new ways of picturing and analyzing high energy collisions and exploring models of what the picture might look like.  In addition to its most important goal of increasing our understanding the world, an experimental project of this magnitude and reach pushes the boundaries of technology in many directions and will produce countless spin-off technologies.  There are also spin-offs from basic research in theoretical physics of the kind supported by this grant.  Time and time again we have seen that theoretical work on the most basic problems in physics has led to totally unexpected advances in basic and applied mathematics and computing.  The mathematics of the work supported here, for example, may have applications to signal processing.  This is the kind of payoff that can arise when talented people, inspired by the most interesting questions in science, invent new tools to solve them.
