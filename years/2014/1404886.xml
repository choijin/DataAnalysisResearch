<AbstractNarration>Professors Daniel E. Austin and Aaron R. Hawkins of Brigham Young University are supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry to explore viable pathways to fabricate highly miniaturized linear-type ion trap mass spectrometers.  The goal of this project is to develop a low cost, simple to manufacture, portable mass spectrometer and to demonstrate its applicability to fast on-site chemical measurement problems.  One such application is the monitoring of atmospheric particulates.  A wide range of scientific and technical areas, including  industrial, environmental, clinical, and air quality monitoring, can benefit from on-site mass spectrometric chemical analysis.  This is ultimately an instrument development project, and like all new and improved measurement tools it will facilitate advances in science and technology areas that rely on these measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is focused on the development of a miniaturized linear ion trap (LIT) mass spectrometer (MS), using two parallel ceramic plates onto which all necessary electrodes are lithographically patterned.  The proposed two-plate concept will allow precise alignment of the electrodes, a requirement for maintaining acceptable MS resolution, mass accuracy, and selectivity with miniaturized MS.  With one plate fixed, only the position of the second plate will be varied using both mechanical as well as fine piezoelectric alignments.  After the plates are aligned, they will be permanently affixed with epoxy to create a miniaturized MS analyzer.  Once assembled, the analyzer will be interfaced to a commercial GC to demonstrate portable GC-MS operations.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The instrument construction and testing tasks involve interdisciplinary education and training of graduate and undergraduate students in chemistry and electrical engineering, two areas that increasingly work together in instrument development and for which cross-training is particularly valuable.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mass spectrometers are powerful instruments for chemical analysis, but their size and weight require that samples must be brought to the lab for analysis.  Portable mass spectrometers show promise as instruments that can be taken into the field, allowing real-time decisions and simplifying sampling and sample transport.  Such instruments are begining to have an impact on environmental analysis, space exploration, forensics, emergency response, treaty monitoring, manufacturing, and many other fields.  Ion traps have been at the forefront of efforts to produce miniaturized mass spectrometers, but performance to date has been limmited by several issues related to miniaturization.  High resolving power in a miniaturized mass spectrometer requires that the dimensional tolerances of electrodes scale proportionally with the electrode size. This cannot be accomplished simply by making smaller versions of 3-dimensional macroscopic designs, because relative errors increase with smaller fabrication techniques. We have demonstrated that accurate electric fields and high performance can be achieved in microfabricated mass analyzers using a novel two-plate approach: the ion trap is composed of two ceramic plates, the facing surfaces of which are patterned with arrays of electrodes.  Appropriate radiofrequency potentials are applied to the patterned electrodes, producing the correct trapping field in the space between the plates.  This approach allows high in-plane fabrication accuracy, but the alignment between the two plates remains subject to misalignment.  We have further demonstrated the specific effects of this plate-to-plate misalignment and have demonstrated that precise alignment is possible.  We have constructed two-plate ion traps (linear type) with size down to 360 micrometers.  At such small sizes, the weight of the trap is significantly smaller than conventional ion traps, the electrical power is greatly reduced, yet performance is retained, thereby realizing some of the key features needed for a portable mass spectrometer.
