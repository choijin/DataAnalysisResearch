<AbstractNarration>Women and people from racial/ethnic minority groups are underrepresented in STEM courses, majors and careers in the United States. Social and psychological factors, in particular the prevalence and persistence of negative stereotypes toward underrepresented group members' abilities in STEM, play a key role in explaining and perpetuating this imbalanced level of participation in STEM fields. In particular, the prevalence and persistence of subtle "micro-inequalities" caused by implicit biases and stereotypes, which have taken the place of more overt, intentional forms of discrimination, have contributed to the "chilly climate" faced by underrepresented students in STEM classrooms. Research has revealed that bias persists in STEM educational contexts, even among individuals who value fairness and even among professionals who are themselves members of underrepresented groups. This project will focus on developing, assessing and deploying a digital interactive narrative platform, called INTRINSICS (Interactive Narrative Technology for Reducing Implicit Negative Stereotyping and Improving the Climate in STEM), for use by introductory-level undergraduate STEM instructors and their students that will allow students to express negative subjective classroom experiences, raise awareness about these subjective experiences among instructors and students in the classroom, and empower instructors and students to be proactive in responding to experiences of discrimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will employ a three-year development and research plan to verify the efficacy and impact of the INTRINSICS platform and its constituent components. In years 1 and 2 (Phase 1: development and guiding research), the technological framework and back-end impact of the platform will be developed and the content, graphics and interface for three modules will be iteratively designed and developed. A set of randomized experiments conducted with undergraduates enrolled in introductory-level physics and biology courses will test the impact of several fundamental variables central to the experience of the platforms' narratives, including narrative voice; the generation versus reception of narrative content; the reception of narrative content believed to be fictional versus content believed to reflect people's actual experiences; and the inclusion versus exclusion of interactive elements. The results of the experiments will directly guide the final content and design of the platform's three modules. In year 3 (Phase 2: applied research and deployment), the researchers will employ a longitudinal design to test the long-term impact of the full INTRINSICS platform among students and professors in introductory-level physics and engineering classes.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The INTRINSICS team built on the work of social psychologists who have studied implicit bias and stereotypes. Our research sought to address the so-called "micro-inequalities" that have taken the place of more overt, intentional forms of discrimination and have contributed to the underrepresentation of women and minorities in STEM university classrooms and careers. Our work demonstrated that novel interventions can change cultural stereotypes and thus can play a central role in increasing both the size and diversity of the STEM talent pool.&nbsp;</p> <p>The impact of the project has been significant. Along with 40 research assistant students, we were able to conduct a total of 17 individual studies resulting in 7 published papers and several more under review at leading journals. We included nearly 3000 participants in studies, ranging from high school students, to college students, to the general public, using 12 different "study-ready" intervention prototypes.</p> <p>Many of our interventions in this research were informed by Tiltfactor's Embedded Design model. Embedded Design is a set of principles that ensures both a person's engagement with a designed experience and the effectiveness of the intervention is maximized. Typical prosocial interventions often broadcast their intentions, which can lead participants to react against them and thus nullifying the impact.</p> <p>Our studies focused on three primary objectives. First, we examined the types of narrative features that were most likely to make a story effective at changing perceptions of subtle bias, and increasing empathy for individuals affected by this bias. Second, we investigated the effects of writing stories about experiences of bias, particularly the factors that made writing about these experiences have positive or negative emotional outcomes. Third, we investigated the role of agency, surprise, and control in how individuals respond to interactive narratives. These studies helped build a bridge between traditional narratives and interactive experiences, and provide important information for the field at large about attracting and retaining STEM majors while in a milieu of bias.</p> <p>The design of the experiments and the interventions in the project were based on two complementary, empirically-based theories which detail the means through which narratives persuade: transportation into narrative worlds, and experience-taking.&nbsp;The INTRINSICS interventions provide a vehicle for research and creation through which to address bias; they provide a means to experiment and experience, discuss, and share new knowledge in order to reduce the situational and psychological factors that perpetuate inequity in STEM domains.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p class="WhyMatter">Our many results from the project were provocative, as a few illustrations will show. For example, 1) we found that reading fictional stories about bias were more effective than "real life" stories?and since it is often assumed that true stories will be more transformative than fictional tale, this might fundamentally change the way we educate about bias. Rather than "tell the true story" of a female student struggling in STEM, our research shows that telling fictional stories may better help readers empathize with the experiences of women in STEM; 2) We found that female students in introductory STEM courses who engaged with a point-and-click interactive narrative showed decreased self-doubt in a longitudinal study. Researchers can use the methods and tools we used to quickly and easily create their own interactive narrative studies, and we shared these methods in a published paper; 3) Our problem-solving exercise called "The Investigation," prompted students to confront their own biases through an "aha" moment. As students discovered that a scientist character was female, they reassessed their assumptions about scientists and gender, but became defensive and less open to women in science overall. This study showed that some societal biases may be too entrenched to shift by the time students enter college; 4) Research on our VR intervention, "Entangled," showed that after playing as a woman scientist in VR, participants thought women and scientists were more alike in competence. Entangled demonstrates that virtual reality experiences have a profound potential to reduce bias (both within STEM, and in general) by facilitating players to temporarily embody characters from marginalized groups. These are only a fraction of the findings.</p> <p>Our results are vital for those working in science because we have discovered evidence and best practices in shifting attitudes that lead to a chilly STEM climate for women in science. Together, our collection of interventions and the research conducted on these interventions forms a robust set of data about novel approaches and interactive designs towards combating the entrenched problem of underrepresentation of women in STEM fields.&nbsp;Our research is of great practical significance to educators, designers, psychologists, and anyone concerned about the next generation of
