<AbstractNarration>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. The investigators of this study propose to develop and study two sets of instructional materials for K-2 teacher professional development in mathematics and science that are aligned with the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics (CCSS) and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).  They will develop two modules in each subject area and an introductory module that prefaces and integrates the science and mathematics materials.  Teachers will be able to review the materials online, watch video of exemplary teaching practice, and then upload their own examples and students' work to be critiqued by other teachers enrolled in professional learning communities as well as expert coaches.  New instructional materials aligned with the standards are needed to assist teachers in meeting the challenging instructional practices recommended.  To date, scant few resources of this type exist and, given many school districts have limited resources, more cost-effective forms of development such as this must be found.  A particular strength of this project is that teachers will be able to engage in the courses online, on an ongoing basis and integrate what they have learned into their daily teaching practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators propose a program of design research to develop and improve the modules. The central hypothesis is a test of the Teaching Channel model--that the modules and professional learning communities result in significant changes in the quality of instructional practice.  Text analytics will be performed on the online discussion to detect changes in group discourse over time.  Changes in instructional quality and vision will be measured by observing the videos posted by teachers.  Pre-post tests of student work will be performed.  The findings of the research will be disseminated through conference presentations, publications, and the Teaching Channel website.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Our goals for this project were threefold: creating scalable online professional development courses in K-2 mathematics and science; creating a video series showcasing exemplary teaching practices in those areas; and creating a tool for measurement of teacher vision in order to determine the effectiveness of our courses and videos.   We have met our objectives by building four online courses, two each in modeling and argumentation for both mathematics and science (example of a course in Figure 1).  We plan to continue with this material by making it available for use in academic courses by our partners at the University of Washington and Northwestern University.  We are also planning to have courseware available for small group collaboration through Teaching Channel?s online professional learning platform. This material has been tested and in over 20 pilot sections with more than 300 teacher participants, with pilot test feedback carefully collected and analyzed by WestEd, with further help from our project advisory board consisting of education research professionals from throughout the United States.  The feedback has then been used to refine the online courses in subsequent versions. We also created twelve videos showcasing exemplary teaching practices, which are currently available on the Teaching Channel website (Figures 2 and 3).  These videos consist of students and teachers in the classroom exploring concepts that are central to our vision of effective teaching of K-2 mathematics and science.  The videos are housed on the Teaching Channel website (www.teachingchannel.org/videos) and have collectively been viewed over 100,000 times.  These videos have further been used in blog posts and Teaching Channel Deep Dives, to provide mini-lessons to the Tch community. Finally, we have worked towards creating effective measurement of teacher vision.  These accomplishments are outlined in conference papers and presentations as well as journal submissions from the project team.  Through analysis of participant data, student work, surveys, and exit interviews we have determined various criteria for observing success, and have incorporated these discoveries into the materials we have created.
