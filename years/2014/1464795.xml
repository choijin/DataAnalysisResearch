<AbstractNarration>Kieron Burke of the University of California-Irvine is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program to develop methods that improve the accuracy and reliability of electronic structure calculations. Modern chemical and materials research increasingly relies on electronic structure calculations, i.e., solving the equations of quantum mechanics for electrons to predict or understand physical and chemical properties.   Burke's method uses very fundamental properties of quantum mechanics to derive improved approximations in a highly systematic fashion.  The intellectual value is to understand the quantum nature of electrons more deeply than before, in a way that significantly reduces errors. The impact could be significant, as it could improve electronic structure calculations for thousands of scientific papers each year, including those related to drug discovery, and to the identification of new catalysts, and new phases of matter.  There is also a broad-based educational component, as graduate, undergraduate, and high school students are involved in the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Burke and his research group combine theoretical methods from three different disciplines. A systematic non-empirical approach to density functional approximation is used, via an asymptotic expansion in powers of Planck's constant, the fundamental quantity that determines the strength of quantum effects. For model systems, the approximations can be found explicitly, and yield far more accurate results than previous formulas. For realistic systems (molecules and materials), the general forms can be used to deduce asymptotically exact approximations that significantly improve on those in use today, and constrain more sophisticated approaches. The methods are also applied to the problem of orbital-free electronic structure calculations, which holds the promise of making much larger distance and time scales accessible to density functional theory  (DFT) calculations. The work includes an alternative strategy to the  DFT framework in use today, called potential functional theory. A natural connection with thermal DFT has the potential to lead to useful applications in the time-dependent density functional theory of molecules and of warm dense matter.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Density functional theory (DFT) continues to have enormous impact as an electronic structure method, with as many as 40,000 scientific publications each year.  The project developed both the theory and approximations of DFT and the human resources (broader impact) needed to continue development in the future.  The project was highly successful in all major areas.  In intellectual merit, substantial advances were made in developing density-corrected DFT, semiclassical understanding of DFT, and machine-learned density functionals.  High-impact papers were published in each of these areas.  These had applications in many different fields, including spin-crossover complexes (requiring very demanding benchmark calculations), creating a new correlation functional that is more accurate for heavy atoms than any existing functional, and a way of bypassing the need to solve the Kohn-Sham equations using a machine-learned density functional.       Many graduate students and some undergraduates were trained in these techniques, both in physics and chemistry.   More broadly, several schools devoted to helping younger scientists understand the fundamental theory were held, and a book is even in preparation.  The PI gave many pedagogical lectures on the topic.  He guest edited a special issue of the journal of chemical physics on machine learning in theoretical chemistry.  The PI also participated in a one-day event aimed at high-school teachers.       Last Modified: 08/16/2019       Submitted by: Kieron J Burke]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
