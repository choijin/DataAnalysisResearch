<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics &amp; Mechanisms B Program of the Division of Chemistry is fudning Professor Timothy Curran of the Department of Chemistry at Trinity College to develop model systems for exploring the physical and chemical properties of beta-sheets, a common protein secondary structure wherein two protein chains are aligned parallel to each other.  Formation of beta-sheets has been implicated in amyloid diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.  Although there are existing model systems for beta-sheets, their use has been limited because these model systems aggregate and become insoluble, making them difficult to study.  Professor Curran and his students have discovered a rigid, cyclic molecule that incorporates the metals, iron and tungsten, and they have discovered ways to append two short protein chains to this cyclic molecule.  These protein chains are aligned parallel to each other.  The goal of this research is to determine whether the two protein chains linked to the rigid cyclic molecule will form beta-sheets, and whether changes to the iron and tungsten atoms can prevent the problem of aggregation.  If successful this work will enable other researchers to better understand the forces that drive beta-sheet formation.   The project lies at the interface of organic, inorganic and biochemistry, and is therefore well suited to the education of undergraduate science students.  Undergraduate co-workers, including those from groups underrepresented in sciences, and some high school students will take part in this funded project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tungsten bis(alkyne)complexes are ununsual in that they are air stable. In general, the alkyne ligands rotate around the tungsten center; this is true for both acyclic and cyclic complexes. In recent work, a cyclic tungsten bis(alkyne) complex derived from a dialkynyl 1,1'-disubstitutedferrocene has been discovered and found to rather rigidly juxtapose the two alkyne ligands in solution.  The rigid nature of this ring system and its ability to hold the two alkynes in close proximity will be used to explore whether peptides appended to the two alkynes will develop cross-strand hydrogen bonds and adopt beta-sheet conformations.  Peptides will be appended to the alkynes via amide bonds made to either methyleneamine or methylenecarboxyl linkers.  If these peptide derivatives do adopt beta-sheet conformations, then their ability to aggregate will be assessed.  If aggregation is observed, oxidation of the iron atom in the ferrocene moiety will be examined to determine whether charge-charge repulsion can disrupt aggregation.  The long-term goal of this work is to develop a model system for studying beta-sheets and the factors that contribute to their aggregation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The aim of this award was to determine whether beta-sheet structures could be generated from peptide derivatives of a newly discovered, rigid, cyclic molecule.  The ring system in this molecule contains two metal atoms, iron and tungsten, which are positioned at opposite ends of the ring.  The tungsten atom is bonded to two alkyne groups (carbon-carbon triple bonds), with the two alkynes lined up parallel to each other and spaced about 3.5 Angstroms apart.     Beta-sheets are one of the major three-dimensional shapes found in proteins.  Sheets consist of two chains of amino acids (peptides) that line up parallel to each other and spaced about 3.3 Angstroms apart.  The two peptides interact via hydrogen bonding and, as their name denotes, adopt a sheet-like shape.  Beta-sheets are of scientific interest because there are a number of proteins that will, in error, change their shapes.  When a protein changes and takes on more beta-sheet structure, it typically will become insoluble and precipitate.  It has been speculated that this process plays a role in some diseases, most notably Alzheimers. To understand the forces that drive these processes, scientists could use model systems for beta-sheets.  There are a number of known beta-sheet model systems, but they do not work well; often the model beta-sheets are insoluble in most solvents, making their study exceedingly difficult.  Hence the need to find a better model system.     In the work supported by this award, different methods for appending peptides to the two alkynes in the rigid ring system were developed and the resulting molecules were studied for their ability to adopt beta-sheet structures.  All of the systems explored involved a spacer between the alkynes and the peptides.  In one set of molecules the spacer was a benzene ring.  It was discovered that this spacer did not allow for beta-sheet formation.  However when the spacer was a methylene (CH2), beta-sheet structures were obtained.  It was also found that what was attached to the methylene did matter.  When the methylene was bonded to an amine and then the peptide, two different beta-sheet structure are generated, and these two structures flip back and forth.  When the methylene was bonded to a carboxylic acid and then the peptide, only one beta-sheet structure was generated.  Of particular interest here is that the model beta-sheets are soluble in most organic solvents, indicating that they are more tractable than previous models.  We believe their solubility is due to the rigid ring system that initiates the beta-sheet; it is not completely flat, like the other sheet models, and may be less prone to aggregation.  The methylene-carboxylic acid system has the greatest potential for studying beta-sheet formation and stability, and further work on it is ongoing.  To date two publications and several conference talks have resulted from this work, with more publications to come.     This research was performed by the Principal Investigator, a collaborator from another college, 10 undergraduate students and one high school student.  Of the 10 undergraduate students who worked on the project, all are or have pursued STEM degrees; half were students of color.  So far 4 of the students have earned their B.S. degrees; 1 is in a chemistry graduate program, and the other 3 are employed as research scientists in industrial or medical settings.  Of the remaining 6 students still in school, 2 will be attending graduate school in chemistry in the next year. There was one high school student who worked on the project for 2 years; she is currently a STEM student at another university.  This award supported students who are now committed to being scientists, and it provided opportunities to students from groups that have traditionally been underrepresented in STEM.     Overall, the research supported by the award has uncovered a new model system for beta-sheets, which was the goal of the proposed research.  The award also supported the training of undergraduate students who are or will pursue employment or further education in STEM fields.
