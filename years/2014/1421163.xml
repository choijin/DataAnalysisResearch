<AbstractNarration>Certain computational problems such as graph connectivity, matching, and primality testing admit time-efficient algorithms. On the other hand problems such as boolean formula satisfiability, traveling salesman problem, and factoring still defy such fast algorithms.  Why does such computational disparity exist among natural computational problems?  This clearly is a foundational question which impacts many areas including mathematics, engineering, economics, optimization, and communication - areas beyond computer science.  The main goal of ``computational complexity theory'' is to study the notion of efficient computation. Typically, efficiency is measured in terms of computational resources such as time and memory (space).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will investigate certain central and longstanding open questions concerning nondeterminism and randomness in the context of memory-efficient computations.  By focusing on memory-bounded computations, it will (a) study the role of unambiguity in nondeterminism (b) design deterministic algorithms that are simultaneously time and space efficient for nondeterministic computations (c) investigate the power of computations with multiple access to a random tape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Study of proposed topics will help in understanding relations among three fundamental concepts of computation: determinism, nondeterminism and randomness, in the context of computations with limited memory. Intuition gained from this project will enhance our understanding of the complexity of solving practical computational problems arising from various fields beyond computer science. Research results from this grant will be published in peer-reviewed journals and will be presented at national and international conferences, thus enabling broad dissemination of the results to enhance scientific understanding. Expository survey articles aimed at a broader theoretical computer science audience will be written. New courses will be created and taught along the theme of this project, thus integrating teaching and research.  The grant will also be used for various human resource development activities such as supporting and mentoring graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Amount of resources needed to solve a computational problem is of fundamental interest. Typical resources that are considered are time, memory and randomness. It is known that some computational problems can be solved in very little time and/or using a limited amount of memory. Whereas few other computational problems seem to require inordinate amount of time of memory to solve them. Theory of computational complexity classifies problems into various complexity classes based on the amount of resources needed to solve them and studies interrelationships among the various complexity classes. An objecive of this study is to illuminate on the computational difficulty/easiness of various computational problems that arise in practice.   Goals of this project are to understand the memory complexity of computational problems and to investigate  relationships among three fundamental notions of computation: determinism, nondeterminism  and randomness  in the context of memory-bounded computations. More specifically, the project seeks to understand are role nondeterminism and randomness play in the context of memory-bounded computations.    Key outcomes of the project include design of memory-efficient algorithms to estimate number of triangles in massive graphs, developing a new approach to remove randomness from time-bounded computations via investigating memory-bounded computations, and design of time and memory efficient algorithms for reachability in graphs that are embedded on surfaces of low genus.   The project partially supported several PhD students, and one of them finished doctoral studies during the course of the project.  Midwest Big Data Summer school  was organized during summers of 2016, 2017 and 2018.   Each year more than 100 participants attended the summer schools.
