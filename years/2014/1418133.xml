<AbstractNarration>This project will develop curricula for environmental/geoscience disciplines for high-school classrooms.   It will teach a systems approach to problem solving through hands-on activities based on local data and issues. This will provide an opportunity for students to act in their communities while engaging in solving problems they find interesting, and require synthesis of prior learning.  The Model My Watershed (MMW) v2 app will bring new environmental datasets and geospatial capabilities into the classroom, to provide a cloud-based learning and analysis platform accessible from a web browser on any computer or mobile device, thus overcoming the cost and technical obstacles to integrating Geographic Information System technology in secondary education.  It will also integrate new low-cost environmental sensors that allow students to collect and upload their own data and compare them to data visualized on the new MMW v2.  This project will transform the ability of teachers throughout the nation to introduce hands-on geospatial analysis activities in the classroom, to explore a wide range of geographic, social, political and environmental concepts and problems beyond the project's specific curricular focus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Next Generation Science Standards state that authentic research experiences are necessary to enhance STEM learning. A combination of computational modeling and data collection and analysis will be integrated into this project to address this need. Placing STEM content within a place- and problem-based framework enhances STEM learning. Students, working in groups, will not only design solutions, they will be required to defend them within the application portal through the creation of multimedia products such as videos, articles and web 2.0 presentations.  The research plan tests the overall hypothesis that students are much more likely to develop an interest in careers that require systems thinking and/or spatial thinking, such as environmental sciences, if they are provided with problem-based, place-based, hands-on learning experiences using real data, authentic geospatial analysis tools and models, and opportunities to collect their own supporting data. The MMW v2 web app will include a data visualization tool that streams data related to the modeling application. This database will be modified to integrate student data so teachers and students can easily compare their data to data collected by other students and the government and research data. All data will be easily downloadable so that students can increase the use of real data to support the educational exercises. As a complement to the model-based activities, the project partners will design, manufacture, and distribute a low-cost environmental monitoring device, called the Watershed Tracker.  This device will allow students to collect real-world data to enhance their understanding of watershed dynamics. Featuring temperature, light, humidity, and soil moisture sensors, the Watershed Tracker will be designed to connect to tablets and smartphones through the audio jack common to all of these devices.</AbstractNarration>

The Teaching Environmental Sustainability - Model My Watershed (TES-MMW) curriculum and RMTs (NSF DRK-12 DRL -1417722, 1417527, 1418133) situates student learning in the exploration and evaluation of the conditions of their local watershed using field experimentation with probe-ware, national data-sets and a scientifically valid watershed modeling application. The curriculum was implemented by thirty eight teachers in eight states with data collected from 1533 students. The instruments used in this study include a watershed content assessment and portions of the NOAA B-WET Secondary Science Self Report (1. Knowledge of Actions 2. Intention to Act; 3. Locus of Control) and a semi-structured Critical Incident Technique interview protocol to assess students? engagement and action. In order to better understand which of the TES-MMW?s Resource, Model and Tools (RMT?s) were most influential to students? engagement in watershed actions, students were asked to reflect on their experience with the TES-MMW curriculum and to describe which activities were most impactful and motivated them to care about their local watershed. Four RMT?s were frequently reported by students as most influential: Model My Watershed GIS application (69%), Probeware and Outdoor data collection (35%), the Online Learning Portal (33%) and the guided tour of the school yard watershed (25%). The data indicates that a data-driven watershed modeling curriculum with scientific-grade RMTs, particularly a geographic information systems (GIS) watershed modeling software (MMW), is an effective tool for increasing students? abilities in 2 of the environmental stewardship characteristics. Students? content understanding and knowledge of action increased while their locus of control and intent to act remained unchanged.&nbsp;</span></strong></p> <p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-661fc07a-7fff-74ad-2ca8-5788a113ea21" style="font-weight: normal;"> <br /> </strong></p> <p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-661fc07a-7fff-74ad-2ca8-5788a113ea21" style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Broader impacts:</span></strong></p> <p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-661fc07a-7fff-74ad-2ca8-5788a113ea21" style="font-weight: normal;"> </strong></p> <p style="line-height: 1.3800000000000001; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-661fc07a-7fff-74ad-2ca8-5788a113ea21" style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Over the 5 years of the project versions of the TES-MMW curriculum were implemented by 117 teachers in eight different states across the U.S. Many other teachers and students have been and are able to use this free curriculum which is accessible online through the ITSI Portal (</span><a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://itsi.portal.concord.org/"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #1155cc; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">https://itsi.portal.concord.org/</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">) and the WikiWatershed Toolkit (</span><a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://wikiwatershed.org/"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #1155cc; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">https://wikiwatershed.org/</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">) and as a result of dissemination efforts to audiences beyond the project teachers. About 165 presentations, workshops, webinars, newsletters, and other dissemination products and efforts were completed during the life of the project. The Model My Watershed (MMW) online GIS is a powerful tool that can be used to analyze various geospatial phenomena and changes to land use or implementation of conservation practices. Use of this application has expanded beyond science and STEM education and watershed science to other areas, such as robust watershed research and restoration monitoring, public health, and socioeconomic analyses. MMW is being used by over 60 watershed associations and citizen monitoring groups, mainly in the Delaware River Basin and also across the country, for modeling and planning of watershed improvement projects and monitoring. A 2019 WikiWatershed Toolkit User Survey shows continued excitement about the tools, from a spectrum of types of users. The WikiWatershed Toolkit now includes Model My Watershed, Runoff Simulation, Monitor My Watershed, EnviroDIY, Leaf Pack Network, Water Quality Mobile App, and Macroinvertebrates.org.
