<AbstractNarration>a.  A nontechnical explanation of the project's broader significance and importance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As coastal populations grow, sea level rises, and climate models predict increasing storminess, there needs to be a better understanding of the effects of high-energy waves on coastal regions. The urgency of this need is underscored by landmark storms that have struck world-wide in recent years.  Western Europe was ravaged by a series of unusually strong storms this past winter, which generated the largest waves ever measured in Irish waters (25 m high).  Damage to coastal infrastructure will cost tens of millions of dollars to repair, and major amounts of erosion and sediment movement are now being documented. This project will use these storms as an oppportunity for before-and-after analysis that can increase our knowledge of how storm waves move large objects.  Using an existing database of photographs (most taken last summer) at surveyed sites tied to specific GPS locations, this research will use repeat photography to document and measure changes wrought by the winter storms. This investigation will establish a relationship between storm power and the inland extent of boulder movement that can serve as an index of the destructive power of storm waves. The results will be applicable to coastal regions world-wide and can serve as the basis for developing effective public policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;b. A technical description of the project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability of storm waves to move large objects such as boulders is controversial. Some researches have suggested that only tsunami have the power to move massive objects to higher elevations, yet the distribution of coastal boulder ridges in areas not prone to tsunami indicate a more widespread and common mechanism.  This project will use existing benchmark photographs and measurements of boulder distribution at key sites in the west of Ireland to make quantitative comparisons of boulder locations before and after thw winter storms of 2013-2014.   The surveys will use recent field photographs taken mostly in 2012 and 2013 to make on-the-ground comparisons with the present boulder configurations, documenting which boulders have moved and measuring both the sizes and translation distances of the transported clasts.  Because these sites have been topographically surveyed, the masses and movements to elevations above high water and distances inland will be documented, thus generating relationships between the maximum sea states recorded last winter and the inland extent of boulder movements. Data generated during this project will quaintify the connection between storm waves and boulder transport.  The results will be applicable to other regions at risk from severe storm damage and can be used as the basis for refining models of coastal transport. This project will train students in the process of approaching a scientific problem that has societal relevance, and will broaden their understanding of geoscience and its broader roles. Undergraduate students, a high proportion of whom are from under-represented groups, will receive intense one-on-one mentoring and training in the field and in lab, as well as hands-on experience with a variety of field and analytical tools. The international nature of the work, the wide range of techniques involved, and the relevance for public planning will help prepare these undergraduates for successful, effective careers in research and teaching.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Coastal boulder ridges accumulate above high tide, and are active only during extreme wave conditions. Some are found on cliff tops as much as 45 m above high water (AHW); others occur up to 250 m inland at the back of gently sloping platforms. They include megagravel with masses in the 100s of tonnes near sea level, and boulders &gt; 1 t at locations up to 50 m above high water (AHW).  They record extreme wave events., but until recently there has been controversy over whether they are moved by storms or whether they are relict tsunami deposits.  The winter of 2013-14 brought record-breaking storms and high seas (with wave heights up to 25 m measured in Irish waters), causing dramatic geomorphologic change at many coastal locations. Using a database of boulder-ridge photographs collected in recent field seasons, we were able to document changes in the accumulations, and measure movements of specific clasts at locations in western Ireland, including coastal Clare, the Belmullet peninsula, and the Aran Islands.  The data collected during this project showed unequivocally that these boulders are moved by storm waves.  Using repeat photography of sites on the west coast of Ireland (photos taken before and after the severe storms of winter 2013-2014) we documented movement of  &gt;1100 clasts, 84 of which were &ge; 20 t, and 16 of which were &ge; 50 t. We recorded movement on cliff tops as high as 25 m AHW, and the largest clast moved at this elevation was ~5.5 t.  Other examples of the effects of the storm include slabs &gt;20 t ripped from bedrock and incorporated into a ridge at 11 m AHW and 90 m inland; and an 18.5 t block moved from ridge base to crest (translated 12 m inland and 4.5 m vertically) in a ridge located 130 x m inland and 17 m AHW. The single largest boulder moved was an isolated block of ~430 t, close to sea level, transported ~5 m laterally. These deposits record maximum wave intensities for their locations and hold the key to understanding inland transmission of fluid forces.  Now that we know for sure that storm waves can move boulders of these sizes, we can begin to better understand the potential effects of extreme storm events in other settings.
