<AbstractNarration>PI: Yager, Paul&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 1450187&lt;br/&gt;Title: EAGER: Extending cell phone capabilities for sensitive detection in lateral flow assays&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significance:&lt;br/&gt;Decentralization of today's most sophisticated biochemical measurements has the potential to revolutionize many fields, from medicine to agriculture; there is great potential to reduce societal costs, improve outcomes by more frequent measurements, and make field measurements that are currently impossible. One promising decentralization approach is to couple new inexpensive disposable chemical devices with our smart phones, which provide "free" measurement and analysis capacity, and can immediately transmit data anywhere. In all such measurement, the sensitivity of the detection process determines whether the measurement is useful. Current lateral flow devices (e.g., home pregnancy tests) are rapid, robust, inexpensive, and useful, but the few commercial systems detect a small set of relatively concentrated analytes. To successfully use antibody binding or nucleic acid detection tests for lower-abundance analytes, we need a significant increase in detection sensitivity. The proposed new methods for detecting analytes in this project could bring such capacity to the lateral flow format. The aim is to minimize cost and maximize speed of adoption by implementing these methods so that they can be carried out with current or next-generation smart phones.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Description:&lt;br/&gt;A goal of this work is to determine whether a particular set of additional capabilities associated with cellular telephones would add significant functionality for smart phones with respect to biochemical measurement, specifically to improving the sensitivity of current and conventional lateral flow-based assays. The PI proposes ways in which next-generation phones could enhance our ability to do useful chemical detection anywhere, whether for medicine, environmental monitoring, process monitoring, laboratory science or education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will utilize acoustic detection of rapid heating of the detection lines to measure the amplitude of binding. This approach is used in photoacoustic ultrasound imaging, in which the lateral flow strip detection zone is illuminated by a rapid flash of light. Alternatively, one could raster scan a bright light beam as is done in today?s commercial barcode scanners</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Decentralization of today?s most sophisticated biochemical measurements has the potential to revolutionize many fields, from medicine to agriculture; there is great potential to reduce societal costs, improve outcomes by more frequent measurements, and make field measurements that are currently impossible. One promising decentralization approach is to couple new inexpensive disposable chemical devices with our smart phones, which provide "free" measurement and analysis capacity, and can immediately transmit data anywhere.  In all such measurements, the sensitivity of the detection process determines whether the measurement is useful.    Today?s lateral flow devices (e.g., home pregnancy tests) are rapid, robust, inexpensive, and useful, but the few commercial systems detect a small set of relatively concentrated analytes. To use antibody binding or nucleic acid detection tests for lower-abundance analytes, we need to increase detection sensitivity, but without greatly increasing test complexity or expense.  The aim was to minimize cost and maximize speed of adoption by implementing these methods so that they can be carried out with current or next-generation smart phones with a minimum of added equipment to the phone or to the disposable lateral flow device.  In the course of this project, we tested and evaluated new methods for detecting analytes in the lateral flow format based on the phones.  Initial work on using the photoacoustic detection (using the flash to excite sound emission by absorption-heated Au nanoparticles in the paper) proved to be impractical&mdash;the flash was too slow and too dim to generate measurable sounds.  Subsequent work to use the flash to cause dyes in paper to fluoresce and to use the phone?s camera to record the timing and intensity of light emitted from those fluorescent dyes proved very effective for two applications: 1) increasing the sensitivity of lateral flow tests based on fluorescent nanoparticles instead of Au nanoparticles because one could observe smaller numbers of them in paper, and 2) observing the production of fluorescent dyes as detectors of nucleic acid amplification for the detection of nucleic acid target molecules.   Using fluorescent nanoparticles like quantum dots as labels in lateral flow assays improved the sensitivity of immunoassays be reducing the lowest number of detection antibodies that could be seen on the background of the paper by at least 10.  This allows a large number of tests to become practical in this format.  The downside to this approach (as compared to use of Au nanoparticles) is that the imaging of the lateral flow with the camera has to be done in the dark, perhaps inside a small blackened box.   There is an explosion of interest in simple nucleic acid amplification tests for detecting pathogens that cause infectious disease, as well as other targets.  These reactions can be monitored by the change in brightness of molecules that become fluorescent when they bind to the amplified copies of the target that are produced over several minutes of incubation.  The speed at which these fluorescent molecules appear, and their brightness, can be used to count the number of targets that were present in the sample in the first place.  It was shown that today?s cell phone cameras (when augmented by adding filters or even an LED flashlight) have ample sensitivity to monitor these fluorescence signals in paper-based devices based on lateral flow tests, opening the door to bringing the sensitivity of the best laboratory tests into remote sites for the first time, and at very low cost.
