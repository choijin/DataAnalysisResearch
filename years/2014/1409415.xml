<AbstractNarration>Designing secure systems and validating security of existing systems are hard challenges facing our society. For implementing secure applications, a serious stumbling block lies in the generation of a correct system specification for a security policy. It is non-trivial for both system designers and end users to express their intent in terms of formal logic. Similar challenges plague users' trying to validate security properties of existing applications, such as web or cloud based services, which often have no formal specifications. Thus, there is an urgent need for mechanisms that can bridge the gap between expressions of user intent and system specifications. This research designs an approach and a system called Aspire that is able to translate user intent into security specifications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aspire takes as input, expressions of user intent such as a system demonstration,  application input-output examples, or natural language. Aspire leverages recent  developments in the field of automated synthesis technologies that can consider such examples of user intent as input to the synthesis of security specifications. Aspire combines such inputs, along with a domain specific language for security applications, to synthesize a candidate set of possible outputs. The user can either choose a candidate output or provide more examples to guide the synthesis process. In this iterative fashion, the user can generate system specifications, policies, or properties. Aspire uses concepts from the domain of formal methods, machine learning, and programming languages to perform synthesis. Aspire is applicable to a variety of domains including web, mobile, and cloud applications. The output of Aspire's synthesis can either be used for analyzing security vulnerabilities, or for compilation and testing with real systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this project was  to explore the synergy between automated synthesis technologies and security. To perform synthesis, the project leveraged concepts from the domain of formal methods, machine learning, and programming languages. This approach was investigated in the context of a broad set of application domains such as enterprise security, web security, social network security and privacy, as well as smartphone privacy.   By performing synthesis on natural language, application input/output constraints, system demonstrations and even network traces, our work has provided a transformative capability for the design and evaluation of secure systems. For example, our work led to (a) frameworks for automated attack investigation in the context of advanced persistent threats in enterprises, (b) frameworks for social network privacy that formally capture user intent, (c) frameworks that utilize smartphone sensor data while protecting data privacy, and (d) a general framework called ASPIRE  that performs systematic security analysis of complex applications.   This project led to deployment of three real-world systems at NEC, blacklisting of malicious accounts at social networks such as Twitter, and the development of practical frameworks for social authentication. Our research has been broadly disseminated in the research community, and led to training opportunities for both graduate students and undergraduate students.
