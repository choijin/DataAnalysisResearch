<AbstractNarration>Technical:&lt;br/&gt;PIs propose to convene a cross-disciplinary workshop that brings together key players and junior researchers from China and the US in paleontology, evolutionary biology, taphonomy and other field related to the Rise of Modern Biodiversity in the Phanerozoic. This workshop will continue a series of bilateral workshops to address Criticial Transitions in the History of Life started in 2005 and co-sponsored by the US National Science Foundation and China National Science Foundation have co-sponsored a series. The workshop will be hosted at the Field Museum in Chicago, and will feature five broad themes chosen to capture recent, high profile research activities. Experts at all career stages will be invited to provide brief summaries of the status of current research followed by extensive, moderated discussions to identify new research directions and initiatives, which will be disseminated to a wider audience on dedicated web sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical:&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will bring together a diverse group of Sino-US experts that spans the breadth of paleobiology to address Criticial Transitions in the History of Life started in 2005 and co-sponsored by the US National Science Foundation and China National Science Foundation. The workshop will help identify new research directions and initiatives in paleobiology and the outcomes will be widely disseminated to the paleobiology research community.</AbstractNarration>

These experts presented research and held broad discussions relevant to two main topics: How did modern biodiversity arise, and how were functionally modern ecosystems assembled over geological time?  Participants shared their recent research through 33 platform presentations and a dozen posters, organized into four broad themes:  Timing and rise of modern biodiversity and ecosystems; Combining paleontological and molecular perspectives;  Sedimentology, taphonomy and the study of fossilized soft tissues in major lagerst&auml;tten; Climatic and biotic evolution in the Neogene      Each themed presentation set of 4-6 presentations was followed by an in-depth roundtable discussion with the goal of identifying new avenues of research on topics of shared interest. These roundtable discussions highlighted four key topics for future collaborations, all of which are broadly applicable to studying all critical transitions in the history of life:  New and powerful tools for improving temporal calibrations The integration of molecular and fossil datasets in evolutionary reconstructions Quantitative and ecomorphological analyses of the fossil record Advances in biogeochemistry and sedimentary geology      The third day of the workshop was spent visiting the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron facility at Argonne National Lab including presentations from APS scientists on synchrotron applications to the field of paleontology.        Broader Impacts - The rise of modern biological diversity during the last 250 million years is of major interest not only to paleontologists, but also to molecular evolutionists, organic geochemists, sedimentologists, and to evolutionary biologists who employ quantitative approaches to study large-scale macroevolutionary patterns.
