<AbstractNarration>The long-term goal of this research is to enable scientists to manipulate the identity of specific tissues in plants to increase their agricultural potential. For example, this research may identify a factor that can be inhibited to enable leaf tissue to begin producing root proteins, and thereby form roots.  Unshackling the constraints imposed by a fixed tissue identity could have a substantial practical impact by enabling modification of plants to enhance their utility for food, fiber, and fuel.  All organisms contain the blueprint of how tissues are formed and what proteins are produced in genes in a highly organized dynamic complex of proteins and nucleic acids referred to as chromatin. Factors play a critical role in regulating production of tissue-specific genes that determine the developmental identity of specific tissues such as leaf and root.  How genes are expressed in different tissues is of particular interest in plants because changes in gene expression during development are extremely malleable in this kingdom. Although some of the factors have been identified that control tissue-specific genes, very little is known about the regulatory mechanisms and machinery that enable genes to transition from one state or the other. The protein will study one of those factors to decipher the mechanism by which it can control gene regulation in plants.  The proposed research is also aligned with the education mission of NSF. The Principal Investigator (PI) strongly supports undergraduate research and has considerable record of engaging undergraduates in research projects that provide them with a transformative scientific experience. These types of research experiences often play a critical role in prompting students to pursue a Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) career. In addition, graduate students will undertake the bulk of the proposed research, which will provide them with a solid foundation in science associated with research involving genomics, biochemistry, and genetics. The PI has an extensive experience in teaching undergraduate and graduate students and strongly believes in motivating topics in the classroom based on current efforts in the lab. Lessons learned by working with students on the proposed research will provide the bases by which the PI will continue to transform the educational experience of students as head advisor in the Department of Biochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental organizational subunit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins. Factors that control chromatin structure, referred to as chromatin remodelers, play a critical role in regulating expression of tissue-specific genes that determine the developmental identity of specific tissues such as leaf and root.  The protein that will be studied in this work, the chromatin remodeler PICKLE (PKL), is thought to contribute to both regulation of tissue-specific genes by serving as a component of a chromatin-based switch that enables both negative and positive regulation of these genes. Thus deciphering the mechanism of PKL action at these loci will illuminate for the first time how the machinery of plants enables fluid determination of gene expression and developmental identity. The proposed experiments will elucidate a fundamental chromatin-based pathway that restricts developmental identity in plants and thus, are likely to identify novel targets by which developmental identity can be manipulated in recalcitrant species. This proposal will examine the role of the chromatin remodeling protein PKL in determination of developmental identity in Arabidopsis thaliana, a plant that is widely used for laboratory research. PKL alters the structure of nucleosomes and is necessary for proper expression of genes that specify developmental identity. Many of these tissue-specific genes are regulated by the repressive epigenetic mark H3K27me3 (trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 ? a specific modification of a histone protein), which is used to prevent expression of tissue-specific genes in inappropriate tissues (for example to keep root genes off in leaf tissue). PKL is necessary for both repression and activation of H3K27me3-regulated genes, indicating that it acts as both a repressor and an activator of gene expression. This proposal will address the hypothesis that PKL is a component of a chromatin-based switch that enables both negative and positive regulation of developmental genes. This proposal will characterize how PKL contributes to chromatin structure and expression from genes that are regulated by H3K27me3. Specifically, the project will analyze the chromatin of the entire genome to distinguish between different models of PKL action. It will examine how PKL activity is regulated by identifying the modification state of nucleosomes that interact with PKL as well as test the hypothesis that nucleosomes remodeled by PKL are a better substrate for the complex that promotes the H3K27me3 modification. Genetic and biochemical screens will be used to identify new factors and pathways that enable PKL-dependent processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our research generated new insights into how epigenetic factors contribute to gene expression and development in plants.  The genome of a eukaryotic organism, whether a plant or an animal, exists as a highly organized dynamic complex of proteins and nucleic acids referred to as chromatin. The fundamental organizational subunit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins. In both plants and animals, the epigenetic modification of histone H3 referred to as H3K27me3 contributes to stable repression of gene expression, particularly of genes that play critical roles in development.  As a result, it is of great interest to identify factors and processes that contribute to deposition and removal of H3K27me3.  We examined the contribution of three different factors &ndash; PIE1, PKL, and CLF &ndash; to gene expression and incorporation of two epigenetic marks, the histone variant H2A.Z and the histone modification H3K27me3 in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a widely used model organism.  PIE1 and PKL are ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers that were previously known to promote incorporation of H2A.Z and enrichment of H3K27me3 respectively, and CLF is a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes formation of H3K27me3.  We discovered that PIE1 promotes H3K27me3 in addition to H2A.Z and that H3K27me3-enriched chromatin is also enriched for H2A.Z.  These data suggest that incorporation of H2A.Z is necessary for deposition of H3K27me3 and that the repressive chromatin structure that is identified by the presence of H3K27me3 is specifically composed of nucleosomes containing the histone variant H2A.Z.  Nucleosomes containing H2A.Z are often regarded as poised for disruption or a change of state.  H2A.Z is not typically enriched in animal chromatin marked with H3K27me3.  The discovery that H3K27me3-enriched chromatin also contains H2A.Z in Arabidopsis indicates that plants and animals use different building blocks to build this type of repressive chromatin structure.  In addition, this discovery provides a possible mechanism by which plants can manifest developmental fluidity: by building repressive chromatin states that incorporate a built-in mechanism for disassembly.  These studies also suggested a novel mechanism by which levels of H3K27me3 are maintained after deposition:  PKL contributes to retention of the nucleosome bearing this modification after DNA replication and/or transcription.  In total, these data provide insight into the mechanisms possibly used by plants to maintain and/or erase H3K27me3 and thereby maintain or change developmental states.     Other studies in the lab specifically examined the contribution of PKL to floral development and plant reproduction.  Loss of PKL results in altered floral development and reduced fertility.  Genetic analyses coupled with phenotypic characterization of reproductive tissue including seeds revealed that this conserved chromatin remodeling factor is necessary for proper communication between different developmental compartments during plant reproduction and thereby contributes to a range of processes, including pollination, ovule development, and seed size.     Combined, the studies described above illuminate how different epigenetic factors and processes are utilized to enable responsive control of gene expression and development in plants.  As such, these findings lay the groundwork for manipulating gene expression and development in plants to improve their capacity for food, fiber, and fuel.  This research also contributed to the education and professional development of both graduate and undergraduate students.  Two graduate students were responsible for the bulk of the research, one of which is now a tenure-track Assistant Professor and the other of which is now a postdoctoral researcher in another lab.  Twenty-two undergraduates contributed to this research effort and learned the fundamentals of undertaking hypothesis-driven research.  Graduating seniors have gone on to medical school, life science PhD programs, and industry.  In addition, lessons learned by engaging undergraduates in this endeavor have informed the development of a new authentic research experience for high school students in a residential education program with the goal of promoting persistence in STEM.
