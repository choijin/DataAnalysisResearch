<AbstractNarration>This program will develop a method of measuring the gravitational redshift effect (change in the frequency of light waves), which has become a new means of testing general relativity on on the scale of galaxies. There is also a plan to validate this method with numerical simulations. Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher.  With a collaborative team including computer science and graphics students at Carnegie Mellon, a computer game for public outreach will be developed based on cosmological structure formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analytic theory and large scale realistic cosmological simulations will be employed to make predictions for gravitational redshifts of galaxies in various environments. Optimal statistical estimators will be formulated to best constrain the large-scale gravitational potential. These estimators will be applied to the simulated data to carry out tests and to make predictions, which will be applied to existing galaxy catalogs.</AbstractNarration>

There are two leading possibilities to explain this. Either a previously unknown substance with negative pressure (``Dark Energy'') causes it to accelerate, or that our theory of gravity, GR, somehow breaks down when we approach cosmological scales. In order to tell these possibilities apart we therefore need to extend our tests of gravity to these scales. Measuring gravitational redshifts of entire galaxies offers a new way to do this.

We have used supercomputing resources to carry out detailed simulations of the Universe, starting from the Big Bang and ending up with maps such as that shown in Figure 1. The various effects of Einsteins GR on the observational properties of galaxies are also predicted by our simulations. For example the gravitational redshift is shown by contours in Figure 1, and galaxies will have different values depending on how deeply they lie in the "gravitational potential wells" caused by dark matter. We have used these and other simulations to predict how these GR effects can be measured from observed galaxy data.

Our measurement extended to scales of 50 million light years, and is consistent with Einstein's General Relativity - we find no evidence for deviations or modifications to our current theory of gravity.&nbsp; We also made measurements on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales, using integral field spectroscopy data from the SDSS survey to look at gravitational redshifts inside galaxies. We created a special software data pipeline (see Figure 3) which increased precision over the standard data treatment by a factor of ten.&nbsp; In this case we made the first significant constraints on the redshifts, showing that dark matter must be a subdominant component at the centers of galaxies, and again that GR works on thise scales.</p> <p class="p2"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Broader impacts:</span></p> <p class="p2"><span class="s1">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">A major outreach project has been the creation of a new way to teach&nbsp;</span>how gravity works in the cosmos: "Galaxy formation", a video game which was written in collaboration with a team of undergraduate research students over 4 years.&nbsp; The game aims to familiarize the players with how galaxies and structure forms in the Universe, as well as what dark matter is and what cosmologists study.
