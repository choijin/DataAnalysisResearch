<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to support a meeting titled Nanophotonic Device: Beyond Classical Limits from May 14-16th, 2014 at the OSA in Washington, DC. USA. This support will permit top-notch experts in nanophotonics to deliver plenary talks on recent advances and future research directions. This meeting will allow researchers, engineers and business leaders a valuable opportunity to meet and discuss challenges and opportunities regarding research in nanophotonics technology. Results of the meeting will impact photonic computing solutions, sensitive point-of-care diagnostics, and revolutions in next generation solar cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last decade, on-chip integrated photonic circuits have shown great potential for big-data bandwidth applications. However, while the photonic device performance is steadily increasing, the inherently weak light-matter-interactions set fundamental limits to integration density, bandwidth, and drive power consumption. The goal of this meeting is to determine the next revolutionary steps of photonics technologies for communication and optical computing. Emerging nanophotonics materials, optical confinement options, and integration schemes will be discussed, analyzed, and planned.</AbstractNarration>
