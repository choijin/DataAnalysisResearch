<AbstractNarration>The University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System, (UNOLS) is a consortium of sixty-one U.S. academic institutions and facilities with research and educational programs in the ocean sciences.  Of these institutions, there are fifteen institutions which operate the twenty oceanographic research ships which form the U.S. Academic Research Fleet.  This proposal is for the University of Rhode Island?s Graduate School of Oceanography to host the UNOLS Office for a second term of five years from 2014 to 2019. The UNOLS Office is comprised of five full time and two part time employees.  Under the guidance and leadership of the UNOLS Office, much of the work is done through the volunteers from the scientific community who serve on our nine standing committees. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The UNOLS organization, founded in 1971, has played an important role in coordinating and improving the operations of the nation?s Academic Research Fleet.  One of the important focus areas for UNOLS is to coordinate and schedule these national assets, to plan for the future, and to be able to identify and meet the scientific infrastructure requirements of the U.S. oceanographic research scientists, students and technicians. This enables the United States to make advances in science, education, and the public awareness of our natural environment.  One of the critical functions that the UNOLS Office performs, through broad community involvement, is to assist in prioritizing the resources within the available budgets to ensure the advancement of the field of oceanography.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is through the UNOLS efforts that we are able to assist the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies with providing community feedback and input on the future direction of oceanographic research in the United States. Through the various UNOLS meetings, workshops, reports, studies, and daily communication, UNOLS provides a conduit for open dialog between the agencies supporting this research and the scientific community being served.  The NSF?s mission to ?promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense? are all aided by the UNOLS Office?s ability to bring together the scientific minds to identify what are the science questions that need to be answered, and then to provide the safe platforms to conduct this important work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is through the UNOLS consortium that we are able to bring together a broad community of scientists, &lt;br/&gt;students, ocean engineers and technicians;  a diverse group of academic research institutions and our federal partners; and of the greatest importance, the next generation of early career scientists who will  help advance the field of marine science to meet the challenges which we will face. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System, (UNOLS) is a consortium of sixty-one U.S. academic institutions and facilities.  Within this consortium there are twenty oceanographic research ships which form the U.S. Academic Research Fleet.  The UNOLS Office serves as a mechanism for the development and sharing of science mission requirements and the articulation of the science drivers, which will help determine the direction of the oceanographic programs within the academic community.  The UNOLS Office facilitates closer collaboration of a diverse group of intellectual talent, which solves the scientific and technical challenges facing scientific research.  Through the nine standing committees within UNOLS, areas such as data management, development of tools for deep sea research, Fleet modernization, safe operation of vessels at sea, working in extreme polar environments, marine seismic exploration, efficient ship scheduling, and the enhancement of research through new technology such as unmanned aerial vehicles and deep sea ocean observatories are all effectively addressed.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is through the efforts of UNOLS that marine research programs are able to enjoy access to the sea.  From large international, multidisciplinary research programs looking at biogeochemical cycles and large-scale distribution of trace elements which are critical for marine life, to near shore studies trying to understand the effects of pollutants on both human and marine organisms, the UNOLS Office and our members all work collectively to meet these challenges and advance the field of oceanographic  research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) is an organization of 59 academic institutions and national laboratories involved in oceanographic research and joined for the purpose of coordinating oceanographic ships' schedules and research facilities.   The UNOLS goals are to:  Promote broad, coordinated access to oceanographic research facilities, Support continuous improvement of existing facilities, Plan for and foster support for the oceanographic facilities of the future.   It is through the coordination work of the UNOLS Office that the activities of UNOLS are carried out by members of the scientific community and facility operators serving on the UNOLS Council and committees.  Funding provided by the National Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the United States Geological Survey, and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management supported the UNOLS Office activities.  During the period of this award, (2014-2020), the UNOLS Office, based at the University of Rhode Island's Graduate School of Oceanography, supported the programs and activities of the organization. UNOLS activities that helped to address the intellectual merit and broader of impact of this award included:  Ship Scheduling: UNOLS Ship schedulers worked to provide access to the sea by scheduling funded projects on the ARF ships in the time frame that met the project?s scientific objectives while also optimizing the utilization of the fleet.   Academic Research Fleet and Facilities Improvement: UNOLS continued to work to assure that the number, mix, and overall capability of ships in the Fleet match the science requirements of academic oceanography in the U.S.  Fleet Safety: Safety of ARF operations is of paramount importance.  The UNOLS Research Vessel Safety Standards (RVSS) provide guidance to assure that research at sea is conducted to the highest practicable standards of safety. The RVSS continued to be regularly reviewed and updated and is available on the UNOLS website.  It is a useful safety reference for all research vessel operations.  International Collaborations: UNOLS continued to expand its reach by working with international organizations.   They helped organize the 2014 and the 2018 INMARTECH Symposia and the 2015 IRSO meeting, all held in the U.S.  INMARTECH provides a forum for marine technicians to exchange knowledge, thereby aiming to improve equipment performance and operational techniques during scientific cruises worldwide. The UNOLS Office continued to host the IRSO web site.  These activities have resulted in stronger collaborations and sharing of knowledge across borders.   Opportunities for Training and Professional development: UNOLS continued to engage the next generation of sea-going scientists.  Programs included:   Chief Scientist Training Workshops introduced new investigators to cruise planning and execution.  During the period of this award 12 workshops were held on 7 different ships. The DeSSC New User Program, held annually, engaged new users interested in using deep submergence vehicles for research. UNOLS assisted the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center with their at-sea internship program aboard research vessels. Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Student Experiences Aboard Ships (STEMSEAS) used transit cruises aboard ARF vessels to provide undergraduate students with sea-going experiences.  STEMSEAS exposes non-STEM students to STEM issues and careers. The UNOLS cruise opportunity program matched oceanographic students with research cruises.   Community Outreach: UNOLS engaged the science community, as well as the broader general public, with information featuring the research fleet and facilities.  This included the UNOLS web site, the UNOLS Public Outreach Resources webpage, and open-house events featuring research vessels.  Greening the Academic Research Fleet: UNOLS continued to promote the environmental sustainability of the ARF. Green Boats and Ports for Blue Waters workshops were held in 2016 and in 2018. Topics addressed included port sustainability, propulsion and fuel, energy monitoring and conservation, recycling, certification, compliance, and noise pollution.  The information provided applies to marine facilities worldwide and can help to promote environmental awareness globally.
