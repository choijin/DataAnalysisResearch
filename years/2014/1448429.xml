<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the enablement of new and improved therapeutic drug development.  One hurdle in the development of new drugs, is their relatively low effectiveness due to poor water solubility limiting formulation choices and/or limiting cellular uptake.  Forming drug nano particles, by way of controlling the drug crystal formation process, is one tool to overcome this low solubility hurdle.   Acoustical energy has been shown to aid in the formation of drug crystallization however, current acoustical technologies are not able to reliably achieve the crystal size and distribution needed for many new drug candidates.  A reliable method for nanoparticle drug production will allow better and more effective drugs to make it to market. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop equipment and processes that enable the continuous manufacture of drug nanoparticles by controlling the crystallization using a novel focused acoustical field.  Focused acoustics has the advantage of delivering a highly efficient, controllable, scalable energy field to the crystallization zone.  The project will demonstrate a focused acoustics nanocrystallization process capable of being developed into commercial grade equipment suitable for use in a continuous flow production pharmaceutical manufacturing environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In Phase I, a prototype Adaptive Focused Acoustics&trade; (AFA) system was designed, built, and tested for the purpose of controlling nucleation and crystal growth of solvent:antisolvent precipitation of small molecule drugs.  A number of design iterations/modifications to the hardware were made to allow reliable operation, and to improve processing performance.  Model drug compounds were tested in batch sizes of 130&micro;L up through and including continuous flow processing as high as 30mL/min.  Continuous flow operation was tested with run durations up to 10 hours at concentrations as high as 500mM of API, resulting in a production rate as high as 292mg/min.  Mean particles sizes below 130nm were achieved.  Critical system design aspects were identified and included sample process temperatures, flow rates, process vessel design, and acoustical processing settings including primary driving frequency and acoustical waveform input form.  The capability of AFA to produce stable nanoparticles was first demonstrated at the batch level, and demonstrated the dramatic effect of AFA on particle size control (Figure 1).  The conditions were then scaled up for a continuous process production. The system was tested with a number of model drugs that included cinnarizine, ibuprofen, felodipine, and indomethacin, and this demonstrated functionality across models with varying degrees of complexity of functional groups. The Phase I performance results, under both continuous and batch processing, are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The ability of the system to run at a range of production rates and conditions with several different model drugs demonstrates the versatility of the system as a technique for tight control of nucleation and crystal growth.  AFA Particle size control  AFA was shown to be able to control crystal size by simply changing the computer-controlled parameters of the system.  The results in Figure 2 demonstrate the ability of AFA-mediated crystallization to vary particle sizes in a controlled manner, from the low micron range to sub-200nm.  The scalability of AFA allows for the production of nanocrystals in a continuous process, which is valuable to the pharmaceutical industry as it allows for large-scale production of the desired API. In addition, obtaining of crystals with controlled morphology and uniform particle sizes is highly desirable to industry for the downstream processing of the API.  Furthermore, drug nanocrystals, especially those below 200nm in size, enable efficient, targeted drug delivery, leading to important advances in nanomedicine - from generating better formulations for aerosol delivery to benefiting oncology research. Thus, sub-200nm nanocrystals are highly sought after by the industry, though it is generally not trivial to produce them. The AFA technology has demonstrated a capability to consistently produce mixtures of particles with sizes below 200nm, drawing interest from several potential industry partners.  In addition, AFA combined with chemical control allows for the production of micron-sized crystals with a tight size distribution, providing better morphology control and size distribution than conventional methods of producing micron-sized particles. Based on the enthusiastic feedback from early exposure to industry scientists, AFA-mediated crystallization shows great promise as a scientifically relevant and commercially marketable technology.
