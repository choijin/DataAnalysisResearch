<AbstractNarration>Harvesting energy from the environment can allow wireless electronic devices to operate indefinitely. This project is for the development of a flexible, multifunctional structure that can generate electrical power from both incident sunlight and ambient wind flow. Such a device could be an ideal power source for wireless sensors or mobile robots in areas where hardwired power is unavailable and battery replacement is costly or impractical. Combining wind and solar power takes advantage of the two major sources of ambient energy and would allow the energy harvesting system to operate both day and night. The technology developed here will benefit society and the environment by offering a new approach for creating self-reliant sensing devices that does not rely on short-term and environmentally hazardous consumable batteries. These sensors could provide structural health monitoring for bridges and buildings, collect weather or ecological data in remote areas to help understand global climate change, improve security around critical infrastructure, or even provide early warnings about natural disasters like floods or Tsunamis. In addition, the low profile and integrated nature of a wind and solar hybrid energy harvester could also be useful on rooftops and exteriors in urban areas to power sustainable buildings. In addition to its technical objectives, this project will train graduate students and provide mentored summer research experiences for underrepresented undergraduate students through a multi-university program among North Carolina's public colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will create an integrated, solar and wind hybrid energy harvester that offers unparalleled simplicity and robustness, low mass, and a negligible increase in geometric footprint compared to a solar array alone. The envisioned device will consist of an array of slender, ribbon-like, flexible thin film solar cells that are laminated with piezoelectric patches. These piezo-solar ribbons will be mounted in longitudinal tension and exposed to a transverse wind flow, creating a fluid-elastic system that will experience aeroelastic limit cycle oscillations (LCO) over a broad range of wind speeds, causing them to vibrate in the flow like plucked guitar strings. These vibrations will produce cyclic strains in the piezoelectric layers, generating an alternating current that can be rectified and used to charge storage elements or power electrical loads. The solar cells, on the other hand, will directly transduce incident sunlight into direct current.</AbstractNarration>

The prototype device consists of a slender, ribbon-like, flexible thin film solar module connected to two vertical steel beams with laminated piezoelectric patches at the clamped ends of the beams, creating an inverted U-shaped geometry. These devices were mounted in longitudinal tension and exposed to a transverse wind flow, creating a fluid-elastic system that experiences aeroelastic limit cycle oscillations (LCO) over a broad range of wind speeds, causing them to vibrate in the flow like plucked guitar strings. The wind-induced vibrations produced cyclic strains in the piezoelectric layers, generating an alternating current that can be rectified and used to charge batteries or power electrical loads. When two such devices were placed in tandem to form an array, aerodynamic interactions between the wake of the upstream ribbon and the next ribbon downstream constructively improved the power output of the array. Simultaneous wind-solar experiments were also carried out to gage the interdependence between the solar and wind power outputs.  Intellectual merit: This research work has made the following contributions to the scientific and engineering community:  We created a working prototype, which showed that it is possible to create a hybrid wind and solar energy harvesting device which captures energy across disparate domains with a single integrated structure.   We developed a second-generation inverted-U shaped geometry device whose wind power output is several orders of magnitude higher than the initial plain ribbon device.   We established a structural modeling framework which not only accounted for the various geometrical and material discontinuities but also the nonlinear response of structure.   We investigated and characterized the complex motion kinematics of the aeroelastically oscillating ribbon with the use of high speed imagery.   We identified several tuning parameters, like the preset applied tension and angle of attack, which were experimentally characterized and shown to affect the wind power output of the device.   We showed that the wind power output of the device could be synergistically scaled up by positioning multiple identical ribbons in tandem to create constructive wake-structure interactions.   We established that the solar power output shows very low sensitivity to the wind induced oscillations, therefore demonstrating that the addition of wind energy harvesting capability to the system does not decrease the solar energy harvesting performance.    Broader impacts: The research effort benefited society through the STEM outreach and education activities carried out at the PI?s laboratory:  Over the duration of the project, eight NCSU undergraduate students and two visiting undergraduate students gained access to the research topics, materials, and laboratory equipment through mentored research activities in the PI?s lab.   The outreach activities also included participation of three local high school students in semester-long mentored research internships where they received hands-on training to design and fabricate conceptual prototypes. This helped to disseminate the results and goals of the research as these high school students shared their knowledge and experiences with their peers through posters, presentations and reports at their parent high schools.   Based on work from this project, one high school student also participated at the Conrad Spirit of Innovation Challenge, an international competition promoting innovation and entrepreneurship.   The participating students included individuals traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields including four female undergraduate students, one African American undergraduate student, and one female high school student.   This research also inspired two undergraduate students to pursue graduate level engineering degrees, adding further depth to the national STEM workforce.   The project also supported graduate education of three doctoral students at NCSU and led to the publication of several technical papers in conference proceedings and journals as well as a graduate thesis.   The technology and techniques developed here may also benefit society and the environment by offering a new approach for creating self-reliant sensing devices that do not rely on short-term and environmentally hazardous consumable batteries. These sensors could provide structural health monitoring for bridges and buildings, collect weather or ecological data in remote areas to help understand global climate change, improve security around critical infrastructure, or even provide early warnings about natural disasters like floods or Tsunamis. The low profile and integrated nature of the wind and solar hybrid energy harvester shown here could also be useful on rooftops and exteriors in urban areas to power sustainable buildings. Additionally, the high frequency oscillations of the flexible ribbons can decrease the accumulation of dirt on the solar cells, decreasing maintenance requirements in dry and dusty environments.
