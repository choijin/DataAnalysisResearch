<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project's broader/commercial impact is the potential of the intelligent tutoring system to increase young learners' science motivation and achievement and to improve their fluent reading and comprehension skills.  The innovation thus addresses a critical national need to improve students' science learning and reading proficiency in our nation's schools, since national assessments of educational progress indicate that the majority of fourth, eighth and twelfth grade students are not proficient in either science or reading on standardized tests.  The innovation is thus designed to provide teachers with an accessible, affordable and highly effective learning tool that will improve their students' engagement, motivation and learning in both science and reading.  The projects' commercialization plan is designed to support widespread distribution of the innovation to schools in the U.S. and globally through existing channels, thus increasing the potential for broad societal impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of an intelligent tutoring system that will help children learn to reason about science and comprehend science texts through conversational interactions with a virtual tutor.  Successful outcomes of the project will lead to new insights and contribute to scientific knowledge about how advanced human language technologies, character animation technologies and computer vision technologies can be combined and integrated into intelligent tutoring systems to optimize young learners' engagement, motivation, self-efficacy and learning.  The project is based on theory and scientific research on how children learn through social interaction in multimedia environments, and prior research by the project team that improved children's motivation to learn science and their science achievement through conversations with a virtual science tutor.  Successful outcomes of the SBIR Phase I project will extend this prior research and advance scientific knowledge by demonstrating the feasibility and promise of an intelligent tutoring system that tracks and interprets students? eye movements to improve science learning, oral reading fluency and reading comprehension.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the SBIR Phase I project was to demonstrate the feasibility and promise of MindStars Books.  A MindStars Book is an intelligent tutoring system in which children interact with a virtual agent that explains science using multimedia presentations.  At logical stopping points within the book, the agent presents multiple choice questions to assess studentsÆ understanding of the vocabulary and concepts presented thus far.  Students receive immediate formative feedback on their answer choices.  Correct answers are reinforced and expanded.  Incorrect first choices are followed by a hint and a second try.  If the second choice is incorrect, the question is repeated, and the correct answer is given, along with its expansion.  Students then practice reading a short text passage about the science.  During reading practice, students can listen to the agent read sentences aloud as the words are highlighted, or click on individual words to hear them pronounced.  When ready, students read each sentence independently, and then listen to their recording as each word they spoke is highlighted on the screen.  All three activities within the MindStars Book are self-paced, and thus under student control.  Images 1-3, respectively, show screenshots of a narrated multimedia science presentation, a multiple choice question, and reading practice.  In two pilot studies, 80 first and second grade students were presented with 14 MindStars books over a 4 to 6 week period, The main goals of the studies were to: 1) demonstrate the feasibility of the MindStars Books to engage students in science learning and reading practice, 2) learn whether using the books increased studentsÆ understanding of science, and their motivation to study science in the future, 3) learn whether the guided reading practice increased their self-confidence about their ability to read science texts, and 4) learn whether teachers viewed the MindStars Books as a useful supplement to their classroom instruction.   The key outcomes of the project were: a) Highly positive experiences by students who used the MindStars Books; approximately 70% of students reported that the books were fun, that they learned many new and interesting things about science, and that they were more excited about science after using them, b) Evidence that students learned key vocabulary and concepts based on their responses to the multiple choice questions (75% first choice correct, 96% correct after receiving a hint and making a second choice), c) Reports by over 70% of students that they could read sentences better after using the books, and d) Highly positive reviews by all teachers, who said they would like to use the program in the future.  The teachers reported that their students were always eager to use the books and were consistently "on task" while using them.  Teachers also reported that the integration of science learning and reading practice was their most important feature, as the activities reinforced each other, and made it easy for them to schedule students to use the books during science, reading or language arts instruction.  Histograms of Students and Teachers responses to questions in the second pilot study are shown in Figures 1-3.  In addition to developing and measuring the feasibility of MindStars Books to improve student engagement and learning in science and reading, we also investigated the feasibility of using existing open-source or commercial eye gaze tracking systems to measure studentsÆ attention during each of the MindStars Books activities.  Our investigation identified one commercially available gaze tracking system, The Eye Tribe (https://theeyetribe.com/), that was sufficiently robust, accurate, and inexpensive ($99) to merit further investigation of possible benefits of tracking studentsÆ eye gaze while using MSBs to gain insights into their cognition and improve student experiences and learning in the future. In sum, the main outcomes resulting from the Phase 1 ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
