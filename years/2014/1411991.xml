<AbstractNarration>Plants and microorganisms produce a large variety of natural molecules with complex chemical architecture and beneficial properties.  These small molecules are made by an assembly-line-like machinery composed of enzymes in the producing organisms. This proposal will probe the structure and mechanism of enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of a specific class of peptide natural products. Using an interdisciplinary approach, the researchers will determine the atomic resolution structures of key machinery components using X-ray diffraction.  The structural work will be complemented by synthetic organic chemistry and molecular biology approaches. Overall, the results will both provide insight into the fundamental chemistry and will help guide the metabolic engineering of biosynthetic pathways to produce useful molecules. Coupled to the research plan is a comprehensive education and outreach plan that will exploit the results and approaches to engage high school, undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Steven Bruner from the University of Florida to study the structure and mechanism of complex, multidomain enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of non-ribosomal peptide natural products.  These pathways are responsible for the production of a wide range of structurally diverse and therapeutically important products.  The proposal will use an interdisciplinary approach focused on small molecule probes in combination with protein X-ray crystallography and mechanistic enzymology. The work will address key unanswered questions in regard to the structure and mechanism of peptide construction: amide bond formation, amino acid epimerization and peptide cyclization.  Expanding on prior results, a structural genomics approach will be used with enzymes of the T. fusca fuscachelin pathway as a model for all non-ribosomal peptide pathways.  Specific focus will be on the structural characterization of protein/protein interactions, substrate trafficking and unresolved mechanistic questions.  The broader impacts of this work encompass multiple disciplines, as the results of this program have application and impact in diverse areas of secondary metabolite production, including metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.  In addition, a strong educational component is present, incorporating aspects of the research plan to introduce students at many levels to the interdisciplinary approaches of chemical biology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Plants, bacteria, fungi and other organisms produce a wide variety of natural products with therapeutically useful properties. Peptide-based molecules are particularly common and favored as drug candidates.  Many of these molecules are synthesized on large protein-based assembly lines containing multiple, modular domains.  Understanding the mechanism of these protein machines can lead to the production of novel therapeutics through rational manipulation of the protein modules.  This goals of this project are to understand the structure and mechanism of these catalytic machines.   Detailed insight into the machinery provides both knowledge into the basic chemistry and, in addition, provides a useful framework for engineering pathways and producing organisms to generate useful therapeutic molecules.  In this project, we have studied several aspects of peptide natural product biosynthesis including the machinery that makes the key amide bonds that links the amino acid monomers.  Additionally, we generated the first structures of the machinery that inverts the stereochemistry of monomers, a key structural feature that commonly relates to biological function.   The final aim of the proposal period, examined the terminal machinery responsible for producing cyclic peptides, therapeutically favorable and stable end-products.   Protein structure determination, using X-ray crystallography, is a key tool utilized in this work, the structures provide unmatched insight into the mechanism and provide a template to guide the engineered biosynthesis of pathways.
