<AbstractNarration>Engineering design is recognized as a critical element of engineering thinking and is what differentiates engineering from other problem solving approaches in science and mathematics. One of the primary goals of engineering design education is to equip students with the capability to become expert design engineers. To develop this capability in students, educators require a detailed knowledge of the thinking process of both undergraduate students and expert design engineers. This project will measure and compare the design thinking of engineering students and expert professional engineers while designing. This research uses techniques and processes developed in previously funded NSF projects to compare students and experts that is independent of the educational and experiential background of the participants. The project is significant in its ability to gain access to engineering design thinking and lay the foundation for engineering education decision-making. Understanding the differences between developing learners and an experts' knowledge is essential to the identification of appropriate learning experiences to reduce this performance gap. To address this gap in knowledge, this project proposes a controlled study of teams of students from two universities with different diversity profiles and of teams of engineering design experts, to measure their respective designing thinking while designing. It utilizes the protocol analysis method, where videos are transcribed, segmented, coded, and analyzed to produce the base data. Understanding the relationship between design teaching and outcomes, and engineering expert behavior is not fully understood. As a consequence there is insufficient knowledge of the long-term performance expected as a result of engineering design education. Results from this research have the potential to transform engineering education nationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the differences between developing learners in engineering and an expert engineers' target performance is essential to identify appropriate learning experiences to move novice learners along the trajectory to becoming experts. However, the design cognition of expert design engineers is inadequately characterized. This project will measure and compare the design thinking of engineering students and expert professional engineers through a study of their cognitive processes while designing. It will use tools and processes developed in previously funded NSF projects to provide a uniform basis for comparing students and experts that is independent of the educational and experiential background of the participants. The project has the ability to lay the foundation for engineering education decision-making. The results of prior research showed that there is a gap between engineering students and engineering experts. To address this gap in knowledge, this project proposes a controlled study of cohorts of teams of students from two universities with different diversity profiles and of teams of engineering design experts, to measure their respective design thinking. It utilizes the protocol analysis method, where videos are transcribed, segmented, coded, and analyzed to produce the base data and uses the Function-Behavior-Structure ontology as the basis of the coding scheme. In order to better prepare students for future careers, it is extremely important to incorporate this content into engineering education. There is a need to develop supplemental teaching materials featuring problem decomposition and problem recomposition. A workshop of engineering educators is proposed where these results can be developed as the basis of educational interventions.</AbstractNarration>

Twenty-two teams of freshmen, 18 teams of seniors and 18 teams of professional engineering designers were studied.

These results formed the basis of comparisons between student designers and professional designers. These comparisons show that the distributions of cognitive effort between students and professional are significantly different for all the measurements at different levels of detail. Students put less of their cognitive design effort into thinking about how a design is expected to perform compared to professionals. However, they put more of their cognitive design effort into thinking about how a proposed design does perform than do professionals. Students put less of their cognitive design effort into thinking about possible designs than do professionals. Students put less of their cognitive design effort into re-thinking expectations about how a design should perform than do professionals. Freshmen exhibited a lower positive sentiment than did seniors, who exhibited a lower positive sentiment than did professionals. A more detailed study of team behavior showed that teams that included females exhibited more collaboration than all male teams. These results showing differences between engineering students and engineering professional designing, form the basis for developing educational policies and educational interventions that move students along an education trajectory towards becoming professional engineering designers. Note: Graphical charts showing 1) Distributions of Cognitive Design Issues and 2) Distributions of Cognitive Design Processes is uploaded as files.
