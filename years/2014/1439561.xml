<AbstractNarration>Ontologies or controlled vocabularies are fundamental to data access and data sharing in the sciences. This project consists of two workshops where ontology developers would connect the Animal Behavior Ontology (ABO), an ontology of normal behavior across a wide variety of animals, to the NeuroBehavior Ontology (NBO), a well-developed ontology of the behavioral phenotypes of model organisms. As behavioral studies have become increasingly inter-disciplinary and collaborative, establishing a cohesive framework within which data can be labeled and shared becomes increasingly important to allow full utilization of data produced with federal support. The joined ABO and NBO will become one ontology, the Comprehensive Behavioral Ontology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ontologies are controlled vocabularies that specify the classes of objects that exist, the relationships among those classes, and the possible relationships among instances of the classes. More than 10 years ago behaviorists began to create the Animal Behavior Ontology (ABO), an ontology of normal behavior across non-model taxa.  As animal behavior expanded to include behavior genetics, genomics, neurobiology and particularly the use of model organisms, specialized ontologies are being developed. The NeuroBehavior Ontology (NBO) is a well-developed ontology of the behavioral phenotypes of model organisms, but it lacks a formal structural relationship to the taxonomically broad and evolution-based ABO. To bring about the integration of these two ontologies, we propose a series of two workshops. The first will convene animal behavior experts to identify the categories in each ontology that need to be defined, resolved and organized in terms of relationships. The second workshop will bring together ontology experts with behavioral biologists to take the recommendations and materials developed in the first workshop and make the necessary changes in the NBO that will make full integration possible. The researchers will disseminate the ontologies through journal article and working with publishers to include the ontology's meta data terms in supplementary material and deposited data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The goal of this project was to develop a single vocabulary to describe animal behaviors and provide it as a unified "ontology" that would make it possible to locate and share digitally stored data about behavior.  The potential beneficiaries of this project include a broad range of behavioral scientists, the behavior-interested public (pet lovers, animal trainers, etc), teachers who use behavioral concepts in their teaching, and indeed all those interested in making information shareable, usable and re-usable digitally.    Ontologies are sets of defined terms with explicit relationships between the terms or concepts (e.g., "all Boxers are a KIND OF Dog") and can thus be used as tools to investigate the natural phenomena to which they refer.  They also have a pragmatic use in identifying digital data on specific topics. Data sets can be labeled with terms from an ontology and then "found" by searching for those terms or for higher-order terms that include them.  For instance, one could find pictures of many specific breeds of dogs by searching for pictures of "Dogs", as long as each is labeled with a breed found under "dog" in an ontology. Thus, in their machine-readable form, ontologies facilitate sharing of digital data and communication within and across disciplines.   The field of behavioral biology is diverse and includes neuroscience, abnormal psychology, and behavioral ecology, among others. Because research is increasingly integrated across sub-disciplines, there had been several attempts to create broadly useful ontologies. However, at the start of this project, behavioral science had no common ontology, unlike some other fields of study, e.g. vertebrate anatomy. In an effort to facilitate understanding and sharing of information across sub-disciplines, we set out to integrate two existing behavioral ontologies--the NeuroBehavior Ontology (NBO) and the Animal Behavior Ontology (ABO)&mdash;into one and promote its use across the field.   We convened two workshops, the first to bring together experts in areas of animal behavior to compare the terms and relationships in the two ontologies and recommend a framework that would integrate them without losing concepts specific to each.  The second workshop brought together the authors of both ontologies and ontology experts with knowledge of behavioral studies to identify and begin the technical steps to integration.  The workshops and post-workshop efforts by the PIs and ontology authors have resulted in these final outcomes:   1. NBO and ABO now reside together in "behavior-ontology", a single public project on Github (github.com), where the ontology community can review, update and recommend continuing changes. Definitions of terms within both have been added and reconciled, and synonymous terms identified.    2.  A complete merger is now in progress as a controlled process in which each move of terms from ABO into appropriate places in the NBO are suggested, "committed" and released after an automatic check that the change is compatible with the ontology?s organization.  When completed, the revised ontology will be available in several forms.  In addition to the raw ontology files being available on github (url), the ontology will be found on several ontology portal sites, e.g. http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/nbo,  http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/NBO or http://aber-owl.net/ontology/NBO.   The NBO-ABO ontology can then be deployed for "tagging" many different kinds of digital behavioral data (data sets, images, etc). Users will include researchers interested in functional relationships between behaviors, sites that archive data, publishers of behavioral studies and many others.     3. Workshops served graduate and undergraduate education.   The workshops themselves included both graduate and undergraduate students in behavioral biology, thus introducing these young scientists to a world of data sharing mechanisms and theory of which they were mostly unaware.  At this time, there is little opportunity for young behavioral biologists to learn about the challenges, theory and practice of ontologies, even though this emerging field will be critical to their own careers in a digitally linked world.     4. Publicizing the new ontology to the invested communities: The developing NBO-ABO merger was publicized as a paper or poster at several scientific conferences during the grant period, but broad dissemination to the groups invested in data sharing must wait until the merger process is complete and a functional single ontology is accessible at one or more portals (see 2. above).
