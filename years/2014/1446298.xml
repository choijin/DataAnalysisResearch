<AbstractNarration>Title: CPS: Breakthrough: Development of Novel Architectures for Control and Diagnosis of Safety-Critical Complex Cyber-Physical Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing novel architectures for control and diagnosis of complex cyber-physical systems subject to stringent performance requirements in terms of safety, resilience, and adaptivity. These ever-increasing demands necessitate the use of formal model-based approaches to synthesize provably-correct feedback controllers. The intellectual merit of this research lies in a novel combination of techniques from the fields of dynamical systems, discrete event systems, reactive synthesis, and graph theory, together with new advancements in terms of abstraction techniques, computationally efficient synthesis of control and diagnosis strategies that support distributed implementations, and synthesis of acquisition of information and communication strategies. The project's broader significance and importance are demonstrated by the expected improvement of the safety, resilience, and performance of complex cyber-physical systems in critical infrastructures as well as the efficiency with which they are designed and certified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original approach being developed is based on the combination of multi-resolution abstraction graphs for building discrete models of the underlying cyber-physical system with reactive synthesis techniques that exploit a representation of the solution space in terms of a finite structure called a decentralized bipartite transition system. The concepts of abstraction graph and decentralized bipartite transition system are novel and open new avenues of investigation with significant potential to the formal synthesis of safe, resilient, and adaptive controllers. This methodology naturally results in a set of decentralized and asynchronous controllers and diagnosers, which ensures greater resilience and adaptivity. Overall, this research will significantly impact the Science of Cyber-Physical Systems and the Engineering of Cyber-Physical Systems.</AbstractNarration>

It is impossible to find a technological system, either cyber or cyber-physical, that does not contain a feedback loop somewhere in its design. The principal aim of this project was the development of novel architectures for control and diagnosis of complex cyber-physical systems subject to stringent performance requirements in terms of safety, resilience, and adaptivity. These ever-increasing demands necessitate the use of formal model-based approaches to synthesize provably-correct feedback controllers. The original approach that was developed was based on the combination of multi-resolution abstraction techniques for building discrete models of the underlying cyber-physical system with reactive synthesis techniques that exploit a representation of the solution space in terms of a finite structure that defines the solution space for safety, liveness, and other logical requirements. These methodologies and associated theoretical foundations are generic and applicable to many types of complex cyber-physical systems with similar safety-critical requirements, in particular reconfigurable networked systems such as aircraft electric power systems and intelligent transportation systems.  The technical approach had its foundations in the theories of controllability of dynamical systems and supervisory control of discrete-state event-driven dynamic systems, complemented with results from graph theory and abstraction techniques. Using a formal model-based approach, the following problems were investigated: (1) Construction of a compact discrete abstraction of the continuous dynamics of a given CPS, with a focus on capturing horizontal modularity and exploiting symmetry present in the system structure.  (2) Development of a methodology based on the discrete abstraction for the construction of a suitable bipartite transition system over which to the synthesis of control and diagnosis strategies that satisfy the given requirements are performed.  (3) Algorithmic synthesis of sensing, communication, and actuation strategies that realize the information structure required to implement the controllers and achieve the desired properties of safety, liveness, and maximal permissiveness.  (4) Development of case studies on a university-scale testbed for an aircraft electric power system. The research conducted in this project resulted in formal methodologies and associated software tools that will have a significant impact on a large class of technological systems that are of great societal importance. Results were published in archival journals and conference proceedings. Software tools implementing the methodologies that were developed are publicly available from the project website maintained at the University of Michigan.  This project contributed to the training of several graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and undergraduate students at the University of Michigan in the important area of safe and resilient of control of cyber-physical systems.
