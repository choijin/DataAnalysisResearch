<AbstractNarration>The quality of infants' social experiences over the course of development affects most aspects of their developing self. One of the biggest contributors to infant social experience is the mother. This is especially true in coping with stressful situations. Mothers' ability to regulate their own emotions and behaviors in stressful situations influences infants' ability to regulate their own stress reactions. This project aims to explore this relationship by introducing a moderate stressor experimentally to both mothers and their infants. Of interest is how maternal stress affects maternal self-regulation, infants' regulation, and the subsequent interaction between the two. &lt;br/&gt; To address this question, 160 mother-infant dyads will be randomly assigned to one of two stress conditions, maternal stress or non-stress. To begin, all dyads will first participate in typical face-to-face play to assess individuals' and dyads' baseline behavior and physiology. Next, depending upon condition, mothers will hear either infant distress cries (maternal stressor) or positive vocalizations. Then, infants will be stressed using a standard approach called the Face-to-Face Still-Face paradigm in which the adult remains still and non-reactive while facing the infant.  This project will assess whether the induced maternal stress predicts maternal, infant, and dyadic stress reactions during and following the infant stressor.      &lt;br/&gt; Raising a child in today's fast-paced and often chaotic society can prove daunting for most mothers. This project will introduce a reliable, innovative approach to manipulating maternal stress in an effort to better understand differences in maternal stress regulation. Results from this project will better inform intervention strategies by helping to identify mothers who are more vulnerable to stress and who, as a result, engage in less healthy stress regulation interactions with their infants thereby compromising the infant's capacity for healthy emotion regulation and social development.</AbstractNarration>

Following the exposure to the experimental manipulations all dyads then participated in a second infant stressor using the Still-Face (SF).  The SF procedure consisted of three 2-minute face-to-face episodes: 1) the first play (Play1): an unstructured play interaction during which the mother is asked to play naturally with her infant, 2) the infant stressor, the Still-Face (SF): the mother is instructed to maintain a still, neutral face and to look at her infant but not smile, talk to, or touch her infant; and 3) the final play (Play2): interaction during which the mother is asked to resume a natural play interaction with her infant.  Results: Maternal Behavior and Cardiac: In both age groups, maternal behavior and cardiac measures did not show any significant differences between the experimental and control groups.              Maternal Self-Report of Stress: The mothers with infants of both ages experiencing the infant cries reported that the experience was significantly more stressful than the mothers experiencing the non-stressor positive infant vocalizations.  Drop-Out. To evaluate the effect of the stress paradigm on infant stress reactivity we first looked at infant drop-out rate during the paradigm. The paradigm was terminated if the infants showed significant distress (e.g. crying) for more than 30 consecutive seconds during any episode. All infants that made it at least 30 seconds into episode 3 were included into the study. There were no differences between groups for the 6-month-old infants. However, in the 4-month-olds, when comparing the experimental group with the control group we observed a significant higher drop-out rate for infants in the experimental group when compared to the control group indicating that the exposure to maternal stress may have lowered their own stress regulation.  Cortisol: Overall, neither maternal nor infant cortisol were related to infant drop-out episode. However, when looking at only the 4-month-old experimental group, infant post-stress cortisol levels showed a significant negative correlation with drop-out episode indicating that the earlier an infant in the experimental condition dropped-out during the paradigm, the higher was the post stress cortisol level.
