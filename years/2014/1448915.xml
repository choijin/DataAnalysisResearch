<AbstractNarration>This STTR Phase I project develops automated instruction for the music education market, replacing human labor with music analysis algorithms, and paper course materials with digital multimedia documents. Despite the positive effects of art education on achievement, many arts programs are being cut or underfunded; as a result these students are at higher risk of poorer grades and not completing their college degrees. Learning music requires extensive practice and individualized guidance, as taught in private lessons for hundreds of years. The proposed solution brings a unique and innovative software system to the marketplace that will automate and reinforce substantial parts of music theory instruction. Early results indicate that this technology can improve learning thereby reducing the need for remediation at higher grade levels and helping maintain the benefits of arts education in US schools even in the face of budgetary pressures. Numerous studies have demonstrated that increased emphasis on education in the arts stimulates intellectual capacity and creates wider benefits such as facility in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and interpersonal skills. This is a market of millions of students with extensions into larger markets, such as amateur musicians throughout the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key innovation of the software lies in its proprietary music analysis algorithms that enable substantial amounts of music theory instruction to be automated, including close to real-time correction, feedback and grading of complex, secondary and post-secondary exercises in tonal music analysis and composition. By using the software in place of paper instruction materials, a music student can practice composition and analysis as much as needed to master topics, receiving instantaneous feedback and guidance from the digital teacher. For music instructors, the technology completely removes the need to grade papers, reducing what now takes them hours of human labor per week to seconds at the push of a button.  The software implements a multimedia document model that integrates all the common types of media used in music theory pedagogy: music notation (with or without automatic analysis), MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface), text editing, images, vector graphics, video and audio playback. Early results indicate that this technology improves learning, thereby reducing the need for remediation at higher grade levels and helping maintain the benefits of arts education in US schools even in the face of budgetary pressures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Illiac SoftwareÆs NSF STTR Phase I grant enabled the company to complete a prototype of its music theory instruction application Harmonia&reg;. The software was tested in a college level music theory course to determine if automating music theory instruction using IlliacÆs patented methodology is an improvement over current, paper-based instructional methods in terms of learning effectiveness and cost of delivering instruction.   In summary, the NSF STTR Phase I research essentially accomplished all objectives defined in the proposal and the technical and commercialization feasibility of Harmonia was successfully demonstrated.  Harmonia completely eliminated the need for human grading of studentsÆ music theory assigned homework and practice sessions by automating the process. Phase I experimental evidence indicates access to Harmonia improved student performance. Using Harmonia reduced the number of student errors by an average of 3.66 per assignment overall, resulting in a final class grade 2.78% higher than average. Excluding review topics and focusing only on assignments with newly introduced concepts, students received an average of 5.42 fewer errors per assignment, resulting in a 3.89% grade increase over the control groupÆs grades for those assignments. Harmonia has been well-received as evidenced by results from student surveys. The impact is, in addition to completing set "homework" assignments, students can now "practice" for themselves, simply by logging into a network, and accessing Harmonia to obtain instantaneous feedback on their performance. The impact on learning is that Harmonia empowers students with a liberating, inspirational environment enabling them to self-direct their learning progress, at a pace matching their individual capabilities and desire. Rote learning in the traditional classroom environment will become more inspirational. The motivational factor will be great. Students may become addicted to this style of learning with a concomitant beneficial influence on music theory pedagogy.       Harmonia provides automatic, instantaneous performance feedback and grading of music part writing and music analysis problems, which - aside from study of music forms - constitutes the subject matter of music theory courses above the level of fundamentals. Harmonia delivers its instructional features using an attractive, easy-to-learn graphical interface that integrates music notation with automatic analysis, text, images, in-line multimedia (video/audio streaming, MIDI playback) and social connectivity. Prototype development occurred in parallel with the creation of cloud servers delivering instructional content and accepting completed work from students. When practice or homework is completed and automatically graded, Harmonia sends the data back to the cloud server, where its information is analyzed and added to the serverÆs course grade book. The teacher can monitor this in real-time to determine the success/failure of the class to understand and complete instructional content (Figure 1). The server also keeps a grade book enabling students to check their homework status and current course grade.   To test Harmonia a controlled experiment was conducted at the University of Illinois, School of Music using the required music theory course, Music 101) for all entering freshmen. Students had to complete twelve assignment groups over the semester, eleven of which involved in Harmonia. Each assignment group included a set of related exercises: half were practice assignments and the rest homework assignments. The assignment groups contained 122 exercises assessing student comprehension.   The experiment involved a total of 53 students: seventeen in a control group using conventional paper-based methods and thirty-six did all their work in Harmonia.  Figure 2 plots the average number of errors made by students in the Harmonia and control groups across the 11 homework assignments providing evidence that Harmonia reduc...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
