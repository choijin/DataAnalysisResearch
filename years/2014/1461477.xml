<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Michael Fayer of Stanford University to conduct experimental studies to examine the behavior of a number of molecules that show interesting and unusual liquid-phase behavior.  Among the liquids to be studied are liquid crystals (used in LCD devices), ionic liquids (salts that melt at low temperatures, which show promise as more benign solvents), supercooled liquids (systems that remain liquid below the normal freezing point), and aqueous surfactant systems (which mimic cell membranes).  The graduate students working on this project will receive state-of-the-art training in ultrafast laser science, while working on chemical problems with real-world impact.  For part of his educational activities, Prof. Fayer and his research students will be working with high school students through Stanford's Inspiring Future Scientists in Chemistry Program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Michael Fayer and his research group will use ultrafast spectroscopy to probe transient structures and dynamics in complex liquids.  The specific studies include: (1) a study of the dynamics of liquid crystals and supercooled liquids via optical heterodyne detected optical Kerr effect (OHD-OKE) and 2D-IR spectroscopy; (2) a study of the changes in dynamical properties of ionic liquids with small amounts of co-solvents by OHD-OKE, 2D-IR and time-reolved fluorescence spectroscopy; (3) measurement of the properties of surfactant layer and bilayer structures with OHD-OKE and 2D-IR spectroscopies.  Researchers working on this project will receive excellent technical training in laser science and cutting edge optical methods.  The inclusion of high school students in the research in the Fayer laboratory stands out as a relatively uncommon engagement with the broader community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have made substantial advances in examining new aspects of and explicating a set of interrelated problems on the relationships among dynamics, interactions, and structure in condensed matter systems involving complex liquids in a variety of systems with mesoscopic structures, non-bulk structures, and bulk systems with non-equilibrium structures. The properties of bulk liquids change dramatically when they are confined on very small (nanometer) length scales.  In addition, certain types of liquid inherently have non-uniform structures on nanometer length scales.  Confinement and inherently mesoscopically structured liquids have properties that are very different from simple bulk liquids.  The properties of such systems are important in naturally occurring materials and in technological applications.  We have studied the dynamics, intermolecular interactions, and structure of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) with optical heterodyne detected optical Kerr effect experiments and several other experimental methods.  RTILs are liquid salts are room temperature.  They have mesoscopic structure with ionic and organics regions.  We have examined a variety of these systems and how they are impacted by solutes, such as water. We have investigated the dynamics of liquid crystals in the isotropic phase as they approached the isotropic to nematic phase transition and developed a mode coupling theory of the 2D IR observables.  In particular, we have found a new divergent property as the phase transition is approach from high temperature.  The results indicate a divergence in density fluctuations. We studied the fast dynamics of supercooled liquids using 2D IR spectroscopy.  We have shown the supercooled liquids display properties, that is, fast dynamics that change dramatically with temperature far above the glass transition temperature.  Theoretical models have been developed to explain the results.  We also investigate fast dynamics inside of phospholipid vesicles as a function of cholesterol content using 2D IR.  Phospholipid vesicales are used as models of cell membranes.  We showed that there are dynamical phase transitions at certain cholesterol concentrations.  We also showed that the membrane dynamics depend on the size of the vesicles.       Last Modified: 08/01/2019       Submitted by: Michael D Fayer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
