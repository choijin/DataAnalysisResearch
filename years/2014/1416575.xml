<AbstractNarration>This interdisciplinary research project will examine how differences in parenting between higher- and lower-income households have changed over time and whether such changes account for the growing achievement gaps in children from different sets of households.  The investigators will bring together expertise in theory and methods from sociology, economics, developmental psychology, and public policy analysis to answer a set of scientifically important and policy relevant questions.  The project will yield new insights into the changing forms of parenting by assessing the degree to which changing gaps in children's skills are a function of differences in the way in which parents' conduct in the home environment affects the development of both cognitive and non-cognitive skills in children.  Understanding this phenomenon will help answer important questions about the origins of the growing gap in children's achievement and attainments as well as the association between economic inequality and children's opportunities.  Project findings therefore should help assess the value of a range of policy approaches, including the Earned Income Tax Credit that redistributes income and relies on parents to use the added income to promote their children's development; the Nurse Family Partnership that teaches high-risk parents about positive parenting practices and the nature of early childhood development; instruments like Pell Grants that encourage would-be parents to acquire post-secondary schooling; and pre-kindergarten programs that provide educational services directly to young children.  By identifying the comparative roles of family income, parent education, and home environments in promoting child well-being, the project will help to point to the most effective potential approaches for addressing the increasing school readiness gaps between lower- and higher-income children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will employ descriptive and econometric methods using data from three large-scale nationally representative studies covering the period from 1986 to 2012.  The investigators will document trends in the gaps in children's cognitive and non-cognitive skills using three national data sets that collectively span 20 years.  They will document socioeconomic-based gaps in children's home environments over time, assessing a range of variables, including measures of parents' time inputs, emotional support, and provision of a physical environment conducive to children's learning and emotional well-being.  The investigators will test whether the importance of the home environment for children's cognitive and non-cognitive skills has increased over time, and they will employ a decomposition analysis to assess how much of the growing skills gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged children can be explained by growing gaps in their home environments or by a changing relationship between the home environment and these child development outcomes.  This project is supported through the NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (IBSS) competition.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Parents of all income and education levels are spending more time promoting their kids&rsquo; development&mdash;yet socioeconomic gaps in childrearing behavior are growing. This pattern emerges because low-income parents still spend far less time than their middle-class counterparts participating in developmentally stimulating activities with their children. One goal of our research was to understand how these income-based differences in parenting behaviors have evolved over time, drawing data from four nationally representative, longitudinal surveys conducted between 1988 and 2012. The research findings are promising in that they show lower-income parents are engaging in activities like reading and educational excursions more than ever before. But they also show that, for six of the eight behaviors studied, the disparities only grew. Thus, in one sense disadvantaged parents have caught up substantially; in another sense, they are two decades behind. One could view these results in a positive light, but on the other hand there are still these gaping inequalities in what educational experiences children are getting across different kinds of families. The reason the gaps grew is simply because affluent, college-educated parents engaged in those behaviors at a much higher level of intensity. In other words, after potentially gaining access to new brain science and discovering that things like trips to the museum and storytelling before bedtime are vital to helping a young child&rsquo;s brain develop and get ready for school, parents with higher levels of income and education started doing them at increasingly intensive levels. Poorer, less-educated parents likely also made these insights and also increased the degree to which they fostered their children&rsquo;s development. But they have not yet been able to catch up. As such, high-income children may continue to pull ahead of their lower-income peers on specific school readiness activities and on broader aspects of cultural learning. These patterns may be due in part to the changing demography of family life. As high-income children are increasingly more likely than their lower-income counterparts to grow up in a married parent family with mothers who were older at the time of the children&rsquo;s birth they may be increasingly enjoying home environments that provide positive support for learning and cognitive development. The fact that income-based gaps in book ownership and library attendance have narrowed while the gap in daily book reading has grown suggests low-income parents should be supported not only to offer children literacy materials, but also engage children with them on a daily basis.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to focusing on educational stimulation in the home environment, our work also documented SES-based differences in changes in parents&rsquo; use of physical discipline over time. These analyses show a decrease in the use of physical discipline and an increase in enthusiasm for timeouts among mothers of all socioeconomic backgrounds, from 1988 to 2011. We relied on data from the same four national studies conducted during this time period, each of which asked mothers how often they had spanked their kindergarten-aged child in the past week and what, hypothetically, they would be most likely to do if their children were to misbehave. Choices included physical discipline, timeout, and talking to the child. We found that during this period the percentage of median-income mothers who endorsed physical punishment decreased from 46 percent in 1988 to 21 percent in 2011. But the declines were uniform across all income-levels, and thus the poorest mothers continue to be more likely to spank their children than their wealthier counterparts. In 1988, around 50 percent of the poorest mothers endorsed physical punishment, compared to 30 percent in 2011. Over the same time period, the percentage of the wealthiest mothers who endorsed physical punishment decreased from 40 percent to 12 percent. There was more convergence in regard to timeouts. The percentage of the poorest mothers who say they would use timeouts went from 45 percent in 1988 to 71 percent in 2011. The percentage of wealthy mothers who feel the same went from around 50 percent in 1988 to to 85 percent in 2011. The income-based gap in using talking to children as a response to misbehavior disappeared entirely during this period. Despite these positive trends, it is important to note that nearly one-third of mothers at the bottom of the income distribution still endorse physically disciplining kindergarten-age children and nearly one-quarter report doing so in the past week. These rates are notable when considering the potential for corporal punishment to escalate into abuse and links &ndash; albeit correlational ones &ndash; between corporal punishment and negative child socioemotional outcomes. Strategies to further reduce reliance on corporal punishment in lower SES families could include encouraging the use of nonphysical approaches such as time out, positive reinforcement, and selective inattention in outreach and intervention efforts as well as raising public awareness about the negative effects, and relative ineffectiveness, of physical discipline.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/01/2017<br>      Modified by: Ariel&nbsp;Kalil</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
