<AbstractNarration>This project will create a network of people and programs that are creating course-based undergraduate research experiences (CURE) in biology as a means of helping students understand core concepts in biology, develop core scientific competencies, and become active, contributing members of the scientific community. The network will create a catalogue of CURE projects and resources. The network will also provide opportunities for participants to discuss issues such as how to document student outcomes such as learning, changes in attitudes toward and interest in science, and changes in engagement in the scientific community, as well as mechanisms for broadening participation in course-based research activities and ethical issues such as who has access to and ownership of CURE-generated data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project will assemble individuals with diverse expertise (instructors, researchers, information technology specialists, faculty development / curriculum specialists, education researchers) who represent diverse institutions and varied CURE projects in terms of data type (genomic, phenotypic, ecological). These individuals will address the questions noted above through meetings of the entire group and subnetwork teams as well as through the use of social networking tools. Mechanisms will be built into the network activities to seek input from undergraduates and scientific societies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project will produce a clearinghouse website, which will be a single "go-to" location for finding and publicizing CURE information.  It will also spawn new collaborations aimed at improving CUREs and expanding their implementation, and will help publicize existing CURE resources so that other faculty across the country can understand the potential of designing such approaches in their own laboratory courses but can avoid some of the pitfalls in doing so.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Research experiences are thought to be pivotal in the education and professional development of undergraduate science majors. Yet, there are many more undergraduates in the life sciences than can be accommodated through traditional research internships, which involve one-on-one mentoring by faculty members. In order to meet the increasing demand for undergraduate research experiences, faculty are designing courses in which research experiences are embedded in the actual course. These courses have been dubbed &ldquo;Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences&rdquo; or CUREs. Advocates of CUREs argue that they offer myriad advantages for students. CUREs can enroll many more students than a research internship. Plus, all students who enroll in a class get access &ndash; not just the few who stand out in class, who are confident enough to approach faculty directly, or who have personal connections that help them get access to research internships.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The appeal of CUREs has led to widespread calls that they replace traditional laboratory courses. Yet, most faculty have never experienced a CURE themselves and don&rsquo;t know how best to design or teach them. This project was designed to address this gap by establishing CUREnet, a network of people and programs creating CUREs in biology as a means of helping students understand core concepts in biology, develop core scientific competencies, and become active, contributing members of the scientific community and scientifically literate citizens. CUREnet is now almost 300-members strong. Through a series of in-person meetings and other activities, CUREnet members have:</p> <p>- Proposed a working definition of a CURE. This is critical for understanding what is happening during CUREs that makes them different from research internships and traditional lab courses. See Auchincloss et al., 2014 (<a href="http://www.lifescied.org/content/13/1/29.full">http://www.lifescied.org/content/13/1/29.full</a>).</p> <p>- Developed and hosted the CUREnet website as a one-stop-shop for CURE resources (<a href="http://curenet.cns.utexas.edu/)">http://curenet.cns.utexas.edu/)</a>. At this site, instructors can find example CURE projects, tools for assessments, guidelines on how to include student authors on scientific work, and other information related to CURE instruction. This site is accessed by users from a wide range of institution types.</p> <p>- Produced new, freely available resources for CURE assessment, including new assessment instruments and a framework for designing research and evaluation of CUREs. These are critical for examining the extent to which different CUREs or CURE features are working in terms of student learning and development.

The working hypothesis of this group is that CUREs may be a &ldquo;gateway&rdquo; to learning to teach using active learning strategies that isn&rsquo;t at odds with a faculty member&rsquo;s research identity (see Brownell and Tanner, 2012, <a href="http://www.lifescied.org/content/11/4/339.full)">http://www.lifescied.org/content/11/4/339.full)</a>.</p> <p>- Supported a working group on CURE instruction at Historically-Black Colleges &amp; Universities (HBCUs). This resulted in the establishment of a network of faculty interested in CURE instruction at HBCUs, professional development on CURE instruction for this group, and plans for a new phase of development of CUREnet that involves strategically expanding the HBCU CURE network.</p> <p>- Supported a working group on CUREs for non-science majors, which is synthesizing information on models, strategies, and resources for non-major CUREs and identifying gaps in knowledge and resources. This is important for reaching students who are not interested in becoming scientists, but are interested in science and want to be ready to make scientifically informed decisions. &nbsp;</p> <p>- Broadened access to undergraduate research experiences by building theories about the role of CUREs in inclusive instruction and offering professional development for faculty from institutions that serve students who are underrepresented in the sciences (e.g., ethnic/racial minorities, first generation college students).
