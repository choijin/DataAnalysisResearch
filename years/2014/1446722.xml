<AbstractNarration>The U.S. National Committee for Theoretical and Applied Mechanics acts as a focal point for research in the broad field of mechanics, both domestically and internationally. The Committee involves fifteen different technical societies in engineering and applied science, and provides a forum where their representatives can discuss their respective goals and priorities in the field of mechanics, as well as plan together reports and events that will further research in those areas. Specifically, the Committee sponsors the National Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, and organizes the AmeriMech Symposia, summer schools, and the reports on Recent Trends in Mechanics. All of these focus on the latest trends, directions, and accomplishments in mechanics in the United States, and help inform both researchers and policymakers. The Committee also acts as a bridge with the international mechanics community through its membership in international scientific union.  At the international level, the Committee provides leadership and assists in the organization of the specialized symposia on subjects in which mechanics plays a pivotal role.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objectives of the Committee are to represent the United States in the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, and to promote and advance all aspects of mechanics in the United States.  Operating under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences, the national member of the international union, the Committee plays an active and visible role both in the leadership of the union and in the development and organization of the union's scientific programs. The roles of the Committee and its representatives in the international union include participation in discussions of the strategic plan; statute changes; activities of committees, commissions, and task groups; union initiatives and co-operative activities; program priorities and tentative budget allocations; election of officers; and selection of the union Symposia slate; as well as in discussions regarding union involvement in interdisciplinary programs organized by the International Council for Science (ICSU).   The Committee meets annually to discuss national and international priorities and plan appropriate action, and sends a delegation to the union's General Assembly every two years. The main intellectual merits of the project lie in the activities organized and supported by the Committee and the union.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary  The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) obtained a three-year grant for Representing the U.S. at the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) while Advancing the Field in our Nation: The Unique Role of the USNC for IUTAM, grant number CMMI 1246585.  The committee has revised and expanded its mission statement in the last three years:  The U.S. National Committee on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (USNC/TAM) represents the United States in national and international activities related to the broad science of mechanics, including related sciences, engineering and mathematics. It serves as a focal point for charting future priorities in mechanics related research, applications and education. It represents the United States in the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM).  Intellectual Merit  The two goals of this project were: 1) promote and advance all aspects of mechanics in the United States, and 2) represent the U.S. in the IUTAM and participate in its activities.   To promote mechanics research in a timely manner within the United States, in 2013 the USNC/TAM established the AmeriMech Symposia series.  The symposia are small, focused events on topical subjects in mechanics that encourage personal interactions.  A particular aim is to encourage participation of younger mechanicians.  In the last three years, the USNC/TAM has funded seven AmeriMech Symposia.   The Recent Trends in Mechanics Report Series addresses contemporary subjects in mechanics.  Each reviews a particular subject of current interest and is led by a member of USNC/TAM.  Reports may take one of three formats: strictly web-based; brief electronic and hard copies; or longer reports.  Since 2013, six reports have been completed; all are available on the USNC/TAM website (http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/biso/IUTAM/index.htm).  The USNC/TAM sent the U.S. delegation to the International Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (ICTAM) in Montreal, August 21-26, 2016 to represent the interests of the U.S. scientific community and be part of IUTAM decision-making process.  Nadine Aubry, Dean of the College of Engineering at Northeastern University and a member of the USNC/TAM and the National Academy of Engineering, was elected President of IUTAM.  She is the first female president in IUTAM?s history.     ICTAM 2016 featured 1,100 oral presentations, 1,000 poster presentations, and 172 invited/keynote lectures.  In addition, the USNC/TAM held a Mentoring Breakfast for U.S. early career academics at ICTAM 2016.  Wendy Crone, member of USNC/TAM, facilitated the Mentoring Breakfast session that was attended by 57 early career professionals and 13 mentors.  The newly elected IUTAM President, Nadine Aubry, gave a short presentation on IUTAM and encouraged the attendees to get involved in global collaborations, international initiatives, and IUTAM operations and workshops.  The breakfast was open to all U.S. early career professional attending the ICTAM 2016.   Broader Impact  The broader impacts of the committee include its leadership in the international union and mechanics at large.  The USNC/TAM works to maintain a number of leadership positions in the IUTAM.  Members of the committee represent the U.S. mechanics community internationally in the Bureau, General Assembly, and various committees of the IUTAM.  USNC/TAM members are very active in IUTAM, thereby reflecting the international status of the committee and participating in defining, on the international scene, mechanics research and education directions, including capacity building. In addition, the committee?s support of younger mechanicians through its congress fellowship program provides interactions for the recipients with researchers from around the world, as a result of their attendance at the congress.   The USNC/TAM has revised the mission of the committee and has expanded it so it is not limited to traditional areas of theoretical and applied mechanics.  The USNC/TAM now represents the United States in national and international activities related to the broad science of mechanics, including related sciences, engineering and mathematics.  It serves as a focal point for charting future priorities in mechanics related research, applications and education besides representing the United States in IUTAM.  In addition, the activities of the committee impact the U.S. scientific community thereby having a broad impact. The representation of technical societies on the committee facilitates interaction and communication across disciplines that do not usually occur through conferences and other avenues. The liaison established between the committee and funding agencies and policymakers helps provide them with technical input on how the different branches of mechanics are evolving. Through its leadership role in the IUTAM, the committee influences global directions in mechanics research.       Last Modified: 11/27/2017       Submitted by: Ana M Ferreras]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
