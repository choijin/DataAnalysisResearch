<AbstractNarration>This project will provide new insights into the long-standing problem of understanding future tropical cyclone (TC) activity.  The results will provide valuable information for future planning of resource management in water sensitive regions of the African Sahel and infrastructure of coastal communities affected by Atlantic TCs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this project is to explore how the dynamics of African Easterly Waves (AEW) respond to a climate forcing of doubled atmospheric CO2 and determine the implications for future Atlantic TC activity. This will be achieved through a suite of simulations with a coupled and super-parameterized global climate model that uses embedded cloud resolving models to reproduce a realistic interaction between convection and large-scale processes. Additional sensitivity experiments will be conducted to isolate the slow and fast responses of the climate system, and examine how they affect AEWs. The analysis will also identify how future AEWs will affect Atlantic TC activity through consideration of the marsupial paradigm and remote influences on the Atlantic TC genesis potential.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The uncertainty of how tropical cyclone (TC) activity will respond to warming from elevated CO2 was a key motivation for this project, but instead of focusing on TC?s themselves I took a unique approach of focusing on the primary TC precursor disturbance in the Atlantic basin, known as "African easterly waves". These waves originate in the African monsoon, which is why my analysis centered around this region.     The advantage of this approach is that a global climate model (GCM) with grid spacing of ~100 km can resolve African easterly waves, whereas TCs require a grid spacing of ~25 km or less, which is much more expensive. The other novel aspect of this project was the use of super-parameterization (SP), which is a technique for replacing traditional GCM parameterizations for moist convection, radiation, microphysics, and turbulence, with a cloud resolving model (CRM) so these process can explicitly interact on the scale of individual clouds. SP models produce more realistic convective behavior compared to traditional climate models, and are thus well suited to study convectively coupled phenomena, such as easterly waves. Previous research has shown that SP models produce very robust African easterly wave activity, which makes SP model simulations an ideal tool for studying their response to warming from elevated CO2.    Two simulations were conducted with pre-industrial (1x) and quadrupled (4x) levels of CO2. The immediate result was a reduction in Easterly wave activity in the mid-troposphere (~600 hPa) over the African Sahel region (5&deg;:10&deg;N, -20&deg;:10&deg;E; see Fig. 1).
