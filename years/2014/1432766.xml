<AbstractNarration>The project will address a gap in theory and research on institutional change in higher education.  The proposed qualitative mixed methods research study will examine the role of professional societies in efforts to implement wide-scale use of evidenced-based teaching practices in undergraduate STEM education.  The research project proposes to move beyond a change model focused on individual and teams of faculty to a change model focused on institutional and systems processes and mechanisms.  The proposed study will examine the assumption that to broadly reshape STEM teaching, a reshaping of the norms of the most elite institutions must be undertaken in order to position these types of institutions as role models in efforts to scale-up evidence-based teaching practices in post-secondary education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field-based study will bring together a cultural and systems perspective on institutional change with an effort by the Association of American Universities (AAU) to test the relevance of three strategies that are identified in the literature as facilitating institutional change in higher education: creating discussions/deliberations; networks; and external support for reform.  The proposed study will use the AAU STEM Initiative as a real-time innovation to examine the role a national organization can play in achieving scale-up of evidence-based teaching practices among its members.  A qualitative mixed methods research design is aligned with a theoretical perspective that draws on social cognition and cultural and human development schools of thought that emphasize the importance of observations and interviews for understanding change processes.  The theoretical approach posits that the phenomena under study are manifestations of social change processes, which are best studied through the use of participant-observation and semi-structured interviews with the goal of developing an understanding of the roles these phenomena play in scaling change.  Considering that behaviors are driven by internal beliefs, perceptions and motives, interviews are important to uncover motivations for and perceptions of observed behaviors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Science Foundation (NSF) plays an important leadership role in the development and implementation of efforts to enhance and improve STEM education in the United States. Through the Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education?s Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) program, the NSF has made a substantial commitment to improve the quality and effectiveness of undergraduate STEM education for all students. During a February 2019 workshop, the Association of American Universities (AAU) convened experts involved in leading, researching, evaluating and funding efforts to transform undergraduate STEM teaching across all sectors of higher education. The workshop was designed to identify critical themes necessary to understand when examining the outcomes of a reform effort, and when examining the change process of a reform effort. In addition, the workshop created a forum to provide recommendations for the continued advancement of the NSF IUSE program.    A workshop report was created by summarizing key findings and recommendations emerging from small-group activities and whole-group discussions.  Additionally, the report contains four reflections on the key themes and recommendations written by workshop participants situated in different sectors of higher education, including a higher education research scholar, a faculty member at an R1 university, a faculty member at a liberal arts college, and a faculty member at a community college. The report is publicly available and may be downloaded at https://www.aau.edu/education-service/undergraduate-education/undergraduate-stem-education-initiative/resources/initiative-publications.   Key Findings: The following factors were considered critical for examining what were the outcomes of STEM education reform efforts and for examining how a STEM education reform effort was implemented at the institutional and multi-institutional levels: Conditions for sustained change; Student and alumni learning outcomes; Faculty approaches to teaching and teaching improvement; examining cross-institutional collaborations and peer networks;  Department commitment, alignment of evidence-based practices with rewards, hiring and training; and common data.  At the portfolio level, the top considerations when examining the outcomes of reform efforts and the change processes of efforts were the same. They involved commitment to building upon what is already known; to understanding the conditions necessary to effect change, including the real implications of various institutional contexts; and to striving toward equity and inclusivity. Looking at the national level, the top considerations when examining the change process of efforts were similar. They included understanding the conditions needed to sustain change, as well as the indicators of progress.
