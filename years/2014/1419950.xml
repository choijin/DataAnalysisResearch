<AbstractNarration>This award provides funds to the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) for a long-standing program of travel assistance to qualified and active oceanographic researchers from developing countries and nations with economies in transition. SCOR travel grants are awarded to enable such individuals to attend international meetings relevant to their scientific interests and to those of SCOR and the Division of Ocean Sciences of NSF. This ongoing project has become the cornerstone of SCOR's efforts to provide assistance to marine scientists in the third world and, more recently in Russia and Eastern Europe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impacts of this activity extend beyond the ocean sciences into other scientific topics by stimulating scientific progress in developing countries. In many cases, personal connections and collaborations that can result from contacts made through these travel grants can have long-lasting effects both in international activities as well as in the developing country?s science communities as the individuals involved rise through the ranks of science and science policy.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This grant was designed to build capacity for ocean sciences in developing countries and the former Soviet Union. The grant did this through three primary activities: (1) a program of travel grants for developing country scientists (primarily students and early-career scientists) to participate in international ocean science meetings to present their work and network with colleagues from other parts of the world; (2) support students from developing countries to participate in the POGO-SCOR Operational Oceanography Fellowship program; and (3) to send SCOR Visiting Scholars to teach and mentor in developing countries. This grant provided full or partial support for 165 students and early-career scientists from 35 different countries to participant in 45 different meetings and training programs. The POGO-SCOR Operational Oceanography Fellowships supports developing country students, technicians and other early-career scientists to learn methods of ocean observations (e.g., retrieval and analysis of satellite data, deployment of Argo floats and fixed moorings, etc.) to contribute to the Global Ocean Observing System. Eight SCOR Visiting Scholars were sent to 6 different countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Namibia, Peru. and South Africa. It is diftcult to evaluate the long-term impacts of these programs, but they are certainly helping many young scientists from developing countries to make their first contacts with scientists from developed countries such as the United States.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/10/2017<br>      Modified by: Edward&nbsp;R&nbsp;Urban</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1419950/1419950_10303258_1502398412679_LarsenCourseatNatMIRC--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1419950/1419950_10303258_1502398412679_LarsenCourseatNatMIRC--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Jakob Larsen's Course"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1419950/1419950_10303258_1502398412679_LarsenCourseatNatMIRC--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Jakob Larsen's Course"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students sample harmful algae in SCOR Visiting Scholar Jakob Larsen's course in Namibia</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jakob Larsen</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Edward&nbsp;R&nbsp;Urban</div> <div class="imageTitle">Jakob Larsen's Course</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1419950/1419950_10303258_1502398581907_SantosPhoto-ResearchGroup--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1419950/1419950_10303258_1502398581907_SantosPhoto-ResearchGroup--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Jorge Santos"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1419950/1419950_10303258_1502398581907_SantosPhoto-ResearchGroup--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Jorge Santos"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Group of scientists mentored by SCOR Visiting Scholar Jorge Santos in South Africa</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jorge Santos</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Edward&nbsp;R&nbsp;Urban</div> <div class="imageTitle">Jorge Santos</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
