<AbstractNarration>A cornerstone of the American Dream has been home ownership, and the capacity for ordinary Americans to achieve that dream has been seriously challenged in recent years, particularly following the housing crisis. Among the alternatives to permanent home purchases that Americans have opted to pursue is the manufactured (or mobile) home. These make up a significant proportion of the U.S. housing market and are the primary residence for at least 20 million Americans. Categorized somewhere between renters and homeowners, mobile home owners have been subject to intense legal, financial, and social marginalization for decades. In situating this research around mobile homes and their owners, this project ask what other factors, apart from financial precarity and/or the material degradation of particular structures, can explain the changing complexities of housing in the United States following the housing market collapse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Allison Formanack, under the supervision of Dr. Carla Jones of the University of Colorado at Boulder explores how residents of mobile home communities (MHCs) across the United States respond to "precarity", a state of uncertainty characterized by risk, vulnerability, and material and symbolic degradation. This project will use an array of ethnographic methodologies, including participant-observation, formal and informal interviews, archival research, and other methods photographic analysis across three key sites in Lincoln, Nebraska: 1) MHCs scheduled for redevelopment; 2) the management agencies operating these communities; and 3) the government offices handling redevelopment efforts. This multi-leveled approach will generate the quantitative and qualitative data necessary to understand how knowledge about MHCs is generated and circulated within the process of community closure and redevelopment. The project will contribute to anthropological, sociolegal, and social scientific debates about precarity, resilience, symbolic and material conceptions of home, and risk discourse and calculus.  In addition to training a graduate student, this research will contribute to public policy debates about affordable housing following economic crisis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Allison Formanack has completed research for her dissertation project, "Changing Attitudes toward Home Ownership, Risk, and Resilience Following the Housing Market Collapse," supported by the NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant. During the funding period, Formanack conducted ethnographic and archival research on the sociocultural, economic, and legal vulnerabilities residents of urban mobile home communities (MHCs) experience as a consequence of occupying ambiguous and stigmatized homes. Qualitative and demographic data were collected in three primary research sites in Lincoln, Nebraska: (1) five urban MHCs; (2) the offices of three management companies which own and operate these communities; (3) and MHC regulatory agencies including various municipal and state government offices.  The research design and methods of this project support the further development of home-based and applied anthropological study in the United States. As a third-generation Nebraskan and 5-year resident of Lincoln, Formanack both (1) incorporated her own familiarity of the area, including its social and governmental environment, into the project design while also (2) disseminating results within local networks of long-time collaborators in the form of public presentations and preliminary data sharing. The potential impact of this and similar research on the field of cultural anthropology will be to encourage young scholars to consider how they might devote their training and skills to addressing critical social problems in their hometowns, as well as those towns, cities, and states that remain underrepresented in the anthropological literature on the United States.  This project considers how a cultural artifact as infamous as the mobile home community, or "trailer park," is familiarized and how the circulation of various knowledges (or beliefs) about these places produces certain social, legal, and financial outcomes&mdash;mostly negative&mdash;for mobile-homeowners. Anthropologists have long been concerned with the material and symbolic dimensions of housing, and the intellectual contribution of this research pairs these interests with newer theories on precarity and materiality. Through in-depth, ethnographic research, Formanack witnessed how urban mobile-homeowners struggled to assert their status as homeowners despite occupying an ambiguous housing form excluded from the financing options and legal protections often afforded to conventional homeowners. The stigmatization of mobile housing, perhaps most recognizable through the popular epithet "trailer trash," further undermines mobile-homeownersÆ social status as they must either defend their choice to own and occupy homes deemed undesirable by a majority of Americans or concede to various unsavory stereotypes which tie homeownerÆs character, intelligence, and morality to their homes.  One resident, a retired man who has owned several homes in the same park for over 30 years, told Formanack that the devaluation he experienced as a mobile-homeowner made him feel "like a second-class citizen." As this research documents, the association of mobile homes and their resident-owners as "trailer trash" via the continued affirmation of their second-class position by non-residents including park management, financial institutions, elected officials, and policymakers&mdash;in addition to the general populace&mdash;sets the stage for broader impacts these communities may face. Despite overwhelming evidence collected during the funding period by Formanack that most mobile home residents living in the primary research sites consider their communities to be safe and preferable to other types of nearby housing options (such as apartments), common attitudes dismissing the usefulness of MHCs allow municipalities to justify their closure and redevelopment for "higher and better use" of the land. Lincoln officials anticipate closing each of its remaining 18 parks by 2040, displacing thousands and reducing the uns...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
