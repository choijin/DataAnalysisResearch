<AbstractNarration>This award supports ethnographic research in the Republic of Tyva (southern Siberia, Russian Federation). It examines the complex economic and social relationships that have evolved between indigenous hunters and herders and their working reindeer, dogs, and horses. The award will allow to study how centralized economic planning affected the relationships between Tozhu reindeer herders and hunters of Siberia and how, when these restrictions were removed, the Tozhu successfully re-adapted to their ancestral way of life. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher accurately argues that understanding these relationships are key to a wider understanding of indigenous economies' resilience to change and the long-term sustainability of indigenous livelihoods globally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tozhu traditionally relied on reindeer, dogs, and horses for food, transportation, and hunting. However, during the Soviet era large-scale reindeer herding was promoted by the government, which also instituted a policy of killing dogs, which ultimately caused the disappearance of indigenous breeds. In the post-Soviet system, dogs have once again become an integral part of hunting and herding among the Tozhu and this research aims to understand the complex role human-animal relationships play in the foundation of the Tozhu reindeer herding communities in the 21st century. Very little research has been done on this topic and none in this region of Siberia.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project studied modern reindeer herding and hunting among the Tozhu herder-hunters in the northeastern part of the Tyva Republic (Russian Federation). Today the basic subsistence of the Tozhu herder-hunters has shifted from reindeer herding to hunting as it was in the past, pre-Soviet era. With the prices of sable fur and musk deer glands rising in the global markets, hunting has increased for the last ten years; consequently the number of reindeer in a herd has been strategically reduced from 300-400 to 40-60 head. The general goal of the project was to explore how reindeer herding and hunting facilitate each other. To achieve this general goal, the project addressed two main sets of questions:</p> <p>First, what role do hunting dogs play in reindeer herding and hunting activities? How effective are hunting dogs in these roles? What role do reindeer play and what effects do they have?&nbsp; And in what ways do herder-hunters value and perceive their reindeer and hunting dogs?</p> <p>Second, what relationships do herder-hunters have with their domestic animals? What strategies do herder-hunters use to maximize reindeer herding and hunting success?</p> <p>To answer these research questions, Arakchaa spent five months in the Tyva Republic. She focused on Tozhu herder-hunters who were originally from the village of Adyr-Kezhik in the Tozhu district. First, she conducted her fieldwork living with one family during the fall hunting season in 2014. Her goal was to gain an in-depth understanding of the most important economic activity&mdash;the fall hunt&mdash;particularly in relation to migration routes, hunting grounds, reindeer herding and hunting techniques, the hunting behavior of dogs, and human-animal relationships. Arakchaa conducted her second fieldwork in the villages of Adyr-Kezhik and Toraa-Khem, as well as in the capital city, Kyzyl, during the summer of 2015.

Initial analyses of the data suggests that in socio-economic studies, dogs, as hunting partners, were under-appreciated in the overall picture of what was thought of as a Tozhu herding economy. Concrete findings include:</p> <p>1. In Tyva, dogs are essential for hunting sables and musk deer in the fall. Today, Tozhu herder-hunters rely mostly on a variety of Laika breeds. The primary benefit of Laika dogs to Tozhu herder-hunters is an increased encounter rate with sables and ungulates. The Laika is reliable for hunting a variety of species (small and big game animals). The well adapted <em>Kadarachy Yt</em> disappeared due to breeding with dogs brought by newcomers and dog-killing Soviet policies in the 1970s. As a consequence, predators (wolves, bears) from which hunter-herders must protect their livestock (reindeer, horses), increased.
