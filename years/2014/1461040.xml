<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program of the Chemistry Division, Professors Matt Shores and James Neilson of Colorado State University are leading a summer research program to engage undergraduate students in chemistry research applied to real world challenges, spanning problems concerning the environment to energy to medicine. Nine students each summer, for three summers, participate in a 10-week research program. Broader impacts are addressed by providing opportunities for scientific discovery to students who might not otherwise have that access. The fundamental research experiences are augmented with activities directed toward educational and professional development, including writing workshops, career panels, presentation opportunities, field trips to industrial sites, and scientific ethics modules. Graduate students and postdocs interacting closely with REU participants are trained in effective mentoring techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in this REU program perform research with one of 27 faculty mentors at CSU, some in collaborative and cross-disciplinary projects. Research thrusts include nanomaterials development for batteries, magnets and solar cells; (asymmetric) catalysis and organic and peptide syntheses for precise control of fine chemical molecular structures; and development of spectroscopy and spectrometry techniques for energy exploration and environmental sensing. Training on multiple techniques through CSU's Central Instrument Facility and presentations at interdisciplinary research meetings are key aspects of helping students translate basic research to addressing real world challenges. Research results are disseminated widely in student presentations and as manuscripts published in competitive chemistry journals. The REU program activities are integrated with several research collaborations and ongoing initiatives at CSU, greatly broadening the overall reach of their program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University hosted a National Science Foundation-sponsored REU program from 2016-2019, titled: REU Site: Chemistry Applied to Real World Problems &ndash; Chemical Sciences at CSU.  This award of $325,000 was budgeted to support 27 participants of undergraduate students recruited from across the nation to spend 10 weeks at Colorado State University.    This NSF REU program was bolstered through collaborations with other research experiences for external-to-CSU students, supported by the NSF-EPA C-CLEAR grant (PI, Shores, CHE-1339674) and through partnership with the CO-WY-Alliance for Minority Participation (HRD-1619673). In the end, a total of 61 undergraduates participated in REU-sponsored activities related to the 2014 grant, and this award supported 27 students.  The REU program at Colorado State University provided each student with an undergraduate research project, mentorship by faculty and a graduate student or postdoctoral scholar, and financial support to the student and project.  The research projects tended to focus on interdisciplinary problems with real-world impact.  Individualized research experiences matched to participants, based upon their interests. Applicants from primarily undergraduate institutions or non-R1 research schools were targeted for the program.  While the program focused on these individual research experiences, myriad professional development activities were provided to each cohort during weekly lunch activities, including an introduction to laboratory safety at Colorado State University, an orientation with the campus science librarian, a workshop on notebook/record keeping best practices, panels on r&eacute;sum&eacute; writing (including on digital social media platforms), presentation skills, and the graduate school application process, a chemical research career panel, and a tour to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.    As a result of this award, many scientific discoveries were made and communicated, and many students received training to place them on a nationally-competitive level for the next stages of their careers.  At the time of writing, 6 peer-reviewed publications were produced from this work in the topics of:  Synthesis of nanoparticles for earth-abundant solar cell. Identification of a dual-pulse technique for laser ignition of hydrocarbons. Determination of the practical stability of magic-number gold clusters. Identification of how to achieve rapid flow in multilayer paper-based microfluidic devices.  Hydrophobicity Enhances Membrane Affinity and Anti-Cancer Effects of Schiff Base Vanadium(V) Catecholate Complexes.  Photoinduced Organocatalyzed Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization Using Low ppm Catalyst Loading.   Additionally, 9 students have matriculated into top graduate programs in chemistry.  This program provided cutting-edge research experiences, career development skills, and an actional network in the chemical sciences.
