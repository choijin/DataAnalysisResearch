<AbstractNarration>As self-driving cars are introduced into road networks, the overall safety and efficiency of the resulting traffic system must be established and guaranteed.  Numerous critical software-related recalls of existing automotive systems indicate that current design practices are not yet up to this challenge. This project seeks to address this problem, by developing methods to analyze and coordinate networks of fully and partially self-driving vehicles that interact with conventional human-driven vehicles on roads. The outcomes of the research are expected to also contribute to the safety of other cyber-physical systems with scalable configurable hierarchical structures, by developing a mathematical framework and corresponding software tools that analyze the safety and reliability of a class of systems that combine physical, mechanical and biological components with purely computational ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project research spans four technical areas: autonomous and human-controlled collaborative driving; scheduling computations over heterogeneous distributed computing systems; security and trust in V2X (Vehicle-to-Vehicle and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) networks; and Verification &amp; Validation of V2X systems through semi-virtual environments and scenarios. The integrating aspect of this research is the development of a distributed system calculus for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) that enables modeling, simulation and analysis of collaborative vehicular systems. The development of a comprehensive framework to model, analyze and test reconfiguration, hierarchical control, security and trust differentiates this research from previous attempts to address the same problem.  Educational and outreach activities include integration of project research in undergraduate and graduate courses, and a summer camp at Ohio State University for high-school students through the Women in Engineering program.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This collaborative project between ASU and the OSU studied multiple aspects of collaborative Automated Driving Systems (ADS). ADS promise to improve transportation efficiency by eliminating human biases, e.g., the belief that a specific route is a faster when, due to traffic, it is actually not faster. ADS also promise to improve safety by orders of magnitude by eliminating driver errors, e.g., making a quick U-turn while not being aware of the whole traffic. Multiple technology and automotive companies have been working on different ADS products, which currently do not talk to each other, or even to the infrastructure, e.g., traffic lights. Communicating and collaborating ADS are expected to even further improve road safety and efficiency. However, the overall system complexity increases, because now, not only the individual vehicle performance must be reliable and robust, but also the interactions among ADS. Software errors in ADS have already proved to be catastrophic in real-life scenarios, and, hence, we need to develop science and engineering methods to guarantee correct and reliable operation at many levels.</p> <p>The project made two important contributions. First, it formalized the problem of automated test case generation for ADS. The most important challenges in testing ADS (collaborative or not) are formulating the goals of the adversaries in the test environment and the assumptions of correct operation for the ADS. That is, the testing problem for ADS is a game between the ADSs and some very powerful adversaries. The adversaries can choose the environmental conditions, e.g., lighting or road conditions, and they can explore pedestrian and vehicle behaviors, which can challenge the ADS. In such an open environment, the adversaries can easily produce test behaviors, which simply lead to uninteresting unsafe road behaviors and collisions. In the context of this project, we have defined new metrics for automated test generation for ADS. These new metrics focus the adversarial test generation on the boundary conditions between safe and unsafe behaviors since such boundary conditions identify scenarios, which could have been avoided with a better perception system or better control architecture. In addition, we established the necessity of ADS testing under assume-guarantee requirements. Assume-guarantee requirements can later assist in certification since they formalize what should be the expected system behavior under certain conditions, which is a more manageable problem than the open world ADS verification problem. The outcomes of this research thread have become available in our publicly available research software S-TaLiRo.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The second contribution is in the problem of modeling, planning and coordination or multiple ADS, which are not necessarily collaborating, but they are also not adversarial. One theoretical framework developed allows for vehicle coordination under partial and conflicting information as well as under different security clearance levels for the vehicles. These scenarios occur when heterogeneous groups of ADS encounter each other in emergency scenarios where road accessibility and centralized communication is limited. In such cases, each vehicle has different access rights or security clearances as well as different priority levels. For example, it should be feasible for an autonomous ambulance or a firetruck to enter an opposite direction road or, even, a highway in the case traffic blocks the legal traffic flow. The work has great potential for future extensions towards a comprehensive framework for providing autonomous planning and coordination mechanisms for ADS in emergency scenarios where access to centralized planning authorities is nonexistent or extremely limited.</p> <p>To this date, the project partially supported 5 PhD students and 2 MS students. One student has joined Southern Illinois University as an Assistant Professor, two students have joined Amazon, while the rest continue their PhD education at ASU. Each year, the project also supported capstone teams by undergraduate students from computer science and engineering. During the last year of the project, the undergraduate students were mentored on a project regarding the development of vehicle simulators inside a gaming environment for studies in human-ADS interaction. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/09/2019<br>      Modified by: Georgios&nbsp;Fainekos</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1446730/1446730_10338558_1557380972663_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1446730/1446730_10338558_1557380972663_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Auto Generated Tests"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1446730/1446730_10338558_1557380972663_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Auto Generated Tests"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Automatically discovering safety critical driving scenarios for Automated Driving Systems.</div> <div class="imageCredit">C.
