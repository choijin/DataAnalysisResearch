<AbstractNarration>The study seeks to identify the mechanisms through novice teachers' social networks shape their mathematics instruction. The researchers will collect surveys, lesson plans, classroom observations, teacher tasks, and student work samples from 200 teachers across districts in three states with different contexts around standards and state assessments. Using social network analyses frameworks, the study will model the novice teachers' future teaching using ambitious mathematics instruction as measured by the Instructional Quality Assessment based on measures of these teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching, and use of ambitious mathematics instruction and characteristics of the novice teachers' social network, as well as their interactions. Qualitative analyses will be used to support the results from the models. This study is framed by an interdisciplinary approach that integrates a cognitive component (focused on teachers' knowledge) and a sociological component (focused on the social context of teachers) in order to understand novices' planning and enactment of ambitious math instruction. No large-scale studies have used such an approach to measure how these factors shape novices' math instruction. The work will contribute to understanding factors that influence beginning elementary teachers learning in the early stages of their careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will advance knowledge and understanding of STEM learning environments by examining how novice elementary teachers' math instruction is influenced by the knowledge sharing, behavior, and expectations of others. A key issue in the improvement of mathematics education is the support beginning elementary teachers of mathematics, particularly as the number of beginning teachers increases at all grade levels.  This project, funded in the Research on Education and Learning program, will study 200 novice elementary teachers and their support networks in schools in three Midwestern states, using innovative research methods in social networking to understand the relationships among teacher knowledge, teaching practice, and the influence of their peers and administrators on the novice teachers' future teaching practice. It is important for districts to organize human capital and professional development in ways that strongly support these novice elementary teachers in teaching mathematics for increased student achievement.  The results of the study will provide recommendations for when schools and districts should provide induction and professional development programs for novice teachers related to their mathematical knowledge for teaching and how they can help novices respond to possible conflicts among school-based norms, curricular standards, teacher evaluation instruments, and external professional development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In a main paper based on the data collected for this study, we drew on longitudinal data of instructional practices and social networks of 137 ECTs to examine how the institutional forces of the Common Core and student testing pressures affect ECTs? instructional practices.  We found that the network members of ECTs played a critical role. When network members perceived the Common Core and testing pressures to support their own practices, ECTs? levels of ambitious mathematics instruction were more likely to increase. In contrast, when network members perceived the Common Core and testing pressures to be inhibiting, or when ECTs named no close colleagues or formally assigned mentors, ECTs? levels of ambitious mathematics instruction were more likely to decline. These effects were net of ECTs? engagement in professional development, MKT, and levels of ambitious mathematics instruction at the beginning of the academic year.   In terms of intellectual merit, these results advance knowledge and understanding by explicating how novice elementary teachers? mathematics instruction is influenced by the knowledge sharing, behavior, and expectations of others. In particular, we have started to identify the mechanisms through which the social networks in which novices are embedded shape their math instructional practices.  With regard to broader impacts, we are using these findings to recommend ways that districts can organize PD for mentors, mathematics coaches, and others who work with novice teachers so that they are able to share resources with them, help novices make sense of and respond to school-based norms, and help them plan and enact math instruction. We are also drawing on our findings to provide recommendations for when schools and districts should provide induction and PD programs for novice teachers related to math instruction and how they can help novices respond to possible conflicts among school-based norms, curricular standards, teacher evaluation instruments, and external PD.

One of the contributions of this work is to show how the nature of ECTs? collaborative interactions when planning does not appear to be tied to the nature of the designated curriculum in their district.  In a third article, we conducted in-depth interviews with 18 ECTs in our study.
