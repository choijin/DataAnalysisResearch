<AbstractNarration>This research will examine the diversity and ecological complexity of plants and associated insects in forests across a variable landscape in Brazil. Plants, insects, and their predators make up over half of all known organisms, and their interactions are essential to ecosystem health. This is especially true for tropical forests, where ecologists are only beginning to understand the nature and complexity of these interactions. In particular, little is known about: 1) the diversity of plant chemicals that deter insect herbivory and affect other plants and animals, 2) how diversity of these plant chemicals varies within and between plant species, and 3) how plant chemistry can affect the diversity and productivity of entire forests. Recent advances in chemistry and molecular biology provide the opportunity to understand the diversity of plant-insect interactions at three different levels (chemical, genetic, and taxonomic) with unprecedented scope and depth. These new methods will be integrated and enhanced by a unique team of U.S. and Brazilian scientists to investigate the diversity of insect-plant food webs, how they are shaped by plant chemical defenses and environmental gradients, and how this diversity affects forest stability and productivity. The research will contribute to understanding how large global changes in biodiversity and climate will affect plant-insect-predator interactions, how plant genetic and chemical diversity influences plant-feeding, and how taxonomic and genetic diversity of insect predators can affect control of harmful insects. The comprehensive sampling and methods used in this project will result in the discovery of new species of plants and insects, new biologically active molecules, and are likely to deliver new tools and approaches that have powerful applications in agriculture and medicine. This international and multi-disciplinary research project will have broad impacts by involving K-12 students, science teachers, and citizen scientists. Discoveries will be widely communicated to the public via websites, and scientific and popular publications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is focused on a highly diverse system involving plants in the genus Piper (Piperaceae), associated herbivores, and parasitic wasps and flies. The research will utilize cutting edge approaches to studying biodiversity that link measures of interaction diversity to genetic diversity, population genetic structure, and plant chemical diversity involving the following components: 1) Large scale sampling of herbivores and their parasitoids on diverse Piper species across an array of sites to assess effects of abiotic gradients on community structure and ecosystem processes, and to acquire specimens for taxonomic, genomic, and phytochemical analysis. 2) Field experiments where taxonomic, genetic, and functional diversity will be manipulated along with abiotic factors to strengthen inferences from statistical analysis of field surveys, community genetics, and measures of metabolite diversity. 3) Taxonomic and systematic analysis of plants, herbivores, and parasitoids using traditional and novel methods (genomics) to document and describe new taxa, understand their relationships, and reveal cryptic diversity. 4) Population genomic analyses of plants, herbivores, and parasitoids to understand how geography, plant phylogeny and chemistry influence population structure and genetic differentiation across trophic levels. 5) Characterization of metabolite diversity of Piper species; how metabolite diversity varies with phylogeny, ecology, and herbivore pressure; and the effect of phytochemical diversity on higher trophic levels. The combination of quantitative sampling along elevational gradients, newly developed metabolomics methods, population genomics, and a large scale experiment will make possible tests of emerging hypotheses about relationships between plant chemistry, and different dimensions of diversity, and will represent the first large scale, among-site plant-herbivore-parasitoid food-web comparison in the tropics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this entomological research was to document tropical insect biodiversity with publications describing new Neotropical wasp species, especially focussing on species of the beneficial parasitoid family Braconidae, to record their previously unknown biologies, and to engage a postdoctoral researcher, students, other researchers, teachers, and the public, in this research process.  This project utilized insect specimens sampled from studies in Neotropical forests to accomplish systematics laboratory studies at the University of Wyoming, with a primary goals being the education of a new generation of Hymenoptera systematists and researchers, as well as the discovery of new wasp species of the hyperdiverse family Braconidae.  Studies conducted in Brazil and other Neotropical countries focused on sampling caterpillars and rearing the associated parasitoid wasps.  My part of the collaboration involved the discovery of "hidden diversity," the description and naming of new species of parasitic wasps (Braconidae), and the mentoring of a Brazilian postdoctoral researcher (Eduardo Shimbori) who studied at my lab in Wyoming.  Dr. Eduardo M. Shimbori, an expert on the diversity of Neotropical Braconidae from Brazil, traveled to Wyoming where we collaborated on research for two years, and we have continued to work together on this research since he returned to Brazil.  During the course of this project, we collaborated to publish eight revisionary taxonomic papers together, resulting in the discovery, naming, and description of 81 new species of Neotropical Braconidae.  Additionally, I collaborated with different researchers on five other revisionary systematics papers that resulted in 76 other new Neotropical Braconidae species, making for a total of 157 new Braconidae species worked on during this project. Since these insects are parasitoid wasps that feed on plant-feeding insects, they are beneficial insects to forest health by providing natural control of potentially destructive species (such as leaf-feeding caterpillars).  Our most recently published paper, a monographic revision of the Aleiodes bakeri (Brues) species subgroup of the A. seriatus species group, was published in 2020 in the international journal ZooKeys with an identification key, descriptions, and illustrations of one previously named species and 18 new wasp species.  While studying at the University of Wyoming, Dr. Shimbori gained professional development and work experience with auto-montage photography, scanning electron microscopy, curation of insect research collections, and drafting of scientific manuscripts for revisionary systematics studies.  He has returned to Brazil and is currently applying these skills in his home country.  He is currently employed by the Departamento de Entomologia e Acarologia in Sao Paulo, Brazil.We are continuing to collaborate on new research projects inspired by this collaboration, and will continue to do so well into the future.  This study is resulted in the discovery, preservation, and preparation of insect specimens from Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador and elsewhere in the Neotropical Region.  These specimens served as the basis for this research, but they are also archived in various museum collections, and therefore are contributing to the development of the infrastructure of insect systematics research collections for Neotropical studes.   Our work on the discovery of new parasitoid wasps and their host caterpillars in the Neotropical Region is provides basic knowledge of the interactions of predatory wasps and plant-feeding insects, which in turn increases our understanding of how insects shape the distribution of tropical forest plants.  Knowledge from this project can be used by insect scientists, ecologists, students, taxonomists, biological control workers, and forest conservationists. The discovery of new insect species from Brazil and other parts of the Neotropical Region contributes to "informing regulatory policy" by providing new data on biological diversity in a tropical forest preserves.  This may allow, in the future, better management and conservation decisions relating tropical forest preserves in Brazil and other neotropical areas.  The education of young students about insects and plants through The Biodiversity Project seeks to broaden societies understanding and appreciation for tropical biological diversity.  This may have broader impacts on societal issues such as the Biodiversity (Extinction) Crisis, and Nature Deficit Disorder, by expanding people's appreciation of living things.
