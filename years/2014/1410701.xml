<AbstractNarration>This award will support the running of the 'Sixth IberoAmerican Congress' that will be held at the City University of New York Graduate Center from May 20-22, 2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference, which runs every three years, is dedicated to the topic of complex analysis broadly defined.  The conference seeks to bring into contact researchers in this important field from North, Central and South America, each region having its own strong complex analysis communities.  This year's thematic focus will be on the theory of Riemann surfaces and the inter-related areas of algebraic curves and moduli, complex dynamics, Kleinian groups, Teichm√ºller spaces, and hyperbolic geometry.  The invitation list of plenary speakers is distinguished and diverse.  Workshop sessions, to be held in parallel, will provide ample opportunities for young mathematicians to present their work and to engage other experts in informal mathematical discussion.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The underlying theme of the  Ibero American Congress on Geometry supported by this grant  was the theory of Riemann surfaces and the main focus was the presentation of important new results in the inter-related areas of algebraic curves and moduli, complex dynamics, Kleinian groups, hyperbolic geometry, Teichmu ?ller theory and group actions on Abelian varieties.      As the first Iberoamerican congress in the United States we took advantage of a tremendous opportunity to bring together US based mathematicians with their international counterparts. The Graduate Center of the City University of New York is a special facility with a large number of graduate students. Moreover, with the high concentration of mathematics graduate students and faculty in the New York metropolitan area, the Graduate Center is an ideal place for such a gathering. We intend used all of the funding for air travel, room, and board. As is consistent with NSF policy, this support was   used for graduate students, post-docs, women and members of other underrepresented groups, persons with disabilities, and mathematicians who do not have other Federal support.               The list of plenary speakers and workshop organizers  included a number of established experts in each of these fields as well as some who are at the beginning of their careers.   The organizers made a serious effort to attract women and minorities to the conference and were successful.  Three out of seven of the organizers were women and the half the plenary addresses  were given by women.       In addition to attracting women, the award  also resulted in heightened participation of otherwise under-represented groups at this conference. These funds  provided travel support for faculty from non-PhD granting institutions and other institutions that serve under-represented groups, and   resulted  in increased research and education collaborations with many of the experts in the field of complex dynamics.
