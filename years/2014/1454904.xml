<AbstractNarration>Almost all living organisms need to move for their survival, and that locomotion is often rhythmic and highly coordinated across an animal's legs, wings, fins, or other body parts.  How such coordination is orchestrated is not well understood, but the consequences of losing nerve cells that are vital for locomotion, for example, during a spinal cord injury, are strikingly clear.  This project examines how the nervous system can be retuned after a significant perturbation or injury to regain its former ability to generate rhythmic patterns of locomotion.  Such reorganization addresses an emerging and highly significant problem in the neurosciences -that of understanding the cellular mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity.  Essentially, this plasticity enables a system to go back to its set point or regain its original operational status after a perturbation.  Currently, very little is known about locomotor-related homeostatic mechanisms.  To understand such events, at the level of individual neurons, this project will use a combination of cellular, molecular and behavioral methods to study how a recovering nervous system achieves its transformation.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific team has chosen to study the medicinal leech as a model of locomotor control and homeostatic plasticity because of its experimental accessibility and well-studied locomotor circuits. Its central pattern generators (CPGs) for crawling behavior have been shown to be regulated by dopamine, a universal modulator of motor activity in most animals; each of these CPGs is located within each and every segmental ganglion comprising the nerve cord.  The compelling aspect of this project is discovering how the crawl CPGs become retuned or reconfigured so that all timing events are fully restored without the physical reconnection of cephalic inputs.  Three hypotheses will be tested: 1) proprioceptive inputs from the body wall substitute for brain-specific timing events; 2) the CPG in the ganglion immediately below the site of nerve cord injury takes the lead in initiating and directing the metachronal crawl waves in the caudal direction; 3) changes in gene expression patterns in the lead CPG provide for a lower crawl-activation threshold to DA and/or proprioceptive inputs.  Experimental methods will include electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry, confocal imaging, behavioral video-capture, computational neuroscience, and cutting-edge single-cell quantitative PCR. This project's outcomes have potential to impact disparate fields outside of the biological sciences, including physics, math, computer science and engineering.  The planned development of a leech transcriptome will also propel the medicinal leech model into the era of genomics. The project will support the training of female and minority participants, several leech-based laboratory teaching modules, and community outreach projects involving a leech Critter-Cam for middle school students.</AbstractNarration>
