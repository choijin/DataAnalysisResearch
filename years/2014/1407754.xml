<AbstractNarration>In this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter represents only a fraction of the total matter density in the Universe. The rest, whose effect we can see only gravitationally, is unknown in its nature and is termed Dark Matter. Particle physics models suggest that dark matter is composed of relic Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, left over from the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Experimental efforts to detect WIMPs are extremely challenging due to the predicted small interaction probabilities and the existence of backgrounds that mimic the expected signal. Fortunately, a number of unique dark matter signatures exist that can be used to discriminate against backgrounds and decisively identify WIMP interactions. The largest and most robust signature is the predicted dependence of the WIMP flux on the Sun-Earth velocity through the Galaxy, yielding a sidereal modulation of the nuclear recoil direction in the laboratory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT) dark matter experiment is a leader in the field of directional dark matter detection, with sensitivity to the powerful angular signature of nuclear recoils induced by WIMPs. The intellectual merit of this award resides in DRIFT's powerful capabilities being brought to bear on one of the most important questions in science today. The collaboration will be testing their next prototype detector, DRIFT-IIe, above ground at Occidental College. It features an inherently scalable design including a redesigned field cage, a texturized, thin-film cathode, a new, transparent wire readout which doubles the fiducial volume per readout, and a new every-wire data acquisition system which allows for lower noise and fiducialization in the detector plane. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential of DRIFT's capabilities have promising applications to Homeland Security and double-beta decay experiments. Broader impacts of this work also include the training of a diverse set of undergraduate and graduate students (including underrepresented minorities) in increasingly rare small-scale experiments, giving them exposure to a wide range of research experience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit In this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter (protons and neutrons) represents only a fraction of the total matter density in the Universe.  The rest, whose effect we can only see gravitationally, appears to be dark.  Particle physics models suggest that dark matter might be composed of relic weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) left over from the Big Bang.  Efforts to directly detect WIMPs are hampered by small interaction probabilities and large backgrounds that mimic expected dark matter signals.  Fortunately, a number of unique dark matter signatures exist that can be used to discriminate against backgrounds and decisively identify WIMP interactions. The largest and most robust of these signatures, based on the predicted behavior of the WIMP flux as the Sun-Earth system moves through the galaxy, is a day-night modulation of nuclear recoil directions in the lab frame.  Of current experimental searches for dark matter, the Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT) project has the longest running detectors underground and the best limits on dark matter interaction rates.  The intellectual merit of this proposal resides in DRIFTÆs unique and powerful capabilities being brought to bear on one of the most important questions in science today. The DRIFT experiment is a multi-institution US (CSU, Occidental and UNM), UK (Boulby, Edinburgh and Sheffield) collaboration with the experiment housed in the UK at a depth of about 1 km in the Boulby Mine.  During this grant period we made progress in a number of areas.   Dark matter experiments are plagued by backgrounds and DRIFT is no exception, until recently.  DRIFT was the first to identify radon progeny recoils (RPRs) from the central cathode as the primary background for directional detectors.  A discovery by the PI in 2013 showed a previously unknown way of distinguishing the recoils from the central cathode from dark matter recoils which occur in the bulk of the gas.  By adding a small amount of O2 to the gas mixture it was found that the position of the recoils could be measured to a few mm.  We immediately employed this technique on the DRIFT-IId detector in the Boulby mine.  What we discovered was all of the background events from RPRs clustered around the central cathode leaving nothing in the gas where we expect dark matter recoils.  DRIFT has been collecting background-free data for over a year now. Worried that maybe we threw the baby out with the bathwater we ran DRIFT-IId for several months without shielding and managed to detect recoils from neutrons coming from the walls of the cavern at a rate of an event every ~4 days in agreement with predictions.  We know of no other dark matter experiment with similar capabilities. Putting the shielding up and running for ~50 days of live time we detected no events and were able to set a limit 2-3 thousand times better than our directional competition.  This limit is now published.  For that run we ran with a high threshold for technical reasons.  That problem has now been solved and we have collected another ~50 days of low threshold data which has yielded a limit 2-3 times better than still and still without background.  DRIFT is funded to run for 3 more years. Finally an undergraduate at Oxy and the PI came up with a new way to calibrate the DRIFT detector at low energies using a several MeV proton beam and an old technique called Rutherford scattering.  A test run was done in the summer of 2014 and a real run was done last summer in 2015.  The undergraduate is working on the analysis as part of his honors thesis and we hope to publish the result. Broader impacts The primary impact of this research, outside of the research, is on undergraduates.  Occidental College is solely an undergraduate college; we do not have a graduate program.  Students interested in physics, though, have the opportunity to get involved in cutting-edge research at the forefront of ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
