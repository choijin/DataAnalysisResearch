<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "Subfactor Theory in Mathematics and Physics Conference 2014" that will be held July 14-18, 2014, on the Maui campus of the University of Hawaii.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary meeting focuses on the interactions between the theory of operator algebras and mathematical physics. Talks will be arranged under four main headings: subfactors, free probability, and random matrices; approximation properties for groups, von Neumann algebras, and subfactors; classification of subfactors; conformal and quantum field theory. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
