<AbstractNarration>The Acquainting Metro Atlanta Youth with STEM (AMAYS) program is designed to engage traditionally underserved middle-school students in performance-based relevant experiences that: (1) incorporate the STEM-related skills, knowledge and practices represented in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) workforce and (2) motivate and build participant interest in pursuing related ICT career trajectories.  In summer and afterschool AMAYS programs in five sites, participants will create ICT products as preparation for statewide ICT competitions. Students will collaborate with each other and with mentors from business and industry, who will be recruited through a partnership with the Technology Association of Georgia.  The project will be implemented through the After-School All Stars program in Atlanta, which operates in multiple sites in the Atlanta, Georgia in close collaboration with the public schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AMAYS is a design-based research project involving the creation, implementation and evaluation of a unique ICT-rich informal learning environment (ILE) that combines elements of culturally relevant pedagogy, informal STEM learning and the use of computer game design principles. The project will iteratively design program experiences and resources and investigate to what extent the project: (1) positively affects participant perceptions of and interest in STEM-ICT careers and (2) develops related disciplinary knowledge and skills.  Intended outcomes will be assessed through cognitive measures of participant ability to think scientifically and affective measures of participant affinity for the field/profession. Qualitative methods for data collection and analysis will also be used for formative evaluation of the project.  Research findings and resources (including curriculum and research/evaluation tools) will be broadly disseminated to educational researchers and practitioners.</AbstractNarration>

Activities were presented to participants in a flexible, modularized fashion, and based on gradual increases of difficulty. Participants could submit completed activities in exchange for new activities of their choice, and for digital badges called experience coins.

These activities were also meant to help motivate and build student interest in pursuing STEM/ICT career trajectories.  During the project life cycle, AMAYS was continually being revised and updated based on data-driven lessons from the field that occurred in 3 distinct cycles: 1) Front-end analysis, 2) pilot testing at one school site, and 3) rollout of the intervention at 9 school sites.  In order to assess the effectiveness of AMAYS, researchers used mixed methods for data collection and analysis based on the concept of design research (Barab &amp; Squire, 2004; Reeves, Herrington, &amp; Oliver, 2005). Data sources for AMAYS research and development efforts included a participant profile survey, two surveys measuring perceptions of STEM and STEM careers, A 21stcentury skills perceptions survey, an assessment activity based on Scratch Jr., a computational thinking quiz based on coding with App Inventor, evaluation of participant artifacts (apps), observations, interviews, and participant observer reflections. In addition, an external evaluation of the project was conductedby the Center for Program Evaluation and Development at Georgia College.   Selected outcomes of the AMAYS project included:   The AMAYS team designed, developed, and tested a curriculum for an urban, after-school program called After-School All-Stars Atlanta, who serve around 2600 students, and who will continue to have access to AMAYS activities, training materials, and the AMAYS Online website.  Over 350 students participated in AMAYS activities across 10 middle school sites.  As part of our research, the AMAYS team designed and developed two assessments of block-based programming skills and computational thinking. We also designed and developed an instrument for self-assessment of 21stcentury skills.  Our team produced multiple peer-reviewed publications and scholarly conference presentations, and our doctoral student assistants for AMAYS completed 4 dissertation proposals based on AMAYS data.  While more data analyses were conducted than are reported here, our research produced the following selected findings: a) Using a sample of study participants, it was found that those who created more mobile apps during AMAYS (i.e., &gt; 2) were more likely to outperform participants who created fewer apps on an assessment of computational thinking called the CT Quiz.
