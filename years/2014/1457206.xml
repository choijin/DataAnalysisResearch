<AbstractNarration>Learning by observation and through social interaction is common in humans and other animals. Yet, the neural circuits involved in this complex form of learning are still poorly understood.  The goal of this research is identify the brain circuits involved in learning from social experiences. This research is challenging because it requires methods for monitoring and manipulating neural circuit activity during social interactions, and ideally, during interactions that result in quantifiable changes in behavior. Songbirds and humans are among the very few animals that learn their vocalizations (song or speech) by imitating their parents or other social models. Juvenile songbirds memorize the song of an adult model through social experiences and use this memory to accurately imitate this song later in life. The PI is using optical methods for manipulating neural circuit activity in juvenile songbirds as they memorize the song of an adult model in order to identify the brain regions involved in this complex form of learning. Because the brain circuits involved in song and speech are analogous, this research can provide fundamental insights into the neural basis for complex human behavior, such as speech learning and social communication. Further, through designed outreach programs this research will help increase the quality of science education in the Dallas/Fort Worth region. The Principal Investigator and staff in his laboratory are working to train middle school and high school science teachers, and high school students through hands on systems neuroscience research. This training involves analytical, behavioral and biological methods as well as cutting edge behavioral and genetic methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Juvenile songbirds memorize the song of an adult model through social experiences and use this memory to accurately imitate this song later in life. The Principal Investigator has developed behavioral, and optogenetic methods for manipulating neural circuit activity in juvenile songbirds as they memorize the song of an adult model, thus providing the necessary methods to dissect the brain circuit involved in learning from social experience. This research will test if the memory of a vocal model is stored in motor circuits involved in producing the learned vocal behavior, as suggested by mirror neuron models of speech and language learning, or in auditory circuits, as suggested by auditory template models. Using optogenetic inhibition of neural activity in the juvenile brain, this research will test the necessity of individual cell types in the encoding of tutor song memory.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Mammals and birds, including humans, learn many of their complex and socially oriented behaviors by imitating more experienced individuals in their environment. For example, development of spoken language is rooted in a child's ability to imitate the speech patterns of their parent(s) and other adults. The ability to learn and use appropriate social/communicative behaviors is impaired in many disorders, yet our basic understanding of the brain circuits used for imitation is still rudimentary. Our research is aimed at identifying how the memory of a social model is formed in the brain, the connections involved, and how these memories relate to memories of our everyday lives and the memories used to perform learned actions. We have pursued these goals by studying the brain circuits for vocal imitation in songbirds. Juvenile songbirds form a lasting memory of an adult birds' song and use this memory to guide learning of their own song by early adulthood. Our research goals are addressed using a wide array of optical, genetic, and behavioral approaches that we have helped pioneer. Over the lifetime of this award, we have identified a node in the songbird brain connecting auditory and motor circuits that is critically involved in forming song memories that guide vocal imitation. We found that disrupting plasticity at this connection blocks young birds' ability to form an appropriate memory and that manipulation of activity at this node can alter memories that are used to guide vocal imitation. We have also identified a second node connecting motor circuits back to auditory regions. This connection is essential for subsequent imitation of the song. Lastly, we have provided the first comprehensive description of the cell types in this circuitry and used this analysis to better understand the evolution of brain pathways used in imitation and how bird brains compare to mammalian brains. In sum, this research has made substantial progress in identifying how and where in the brain memories used to guide imitation are formed and the evolution of these circuits.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/17/2021<br>      Modified by: Todd&nbsp;Roberts</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
