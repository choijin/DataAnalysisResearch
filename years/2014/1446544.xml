<AbstractNarration>Modern medical devices increasingly incorporate connectivity mechanisms that offer the potential&lt;br/&gt;to integrate devices via network/middleware technology into larger systems of cooperating&lt;br/&gt;devices. Initial integration efforts in the industry are focused on streaming device data&lt;br/&gt;into electronic health records and integrating information from multiple devices into single &lt;br/&gt;customizable displays.  This proposal provides a research foundation for engineering and verification&lt;br/&gt;of these safety critical systems through creating an open source Medical Device Coordination &lt;br/&gt;Framework (MDCF) which includes: 1)middleware for integrating medical devices and electronic health &lt;br/&gt;records, and 2) a model-based development environment that implements medical device coordination&lt;br/&gt;applications (apps for short), enabling a systems of systems paradigm for medical devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has substantial broader impact via tools and techniques for verifying the integration of &lt;br/&gt;medical systems that are compatible with the Integrated Clinical Environment standard.  In addition,&lt;br/&gt; the proposer includes extensive interaction with FDA specialists who are looking to transition these &lt;br/&gt;methods into their validation and verification processes for their regulatory mission.</AbstractNarration>

Initial integration efforts in industry are focusing on streaming device data into electronic health records and integrating information from multiple devices into single customizable displays. However, there are numerous clinical motivations for moving beyond this to consider frameworks that coordinate the actions of groups of cooperating devices to realize "closed loop" scenarios, automate clinical workflows by controlling networked devices as they perform cooperative tasks, and even automatically construct and execute patient treatments.   To provide a research foundation for investigating the engineering and verification of such systems, we have developed an open source Medical Device Coordination Framework (MDCF). The MDCF includes (a) middleware for integrating medical devices and EHRs and (b) a model-based development environment that could be used to quickly implement medical device coordination applications ("apps" for short), enabling a "systems of systems" paradigm for medical devices. The MDCF implementation aligns with the ASTM F2761-09 standard Integrated Clinical Environment (ICE), whose development was led by Dr. Julian Goldman from the Center for Integration of Medicine and Technology (CIMIT). Several companies are beginning to explore how their device integration solutions can support device coordination applications such as those envisioned in the ICE standard. Therefore, the community must begin to seriously consider the challenges of improving risk assessment and safety argument techniques necessary for supporting regulatory submissions for ICE medical apps and integrated devices.  In previous NSF FDA SIR work, we conducted an initial investigation of how the SAE standard Architecture and Analysis Design Language (AADL) might be applied to specify the architecture, interfaces, and high-level behavior of ICE apps and ICE devices. Recently, researchers at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) developed an Error Modeling framework (EMv2) for AADL that enables modeling of different types of faults, fault behavior of individual system components, modeling of fault propagation affecting related components, as well as specification of fault tolerance strategies expected in the system architectures.  In previous work with FDA engineers and clinicians, we also identified the Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) hazard analysis developed by Nancy Leveson as especially appropriate for interoperable medical systems.   EMv2 does not currently support STPA, nor does it provide integrated support for addressing the specifics of risk management in the medical domain.  In this NSF FDA Scholar-in-Residence project, a PhD student and a research associate from Kansas State University worked with FDA engineers to (a) develop a more detailed methodology for STPA to address interoperable systems, (b) develop tool support for this enhanced STPA approach within the OSATE open-source AADL environment, and (c) apply the methodology and tooling to example interoperable systems.Technical work on the project included (i) developing a extensive taxonomy of fault types and integrating those into the STPA methodology, (ii) developing formal modeling annotations in AADL to support STPA, and (iii) developing automated STPA reporting capabilities for generating reports that would support third-party safety reviews and regulatory submissions.  This project has had several important broader impacts. First, the illustrations of model-based risk management produced in this project are being evaluated to inform the risk management approach taken in the AAMI / UL 2800 standards for safety and security of interoperable medical systems (PI Hatcliff is a co-chair of the 2800 Architecture Work Group).
