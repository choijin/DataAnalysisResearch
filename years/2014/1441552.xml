<AbstractNarration>The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that support envisioning the future of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Development and Implementation (DIP) Projects build on proof-of-concept work that shows the possibilities of the proposed new type of learning technology, and PI teams build and refine a minimally-viable example of their proposed innovation that allows them to understand how such technology should be designed and used in the future and that allows them to answer questions about how people learn, how to foster or assess learning, and/or how to design for learning.  This project aims to tackle a difficult and important concept for learners at all levels: understanding complex systems. Complex systems are systems with many interacting parts and feedback loops and where the phenomena we experience emerge from the interactions between very large numbers of underlying usually tiny components. Our weather and climate systems, the flight patterns of birds, the circulatory systems in our bodies, and results of predator and prey interactions are all examples of complex systems. The NetLogo system is the premier system used in educational contexts to help learners engage with and understand complex systems; they can use NetLogo both to model such systems and to watch the way such systems behave in different conditions. But it is difficult to conceptualize complex systems so as to be able to model them, and causality and influences underlying "emergence" of the phenomena we can sense are particularly difficult to understand. This team is offering a new way to think about complex systems and software to help with understanding the idea of emergence. They will add multi-level modeling to NETLogo, and their research will focus on how understanding of complex systems develops when software tools that make emergence easier to understand are available and when learners are helped to think about complex systems as having multiple levels. Such understanding is important to understanding the natural phenomena around us as well as the workings of social systems, and in disciplines as diverse as biology and public policy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding complex systems is an imperative in our current society. Putting good social and other public policy into place requires such understanding, as does reasoning about climate and environment. As well, much of modern biology focuses on complex systems and their interactions. The Northwestern team has been a leader in designing software infrastructures for supporting such learning, using as their foundations literature on cocneptual change and learning about systems. In this project, they are extending the modeling approach called agent-based modeling so that it can support multi-level modeling of complex systems. The innovation is two-fold: the design of tools in support of multi-level agent-based modeling of complex systems and support for modeling complex social systems. The hypothesis is that such modeling tools will make it easier for both novice and expert modelers to model and come to understand both particular complex systems and the idea of complex systems. Research questions are grounded in that hypothesis, with the aim to investigate the development of understanding of complex systems when such tools are available and supported well in the surrounding socio-technical environment and the special affordances for fostering such understanding when learners are helped to conceptualize particular complex systems as multi-level (rather than 2-level) systems. The proposed project has the potential to both make the modeling of such systems more accessible and raise the ceiling on what can be modeled qualitatively.</AbstractNarration>

For this reason, our group has worked for decades on designing and building computer modeling tools that can be used by students in K-16 to explore a broad range of scientific topics, preparing them for future work and research in the sciences.

For example, instead of having separate computer models of cells and whole-organisms, multi-level modeling allows researchers to run whole-organism computer models that consist of thousands of simultaneously interacting cell-models at a lower level.  This project developed a multi-level computer modeling extension for the popular NetLogo modeling language (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/), the "LevelSpace extension". NetLogo is one of the most widely used modeling languages in scientific research, and the most widely used modeling language for K-16 education. Bringing multi-level modeling capabilities to  NetLogo means that an existing userbase of hundreds of thousands of researchers, educators and students now have the opportunity to explore multi-level systems, and the cutting-edge science of such systems.  Using the LevelSpace extension, this project explored both educational and research-related uses of multi-level agent-based modeling. On the research side, we developed models that shed new light on a variety of systems. We explored how the patterns of interaction within cities and towns affect the spread of global disease. We also developed new methods of modeling agent cognition  that allow agents to simulate the environment around them to guide their decision making.

Dissemination   We used LevelSpace to augment the NetLogo models library with  multi-level models that are now freely available with the NetLogo software. We have disseminated our work in computer modeling journals such as the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation, at scientific modeling conferences like the Winter Simulation Conference and The Conference on Artificial Life, complex systems conferences such as the International Conference on Complex Systems, and at education-related conferences like the Constructionism conference, the Interaction Design and Children conference, American Educational Research Association, International Conference on the Learning Sciences and Learn.Design.Compute.
