<AbstractNarration>This is funding to support a Doctoral Consortium (workshop) for approximately 15 graduate students, along with a panel of 4 distinguished research faculty mentors (but only those students enrolled in U.S. educational institutions, about 8, will be eligible for funding through this grant).  The event will take place in conjunction with (and on the first day of) the Eighth International Conference on the Theory and Application of Diagrams (DIAGRAMS 2014), to be held July 28-August 1, 2014, in Melbourne, Australia, and co-located with the IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing, as was the case in 2008.  Diagrams are wide-ranging and open-ended representations that include sketches, drawings, charts, pictures, 2D and 3D geometric models, and maps.  They are a vital tool in human communication in areas such as art and science, as well as commerce and industry.  A better understanding of how effective diagrams can be generated and used has the potential to produce transformative advances in these areas.  DIAGRAMS is the only conference series that provides a united forum for all aspects of research on the theory and application of diagrams.  It is a bi-annual, international and interdisciplinary event whose goals are to present and discuss (a) state-of-the-art research on computational, cognitive and socio-cultural theories, models and techniques of reasoning with diagrammatic representations, and (b) cutting-edge intelligent and interactive information technologies for using diagrammatic representations in supporting human reasoning.  Research topics include understanding diagrammatic reasoning in humans, understanding the use of diagrammatic representation for communication, developing techniques for automated diagrammatic reasoning, and designing tools for use of diagrammatic representations.  The conference series is overseen by the DIAGRAMS Steering Committee with a rotating membership; more information is available at the conference website http://www.diagrams-conference.org/2014.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the DIAGRAMS 2014 Doctoral Consortium is to increase the exposure and visibility of young graduate student researchers in these areas.  The workshop will be a research-focused day-long meeting that affords participants an opportunity to present their work and get feedback from established researchers in the field, who will be present to comment on the young researchers' presentations in an informal and constructive environment.  Each invited participant will be asked to give a short talk, which will be followed by discussion and critiquing.  For some students, this may be their first opportunity to give a research talk outside their home institutions, which will help prepare them for future scholarly discussions.  The Doctoral Consortium is open for attendance to all conference registrants, and summaries of the presentations will be available on the conference website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  DIAGRAMS 2014 will significantly increase our understanding of diagrammatic reasoning in humans and machines, and will add momentum to the development of new information technologies for the use of diagrammatic representations in support of human reasoning.  The conference will help develop human research capital by enabling interactions between senior and junior researchers and by catalyzing new collaborations. The Doctoral Consortium will increase the exposure and visibility of young graduate student researchers in these areas, and help train them by providing early input from senior researchers in the field in an interactive and constructive environment.   The social network among this next generation of researchers, and the relationships with senior researchers, created by the workshop will play a critical role in their enculturation into the profession.  Diversity of the selected students is a goal of the organizers, who will be proactive in an effort to ensure that both students and faculty are a diverse group across multiple dimensions including nationality, scientific discipline and gender.  To further assure diversity, only one student will be selected from each educational institution, with preference given to students from underrepresented populations.</AbstractNarration>
