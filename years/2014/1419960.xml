<AbstractNarration>Biologists have long been interested in understanding the mechanistic basis of adaptation. Epigenetic effects (e.g., methylation) can contribute to variation in the traits of organisms even in the complete absence of differences in DNA sequence information. Epigenetic changes in DNA can be induced by environmental stress and lead to a more rapid response to natural selection but there is little information on how epigenetic mechanisms function in natural populations. This project will develop a novel next generation sequencing technique allowing for the measurement of both genetic and epigenetic variation under different environmental conditions in non-model organisms with no reference genome. The technique will combine Genotyping-By-Sequencing and bisulfite sequencing to simultaneously measure DNA sequence and methylation polymorphisms at tens to hundreds of thousands of fragments across the genome. As a proof of principle, the technique will be developed in Fallopia japonica, a highly invasive polyploid plant with a large and complex genome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The techniques developed in this EAGER will be used in workshops with Hillsborough County Public School teachers and students to allow for effective outreach of the latest in innovative genomics approaches that will be applicable to a wide variety of biological research as well as understanding of social issues like personalized medicine, and genetically modified crops. At the University of South Florida the project will include summer research for undergraduates, and graduate student training.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual merit: </strong>We developed the reduced representation DNA sequencing epiGBS protocol with bisulphite treated DNA in collaboration with K.J.F. Verhoeven (Netherlands Institute of Ecology) and N.C.A.M. Wagemaker (Radboud University, The Netherlands) for Japanese knotweed (<em>Fallopia</em> spp.) and <em>Spartina alterniflora</em>. This protocol represents a significant improvement in power to detect genetic and epigenetic variation simultaneously in plants with no genomic resources. We also built a reference transcriptome for <em>Fallopia</em> spp. with PacBio full transcript sequencing to improve our ability to detect functional genes with the epiGBS fragments. Further, this work has been leveraged with a collaboration with researchers in Australia, Spain and Germany to apply the protocol to 11 additional species through an Australian Research Council funded project: Phenotypic plasticity and plant water use in a changing climate: a multi-species, multi-site investigation (DP120100945). Through an IREU supplement, we trained two U.S. and two Brazilian undergraduates while developing the protocol for red mangrove (<em>Rhizophora mangle</em>), and through an ROA supplement we investigated inheritance of induced epigenetic changes using the model plant <em>Arabidopsis thaliana.</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader impacts: </strong>We established international collaborations in the Netherlands (EAGER) and Brazil (IREU), as well as a US collaboration with a junior faculty at a primarily undergraduate institution (ROA), University of Texas at Tyler. Mentoring, training, and international networking included 1 female junior faculty (PI), 3 graduate students (1 minority, 2 female), and 2 female IREU students in three countries (France, the Netherlands and Brazil). We also organized and co-hosted an international symposium at the annual meeting of the Society for the Study of Evolution (SSE) with co-host ROA sponsored Josh Banta (UT-Tyler) in Brazil, highlighting work of 2 female scientists (one Brazilian researcher, one US PhD candidate). International presentations were given by 3 graduate students (including two oral presentations by a minority student, three presentations by female students- one a symposium presentation) and 2 female IREU sponsored students (poster presentations). In addition to USF students traveling abroad, the IREU also supported visits from two Brazilian undergraduates who are currently completing their visit at USF (Summer 2017). The work supported eleven presentations in international venues, four publications to date and a preprint published on bioRxiv. Two additional publications are in review, 4 in preparation, and data is still being collected for another two publications that were delayed by funding restrictions from Brazil for the IREU. Research products will be available on DRYAD upon submission for publication.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/04/2017<br>      Modified by: Christina&nbsp;Richards</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1419960/1419960_10294791_1493901064547_Screenshot2017-05-0414.21.27--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1419960/1419960_10294791_1493901064547_Screenshot2017-05-0414.21.27--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Epigenetic genotyping by sequencing (epiGBS; funded by NSF EAGER) identified candidate genes among 7,924 fragments in Fallopia."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1419960/1419960_10294791_1493901064547_Screenshot2017-05-0414.21.27--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Epigenetic genotyping by sequencing (epiGBS; funded by NSF EAGER) identified candidate genes among 7,924 fragments in Fallopia."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Gene ontology shows enrichment for several functional categories in the 2,522 functional hits among the 7,924 contiguous fragments identified using the epiGBS protocol (Richards et al. unpub).</div> <div class="imageCredit">CL Richards</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christina&nbsp;Richards</div> <div class="imageTitle">Epigenetic genotyping by sequencing (epiGBS; funded by NSF EAGER) identified candidate genes among 7,924 fragments in Fallopia.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1419960/1419960_10294791_1493901170850_Screenshot2017-05-0414.21.56--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1419960/1419960_10294791_1493901170850_Screenshot2017-05-0414.21.56--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Epigenetic genotyping-by-sequencing (epiGBS; funded by NSF EAGER) identified 2,473 candidate genes among 36,161 fragments in Spartina alterniflora."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1419960/1419960_10294791_1493901170850_Screenshot2017-05-0414.21.56--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Epigenetic genotyping-by-sequencing (epiGBS; funded by NSF EAGER) identified 2,473 candidate genes among 36,161 fragments in Spartina alterniflora."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Gene ontology analysis shows enrichment for several functional categories in the 2,473 functional genes found among the 36,161 contiguous fragments identified using the epiGBS protocol (Richards et al. unpub) developed in collaboration with Verhoeven and colleagues (van Gurp et al. 2016).</div> <div class="imageCredit">CL Richards</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christina&nbsp;Richards</div> <div class="imageTitle">Epigenetic genotyping-by-sequencing (epiGBS; funded by NSF EAGER) identified 2,473 candidate genes among 36,161 fragments in Spartina alterniflora.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1419960/1419960_10294791_1493901270786_Screenshot2017-05-0414.24.32--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1419960/1419960_10294791_1493901270786_Screenshot2017-05-0414.24.32--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Number of sequenced cytosines per sample from 8 individuals of Spartina alterniflora sampled across Spring and Autumn in 2012 and 2013 in Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge, FL, USA."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1419960/1419960_10294791_1493901270786_Screenshot2017-05-0414.24.32--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Number of sequenced cytosines per sample from 8 individuals of Spartina alterniflora sampled across Spring and Autumn in 2012 and 2013 in Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge, FL, USA."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The number of common loci for locus-by-locus analysis is indicated by the blue line.
