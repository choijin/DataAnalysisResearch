<AbstractNarration> Plants and animals are constantly in contact with microbes (microscopic organisms) that live on and inside them.  This research will be an important first step in determining how competition between viruses is altered by the presence of beneficial bacteria and whether infection by viruses can reduce benefits from beneficial bacteria to their host plant, the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). This work benefits the public both directly by providing data that is relevant to agricultural crop production and indirectly through scientific education and outreach.  Beans and other legumes are important, highly sustainable sources of dietary protein worldwide.  A better understanding of microbial interactions in common beans can be used to inform strategies that could alter disease prevalence and increase crop yields.  The pursuit of this knowledge will also provide a variety of hands-on research experiences for undergraduate students. Finally, the results of the research will be widely disseminated to the public through presentations to the community and the development of hands-on learning experiences and mini-courses for 6-12 grade students.&lt;br/&gt; The researchers will examine how the presence of additional mutualist microbial species in a host plant changes the outcome of virus competition and disease severity in coinfections and 2) whether infection by pathogens reduces the benefit that the host receives from mutualists. The ecological and evolutionary interactions between multiple pathogens which occupy the same host will be studied, using a system of viruses infecting the common bean. Mutualists have the potential to alter competitive outcomes between coinfecting pathogens by influencing host resources for growth and defense. At the same time, pathogens can induce a full immune response by the host that can be damaging to microbial mutualists. If pathogen infection reduces the benefit that the host receives from mutualists, this might destabilize the association. Common beans infected with pathogenic viruses and mutualistic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia) offer a highly tractable system for studying the interactions between coinfecting pathogens and mutualists. Two measures of pathogen competitive ability, within host concentration and transmission between hosts, will be compared in plants with and without rhizobia to evaluate whether the presence of a mutualist is differentially beneficial to one pathogen species. The impact of pathogen infection on the viability of the mutualism will be quantified by measuring plant immune response hormones as well as rhizobial root colonization and nitrogen fixation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Both animals and plant have mutually-beneficial relationships with microbes that greatly extend the functional capabilities of an organism beyond the genes encoded in its own genome. For plants, one of the best characterized examples of this type of relationship is the mutualism between legumes, such as beans, and rhizobia bacteria.  The bacteria convert nitrogen gas from the air into a form that can be used by plants in exchange for sugars that the plant makes during photosynthesis.     Plants are also beset by pathogenic microbes that cause disease.  While we commonly think of hosts as only harboring one type of pathogenic microbe at a time, in reality hosts are commonly infected by multiple pathogens at the same time.  These multiple infections can have devastating consequences for host health.  For example, a disease that is a major threat to food security in sub-Saharan Africa, maize lethal necrosis, is actually caused by coinfections of one host with two different viruses that cause mild effects on hosts in single infections but severe effects when combined.      In this project, we investigated the interactions between a legume, mutualistic rhizobia bacteria, and two species of coinfecting viruses.  Our major objectives were to 1) determine whether the presence of a microbial mutualist affects the relationship between the coinfecting viruses and 2) evaluate the effects of coinfection on the amount of nitrogen that plants receive from rhizobia.  In order to accomplish these goals, we infected bean hosts with Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), Clover yellow vein virus (ClYVV), both viruses, or neither virus while providing hosts with either no supplemental nitrogen fertilizer, inorganic nitrogen fertilizer, or nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria.      We found that rhizobia colonization influenced the within-host growth of viruses in coinfections.  ClYVV reached higher concentrations in coinfected hosts only when rhizobia were present. In turn, viral infection reduced the benefits that legume hosts received from rhizobia.  In fact, the negative effects of a viral coinfection were worse than simply adding up the losses of hosts infected with only BCMV or ClYVV.  This has several important implications:  1)      Some of the effects we attribute to pathogen virulence could be caused by impaired function of mutualistic microbes rather than direct impacts on the host.  This is analogous to a pathogen that would make people sick partially by reducing the vitamin K synthesized by gut bacteria.   2)      The mutualism between legumes and nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria impacts agricultural production.  Legumes like beans are not reliant on soil nitrogen because rhizobia provide them with an alternative nitrogen source.  In addition, when legume cover crops or crop residues decompose they enrich the soil.  Therefore, less inorganic nitrogen fertilizer must be added to a subsequent non-legume crop to achieve the same yield.  In conventional systems, this saves farmers money when they follow soybeans or alfalfa with corn, because they need to spend less money on inorganic nitrogen fertilizer.  On subsistence farms, inorganic nitrogen fertilizer is prohibitively expensive, so farmers rely on legume crop rotations to provide fertilization for subsequent non-legume crops.  We calculated how much money farmers would lose in terms of either increased inorganic fertilizer costs or yield losses in a subsequent crop after viral epidemics of differing severity that reduce legume nitrogen-fixation.  Our results indicate that even viral epidemics in cover crops that are intended to be plowed under can influence a farmer?s bottom line.  In addition, viral epidemics in legumes on subsistence farms could be used to predict yield reductions in cereal crops during the following season.   3)      Legumes are also ecologically important in building up soil after an extreme storm or other event that scours away or engulfs organic soil layers.  Viral epidemics in these legumes have the potential to slow down ecological succession, the process that allows an area to transition from bare rock to a forest over the course of generations.     More generally, these findings could have important implications for human health and individualized medicine.  Certain microbial components of the human microbiome could be risk factors for increased within-host pathogen growth in certain patients.  Moreover, infection with pathogenic microbes could reduce the benefits that humans may receive from helpful microbes.  Understanding the interactions among beneficial and detrimental microbes will aid in predicting host outcome.
