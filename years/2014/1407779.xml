<AbstractNarration>Mathematical programming is a powerful tool for attacking combinatorial problems.  One transforms a discrete task into a related continuous one by casting it as optimization over a convex body.  Linear and semi-definite programming (LP and SDP) form important special cases and are central tools in the theory and practice of combinatorial optimization. These approaches have achieved spectacular success in computing approximately optimal solutions for problems where finding exact solutions is computationally intractable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there are very strong bounds known on the efficacy of particular families of relaxations, it remains possible that adding a small number of variables or constraints could lead to drastically improved solutions.  We propose the development of a theory to unconditionally capture the power of LPs and SDPs without any complexity-theoretic assumptions.  Our approach has the potential to show something remarkable:  For many well-known problems, the basic LP or SDP is optimal among a very large class of algorithms.  More concretely, we suggest a method that could rigorously characterize the power of polynomial-size LPs and SDPs for a variety of combinatorial optimization tasks.   This involves deep issues at the intersection of many areas of mathematics and computer science, with the ultimate goal of significantly extending our understanding of efficient computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical programming is of major importance to many fields---this is especially true for computer science and operations research.  These methods have also seen dramatically increasing use in the analysis of "big data" from across the scientific spectrum.  From a different perspective, LPs and SDPs can be thought of as rich proof systems, and characterizing their power is a basic problem in the theory of proof complexity. Thus the outcomes of the proposed research are of interest to a broad community of scientists, mathematicians, and practitioners.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to understand the power and limitations of convex programming relaxations in combinatorial optimization.  One major aim was to move beyond specific hierarchies of programs and characterize the power of general models of linear and semi-definite programs.  These general models are closely connected to deep problems in algorithms and complexity theory, and they consistute some of the most powerful computational tools available to algorithm designers.  A secondary objective was to use such relaxations as a tool in new settings; for instance, in the study of discrete models arising in 2D quantum gravity.   Our progress on these fronts has been very compelling, leading to the resolution of some long-standing open problems, and creating new connections between semidefinite programs (SDPs), quantum information theory, and the role of symmetry in communication complexity.  In particular, the PIs demonstrated that there are no small SDPs for certain classical NP-complete optimization problems (like the famous traveling salesman problem). This marks one of the few times that it has been possible to rigorously demonstrate that a powerful computational model cannot prove that P=NP.    On the algorithmic side, we demonstrated the power and generality of such programs  by using them as a mathematical tool in the areas of discrete isoperimetry and spectral graph theory.  Perhaps the most intersecting discovery here is that certain convex relaxations can be used to deform the geometry of random networks arising in the study of 2D quantum gravity.  These deformations lead to the verification of some 25-year-old conjectures of statistical physicists on the structure of such networks.  For instance, while their volume growth is quartic ("four-dimensional"), one can establish that their "spectral dimension" is always 2.
