<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report Davidson   The primary aims of this applied mathematics project were to use geometry and statistics to improve understanding of the behavior of phylogenetic algorithms for researchers working in mathematics, statistics, biology, and computer science.   Intellectual Merit:  This project gave a statistical organization of patterns in molecular data when embedded as distances in a Euclidean space. The contribution to the theory of geometric data analysis was the understanding of the organization of the second&shy;tier behavior of the data. This development should lead to a better understanding of trends in phylogenetic distance data and give insight into other possibilities for methods of geometric data analysis.  By finding a shelling order and identifying and counting the homology facets of a nonpure, disconnected simplicial complex, the PI and co&shy;authors re&shy;proved a well&shy;-known identity of Dixon by showing that it encoded the reduced Euler characteristic of the simplicial complex in question. There are a very limited number of nonpure and/or disconnected shellable simplicial complexes in the literature. This novel shelling technique could be employed in the study of other simplicial complexes.  The Billera-&shy;Holmes-&shy;Vogtmann (BHV) space of phylogenetic trees is an interesting mathematical object: it is a CAT(0) cubical complex with an intrinsic geodesic distance measure. There is a different copy of BHV space with distinct maximal dimension for each number of leaves possible on a phylogenetic tree. While BHV spaces are interesting mathematically, there has been little progress in studying problems that arise in phylogenetic inference in this space since the introduction of the concept in 2001. The results from the project are the first results that allow collections of trees embedded in BHV spaces to be studied using techniques of mathematical phylogenetics.    Toric varieties that arise in the study of group&shy;-based Markov models of sequence evolution are mathematically interesting due to their rich algebraic structure. Working with collaborators in a Mathematics Research Community, the PI helped develop a MaCaulay2 software package that computes quantities associated to these varieties. In a manuscript accompanying this package the authors showed conditions sufficient for these varieties to have full dimension (allowing for combinatorial identifiability) and found improved bounds for claw trees.    Broader Impacts:  Certain research outcomes of this award will impact quantitative fields outside the discipline of mathematics such as computational biology, computer science, and data science.   Under two types of genetic discord (horizontal gene transfer and incomplete lineage sorting) the PI showed with collaborators that coalescent-&shy;based species tree inference methods that identify the quartet signal in a collection of input genes outperform the leading methods NJst and concatenation with maximum likelihood on data simulated under a variety of model conditions. In particular, ASTRAL&shy;II outperformed all other methods and Weighted Quartets Max Cut came in a close second. This should lead to the selection of quartet&shy;based summary methods on many datasets in which these two sources of genetic discord are present.   The PI showed with collaborators that the SVDquartets method of species tree inference does not necessarily outperform other coalescent&shy;-based methods on datasets where the average length of gene sequences sampled is very short.  It was also shown in this study that under very low levels of incomplete lineage sorting, concatenation with maximum likelihood could be the most accurate method of species tree construction among those compared. This has led to caution in method selection for species tree inference in the computational biology community.   With collaborators, the PI developed the "efficient quartets" software package that encodes a set of trees as a set of O(n^2) quartets, where n is the maximum number of leaves in the set of input trees. This is a reduction from the full O(n^4) representation of the input trees as quartets. It was found in a comparative study on simulated data that using an efficient quartet representation in supertree and summary methods (instead of the full quartet representation) did not result in a significant reduction in the accuracy of the inferred output trees.   The PI collaborated with 14 undergraduate students and 11 graduate students in conducting research funded by this award.  Collaborator affiliations were in statistics, mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, and bioengineering departments at 18 institutions.  Two collaborators were affiliated outside the United States, and 30 of the 40 collaborators working on research related to this award were from populations under-represented in academia.
