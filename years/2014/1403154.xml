<AbstractNarration>Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that ultimately produces gametes (i.e., sperm and egg). This project will examine recombination, the exchange of genetic information between paired chromosomes, that occurs during meiosis. The project has broad educational and societal impacts, including opportunities to train undergraduate and high school students in classical genetics, basic molecular biology, and evolutionary biology. Furthermore, the portability of the experimental system facilitates outreach efforts involving middle school students participating in summer programs in science education. The research has potential societal impacts including human health as meiotic disruptions contribute to infertility and aberrant chromosome number in progeny. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recombination that occurs during the first stage of meiosis serves two important functions. First, recombination ensures the distribution of the appropriate number of chromosomes into gamete cells. Second, recombination generates novel genetic combinations that are potentially beneficial to the progeny. Despite these benefits, recombination has risks because it can generate deleterious duplication and deletion mutations. The frequency of recombination may therefore evolve to balance the benefits of recombination against its risks. Using the fly genus Drosophila, this research will investigate how the frequency and physical placement of recombination events along chromosomes has evolved between species. In particular, this research will investigate how the rapid molecular evolution of a meiosis gene has resulted in the evolution of differences in recombination rate observed across the evolutionary tree of Drosophila species. The project will investigate the rapidly evolving mei-218 gene which is responsible for most of the crossover rate difference between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila mauritiana using a candidate gene approach. The project will test the degree to which molecular evolution at mei-218 contributes to the variation in recombination rates across the Drosophila phylogeny using a molecular evolutionary analysis to test for histories of recurrent positive selection at mei-218 in multiple Drosophila lineages. The project will also use a transgenic approach to assay the phenotypic effects of the mei-218 gene from multiple Drosophila species.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Meiosis is a fundamental, highly specialized cell division process by which sexually reproducing eukaryotes produce haploid gametes.  During the early stages of meiosis, recombination via crossing over occurs, serving two important functions.  First, crossing over ensures chromosomes properly segregate into haploid gamete cells.  Second, the resulting recombination creates new genetic variation thereby increasing the efficacy of natural selection.  Despite these benefits, however, recombination has risks.  Repetitive sequences introduce the risk of unequal exchange that may generate deleterious duplications and deletions.  The optimal rate of crossing over may therefore evolve to balance the benefits of recombination against its risks.  Among Drosophila species with comparable genome sizes, crossover frequency varies more than four-fold.  The goal of this project was to study the basis of these evolved species differences in crossover rate, taking advantage of the rich body of work on the genetic control of meiosis in Drosophila females.  Previous research identified mei-218, a gene essential for the formation of crossover intermediates, among the fastest evolving genes in the genome, raising the possibility that evolution at mei-218 mediates the evolution of crossover frequencies.  To conduct this project, we generated five transgenes containing mei-218 alleles from species across the Drosophila phylogeny.  Of most interest, was two closely related species: D. melanogaster and D. mauritiana.  We measured crossover frequency in the presence of each mei-218 transgene and found that mei-218 is responsible for nearly all of the ~1.3-fold species difference in crossover rates on chromosome 2.  We generated two additional chimeric transgenes containing regions of mei-218 from both D. melanogaster and D. mauritiana to identify the particular protein domains of mei-218 that play a critical role in species-specific crossover rates.  Next, we conducted a molecular evolutionary analysis to ask how five meiosis proteins that interact in a multi-protein complex, including mei-218, have evolved across the phylogenetic history of 15 Drosophila species.  We detect evidence of adaptive evolution in two of the five proteins, including mei-218.  These findings suggest that adaptive evolution at these genes may evolve to adaptively modulate the rate of crossing over in multiple Drosophila species lineages.  Last, we initiated work on a high-resolution, genome-scale recombination map of D. mauritiana to complement existing data for D. melanogaster.  Once completed, we will be able to compare recombination maps and determine how gene conversion rates, crossover rates, and distributions along chromosomes have evolved between the species.  This work is ongoing.  Overall, recombination has profound effects on the genome and cell cycle, influencing levels of population genetic variation and serving as a checkpoint during meiosis.  Results from this project further our understanding of the molecular genetic control of recombination and the population genetic forces involved in the evolution of recombination rates.  This project enabled the training of graduate students, undergraduate students, and high school students participating in a summer program targeting underrepresented minorities.
