<AbstractNarration>Mid-infrared spectroscopy is a technique that is used to identify molecular constituents based on the interactions of light with matter.  Current system implementations require large, bulky, and discrete optical and electronic components, inherently limiting sensitivity, power efficiency, functionality, stability, reproducibility, compactness, and economies of scale.  This award supports research to overcome these fundamental limits by realizing a complete mid-infrared spectroscopic sensor system fully integrated on an optoelectronic integrated circuit at the micrometer scale.  The research brings together concepts from optical physics, material science, and electrical engineering allowing for both fundamental science and technological applications to be advanced in tandem.  Opportunities are created for chemical and biological sensing with societally important applications including medical sensing, bio-agent defense, environmental process control, and atmospheric chemistry.  In addition to specific applications, the convergence of photonics and electronics broadly impacts the optical networking, computing, and sensing industries.  The cross-disciplinary nature of the research drives the focus of the integrated educational plan that responds to the challenge of preparing students to be successful in an increasingly interdisciplinary and global environment.  Graduate students, undergraduate students, underrepresented groups, and minorities are engaged in a curriculum that fosters integrative research thinking and links societal issues to science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Silicon is the established material of choice for the microelectronics industry and is attractive for integrated electronic and optical systems on a chip.  The lack of second order susceptibility in silicon is, however, a major obstacle to achieving chip-scale mid-infrared spectroscopy.  The objective of this research is to overcome this barrier by hybridizing the silicon platform with lithium niobate, a ferroelectric material exhibiting second order susceptibility.  New horizons become apparent when exploiting the capability of silicon to provide submicrometer spatial confinement of light and the ability of lithium niobate to mediate strong second order nonlinear optical effects.  The research team will perform design, modeling, fabrication, and test to create chip-scale mid-infrared spectroscopy for the first time.  The design and modeling approach is based on numerical solutions to nonlinear coupled amplitude equations based on Maxwell's equations.  The chip will be physically realized using nanometer scale fabrication techniques.  Species will be measured for the purpose of test, measurement, and validation.   Results will be compared with the high-resolution transmission molecular absorption database.  These concepts provide a new method of attack to achieve complete chip-scale functionalities in hybrid-monolithic silicon and lithium niobate photonic integrated circuits.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the duration of this award, we have been able to form the technological foundation needed for chip-scale mid-infrared spectroscopy.  The results enable the characterization of materials in miniature form factors for applications requiring knowledge of chemical composition.  The research activities involved design, modeling, fabrication, test, and validation.  The design and modeling approach was based on numerical modeling of the interaction of light waves at different frequencies confined to patterned structures on the same scale as a microelectronic circuit.  On the chip scale, optical light is guided in patterned structures called planar optical waveguides.  The optical waveguides are analogous to electronic circuitry in conventional microelectronic circuits.  The physics is, however, based on the properties of light waves instead of the properties of electricity.         On-chip spectroscopy requires the generation of multiple wavelengths.  Design, modeling, and analyses were conducted to convert light from one color to a different color with high efficiency.  The process of color conversion requires the colors to be matched in phase.  Phase is a fundamental characteristic of light.  To match colors in phase with high efficiency, the waveguides were composed of a thin film ferroelectric material, called lithium niobate, designed with a property referred to as periodic poling.  Periodic poling is achieved by fundamentally altering the waveguide material property with an electronic pulse.  The efficiency of the color conversion is also impacted by co-propagating the colors in waveguides with micrometer scale cross sections.  The efficiency is higher in smaller waveguides because, for the same amount of optical power, the optical intensity is larger in the smaller waveguides.   Once the design and modeling was completed, the waveguides were fabricated at The Ohio State University using nanoscale fabrication techniques.  We have achieved the fabrication of poled lithium niobate thin films where the film thickness was less than one micrometer thick.  Light was guided on the thin films of lithium niobate via patterned strips of insulator called silicon nitride.  We achieved nonlinear wavelength conversion on a chip from 1530 nm wavelength to 765 nm wavelength.  Nonlinear wavelength conversion was validated by observing a quadratic dependence between the fundamental harmonic power and the second harmonic power, in accordance with theory.         Broadly, we have been able to open the full suite of nonlinear optics to the chip scale.  Nonlinear optical functionalities enable the realization of integrated circuits that use photons to overcome the physical limitations imposed by electrons.  Graduate students have been involved in the research and have received training in numerical modeling, nanoscale fabrication techniques, and precision optical measurements.  The training of the next generation of scientists and engineers, along with the continued convergence of electronics and photonics, impacts the optical networking, computing, and sensing industries with applications in information technology, telecommunications, and health care.
