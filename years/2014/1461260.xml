<AbstractNarration>This award establishes a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Illinois Institute of Technology and the University of Chicago. The site, which is named BigDataX, focuses on undergraduate research in both the theory and practice of big data computing at extreme scales. BigDataX includes a diverse group of 8 undergraduate students and 4 mentors spread out over the two institutions. Students will conduct research in the area of big data and how it will address issues related to the design, analysis, and implementation of run-time systems and storage systems to support big data applications. This work includes making extreme scale computing more tractable, touching every branch of computing in high-end computing and datacenters. These advancements will impact scientific discovery and economic development at the national level, and they will strengthen a wide range of research activities enabling efficient access, processing, storage, and sharing of valuable scientific data from many disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary focus of this award is to promote a data-centric view of scientific and technical computing, at the intersection of distributed systems theory and practice. The project team has identified various data-intensive applications from many disciplines  such as  astronomy, bioinformatics, medical imaging, that demonstrate characteristics of big-data applications. This work focuses on the design, implementation, and optimization of runtime systems to support parallel programming systems for both Many-Task Computing and High-Performance Computing.  The work centers on distributed scheduling, dynamic provisioning, improved fault tolerance, and support for heterogeneous computing. To better support big data applications, the team is exploring distributed file systems and improvements to a variety of critical components such as metadata management, I/O access pattern coalescing, distributed provenance as well as exploring novel interfaces into distributed storage systems. This work involves real applications, real data, and real testbeds ranging from small clusters at IIT and UChicago, supercomputers at Argonne National Laboratory, to the Amazon AWS cloud.</AbstractNarration>

The primary objective of this project is to promote a data-centric view of scientific and technical computing, at the intersection of distributed systems in both theory and practice. The intellectual merit of this proposal is in the area of big data and will address issues related to the design, analysis, and implementation of run-time systems and storage systems to support big data applications. The broader impact of this work has made extreme scale computing more tractable, touching many branches of computing in high-end computing, while placing undergraduate students in the middle of a technological revolution at the intersection of computer science, scientific computing, and big data.&nbsp;</p> <p>This project had 5 mentors with a variety of complementing expertise from theory to systems. This work included a comprehensive educational plan integrating 25 undergraduate students with senior PhD students with incremental manageable goals, aimed at allowing undergraduate students to achieve publishable results within the ten-week summer program. The REU students were immersed in a thriving research laboratory that has a large number of other students from high-school, undergraduate, master, and PhD students participating in funded research work related to big data and distributed systems in one of two interdisciplinary laboratories: 1) the DataSys Lab in Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology or 2) the Systems Group in the Computation Institute at University of Chicago. The PIs aimed to recruit most of the students from outside of the host institutions, focusing on recruiting students from institutions without research opportunities as well as women and minorities; as a result, only 3 of the 25 students were from the host institutions.&nbsp;</p> <p>This REU program hosted 25 students from 2015&ndash;2017, which&nbsp;produced 17 publications.&nbsp;Of these students, 16 co-authored publications (64% of REU students), and 21 students attended conferences (84% of REU students). We had received 156 applications, and accepted 25 students (16 were women, minorities, from institutions without research programs, or first-generation college students). The BigDataX cohort was enhanced through alternative sources of funding which increased the average cohort size from 8 undergraduate students per summer to 20 students per summer, for a total of 61 students participating in summer research in the past 3 summers.&nbsp;</p> <p>The program received 156 applications, of which 24% of the applicants were female, and 20% minorities. 24% were 1<sup>st</sup>generation college students, and 43% had applied from primarily teaching only institutions. The average GPA across all applicants was approximately 3.7 out of 4.0, with the minimum GPA of 3.3. We accepted into the REU program 25 students (16% acceptance rate). We were able to bring in 2 females per year for the first two years, and 3 females in 2017; we would like to note that we accepted many more female students and would have been thrilled to have 50% female students, but many of these students turned us down. We accepted a representative number of 1<sup>st</sup>generation college students, from teaching only institutions, and with good GPAs.&nbsp;</p> <p>There were 16 REU students&nbsp;who co-authored 17 publications (64% of the REU students co-authored at least 1 paper). We want to highlight that 21 of the 25 students have attended at least 1 workshop or conference, with some having attended multiple; all these students&rsquo; travel were either funded by this REU award or by student travel grants that the students/mentored applied for. Some noteworthy research results can be highlighted by the awards received. In 2016, one of the REU students William Agnew, received the ACM Undergraduate Student Research Award at the SC16 conference for paper titled &ldquo;Touring Dataland? Automated Recommendations for the Big Data Traveler&rdquo; that he co-authored with another REU student Michael Fischer, along with their mentor Kyle Chard and collaborator Ian T. Foster. In 2017, two REU students&nbsp;Blue Keleher and Emily Herron won 2nd and 3rd place respectively in the ACM Undergraduate Student Research Competition at IEEE/ACM SC 2017 conference for their published research work (&ldquo;Finding a Needle in a Field of Haystacks: Metadata Search for Distributed Research Repositories&rdquo; and &ldquo;Applying Image Feature Extraction to Cluttered Scientific Repositories&rdquo;).</p> <p>Every year, we conduct a yearly survey to find out where all the past REU students are in their academic careers, or careers in general (with a 50% response rate). Unsurprisingly, we found that most (57%, 14 students) are still working on their undergraduate degrees. And of those who did complete their undergraduate degrees, there was a 2:1 ratio between those who took jobs in industry (7 students) compared to those who continued to graduate school (4 students).&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/09/2018<br>      Modified by: Ioan&nbsp;Raicu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1461260/1461260_10354341_1536468007089_bigdatax-2017-sc17-awards--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1461260/1461260_10354341_1536468007089_bigdatax-2017-sc17-awards--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU BigDataX 2017 - IEEE/ACM SC 2017 Awards"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1461260/1461260_10354341_1536468007089_bigdatax-2017-sc17-awards--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU BigDataX 2017 - IEEE/ACM SC 2017 Awards"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Two REU students Blue Keleher and Emily Herron won 2nd and 3rd place respectively in the ACM Undergraduate Student Research Competition at IEEE/ACM Supercomputing/SC 2017 conference for their published research work.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ioan Raicu</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ioan&nbsp;Raicu</div> <div class="imageTitle">REU BigDataX 2017 - IEEE/ACM SC 2017 Awards</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1461260/1461260_10354341_1536466839368_bigdatax-2016-picnic--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1461260/1461260_10354341_1536466839368_bigdatax-2016-picnic--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU BigDataX 2016 - Picnic Social Activity"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1461260/1461260_10354341_1536466839368_bigdatax-2016-picnic--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU BigDataX 2016 - Picnic Social Activity"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The BigDataX REU program together with the MEDIX REU program enjoying a social activity in the park in Chicago Illinois in the summer of 2016.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ioan Raicu</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ioan&nbsp;Raicu</div> <div class="imageTitle">REU BigDataX 2016 - Picnic Social Activity</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1461260/1461260_10354341_1536466701997_bigdatax-2015-anl--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1461260/1461260_10354341_1536466701997_bigdatax-2015-anl--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU BigDataX 2015 - Argonne National Laboratory Visit"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1461260/1461260_10354341_1536466701997_bigdatax-2015-anl--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU BigDataX 2015 - Argonne National Laboratory Visit"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This picture captured the BigDataX REU group together with the MEDIX REU group for a site visit at Argonne National Laboratory in the summer of 2015.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ioan Raicu</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ioan&nbsp;Raicu</div> <div class="imageTitle">REU BigDataX 2015 - Argonne National Laboratory Visit</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1461260/1461260_10354341_1536467090056_bigdatax-2016-sc16-awards--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1461260/1461260_10354341_1536467090056_bigdatax-2016-sc16-awards--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU BigDataX 2016 - William Agnew at IEEE/ACM SC 2016"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1461260/1461260_10354341_1536467090056_bigdatax-2016-sc16-awards--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU BigDataX 2016 - William Agnew at IEEE/ACM SC 2016"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">William Agnew received the ACM Undergraduate Student Research Award at the SC16 conference for paper titled ?Touring Dataland?
