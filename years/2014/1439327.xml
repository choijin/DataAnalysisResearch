<AbstractNarration>Formal verification techniques such as model checking, satisfiability solving, theorem proving, and static analysis have matured rapidly in recent years.  These techniques have a number of important applications ranging from the modeling and analysis of biological and cyber-physical systems to the verification of the safety and security of complex software systems.  The Summer School on Formal Techniques trains students in the principles and practice of formal verification, with a strong emphasis on the hands-on use and development of this technology.  It primarily targets graduate students and young researchers who are interested in using verification technology in their own research in fields such as computing, engineering, biology, and mathematics.  Students at the school are given the opportunity to experiment with the tools and techniques presented in the lectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2014 edition of the Summer School is the fourth in the series takes place during May 19-23, 2014.  Topics covered in this school include logic, formalization, interactive theorem proving, SAT and SMT solving, model checking, program semantics, modeling and verification of security protocols, and software reliability.  The students cooperate in solving challenging problems while learning to use cutting-edge tools and techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Formal modeling and verification technology has made significant advances in the last two decades.  Techniques like model checking and theorem proving are now used in both the hardware and software industries.  Formal techniques are also increasingly being used in scientific modeling, as for example in systems biology and in the engineering of complex cyber-physical systems.  The biggest challenge facing this technology is the lack of trained users and developers of this technology.  To address this gap, we started the Summer School in Formal Techniques.  The first such school was held in the Summer of 2011 at Menlo College in Atherton, California, with support from the National Science Foundation and SRI International.  The school attracted 80 participants with a diverse range of interests and backgrounds.  The lectures were rigorous and covered the spectrum of formal techniques including static analysis, model checking, theorem proving, invariant generation, compositional verification, and systems biology.  The lectures were supported by hands-on laboratories.  Building on the model of the first school, the Second Summer School on Formal Techniques was held in May/June 2012, and also drew around 80 participants.  The third Summer School held in May 2013 drew around 60 participants. The Forth School was held May 2014 and drew around 65 students. Like the preceding schools, the forth edition of the school was received enthusiastically by the participants.  The lecturers included Nikolaj Bjorner (MSR Redmond), Veronique Cortier (LORIA, France), Gerard Holzmann (JPL/Caltech), Gerwin Klein (NICTA Australia), and Marta Kwiatkowska (University of Oxford) and  Dr. Natarajan Shankar (SRI).  We also had invited talks from Dana Scott (CMU) and Emina Torlak (UC Berkeley).  In addition to participating in the lectures and laboratory sessions, the students gave informal presentations of their own ongoing research activities.
