<AbstractNarration>This project supports the participation of undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, junior faculty, and other researchers in a conference on "Frontiers in Applied and Computational Mathematics" (FACM) at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). This successful conference series has been organized over the past ten years by the Department of Mathematical Sciences and Center for Applied Mathematics and Statistics at NJIT. The annual meeting has established itself as a leading forum for the dissemination of research in applied and computational mathematics and statistics.  FACM conferences are more intimate and student centered than large society meetings and a goal of the organizers is to introduce future leaders of applied mathematics to established investigators and emerging research areas. Participation among graduate students and postdocs is greatly enhanced through a competitive application process by which they can give presentations in minisymposia alongside leading scientists.  Past FACM conferences have an excellent record of participation of women and underrepresented minorities, and special efforts will be made to continue this trend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FACM 2014 is focussed on mathematical biology and biostatistics. The meeting features invited plenary talks, minisymposia, and poster sessions on areas of great current interest, such as analysis of large data sets, computational biology, circadian rhythms, and models of brain disorders. This conference series brings together mathematicians, statisticians, scientists and engineers in an environment where significant interaction and cross-fertilization take place.  For students and postdocs, this will be a major learning and networking experience that will help them with their research and career paths.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit. FACM 2014 was a focused meeting on mathematical biology and applications in neuroscience and systems biology. There were also several sessions on nonlinear waves. The meeting included minisymposia on mathematical modeling in areas of significant current interest such as circadian rhythms (Casey Diekman, NJIT, organizer), computational  biology (Carson Chow, NIH),  dynamics of brain disorders (Jonathan Rubin, U. Pittsburgh), and several sessions on biostatistics (Antai Wang, NJIT).  Broader Impacts. This conference series brings together mathematicians, statisticians, scientists and engineers to present their research results and interact in an environment that is more intimate than the typical large conference setting. Significant interaction and cross-fertilization takes place between the participants. Substantial funds are devoted to support the participation of graduate students, post- docs, and under-represented minorities. For students and postdocs, this is a major learning and networking experience that will help them with their research and career paths.  FACM conferences have an excellent record of participation of women and under- represented minorities.  In addition, the Department of Mathematical Sciences and other departments nationwide have undergraduate and graduate students who are culturally diverse. For many of these students, such a research conference is their first exposure to high quality research being undertaken at other research institutions.
