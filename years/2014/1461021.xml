<AbstractNarration>Title: REU Site: REUMass: A Summer Computing Research Experience in Data Science&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides undergraduate students with a 10-week intensive summer research experience focused on data science, an emerging area with high societal impact and significant student interest.  Data science studies theory and methods that enable efficient extraction of knowledge from large amounts of data.  The intellectual merits of this project include the investigation and development of new methods for data analysis, methods for improving the infrastructure for analysis, and the application of those analysis methods and infrastructure to useful problems. The project's broader significance and importance include increasing the attractiveness of graduate study in computer science for students from community colleges and underrepresented groups, and increasing the technical knowledge of data science among such students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each student project is oriented around a single type of analysis method, infrastructure, or application, but projects embed that work within an integrated "deep stack" view of data science that connects applications with analytics and infrastructure. Students participate in a number of technical activities (workshops, symposia, field trips, etc.) and social events that have proven successful in creating a close and sustained relationship among the participants in past year's cohorts.  This focus helps emphasize how fundamental computer science enables a broad set of information technology applications as well as showing the breadth of opportunities in computer science, and these areas have proven to be attractive to the proposal's target cohorts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[         The project &mdash; REUMass: A Summer Computing Research Experience in Data Science &mdash; provided a 10-week period of training and hands-on experience to 30 undergraduate students.  REUMass exposed students to a range of fundamental computing research projects that are motivated by an underlying focus on data science, an emerging area with high societal impact and significant student interest. Our program leveraged longstanding and ongoing research at the UMass College of Information and Computer Sciences in a variety of computing areas, including machine learning, computational social science, information retrieval, databases, programming languages, parallel and distributed computing, and theory.              The primary goals for the REUMass project were to: (1) Expose students to leading-edge research with an emphasis on data science; (2) Enhance students? ability to thrive in a competitive research-oriented REU program by building supporting communities, mentoring, and addressing weaknesses in student preparation; and (3) Create excitement about the possibility for pursuing graduate studies and research careers.          Major educational activities for students included an orientation day, a week-long data science bootcamp, a professional development seminar series, a research seminar series, and a field trip to visit industry research labs. Major student research activities included the conduct of research projects, and oral and poster presentations of research progress and results.          Students received formal lectures and performed in-class activities in the data science bootcamp and the research methods lectures. They also received lectures in other professional development topics throughout the summer. Students received equally valuable, though less formal, training and professional development through the weekly technical lunch talks by graduate students.
