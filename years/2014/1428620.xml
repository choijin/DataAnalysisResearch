<AbstractNarration>Non-technical: Nanoscience is a major research focus across South Carolina. The state has three research-intensive universities including the University of South Carolina (USC), Clemson University, and the Medical University of South Carolina, in addition to numerous research-active teaching-colleges. The proposed small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) instrument fills a regional need for nanoscale characterization capabilities and has written commitments from more than 20 faculty members across 6 universities to put the tool to immediate use. The SAXS instrument establishes an open regional facility called the South Carolina SAXS Center (SCSC) that is centrally located to support affordable access from HBCUs and PUIs. The instrument enables emerging research programs from recently hired faculty and broadly supports numerous federally funded programs on soft-matter physics, engineering, biological sciences, and nanomaterials chemistry. SCSC supports the education of nearly two hundred undergraduate and graduate students. The SAXS capabilities are being incorporated into existing educational programs as well as into new USC undergraduate and graduate courses on nanoscale characterization. A new summer program at USC introduces SAXS to students of HBCUs, including South Carolina State University, Claflin University, and Benedict College. In addition, industrial research partners use the SAXS instrument to accelerate their research that enhances the local economy, promotes close academic-industry collaboration, and increases the hiring of South Carolina graduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: Establishing the South Carolina SAXS Center transforms statewide nanoscale research capabilities, especially regarding block copolymers, conductive polymers, nanocomposites, nanoparticles, bioparticles, protein solutions/interfaces, mesoporous materials, and nanomaterials for energy devices. The scientific problems to be studied all require nanoscale structural information such as the long-range order of nanocomposites or the shape and size of nanoparticles. The previous lack of local access to a SAXS instrument had significantly slowed the scientific research of numerous federally funded projects. This SAXS acquisition includes several sample stages and multiple configurable detectors to support a diverse range of measurement methods from small- to wide-angle scattering in both transmission and reflection modes from solids, pastes, and liquids. The temperature controlled environmental chamber, flow cell, and capillary stage enable the diverse experimental needs of the broad user base. SCSC supports 24/7 cyber-access for remote instrument use and will promote the dissemination of results with online data hosting. The user-friendly software packages guide trained undergraduates, graduates, and senior scientists in SAXS analysis. SCSC enhances ongoing fundamental studies and supports diverse applications such as photovoltaics from anisotropic nanoparticles, high-performance membranes for fuel cells, sustainable thermoplastic elastomers, and drug delivery from dynamic nanocapsules. Accelerated results from the South Carolina SAXS Center transform advanced research programs on polymers, nanocomposites, energy materials, biological sciences, and physical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
