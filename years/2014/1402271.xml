<AbstractNarration>Algebraic structures like groups, Lie algebras, and Lie superalgebras have internal symmetries that have been used in many different physical applications in biology, chemistry, and physics. Representation theory, a method to codify information about groups and algebras through matrix realizations, has played a fundamental role in mathematics over the past one hundred years. Modern trends in representation theory have involved using tools from topology (i.e., cohomology) and algebraic geometry to package the representations of an algebraic object via the tensor product structure to connect the representation theory to ambient geometric structures. This project will use these deep interactions between the representations, the geometry, and the cohomology as a powerful device to prove new results about these algebraic structures and to answer important questions pertaining to geometric and homological invariants (like the complexity and atypicality) for these representations. The PI will organize conferences in algebra with an emphasis toward the development of junior mathematicians, and he will disseminate working knowledge of modern methods in representation theory through lectures at seminars, workshops, and summer schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores central problems of interest in the representation theory of reductive algebraic groups, Lie algebras, and Lie superalgebras. This study includes discovering new conjectures about the characters of simple modules for reductive algebraic groups in positive characteristic, and classical Lie superalgebras in characteristic zero. The determination of formulas for extensions between irreducible representations for finite Chevalley groups and loop algebras will also be explored. In this investigation, the PI will make use of tensor triangulated geometry and other geometric constructions in triangulated categories to compute cohomological invariants (e.g. cohomology groups, module varieties) of representations for the aforementioned algebraic objects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectural Merits:  Representation theory has emerged as a central area of modern mathematics with connections to combinatorics, algebraic geometry, topology, number theory, along with applications to chemistry and physics. Representations are mappings, regarded as snapshots, of complicated algebraic objects (such as groups and Lie algebras) to an array of numbers (matrices). These realizations by matrices encode local data that can yield deep insights into these complicated algebraic objects.     The PI's research is at the interface between representation theory, geometry and homological algebra. Collecting all the representations for a certain algebraic object forms a tensor triangulated category. Methods as introduced by Balmer from homological algebra can be used to build a bridge between tensor triangulated categories and geometric objects. Uncovering this "hidden geometry" often leads to new insights about the algebraic object and its representations.     The PI and his collaborators established a general setting for a compactly generated tensor triangulated category to classify thick tensor ideals and the Balmer spectrum. This enabled us to classify thick tensor ideals and compute the Balmer spectrum for representations of Lie superalgebras quantum groups.  Endotrivial modules are an important component of the tensor triangular geometry, the PI et al. completed the description of the group of endotrivial modules for a finite group of Lie type in the type A case.     Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group and B be a Borel subgroup  defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p &gt;0 and let G_r denote the r-th Frobenius kernel of G.  During the grant the PI and his collaborators established the following new results on algebraic group representations:     1)    provided a new proof of rational and generic cohomology with improved stablility ranges.  2)    established effective bounds for the dimension of the first and second cohomology for G that gave significant improvements over prior estimates.  3)    proved a conjecture of Benedict Gross on the global irreducibility of Weyl modules  4)    provided conditions for the when tilting, induced and Weyl modules yield orthogonal or symplectic structures  5)    established key relationships between Donkin's (p,r) Filtration Conjecture and Donkin's Tilting Module Conjecture  6)    answered a question of Friedlander on the existence of mock injective modules for arbitrary algebraic groups.     The PI and his collaborators advanced our knowledge of explicit calculations of cohomology and other homological invariants. The PI et. al.       7)    calculated the cohomology ring for the small quantum group for small roots of unity  8)    computed the support varieties for quantum Weyl modules  9)    investigated the structure of the restricted Lie algebra cohomology for p-nilpotent Lie algebras with trivial p-power operation. In particular, conditions were given to insure that the cohomology ring is Cohen-Macaulay.  10) presented detailed calculations of the third B cohomology with coefficients in a one-dimensional representations along with related computations involving cohomology for G_r for induced modules and ordinary Lie algebra cohomology for u=Lie U.  11)  computed the complexity of the Lie module for the symmetric group , thus proving a conjecture of Erdmann, Lim and Tan. The proof used deep work in homotopy theory due to Arone and Kankaanrinta.        Broader Imacts:  The PI continued to develop his active training program of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in representation theory. During the grant, the PI graduated three Ph.D students and served as a mentor for five postdoctoral fellows. He was the VIGRE (Vertical Integration of Research and Education) Director at UGA through summer 2015.  The PI organized workshops aimed at the professional development of junior mathematicians.
