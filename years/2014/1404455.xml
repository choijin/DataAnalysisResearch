<AbstractNarration>By removing an electron from an atom or molecule, one creates a "handle" which allows one to grab it and hold onto it using electric and/or magnetic fields.  The ability to trap and manipulate atoms and molecules in this way has long been recognized to hold great scientific and technological potential, with applications ranging from quantum-controlled chemistry to precision tests of the basic theories of physics which underlie virtually all of modern technology.  Trapped atoms (and their ionized counterparts) have been studied by many groups, but it is more difficult (although potentially more rewarding) to trap and probe the relatively fragile molecules.  The mostly untapped potential of molecules relates to their ability to rotate and vibrate, internal degrees of freedom which are absent in atoms.  However, before the full potential of trapped molecules can be realized, techniques must be developed to determine their degree of rotation and vibration without destroying the molecules in the process.  Here, the supported research group proposes capturing camera images of trapped molecules in such a way that they only appear in the picture if they have specific well-defined rotational and vibrational energies. These camera images will provide a means to non-destructively determine the rotation and vibration of trapped molecules, with detection resolution achievable down to the single-molecule level.  It is anticipated that the development of these techniques will eventually find application in the chemical industry and in the realization of more advanced quantum computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With prior NSF support, the supported research group at Northwestern University demonstrated a technique to control the quantum rotational state of trapped molecules using a single femtosecond laser to simultaneously optically pump from all thermally populated excited levels.  This technique works for molecular ions with a special internal structure, those possessing a so-called diagonal electronic transition, allowing many photons to be scattered before vibrations are excited. These molecules can be roughly thought of as the alkali atoms of the molecule world.  In the present work, fluorescence of trapped molecular ions will be imaged directly on a CCD camera, lighting up certain locations in a one-dimensional Coulomb crystal where the single molecular ion at that site is in the probed quantum state.  These CCD images will thus provide molecular state readout with single-molecule resolution. The group will then use fluorescence state readout in order to observe electric-dipole mediated rotational entanglement between co-trapped polar molecular ions.  Future extensions of the work proposed here could include scattering-free detection of single molecules using optical phase shifts, directly using heavy molecular ion fluorescence readout for parity-violation and time-reversal symmetry violation searches, implementations of conditional quantum gates, entangling molecular ions with external circuits, and studies of decoherence dynamics in ion traps.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Physicists have become proficient at controlling trapped atoms at the quantum level.  However, obtaining quantum control of more complex systems, including molecules formed of just two atoms, presents a serious challenge.  If scientists can develop tools to gain this level of control over such molecules, many new applications could be possible, ranging from quantum information processing, to quantum-controlled chemistry, to new tests of fundamental assumptions about the nature of the universe.  Toward these goals, it is critical to develop improved techniques to load, fully control the quantum state, and non-destructively read out the quantum state of trapped molecular ions.  One molecular ion which is of particular interest for many applications is SiO+.  Its favorable properties include a simple nuclear structure, a rotational motion that can be driven by inexpensive microwave sources, and rotational quantum states which are long-lived in a room temperature environment.  Under this grant, the researchers better characterized SiO+ and determined that its properties are favorable for quantum control.  The researchers also developed a new technique for cooling an atomic barium ion to the lowest motional quantum state of the trap. The ground-state Ba+ ion, interacting with a co-trapped SiO+ ion, can then be used in future work as a tool to control and read out the SiO+ quantum state.  In order to perform the cooling of the Ba+ ions, the researchers found they needed more stable lasers.  This challenge led to an investigation of a standard current driver circuit used by many groups, and they found a way to improve the design to allow stable operation nearer to the maximum current setting.   Additionally, in the process of pursuing the planned goals, the researchers realized that they had on hand a method to perform thermometry on a crystallized string of trapped ions, using the fluorescence emitted by the laser-cooled ions.  The analogous technique had been previously demonstrated for a single ion, and the researchers showed that with the proper analysis the technique could be used for more complex systems involving multi-site crystals.  In February 2017, the PI co-led a session for the Chicago High Jump event.  This half-day Saturday event was attended by around 100 aspiring high school students from underperforming schools from throughout the greater Chicago area.  In his sessions, the PI took the students through a brief slideshow motivating and describing his group?s molecular ion trapping research.  The groups then talked with the students about the impact of science on society and about pursuing science and engineering degrees in college and related careers after college.  The areas impacted by this research include physical chemistry, quantum information processing, and fundamental studies of the nature of the universe.  The researchers developed a new type of source for molecular ions which could be useful to chemists, and ultimately the work could lead to quantum-controlled chemical reactions.  Progress toward quantum control of trapped molecular ions brings closer to fruition possibilities of using molecules as elements of a quantum computer.  And quantum control of molecules will lead to new experiments to address the question of whether physical "constants" are truly constant or whether they vary in space or time.
