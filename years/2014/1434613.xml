<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description: Superhard materials, such as diamond, cubic boron nitride, and boron carbide (B4C) can exhibit high melting temperatures, large compression strengths, chemical inertness, and high thermal conductivity, making them of practical importance for science and engineering applications. However, they are brittle, breaking easily, a serious flaw that prevents many engineering applications. Computational approaches will be combined to develop ductile superhard materials for extended engineering applications. Initially, quantum mechanics will be used to predict the best candidates for new ductile superhard materials by analyzing a large number of cases in silico. For the best predicted materials novel experimental methods will be employed in which diamond anvil cells are twisted while applying high pressure to form the predicted phases. The properties of these materials will then be tested. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: The goal is to advance multiscale theory, modeling, and experiment sufficiently to enable a revolutionary new approach to search for and synthesize novel nanostructured phases in the BCN system. Large plastic shear deformation will be combined with high pressure in a unique rotational diamond anvil cell (RDAC), to (a) search for new nanostructured superhard phases that cannot be obtained under pressure without plastic shear straining, (b) dramatically reduce pressure required for phase transformation pathways to new and/or known phases, and (c) stabilize these new phases for processing at ambient pressure. The focus will be on some of the most promising materials within the BCN system: superhard phases of carbon (diamond, fullerene, high-density amorphous C, nanotubes, and long-range ordered amorphous clusters), boron, cubic cBN and wurtzitic wBN, cubic cBC2N, cBC4N, high density cC3N4 (predicted to be harder than diamond but never synthesized), nanostructured composites within BCN system, and other new phases in these systems, all of which will be predicted by the atomistic simulations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the collaborative proposal is to advance multiscale theory, modeling, and experiment to enable a new approach to synthesis of novel phases in B/C/N system.  The goal of the ISU team is to find ways to control PTs by advancing three-scale continuum theory for plastic strain-induced phase transformations (PTs) under high pressure and model synthesis of superhard phases in rotational diamond anvil cells (RDAC).  Intellectual merit   Collaborative efforts resulted in the following outcomes:    (a) The following breakthrough results were obtained in collaboration with Caltech and TTU teams. The possibility of shear-induced PT under zero pressure was predicted with the phase field approach (PFA). Shear-induced PT from graphite to hexagonal and cubic diamond at 0.4 and 0.7 GPa, respectively, was then obtained in RDAC.  These values are 50 and 100 times less than the corresponding PT pressures at quasi-hydrostatic conditions! This discovery may have technological and geophysical importance.  (b) In collaboration with James Warren, project leader for MGI at NIST:           (i) PFA for PTs with anisotropic interface energies and stresses is developed at large strains.          (ii) PFA for PTs between three phases is developed and applied to revealing the strong effect of stress on melt nucleation during solid-solid PT via an interfacial intermediate melt far below melting temperature.    (c) In collaboration with Russel Hemley (Geophysical Laboratory of Carnegie Institution of Washington), a model for large elastoplastic deformation with nonlinear elasticity and pressure-dependent yield condition is formulated. The finite element method (FEM) algorithm is developed. The FEM solution effectively describes experimental pressure distribution in rhenium compressed in DAC up to 300 GPa.  (d) In collaboration with Vladimir Blank group (Technological Institute for Superhard and Novel Carbon Materials, Moscow, Russia), shear transformation-deformation bands consisting of linearly-polymerized, triclinic, monoclinic, and hcp fullerene, and amorphous structures are revealed. Transformation-induced plasticity, positive mechanochemical feedback, and cascading structural changes are also revealed.  2.  New PFAs at large strains and FEM algorithms are developed, and numerical simulations are performed for:   (a) Stress-induced multiphase PTs and multivariant martensitic PTs with interfacial stresses;  (b) Dislocation nucleation and evolution at the nanoscale; and  (c) Coupled multivariant martensitic PTs, twinning, and dislocation evolution.  (d) Nanoscale mechanisms of drastic reduction of PT pressure under compression and shear of materials are revealed by PFA studies of phase nucleation at evolving dislocation pileups.  (e) The origin of a large elastic stress within an interface between martensitic variants (twins) is determined analytically and with FEM.  (f) An explicit expression for the lattice instability condition for Si I-Si II transformations under action of all six components of the stress tensor is obtained by combining analytical prediction using PFA with molecular dynamics and first principle simulations.  (h) Unique homogeneous (without two-phase mixture) and hysteresis-free first-order PT is predicted using molecular dynamics and PFA under special triaxial stresses. These are ideal properties for various PT applications.  3. Macroscale approach resulted in the following outcomes:  (a) The first models and algorithms are developed, and FEM results are obtained for plastic flow and coupled plastic flow and PTs for large strains.  (b) Evolution of the stress-strain state for rhenium compressed and twisted in RDAC under megabar pressures and for copper under high-pressure torsion is obtained.  (c) The pressure self-focusing effect near the center of a sample, compressed in DAC and compressed and twisted in RDAC, is revealed.  (d) The main principles of producing very high pressure, based on the pressure self-focusing effect, are predicted.    (e) Coupled plastic flows and the strain-induced PTs are studied              (i) for the PT from hexagonal boron nitride (BN) to superhard wurtzitic BN within the rhenium gasket for pressures up to 50 GPa;            (ii) in a sample within a gasket under pressure and torsion in RDAC;           (iii) for alpha-omega PT in zirconium under compression in DAC and compression and torsion in RDAC.  Various new interpretations of experimental results were obtained, and ways of controlling PTs are suggested.  Broader Impact:  Three PhD students have graduated.
