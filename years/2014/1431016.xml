<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is an environment resistant inertial measurement unit (eIMU) for commercial/industrial applications. This eIMU is a miniaturized navigation device that will enable enhanced GPS navigation down to centimeter accuracy and will replace GPS when it is not available or reliable. The eIMU will enable navigation directly to specific items in malls, grocery stores or department stores. It will also enable reliable navigation for police or fire fighters inside buildings in emergency situations. This navigation chip would enable a wide range of precision manufacturing and assembly robots. It would also enable the navigation of autonomous vehicles that can be used by police and homeland security in addition to commercial applications, such as real estate and smart agriculture. The eIMU could also be used to help map mines and to aid in oil exploration. In the medical industry, the eIMU could be used for surgical robots and wheel chairs. Scientific applications include miniaturize micro- and nano- satellites; and autonomous vehicles for underwater exploration. Overall, the eIMU targets making precision navigation small and affordable enough to be used throughout our society for enhanced industrial, security, scientific and personal applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a new environment resistant inertial measurement unit (eIMUs). Inertial measurement units (IMUs) consist of accelerometers and gyroscopes which work together for navigation and orientation measurements. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial (motion) sensors are now used for a wide range of consumer applications, but can?t be used for precision navigation because of their extreme environmental sensitivity. In particular, the measurement (bias) stability of these sensors is extremely sensitive to temperature, humidity and stress?making it very challenging to us them for precision navigation and machine control. The proposed eIMU will address this by building a micromachined physics package around the sensitive MEMS sensors in order to actively control their environment independent of environmental factors. The technical challenges include: i) developing a process for reliably assembling the IMU dies in to the physics package; ii) optimizing the physics package for temperature stability and in order to prevent it from introducing any noise to the IMU and; iii) optimizing software algorithms for reducing the power required for environmentally stabilizing the IMU. This packaging technology will also be generic and applicable to other sensor systems and technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The following describes the project outcomes for this NSF Phase II SBIR and technical enhansement for commercialization (TECP) :  A high-performance package was designed and implemented for improving the performance of consumer grade inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of 3 gyroscopes and 3 accelerometers. This package enabled a greater than 10 times improvement in measurement stability under changing temperature, under changing outside stresses and in measurement stability over long term testing. This packaging can be designed to have the same footprint as traditional sensor packages (a few millimeters on each side) while enabling this improved performance. A package manufacturing and assembly process supply chain capable of prototyping and production volumes for &gt;10,000 units/year was developed. "Evaluation packages" and "evaluation electronics" were developed under this program to allow for prototyping of new inertial sensor products in this package. Custom packages were also developed for one of the biggest industrial grade inertial sensor companies in the world. The test data and technology allowed for a partnership with one of the world leaders in inertial sensor manufacturing. This partner can help scale the technology to very high volume production (&gt;1M units) and engage with end users of the technology. It is anticipated that this technology will get used in applications including: industrial robot control, unmanned vehicles (aerial and ground), and driverless cars.
