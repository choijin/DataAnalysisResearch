<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract: As future bioengineers, the participating students will appreciate the impact of international differences in regulation, culture and ethics, and engineering approaches. The purpose of the program is to teach, train, and mentor under-represented undergraduates (minorities and women-U.S. citizens or permanent residents) each year via cross-cultural immersion at Nanyang Technological University (NTU)in Singapore. The project themes entail research related to transformative biomedical applications. This IRES project will enhance 1) student learning abilities; 2) intercultural competencies; and 3) retention and enrollment in graduate studies. The program will provide international educational opportunities to enable participants to effectively compete as global leaders in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract: Efforts to engage U.S. students in biomedical research abroad, particularly those from under-represented groups are essential for training the next generation of STEM professionals who can work in a global environment. In this three year program, under-represented students will be participating in a biomedical-focused international research experience (IRES) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore. The participants, all from the EPSCoR state of South Carolina, include Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Program objectives will be assessed by measuring how well the IRES program trains participants in 1) research skills (e.g. learning to conduct research, data analysis, formulating research hypotheses); 2) intercultural competencies; and 3) retention and enrollment in graduate studies.&lt;br/&gt;The IRES research project is in biomedical sciences with specific importance in developing new technologies. During this three year project (2015-17), qualified undergraduates from different institutions will spend eight summer weeks at NTU in Singapore performing research with dedicated mentors.The intellectual merit of the program involves: 1) Creating specific biomedical science projects; 2) Creating well-developed research and outreach activities; and 3) Developing a specific and appropriate plan to measure the PI's goals to train all GMG fellows in the skills of STEM research and learning while living abroad. Broader impacts involve: 1) Providing summer research experiences for under-represented undergraduates designed to encourage pursuit of graduate study; 2) Providing US students from an EPSCoR state the opportunity to conduct research in a Southeast Asian research laboratory and learn intercultural competencies; 3) Leveraging the previous experience and skills of students trained in other programs; 4) Providing designed professional and cultural development activities for the students; 5) Training participants to disseminate their research to biomedical science peers; and 6) Enhancing existing collaborations between Clemson and NTU.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This research project supported the development of an eight week summer international research experience program ("Call Me Glober") for under-represented students. The program was open to students studying science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines and recruited from Clemson University and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) within South Carolina. During the program, students lived in Singapore and worked in research labs at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). The program's objectives were to enhave 1) student learning abilities, 2) intercultural competencies, and 3) retention and enrollment in graduate studies. During the performance period, a total of eighteen students received stipends through the grant to support their participation in the program. Twelve / eighteen (67%) of supported students were from minority groups under-represented in STEM and fourteen / eighteen (78%) were female. The Call Me Glober program also drew interest from other students and seventeen additional students participated in the program during the performance period with support from other sources. Students worked primarily with faculty in the Materials Science and Engineering department at NTU and their projects were all related to the broad field of biomedical sciences, particularly the areas of biomaterials, implants, and medical devices. On survey assessments, students reported very high scores (9+/10) for improvements in their skills for using research instrumentation, data collection, analysis, and interpretation (Objective 1) and their ability to interact, communicate, and collaborate with others from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds (Objective 2). In addition, students gave very high scores (3+/4) for the impact of the program on their understanding of what it is like to be in graduate school and their commitment to pursuing a graduate or medical degree (Objective 3). At project end, fifteen of eighteen supported participants had graduated with their bachelor's degrees, with the remaining three still enrolled and on schedule for graduation. Of the fifteen graduates, nine (60%) are either currently enrolled in or have already completed a graduate degree program, including doctoral programs in chemical engineering and bioengineering and Master of Public Health programs. In addition to their technical research experience, students participated in tours and cultural excursions that allowed them to experience Singapore's history, cuisine, multi-cultural population. Overall, this project made a substantial contribution to training a diverse STEM workforce with an understanding of the global nature of scientific research.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/26/2020<br>      Modified by: Ken&nbsp;Webb</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
