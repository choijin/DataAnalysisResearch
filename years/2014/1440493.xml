<AbstractNarration>The proposed system consists of an optimized large scale microphone array that allows spatial audio selection. This system can focus in on a target source while suppressing interferences from a wide variety of locations. In other words, the proposed system allows users to listen in on selected target source even though the source may be surrounded by a host of other interfering sources.  The proposed technology achieves significant gains over current microphone array implementations through joint optimization of microphone placement and design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology can process acoustic and electromagnetic waveforms to discover both the number and location of sources in multi-path, noisy environments. The technology separates each source by either cancelling or attenuating interferences and identifies previously recognized sources. Additionally the technology works in environments where sources both move and outnumber the number of sensors. The technology optimizes sensor placement and processing using state of the art optimization and statistical modeling techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF I-Corps award 1440493 allowed the Entrepreneurial Lead (Mark Lai), the PI and Business Mentors (Lex McCusker and Karl Ginter) to study the market readiness for large scale sensor arrays optimization and source separation technologies.  Over the 6-month period of this grant the team analyzed business opportunities in three areas of application: (a) audio applications; (b) wireless communications and antenna arrays; and (c) seismic data management.  Over a 6-week period the team conducted over 125 interviews with companies and technical experts in these three areas of applications. After a short analysis of the first two areas of applications, the work has concentrated on seismic data acquisition and processing. The Launch Pad Central was heavily used during the entire period.  The NSF funds allowed the EL and PI to have many face to face meetings primarily in Houston and Austin area, as well as travel to technical meetings on time-frequency analysis and array signal processing. The grant also partially supported the EL to finish his Ph.D program under the PI's supervision.  Several technical documents were produced during the performance period of this grant including two papers, one Ph.D. thesis and one provisional patent application. The EL is continuing to develop new technologies and customer discovery activities in his new position as Post-Doctoral Associate at the University of Texas.
