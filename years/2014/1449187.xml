<AbstractNarration>The project proposes a research study and a workshop, both aimed at bringing together theory, practice, and evidence-driven discussion. It will be guided by two objectives: (1) understanding faculty engagement, and (2) strengthening faculty engagement. These will be considered in relation to institutional environment support and the capacity for transformative research. Key activities will include an integrated analysis of faculty and institutional data within the context of a self-determination theory of motivation, and a holistic envisioning of academic research careers by experts and stakeholders.  A distinctive exploratory aspect of the research study is the use of  statistical modeling to investigate questions that have not been addressed before in large-scale surveys related to faculty satisfaction and retention.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will include a focus on career-life balance to better understand faculty engagement and persistence in academic STEM careers.  The study team will plan and convene a workshop to synthesize recent work encompassing career life balance and broader impacts (BI) infrastructure, share and stimulate promising practices, and develop recommendations for institutional action. The project will influence institutional opportunities to enhance faculty engagement, career life balance, gender equality in STEM careers, and BI infrastructure. The use of COACHE data may inform cross-institutional policies and practices to support faculty and potentially benefit hundreds of colleges and universities. Open access to research and workshop results will be provided using Iowa State's Digital Repository.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit   The STEM-FIT project advanced knowledge, collaboration, and new lines of inquiry by: (1) designing and conducting a research study using a new model for faculty engagement; and (2) planning and convening a workshop to synthesize work encompassing career life balance and broader impacts. The project investigated the relationship between the three principles of self-determination theory (SDT) (autonomy, perceived competence and perceived relatedness) and environmental factors that contribute to key faculty outcomes like satisfaction and intent to leave. The study used a large institutional COACHE dataset that measures a variety of constructs related to aspects of faculty?s perceived institutional support, global and specific aspects of their job satisfaction, and other perceptions of their experience at their present institution. The researchers identified survey items that relate strongly to the SDT psychological needs and explored a theory-based model using a rich and large dataset. The findings provide triangulation among a large-scale institutional model (STEM-FIT), experimental and psychological research (prior literature), and institutional intervention research (e.g., ADVANCE Project TRACS), in supporting SDT as a highly useful guide to understanding faculty satisfaction, productivity, and well-being as a function of institutional support.

Global satisfaction was predicted only by faculty's perceived relatedness, which is in turn predicted by administrative, research, departmental, and promotion and tenure support. Several institutional supports related to work-life balance were also shown to play a role.  Broader Impacts   SDT has implications beyond satisfaction and retention for considering the morale and productivity of the faculty. SDT can help institutions think about faculty development efforts and how to keep faculty engaged throughout their careers, as well as get more out of the majority of faculty in ways beneficial for society, institutions, and faculty. Given the ubiquitous use of the COACHE survey, the project?s findings suggested that other institutions could explore pre-existing COACHE data, or plan specific analyses of future COACHE data, to also investigate institutional weaknesses and thus develop or propose targeted interventions.
