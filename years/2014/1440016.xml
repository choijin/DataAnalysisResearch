<AbstractNarration>This proposal from the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) includes two workshops for early-career women, the first at the Joint Mathematics Meeting (JMM) in San Antonio, January 10-13, 2015, and the second at the SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) in Salt Lake City, March 14-18, 2015. It also includes a named lectureship, the Emmy Noether Lecture, to be held at the San Antonio JMM meeting. The workshops are designed to create sustainable networks, encourage mentoring relationships, and promote research collaborations in key fields of mathematics.  The Noether Lecture highlights outstanding contributions by a female mathematician and provides an inspiring role model to more junior women.  As such, these events address some of the key issues that frequently inhibit women's participation in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each workshop will focus on an area of mathematics of current interest. The 2015 AWM-JMM workshop will focus on homotopy theory. Homotopy theory, an area of algebraic topology, has close ties to algebraic geometry, geometric topology, number theory, representation theory, and mathematical physics.  It is a highly active area and has seen significant progress in recent years.  The 2015 AWM-SIAM workshop will focus on mathematical modeling and high-performance computing for multiphysics and multiscale problems.  Advances in science and engineering - in disciplines ranging from health to energy and the environment to defense - rely on predictive measurement and analysis of multiscale multiphysics systems.  Topics to be addressed at the workshop include physical modeling, mathematical analysis, numerical analysis, algorithms, implementation, performance, and scalability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/awmmath/programs/workshops</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This project included two workshops for early-career women and one named lectureship organized by the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) and held at major national mathematics meetings.  The first workshop and the Noether Lecture were held at the Joint Mathematics Meeting (JMM) in San Antonio in January 2015, and the second was held at the SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) in Salt Lake City in March 2015.  Intellectual Merit  Each of the workshops focused on a topic of current interest. The AWM-JMM Workshop focused on homotopy theory, a highly active area that has seen significant progress in recent years.  Homotopy theory is a rich field of mathematics with close ties to algebraic geometry, geometric topology, number theory, representation theory, and mathematical physics.  It has also been applied to problems in engineering and computer science.  The AWM-SIAM Workshop focused on mathematical modeling and high-performance computing for multiphysics and multiscale problems.  Advances in science and engineering, in disciplines ranging from health to energy, from the environment to defense, rely on predictive measurement and analysis of multiscale and multiphysics systems.  Advances in this area impact not only scientific discovery, but also engineering design and policy-making.  Talks at both workshops were given primarily by women in the early stages of their career. The workshops also included a graduate student poster session covering a wide range of topics, panel discussions and mentoring sessions.  Talks and poster sessions were open to attendees of the broader meetings and provided a chance for participants to discuss their research with others in the field.  The workshops also helped to integrate a new cohort of female mathematicians into the research community.  Broader Impact   The events supported by this grant were designed to address issues that frequently cause women in mathematics to leave the profession early in their career or fail to thrive.  The AWM workshops were designed to create sustainable networks, encourage mentoring relationships, and promote research collaborations.  By focusing on a particular area of mathematics, these workshops helped to build a sense of community among women in that area and to reinforce existing networks.  Contacts formed through these workshops will lead to greater participation in the broader research community as well as spawning new research collaborations.     As a plenary lecture at the JMM, the largest annual mathematics meeting in the world, the Noether Lecture is a unique opportunity to highlight the work of a distinguished female mathematician. The Noether Lecture provides inspiration to younger women and offers a visual reminder of the significant contributions of women to the field.  Recent research on implicit bias confirms the importance of such events.        Last Modified: 09/14/2015       Submitted by: Ruth Charney]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
