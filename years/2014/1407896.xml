<AbstractNarration>1407896&lt;br/&gt;Cannon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydrofracturing is a relatively new area with respect to shale-gas extraction.  It holds the promise for the US becoming an energy exporter; however, it is also possible that the extraction of shale gas and the methods used for extracting shale gas may adversely impact water resources in the US. Therefore, it is extremely important that technologies to treat/remediate the process and produced water be found.  An important aspect of Environmental Engineering and associated programs, is to insure that every effort is made to minimize adverse environmental impact from hydrofracturing.  This proposal addresses a new technology to minimize adverse environmental impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will separate salts from water by applying a supercharged pulsed jet (SPJ) to hydrofracturing water. This water may be either process or produced water. The process, once developed fully will be simple, as the SPJ system is merely of a 3-foot long tube, consisting of a rapidly alternating air-fuel intake, and a brine discharge nozzle. This SPJ system will help American energy-independence, with new hydrofracturing in PA, TX, WY, CO, WV, LA, and other places, thus, it will have applications in many states. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In preliminary tests with this SPJ, the research team processed hydrofracturing water (i.e., brine) that contained 12.6 % solids. From this, the team captured 60 % of the brine?s salts onto a steel mesh. Also, the water was atomized into a mist while using just 17 % of the energy needed to ideally boil water at 1 atm pressure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to the broader impacts of this project the PI will continue to serve as the PI of Penn State's Sloan Minority Scholarship Program. This Sloan program will provide a year's funding to 16 Minority Ph. D. students in STEM disciplines during the course of the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research team tested a supercharged pulsed jet combustor system for separating salts from water when processing hypersaline brines, such as those resulting from hydrofracturing operations.  This system was able to process 13-25 % (by mass) hypersaline brines, and vaporize water from this brine with energy efficiency as favorable, and more favorable than mere conventional evaporation in open-air setting.  This was achieved while collecting as much as 95-100% of the salt in a simple polypropylene pool, when this pulsed jet was operating in the open air, at temperatures ranging from 28oF to 75oF.  From these results, we offer that this novel pulsed jet technology uniquely offers a viable means of separating salts from hypersaline brines&mdash;particularly brines that contain greater than 300,000 mg/L salts.   We also found that when the superpulsating jet?s high frequency pressure waves directly contacted the brine droplets, the convective heat transfer into those droplets was 40-45% more efficient than when that heat from the exhaust gases was instead conveyed via conductive heat transfer through a stainless steel coil that contained the brine.  This distinction highlighted that the supercharged pulsed jet separated salts from brines by means of highly efficient convective heat transfer; and did not need to rely on the (expensive) conductive heat transfer that conventional desalination requires.   In our most recent tests, we also employed an efficient orifice design that facilitated efficient misting of the fluid in the presence of the superpulsating jet, and this was enhanced yet further with pulsed fluid introduction.  These improvements enhanced performance to the extent that far less fluid dropped below the pulsed jet impact zone.     This performance was monitored by high-speed Schlieren imaging, which depicted both the jet high pressure and low pressure waves, and also the misting of the saline fluids.  The Schlieren imaging and acoustical devices facilitated "tuning" of the pulses to the natural frequency of the jet's discharge bell, much as a brass instrument can be tuned. The team is continuing with demonstration and commercialization of this novel technology.         Last Modified: 08/15/2016       Submitted by: Fred S Cannon]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
