<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a two-year Postdoctoral Fellowship. The PI received her PhD in chemical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering. The sponsoring scientists and host institutions are Dr. Jim Murray (University of Washington) and Dr. John Crusius (USGS - Seattle). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research she will conduct for her Fellowship is focused on the exploration of what is driving iron (Fe) cycles in the coastal oceans and on the development of a new instrument that will improve the sampling of iron in the ocean. Oceans cover over 70% of the earth surface and are responsible for nearly 50% of annual primary productivity, yet these ecosystems remain significantly understudied relative to their terrestrial counterparts. Notably, trace nutrients such as iron which may be critical in driving (or limiting) primary productivity in the ocean remain only sparsely sampled. What data are available indicate that iron concentrations are highly variable and seasonally dependent offshore and especially in coastal areas where upwelling/downwelling cycles may be particularly important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will explore the extent to which coastal upwelling and hypoxia events may drive supply of Fe to overlying waters from sediments and will develop a methodology for automated high-frequency trace-metal clean sampling at ocean moorings which stands to improve data density for iron (and other metals and nutrients) by a factor of ten or more relative to existing solutions. The PI will develop a system for automated collection of samples via a novel trace-metal clean sampler for use at profiling moorings. Deployments at a near-shore validation site (~6 months, ORCA, Puget Sound) will be followed by sampling for 12 months at a scientifically relevant coastal shelf site. Ideally, this deployment will take place at the OOI Endurance Array Newport Line, where water column profilers are scheduled to be installed at various depths from 25-800m. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will also participate in two educational initiatives, both of which involve underrepresented students in science projects. She will act as a science mentor for middle school students in the Seattle area via Project COOL, and she will mentor undergraduates who are participating in the University of Washington and Woods Hole internship programs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Overview:</p> <p>The goal of this project was development and field validation of a next-generation trace metal clean water sampler to enable high resolution (in space and time) study of nutrient-limited marine ecosystems, particularly High-Nutrient Low-Chlorophyll (HNLC) regions where iron (Fe) is known to be a key driver of ecosystem productivity &nbsp;yet is relatively understudied and contributes significantly to remaining uncertainty in ecosystem models used to forecast fisheries productivity.&nbsp; By virtue of a small, modular design, such a tool was envisioned to increase both the total number of samples that can be collected and the platforms from which such studies can be conducted (e.g., stationary buoys running an profiler to study full water column depth, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), etc.).&nbsp; Further, a key goal of this program was broadening participation by underrepresented groups in the ocean sciences.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Results:</p> <p>A highly compact sampler constructed with trace-metal clean materials was designed, lab-tested, pressure-tested, and field validated on two deployment platforms in Puget Sound.&nbsp; The Portable Remote In-Situ Metal (PRISM) sampler is comprised of 15-sample custom-machined HDPE ring-shaped modules (7.5&rdquo; outer diameter, 3.5&rdquo; inner diameter) which mount along a 3&rdquo; PVC pressure housing containing system electronics, batteries, and a pressure-compensated pump chamber.&nbsp; The system has been lab-tested to pressures equivalent to 200m, with the goal of enabling sampling along the continental shelf regions where upwelling and land inputs create complex, interesting dynamics in the iron cycle that (1) are strongly linked to harmful and increasing anoxic periods in the coastal ocean and (2) projected to vary significantly as climate patterns continue to change.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>PRISM utilizes standard 10mL polypropylene syringes as sample containers, with custom dual-seal Teflon plungers replacing the standard plunger to (1) avoid sample contamination from rubber seal tips and (2) avoid back-flooding of sample containers in the free-flooding sample chamber.&nbsp; The sampling line is actively pumped, enabling flexible placement of the inlet to ensure collection of clean water from any platform and adequate flushing of lines to minimize contamination and carry-over.&nbsp; Optional filtering can be added on top of the 0.8 micron filter utilized as the inlet to the sample tubing.&nbsp; Sample chambers are held closed (empty) by zipties secured with Tungsten-Rhenium wires; to fill a designated chamber with sample waters, high current is run through the wire to release the ziptie (optional designs can break the wire or melt the ziptie), enabling the pump to push water into the syringe.&nbsp; Upon filling the syringe plunger is pushed back, seating into a stop-plate to prevent over-filling.&nbsp; Timing of sample collection can be either static (timed) or dynamic (designated depth at or after a given time), with the potential for future adaptive-sampling mechanisms based on temperature or triggered from other sensors mounted on the same platform (e.g., based on dissolved oxygen, turbidity, or chlorophyll levels).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The PRISM sampler was field tested on two platforms at different sites in Puget Sound:&nbsp; mounted as payload on a REMUS-100 AUV (Hood Canal, August 2017) and deployed on a multi-sensor instrument case at an ORCA buoy profiling station (Point Wells, October 2017).&nbsp; The AUV deployment demonstrated autonomous mobile sample collection to depths of 20m (active photic zone).&nbsp;
