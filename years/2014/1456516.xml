<AbstractNarration>In the fall of 2006 Sunni tribes turned on Al Qaeda in Iraq and allied with the United States. This - along with the surge in American troops and a change in American strategy - reversed the course of the insurgency. Alignment decisions and coalition dynamics are often key factors in determining the outcome of civil and interstate wars. Yet theoretical work done over the last two decades on the causes and conduct war of has very little to say about coalitions. This work has made very important insights. But it has almost exclusively focused on two-actor models. Building on that literature, this project attempts to extend the insights derived from two-actor models of war to the formulation and analysis coalitions. These include a third party's decision of whether and how to intervene in a war of attrition; the role of third parties in proxy wars; a general model of divide and conquer, and the centripetal forces that tend to break coalitions apart as they near their goals. A main result of this project will be a clearer conceptual foundation for empirical efforts to estimate the effects of third-party intervention in civil wars. Looking to the broader impacts of the project, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees recently reported that there were nearly 60 million displaced people in 2014, half of them children (New York Times, 18 June 2015). Civil war was a major cause. A clearer understanding of coalition dynamics may be a small step toward mitigating these effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alignment decisions and coalition dynamics are often key factors in determining the outcome of civil and interstate wars. Yet the formal, game-theoretic work done on the causes and conduct of war in the twenty years since Fearon's "Rationalist Explanations of War" (1995) has largely focused on two-actor games, often on two-actor bargaining games. This work is largely silent on coalitional issues. Building on that literature, this project attempts to extend the insights derived from two-actor models of war to the formulation and analysis of models coalitional dynamics in the shadow of conflict. More specifically, the goal of this project is to identify and analyze broad, canonical problems in coalition formation and then formalize them as "workhorse" models. Preliminary work has already analyzed the problem facing a third party in deciding whether to take sides in a war of attrition. Two-actor wars of attrition are commonly used to model many different kinds of conflict, including civil wars. Thought of as all-pay, second-price auctions, wars of attrition have been generalized to allow for n players competing for n-k prizes (Bulow and Klemper 1999). Surprisingly, however, no one has previously analyzed the very natural question of what a third party would do when it has preferences over who wins the war of attrition and can influence that outcome by supporting one side or the other. This project will first extend and generalize the preliminary results of the analysis of the model of choosing sides in a war of attrition. The project will then formulate other coalitional problems like divide and conquer (or rule), and the centripetal forces that tend to break coalitions apart as they near their goals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major results of this research are threefold. The first two come out of "Taking Sides in Wars of Attrition." Recent qualitative work on civil wars emphasizes the fluid nature of many alliances with factions frequently shifting sides. The analysis provides an explanation for this. Roughly, sticking with a side is time inconsistent. If others expect a faction to stick with an ally and for an alignment to hold, others take steps that effectively create a large reward if the faction double crosses that expectation and switches sides.  The game-theoretic model developed in "Taking Sides" also makes it possible to evaluate a crucial assumption underlying empirical efforts to understand effect of outside intervention on the duration of civil wars. (This is the proportionality assumption underlying Cox hazard-rate models.) The formal analysis shows that this is an extremely strong assumption which is unlikely to hold in even the simplest settings, and this calls several existing empirical claims about the effects of intervention into question.  Third, "Endogenous Intractability" shows that a wide range of phenomena &ndash; US efforts to get Pakistan to go after the Haqqani network and disrupt Taliban sanctuaries on the Pakistani border, efforts to get authoritarian leaders to democratize, and US efforts to create long break-out periods in nuclear negotiations &ndash; all have a similar structure. A principal is trying to induce an agent to solve a problem that, if solved, (i) creates or exacerbates an ongoing problem for the agent and (ii) significantly reduces the agent?s bargaining power with respect to the principal. The analysis shows that these problems are very hard to solve and likely to persist for a long time.  Looking to the broader impact, civil war is often a humanitarian disaster, and the effects of American intervention were the subject of much discussion early in the Syrian civil war as the Obama administration was formulating policy. "Taking Sides" sheds light on some of the factors affecting civil war duration and total cost.  The war in Afghanistan is now the longest war in American history. Taliban border sanctuaries have often been said to be a significant reason that American and Afghan forces have never been able to go after Taliban forces and possibly break the back of the insurgency. Pakistan?s unwillingness to go after these sanctuaries and the Afghan Taliban more generally have been a continual problem in US-Pakistan relations for almost 15 years. "Endogenous Intractability" helps explain why problems like this tend to persist and are unlikely to be resolved. The analysis provides a firmer foundation for policy.
