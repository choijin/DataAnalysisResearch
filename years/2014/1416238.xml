<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B Program and the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Michael Bowman of the Department of Chemistry at The University of Alabama will develop new classes of reagents to increase the sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and make it possible to image specific chemicals and proteins.  The goal of this research is to exploit the properties of free radicals and clusters of free radicals to develop ways of enhancing the MRI signals from specific molecules using non-toxic, earth-abundant materials so that the transport and fate of those molecules can be studied. This project is part of an international collaboration with chemists in Novosibirsk, Russia and provides an excellent opportunity for introducing under-represented students in the University of Alabama's Chemistry and Research Experience for Undergraduate program to the global science, technology, engineering and math career opportunities of today's economy through planned outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free radicals and biradicals are used in a process known as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) to greatly enhance nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and MRI signals for molecular imaging and the study of rare molecules and intermediates. The use of DNP is hindered by its high cost and limited performance. Improvements to DNP will be made by the synthesis of much better polarizing agents based on a detailed understanding of the DNP process and the role of the electron spin dynamics of the free radicals that drive DNP. This project involves an international collaboration coupling: 1) experimental studies of free radical spin dynamics and DNP; with 2) theoretical modeling of the role of free radicals in DNP; to 3) guide the synthesis of new free radicals and poly-radicals aimed at improving the practical performance of DNP.</AbstractNarration>
