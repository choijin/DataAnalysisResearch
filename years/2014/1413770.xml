<AbstractNarration>Many aspects of brain function involve the coordinated activity of millions of nerve cells.  Individually, these cells can behave like tiny clocks, emitting a steady stream of pulses that communicate with each other.  The synchronization of these oscillators ("clocks") plays a role in both healthy and diseased brain states.  Deepening the understanding of how groups of brain cells synchronize ("tick" together) or desynchronize ("tick" separately) will deepen the understanding of the brain systems underlying motor control, epilepsy, breathing, information processing, and cognition.  This project addresses a conceptual gap in the theoretical understanding of oscillating nerve cells.  Today, most theories about how nerve cells synchronize rely on the assumption that each cell behaves with nearly impeccable precision.  However, real nerve cells have stochastic variability, and their behavior is partly irregular and unpredictable.  In constructing mathematical models of nerve cells that can account for variability, mathematically challenging problems arise.  Solving these mathematical problems can improve the ability to quantitatively describe the clocklike behavior of individual nerve cells.  This project will contribute to the BRAIN Initiative by providing deeper insight into many nervous system disorders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses a mathematical problem at the foundations of computational neuroscience and neurophysiology: the reduction of oscillatory systems to a phase oscillator description, in the presence of noise. The asymptotic phase of a deterministic dynamical system possessing a stable limit cycle was introduced in mathematical biology in the 1970s. Today, the biological significance of phase oscillator models is difficult to overstate.  The fundamental notions of phase and phase resetting depend on classical results of invariant manifold theory for systems of deterministic differential equations. But noise is ubiquitous in biological dynamics.  In recasting models of biological oscillators to take into account random fluctuations, the classical "asymptotic phase" is no longer well defined. This project develops a new definition for the asymptotic phase of a noisy oscillator, defined in terms of the complex eigenfunctions of the forward Kolmogorov operator, describing the evolution of the density on the state space. This "stochastic asymptotic phase" coincides with the classical phase in the case of vanishing noise intensities. However this new definition does not rely on the classical phase of a related deterministic system. Unlike the classical phase, it is equally well defined for systems that require noise for sustained oscillation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report for the General Public  Award Number 1413770  Spectral Analysis of Stochastic Neural Oscillators   Oscillations occur all around us.  The steady skip-skip-skip of a child jumping rope, the rhythmic swaying of tree limbs in a light breeze, and the swinging of the pendulum in a grandfather clock are examples.  Inside the brain, rhythmic oscillations in electrical activity are observed at scales ranging from millions of nerve cells (the electroencephalogram, or EEG signal) to the firing of steady trains of action potentials by individual nerve cells. Understanding how the rhythmic activity of brain cells emerges, and how different cells can coordinate their activity with one another, is a fundamental question in theoretical neuroscience.  Oscillations in the brain are of fundamental scientific interest, but also play an important role in brain health and disease.    Mathematical modeling has proven helpful for both theorists and experimental neuroscientists to understand the behavior of individual nerve cells and networks of interconnected nerve cells.  Over the past forty years, a mathematical framework has been developed, called "oscillator phase reduction", that can capture the fundamental behaviors of oscillating nerve cells in simplified models, that are more tractable to mathematical analysis.  An important aspect of this simplified description of nerve cells is to assume that their behavior is completely deterministic, or predictable: given the same starting conditions, the mathematical model of a given nerve cell will act the same way time and again.  In contrast, cells recorded either within the living brain, or in experimental preparations "in vitro", show a degree of unpredictability:  given (practically) identical starting conditions, the timing of a cell?s action potentials will show a degree of randomness or stochasticity.    The principal contribution of the project "Spectral Analysis of Stochastic Neural Oscillators" has been to extend the mathematical framework of oscillator phase reduction to allow for the effects of stochastic (random) fluctuations in the behavior of nerve cells, while retaining the advantages of a simplified (low dimensional) mathematical model.  This new framework opens the door to mathematical analysis of the effects of random fluctuations on the coordinated firing of nerve cells through synchronization (rhythms emerging from the interactions between cells in a network) as well as entrainment (rhythms driven by an externally applied input, such as oscillations in a different brain area).  In the long run, it may help lead to improved techniques for detecting and treating neurological disorders involving discoordination of brain rhythms or pathological synchronization.
