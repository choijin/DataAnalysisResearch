<AbstractNarration>In recent years, much has been learned from survey observations of interstellar clouds that harbor star formation in our Galaxy.  These surveys have been conducted at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths, measuring light emitted at wavelengths invisible to the human eye.  A key piece of the puzzle, information about cloud motions that can only be found with instruments that observe spectral lines, is needed to transform these surveys into a comprehensive understanding of the structure and dynamics of our Galaxy.  The proposal sponsored here will allow integration of the Supercam submillimeter-wavelength heterodyne array receiver with the 12-meter-diameter APEX telescope in Chile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology that enables this investigation is the 64-element Supercam camera, whose design and construction was funded by NSF.  It uses superconducting SIS detectors to observe the sky at a wavelength of around 850 microns.  The Supercam features superconducting SIS junctions in mixer blocks, and these components are modularized into 1x8 rows with bias electronics, IF processors, and digital FFT spectrometers integrated into the modules.  The observations are particularly topical and important to modern astronomy, and were indeed recommended in the Astro2010 decadal survey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will involve and train students in many aspects of the work.  It also has potentially large broader impacts, as a survey, on progress in its field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this project is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Wide-field imaging with radio telescopes is often an extremely time consuming operation as most radio receivers have effectively one "pixel" and therefore see only one spot on the sky at a time.  Construction of radio receiver arrays, particularly for imaging spectrometers, has up to this point been limited to small arrays of very few "pixels" &ndash; constructed through brute force using discrete mixers in the focal plane.   Through an NSF funded program in 2005-2009, we have constructed Supercam, a 64-beam imaging spectrometer which is built following an integrated approach that leads the charge toward cost-effective large-format focal plane arrays.   This is analogous to the situation in visible light in the early 1980Ã†s, when integrated arrays of detectors (CCDs) began to revolutionize optical astronomy and now comprise the digital cameras in nearly every mobile phone. Now, at the boundary between optical/infrared and radio frontiers, at TeraHertz (THz) frequencies, this revolution is happening again.  Supercam is the first such integrated camera in the submillimeter-wave regime, where the 64-beams not only make imaging more rapid and cost-effective, but every pixel in that image also contains a high resolution spectrum.  This particular program utilized the now-completed Supercam instrument, and enabled its integration on one of the premier terahertz telescopes in the world, the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) sited at 17,000 ft elevation in the high mountains of the Atacama desert in northern Chile.   Supercam was successfully installed for a 3 week observing campaign in December 2014, and again in April 2015 under excellent weather conditions. Supercam delivered exceptional data of the Southern Milky Way, and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.  Calibrated "Level 1" data are now publicly available at http://archive.eso.org/cms.html and http://soral.as.arizona.edu/Supercam and science publications and "Level 2" science products including fully processed maps are being readied for release in Q4 2015 and Q1 2016.  These new data promise to improve our understanding of the interactions between stars and the molecular clouds which form them.  Specific questions that we expect these data to directly address include:  How do molecular clouds form, evolve, and get disrupted?  Low long do they live?  Under what conditions do molecular clouds form stars? What are the effects of (hot) stars on their associated (parental) molecular clouds?  Do what extent is the radiation and dynamics created by these stars a trigger (or an extinguishing agent) for further star formation? How does the Galactic environment impact the formation of clouds and stars? Can star formation in the Milky Way be synthesized into a templat ewhich can help us interpret star formation in the most distant galaxies?
