<AbstractNarration>This project is a continuation of the UCLA team's highly-visible study of the central regions of our Galaxy, which includes the nearest supermassive black hole (SMBH). With special instrumentation, they are able to follow the motions of individual stars orbiting close to the SMBH in the center of our galaxy.  Rare astrophysical events predicted to occur in both 2014 and 2018 will be observed, perhaps offering an indirect study of gravity around the SMBH. The central region of our galaxy provides a unique laboratory for understanding how SMBHs are formed and why they are so common in galactic nuclei, and it provides a laboratory to test our fundamental notions of gravity.  The proposers will build on their existing track-record and relationships with education and public outreach entities to disseminate their work to the general public, by creating publicly-available material for undergraduate textbooks and course material, and museum exhibits, participating in documentaries, and giving public talks, planetarium shows, and elementary-school classroom presentations.  This group will also continue to directly train and mentor undergraduate and graduate students, with a special emphasis placed on recruiting students from underrepresented groups.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will use the upgraded laser on the Keck Adaptive Optics system as well as the new grating in OSIRIS to: (1) Investigate black hole accretion physics by capturing the anticipated encounter of G2 - a putative gas cloud - with the Galaxy's SMBH as it goes through its closest approach; (2) Capture the closest approach of S0-2 in 2018 with sufficient precision to test predictions of General Relativity in an unexplored regime (100 times closer to a black hole and on a mass scale that is 400,000 times larger than any previous test) and to measure the distance to the Galactic Center with better than 1% precision; (3) Construct a comprehensive picture of the star formation and dynamical history of the nuclear star cluster.</AbstractNarration>

By monitoring the orbits of stars around the supermassive black hole, several leaps in the understanding of this extreme environment have been made. By utilizing more than two decades of data and observations in 2018, the group was able to test predictions from Einstein's Theory of General Relativity using the orbit of the star S0-2. Until S0-2's closest approach in 2018, no direct test of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity had ever been done near a supermassive black hole. This test demonstrates that these orbits can be used as a new probe of gravity around a supermassive black hole and opens a new era of study at the Galactic center. The group has also continued their study of the unique properties of stars in this region, including searches for binary stars, which may hold the key to understanding the long-term dynamical processes that take place around supermassive black holes as well as gravitational wave sources as seen by LIGO. In addition, studies of accretion physics were made using observations of the near-infrared emission from gas falling into the supermassive black hole. By compiling an unprecedented dataset consisting of over 90,000 individual measurements from both space and ground-based telescopes, the most complete picture to date of the time variable nature of the supermassive black hole has been developed. Altogether these measurements are driving progress in our understanding of how supermassive black holes grow and how they regulate evolution of their host galaxies.</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/30/2018<br>      Modified by: Andrea&nbsp;M&nbsp;Ghez</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1412615/1412615_10340917_1546208284900_plot_central_image_2018_hires--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1412615/1412615_10340917_1546208284900_plot_central_image_2018_hires--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Stars Orbiting the Supermassive Blackhole at the Galactic Center"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1412615/1412615_10340917_1546208284900_plot_central_image_2018_hires--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Stars Orbiting the Supermassive Blackhole at the Galactic Center"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A 2.2 micron image of the stellar orbits in the central 0.5 arcsec.
