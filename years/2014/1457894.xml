<AbstractNarration>Shifts in natural disturbance regimes can radically change communities at regional scales and consequently impact ecosystem functions and processes.  This doctoral dissertation research project will investigate the impact of broad-scale ecological disturbances on the avian community in sub-alpine conifer forests. The doctoral student will use Bayesian modeling methods to evaluate the community-level impacts of logging treatments and bark beetle epidemics on the common avifauna guilds.  The research will quantitatively predict the effects of logging and beetle outbreaks on both future forest dynamics and ecosystem services, including avian diversity.  It will provide new perspectives regarding bark beetle-wildlife relationships for aiding ecologists in determining the effects of a warming climate on broad-scale forest disturbance dynamics.  The study has important implications for forest and natural resources government and non-government agencies because it will provide insights regarding alternative approaches for improving forest resiliency and conservation.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The doctoral student will use observational and modeling approaches to understand the ecological consequences of landscape-altering beetle disturbances.  The study will be conducted at four sites in the spruce-fir forests of Colorado's San Juan Mountains.  Using remote sensing derived products, in-situ data, and Bayesian modeling methods, the student will seek to answer two core sets of questions:  (a) How do spruce beetle outbreaks impact avian community composition and abundance, and what forest structure variables are associated with increased diversity?  (2) How does avian diversity change as a function of specific forest structure variables in forests that are logged to mitigate spruce beetle infestations?  Project results will enhance understanding of disturbance-wildlife relationships and their effects on broad-scale forest disturbance dynamics, thereby helping to preserve future biodiversity more effectively.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Spruce-fir forests are an important subalpine ecosystem in the western U.S., and many species depend on this habitat type.  Changes in forest structure and composition resulting from outbreaks may disrupt other species? communities by altering resource availability, having important implications for biodiversity and specifically avian diversity. Our study evaluated the influence of broad-scale regional changes caused by spruce beetle outbreaks on avian species. Because controlled experiments on regional insect outbreaks are not possible, we performed an observational study to understand the ecological consequences of landscape-altering beetle disturbances.      We quantified relationships between bird occupancy patterns and forest structure characteristics within spruce-fir forests of southern Colorado that had been logged and infested by bark beetles. Data collection occurred over the course of four summers (2013-2016) to assess the overall diversity and abundance of bird species present within subalpine spruce&shy;fir forest stands that had been selectively logged, unlogged, or bark beetle&shy;infested. We used multi-species and single-species occupancy modeling to determine which forest structure characteristics were related to occupancy of breeding birds. Taken together, results showed that selective logging activities in spruce-fir forests that took place &gt; 20 years prior to our study did not affect avian species richness.  Presence of American three-toed Woodpeckers at both broad and fine scales was strongly related to the presence of beetle-infested trees.  Our findings suggest regional variation in American three-toed Woodpecker associations with infestations of spruce beetles and mountain pine beetles, and provide evidence of habitat specialization in the southern Rockies and a tendency toward relative habitat generalization in the northern Rockies.  As the primary cavity excavator in spruce-fir forests, conservation of American three-toed Woodpeckers may stimulate an umbrella effect by protecting other cavity nester?s habitat in subalpine forests of Colorado.  More importantly, spruce-fir forests are extensively managed for resource output and to maximize resistance to ecological disturbances such as fire and bark beetle outbreaks.  Because logging initiatives will continue, we argue that selective thinning activities in forests unaffected by spruce beetles should not harm avian species richness in the long term.  However, thinning treatments in stands infested by spruce beetles should be done conservatively to protect food and nesting resources for cavity nesting species known to breed in our study region. We suggest managers consider these results when planning logging activities aimed at spruce beetle mitigation.            Last Modified: 01/26/2018       Submitted by: Julia J Hicks]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
