<AbstractNarration>Under the guidance of Dr. E. Charles Adams, Saul Hedquist will examine the social uses of turquoise and other blue-green minerals in the late prehispanic Western Pueblo region of the U.S. Southwest. Scholars have long recognized the importance of turquoise among past and present Pueblo groups. Despite knowledge of its long-lasting social and symbolic importance, however, late prehispanic patterns of turquoise use remain poorly understood. This research seeks to address this deficiency and illuminate associated identity structures through an interdisciplinary investigation of provenance, style, and deposition. The project incorporates archaeology, geochemistry, and ethnography in an effort to address a central research question: How did the circulation and use of turquoise vary throughout the late prehispanic Western Pueblo region, and what are the implications for understanding interactions and identity expressions within and among newly aggregated settlements and settlement clusters? The research gains fundamental importance for the insight it will provide on how societies at a "simple" level of social compxity are organized. In this case the specific issue is: how do multiple groups, often speaking different languages and with different sets of customs and beliefs become integrated into effectively functioning social units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes three primary components. First, a comprehensive geographic information systems (GIS) database of previously documented late prehispanic turquoise occurrences will be developed to examine: 1) the regional variety and distribution of stylistic traits; 2) the regional variety and distribution of documented depositional patterns; and 3) contextual associations between turquoise and other materials. Second, regional patterns of acquisition and exchange will be explored using measurements of lead and strontium isotopes. Recent pilot studies indicate turquoise from at least three geologic locales circulated throughout the Western Pueblo world during the late prehispanic period. Additional isotopic measurements will be used to clarify the regional spread of turquoise from these (and perhaps other) sources and expose potential networks of interaction. Third, consultation with Hopi and Zuni tribal members will aid interpretations of archaeological patterns and ensure Pueblo knowledge is accurately represented in scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will foster collaboration with descendent communities by directly incorporating Hopi and Zuni participation and perspectives. In addition, through exclusive use of existing museum collections, the project promotes research with minimal impact on the archaeological record. The project's database will integrate archival data spanning more than a century's worth of fieldwork. These data will be made available to qualified individuals through the Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR). Research results will be further disseminated through public talks, conference presentations, presentations to tribal members, and peer-reviewed publications. Displays and web-based modules will also be prepared for use in museums and K-12 curricula.</AbstractNarration>
