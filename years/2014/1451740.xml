<AbstractNarration>Bacteria play critical roles in many environmental processes, in human health and disease, and in biotechnology. It is important, therefore, to understand the processes by which bacteria change over time, and to measure the rates of change in their genes and ecological functions. Reseachers at Michigan State University will study evolutionary changes in replicate experimental populations of the bacteria species Escherichia coli, as they evolve in a controlled laboratory environment for thousands of bacterial generations. To measure adaptation, the researchers place the bacteria from later generations in competition with the ancestral strain, which is stored frozen and revived for these experiments. To quantify genetic evolution, the researchers will sequence the genomes of bacteria from many time points and compare them to the ancestor's DNA sequence. These analyses will provide unique information about the rates, mechanisms, effects, and predictability of bacterial evolution. The knowledge gained will benefit both science and society because bacteria are key players in the environment, health, and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This experiment provides a unique study of bacterial evolution by generating exceptionally long time-series of samples from 12 replicate populations, all founded from the same strain of E. coli and maintained in identical environments. The research team will propagate the populations by transferring them every day into fresh medium; every 500 generations, samples are stored frozen, where they remain viable. Over the next decade, the experiment will surpass 85,000 generations. The frozen samples will be used to analyze the dynamics of adaptation by natural selection, the coupling of phenotypic and genetic evolution, and the repeatability of evolutionary changes. Research questions to be addressed include: Will the fitness of the evolving bacteria relative to their ancestor continue to increase indefinitely? Do the trajectories for relative fitness and genomic evolution have similar curvatures, or are they discordant? How repeatable are fitness gains and genomic changes across replicate populations? The biological samples and datasets generated in this project will be shared with the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Bacteria can replicate themselves quickly and reach large population sizes.  As a result, they can change and adapt on a time scale that can be observed and measured.  PI Richard Lenski and his team at Michigan State University have watched and studied 12 populations of E. coli bacteria as they evolve in a controlled laboratory environment. This long-term evolution experiment has now been running for over 30 years and more than 70,000 bacterial generations.  The project has addressed three overarching questions:  (1) Can one observe the process of adaptation by natural selection?  Can one model and even predict the dynamics of evolution? (2) How quickly do bacterial genomes change?  How tightly coupled are the rates of genetic change and adaptation? (3) How repeatable is adaptive evolution?  Is it largely unpredictable, with particular adaptations depending on random variation and the contingent history of the lineage in which they arose? Or are adaptations broadly reproducible because natural selection finds similar solutions to the same environmental challenges?  To measure the process of adaptation by natural selection, the researchers competed bacteria from different generations.  Fitness, as measured by bacterial growth during the competition assays, has continued to increase throughout the experiment.  Although the rate of improvement has slowed over time, the bacteria's growth has not reached an upper limit, even after 70,000 generations in a constant environment.  The populations are propagated in a medium that includes two potential sources of energy for the bacteria, glucose and citrate. Typical E. coli cells readily consume glucose, but not citrate. The 12 populations have improved their growth on glucose to a similar degree.  However, only one population evolved the ability to consume the citrate in the medium, allowing it to increase in number relative to all the others. Even so, this citrate-consuming lineage struggles to use citrate efficiently, with many cells dying even as they reach higher numbers.  To understand genetic evolution, hundreds of genomes were sequenced from the different populations and generations, and then compared to the ancestral strain's genome. These sequences revealed extensive parallelism - that is, repeatability - at the level of genes, but not the individual mutations in those genes. This parallelism implies that a dozen or more genes experienced selection that altered their functionality, leading to increased competitive fitness of the bacteria in the laboratory environment.  Over a thousand whole-population samples were also sequenced and analyzed. These data show the extent of genetic diversity that was present in the evolving populations over time, including some cases in which two lineages stably coexisted for thousands of generations.  This experiment provides an exciting and unusual opportunity to observe and quantify the process of evolution.  Bacteria are important in many respects: as essential players in ecosystem processes, as agents of disease in humans and other species, and as workhorses in biotechnology.  Acquiring new knowledge and deeper understanding of the rates, mechanisms, and outcomes of bacterial evolution has important implications and potential applications for science and society.   This long-term project has provided biological samples that have been used in research by a diverse team of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral scientists.  Many of these participants have gone on to productive careers in science and medicine, thereby contributing to the nation's scientific workforce.  Also, findings from this project have been reported by journalists and authors, thus helping to increase the public's engagement with and understanding of science.
