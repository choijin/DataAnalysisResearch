<AbstractNarration>The intellectual merit of this research project is broad. Dust reduces the light from galaxies, sends out its own light, and plays an important role in the thermo-, chemo-, and fluid-dynamics of the matter between the star systems in a galaxy, and in the formation of planets and stars. An improved understanding of the physical properties of interstellar dust grains will have implications for studies of diverse astrophysical phenomena, from formation of stars and planets to the material near active galactic nuclei.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our knowledge of interstellar dust derives primarily from remote observations of absorption, scattering, and emission of electromagnetic radiation by dust grains. The scattering and absorption properties of dust grains are needed to interpret observations, and to test dust models. In addition, scattering and absorption of light exerts forces and torques on dust grains, with important dynamical consequences. Dr. Bruce Draine and his research team will carry out a number of investigations concerning the optical properties of interstellar dust, and development of improved tools for calculating the optical properties of small particles with irregular geometries. These tools will be used to find new state-of-the-art models (composition, shape, and size distribution) for interstellar dust that are consistent with observational constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial objective is to create a "library" of calculated cross sections for scattering and absorption over a broad range of wavelengths, for selected grain sizes, shapes, and compositions. Grain geometries will include spheroids, fluffy grains built up from random coagulation of spheres, and grains that are irregular but compact. State-of-the-art codes will be employed. The discrete dipole approximation (DDA) will be used for irregular grain geometries. Accurate calculations of absorption and differential scattering cross sections at X-ray energies will be carried out using a new code applying anomalous diffraction theory to general geometries. This code will be documented and made publicly-available (open source) on the WWW. Dr. Draine will continue to develop and support the open-source code DDSCAT for calculations using the DDA. The cross-section library will be made available on the WWW. For each grain, the team will calculate the temperature distribution function for various heating radiation fields; the library of temperature distribution functions will also be made available on the WWW. These will be valuable community resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The calculated cross-sections and temperature distribution functions will be used to construct the best-to-date interstellar dust models with size distributions adjusted to reproduce observations of wavelength-dependent extinction, wavelength-dependent polarization of starlight, polarized infrared emission, and X-ray scattering. Models will be built with different grain shapes, including compact grains and fluffy grains. Interstellar grains may include magnetic material. The team will continue study of the intensity and polarization of the magnetic dipole radiation emitted by such grains. This magnetic dipole radiation may be important at mm and cm wavelengths, contributing a new polarized component to the "galactic foreground", affecting studies of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work has broad interdisciplinary impact. Improved methods for calculating scattering and absorption by nanostructures have wide applicability, beyond astrophysics. The optics of small particles is important in many scientific fields, including atmospheric science, oceanography, planetary science, combustion science, marine biology, and nanoparticle studies. DDSCAT has already been applied by users in all of these areas. The DDSCAT package will continue to be supported by Dr. Draine and made publicly available via the WWW. The research program includes a graduate student component, and undergraduate participation is planned. The proposed research will thereby contribute to training future scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Interstellar dust is recognized as an important component of galaxies. Unfortunately, we do not have representative samples of interstellar dust grains that we can study in the laboratory -- therefore we must rely on theoretical modeling to interpret observational data that tell us about interstellar dust.  The research project, "Interstellar Dust: Optics and Models", has been dedicated toward improving our understanding of the scattering, absorption, and emission of light by the dust in interstellar space.  Most of what we know about interstellar dust grains is deduced from observations of the absorption and scattering of starlight by the dust, and in recent years by carefully studying the polarized emission of thermal radiation at sub-mm wavelengths by the dust grains.   Infrared spectra from space (ISO and Spitzer Space Telescope) constrain the composition of the dust. The strong silicate absorption feature at 9.7 micron tells us about the silicate component.  Nondetection of other absorption features in the infrared places a strong upper limit on the amount of H2O ice present -- H2O ice accounts for little (if any) of the dust material in the diffuse interstellar medium.  Most of the silicon and magnesium, and some of the iron, is in the form of amorphous silicate material with a composition intermediate between pyroxene and olivine.  The sightline to the hyperluminous star Cygnus OB2-12, using archival data from ISO and Spitzer Space Telescope.  For this star we were able to measure the extinction curve out to 35 microns.  The measured extinction joins smoothly to the inferred wavelength-dependent absorption at longer wavelengths.  These results were published in two papers: Poteet, Whittet &amp; Draine (2015; Astrophysical J. 801:110) and Hensley &amp; Draine (2020; Astrophysical J. 895:38).  Observed infrared emission allows us to estimate both the amount of dust and the intensity of starlight heating the dust in other galaxies.  Hunt, Draine, et al 2015 (Astr. &amp; Astrophys. 571, A33) compared different techniques for modeling the far-infrared emission measured by the Spitzer and Herschel space observatories.  Aniano, Draine, et al (2020; Astrophys. J. 889:150) created resolved maps of dust surface density and other parameters for a 60 galaxy sample.  Hoffman &amp; Draine (2015; ApJ 817:139) developed and implemented a new technique for calculating absorption and scattering of X-rays by interstellar grains with arbitrary geometries.  These methods will be useful in future studies interpreting the observed X-ray scattering by interstellar dust.  Interstellar dust includes a population of rapidly-spinning nanoparticles, spinning with rotational frequencies up to and exceeding 30 GHz. These nanoparticles generate microwave radiation that, while faint, can confuse observations of the cosmic background radiation.  Because this microwave emission had not been expected, it is referred to as the "anomalous microwave emission" (AME).  This grant supported research on several aspects of the anomalous microwave emission.  Hensley, Draine, &amp; Meisner (2016; ApJ 827:45) found a surprising result: there appears to be no evidence connecting the AME to the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-based nanoparticles that are responsible for strong infrared emission features.  One important question is whether these nanoparticles can be aligned by the Galactic magnetic field; Draine &amp; Hensley (2016; ApJ 831:59) argued that the grains cannot be aligned, predicting that the AME will be essentially unpolarized.  Another paper (Hensley &amp; Draine 2017; ApJ 836:179) demonstrated that the AME could be produced by silicate-based nanoparticles, which would explain the lack of correlation with the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission.  Draine &amp; Miralda-Escude (2018; ApJL 858:L10) showed that absorption by spinning dust in our Galaxy, or even in the Earth's atmosphere, could potentially confuse observations of 21 cm emission from hydrogen at high redshifts, z ~ 20.  This is a novel effect that had not been considered previously.  Work has been proceeding on development of a new model for interstellar dust.  A first step has been to determine the optical properties of grain material that is consistent with the observaitional constraints.  A paper has been submitted to the Astrophysical Journal (Draine &amp; Hensley 2020; arXiv:2009.11314) concerning the dielectric function, with predictions for the polarization in the important silicate absorption feature at 10 micron, and for the polarization in the hydrocarbon absorption feature at 3.4 micron.  The intellectual merit of this overall research program is that it is advancing our understanding of the nature of interstellar dust, which plays a critical role in many processes.  This has broad impact, ranging from the physics of nanoparticles to understanding the evolution of galaxies and formation of stars and planets in clouds of dust and gas.
