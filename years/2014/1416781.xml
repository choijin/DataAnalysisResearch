<AbstractNarration>Comprehending how ecosystems function is important knowledge for citizens in making decisions and for students who aspire to become scientists. This understanding requires deep thinking about complex causality, unintended side-effects, and the strengths and limitations of experimental science. These are difficult concepts to learn due to the many interacting components and non-linear interrelationships involved. Ecosystems dynamics is particularly difficult to teach in classrooms because ecosystems involve complexities such as phenomena distributed widely across space that change over long time frames. Learning when and how experimental science can provide useful information in understanding ecosystems dynamics requires moving beyond the limited affordances of classrooms. The project will: 1) advance understanding of experimentation in ecosystems as it can be applied to education; 2) show how student learning is affected by having opportunities to experiment in the virtual world that simulate what scientists do in the real world and with models; and 3) produce results comparing this form of teaching to earlier instructional approaches. This project will result in a learning environment that will support learning about the complexities of the earth's ecosystem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will build upon a computer world called EcoMUVE, a Multi-User Virtual Environment or MUVE, developed as part of an earlier NSF-funded project. A MUVE is a simulated world in which students can virtually walk around, make observations, talk to others, and collect data. EcoMUVE simulates a pond and a forest ecosystem. It offers an immersive context that makes it possible to teach about ecosystems in the classroom, allowing exploration of the complexities of large scale problems, extended time frames and and multiple causality. To more fully understand how ecosystems work, students need the opportunity to experiment and to observe what happens.  This project will advance this earlier work by developing ways for students to conduct experiments within the virtual world and to see the results of those experiments. The project will work with ecosystem scientists to study the types of experiments that they conduct, informing knowledge in education about how ecosystem scientists think, and will build opportunities for students that mirror what scientists do. The project will develop a modified virtual world and accompanying curriculum for middle school students to help them learn to more deeply understand ecosystems patterns and the strengths and limitations of experimentation in ecosystems science. The resulting program will be tested against existing practice, the EcoMUVE program alone, and other programs that teach aspects of ecosystems dynamics to help teachers know how to best use these curricula in the classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Helping students to understand how ecosystems work is challenging. Ecosystems dynamics occur over broad spatial and temporal scales that are not conducive to classroom learning. They involve many variables that are not directly visible or are not obvious--eluding students' attention. Further, students often have little information about the ways that scientists figure out what is going on in ecosystems, the assumptions that they make about the nature of causal evidence, and their modes of investigation. Yet, knowing how ecosystems work and how that knowledge is generated is essential to a full understanding of biology, life sciences, and sustainability.</p> <p>This award resulted in the development and study of a technology-based, three-week curriculum for middle school students called EcoXPT. It includes an immersive computer simulation of a pond ecosystem that students can move around in and explore. (See attached figures.) As they move around, they discover an environmental puzzle that they then attempt to explain. The simulation includes virtual tools to help students to study and learn about the ecosystem. For instance, they can take measurements of water quality, gather information about the organisms that live there, and move around in time and space to see what is happening in the ecosystem on different days and at different locations. Students collect data, graph their findings, and learn from a variety of representations that help them to reason about variables, visible or not, in the world.</p> <p>Developed based on an earlier simulation called EcoMUVE, the EcoXPT simulation has a larger, more complex virtual world. It added authentic forms of experimentation and virtual scientists who guide students in the modes of investigation that ecosystems scientists use, both in the lab and out in the world. It added an on-line concept map for students to make claims, collect evidence, and offer reasoning in support of their claims as they develop explanations. In addition to the computer simulation, the full curriculum includes lesson plans, PowerPoints, a set of six Thinking Moves that are aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) with supporting videos, and an extensive teachers' guide. Two sets of workshop sessions with accompanying materials, an introductory set and a set to help teachers support students in developing strong evidence-based claims, were also developed.</p> <p>A study of how ecosystems scientists conduct their work was carried out to inform the process of developing EcoXPT and was subsequently published. In addition, a study of how teachers understand experimental methods in ecosystems science was conducted; it underscored the need for the EcoXPT curriculum and teacher materials, supporting the intellectual merit of the endeavor.&nbsp;</p> <p>Studies of EcoXPT in the classroom revealed the following findings. In a study contrasting the performance of students using EcoXPT with the experimental tools that ecosystems scientists use to that of students using a version omitting the experimental tools, both groups made significant gains in understanding ecosystems content, dynamics across space and time, causality, experimental methods, and attitudes towards science. However, those with the experimental tools demonstrated significantly greater understanding of experimental methods and the differences between correlation and causation. Tested against a paper-based curriculum focused on a similar ecological puzzle, EcoXPT students made significant gains in attitudes towards science, experimental methods, and causality, while students using the paper-based version made gains only in attitudes towards science. Case studies contrasting EcoXPT to other technology-based programs suggested that EcoXPT is especially helpful in supporting students' understanding of the complex dynamics of ecosystems. A case study testing a focus on developing a strong body of evidence for explanations found that students initially made fewer connections, but included deep and varied support for each connection that they made. The work also resulted in new methodologies for coding how well teachers implement inquiry-based learning curriculum; this should benefit other researchers. EcoXPT has already positively impacted the learning of over 2,000 students and the practice of 20 teachers who participated in the development and testing phases of the work. EcoXPT is available for free download and use by classrooms around the world at this link: <a href="https://ecolearn.gse.harvard.edu/projects/ecoxpt">https://ecolearn.gse.harvard.edu/projects/ecoxpt</a></p> <p>The outcomes of these studies inform considerations in the research literature on the role of intervention in understanding causality in ecosystems science and inform an understanding of how discussion of bodies of evidence and the ways that scientists think about certainty and uncertainty can be helpful to middle school students. The products and findings of this work should broadly benefit society in helping students to have integrated, authentic experiences in planning and carrying out investigations; analyzing and interpreting data; asking questions and defining problems; developing and using models; obtaining, evaluating and communicating information; and constructing explanations and designing solutions as called for in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/30/2020<br>      Modified by: Tina&nbsp;A&nbsp;Grotzer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416781/1416781_10308518_1591370866162_EcoXPTImage1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416781/1416781_10308518_1591370866162_EcoXPTImage1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Screenshot of EcoXPT world"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416781/1416781_10308518_1591370866162_EcoXPTImage1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Screenshot of EcoXPT world"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1.
