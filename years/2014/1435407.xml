<AbstractNarration>This study is motivated on the observation that ocean mixed layer fronts are common features throughout the world ocean and are currently ignored in boundary layer representations. Circulations associated with frontal instabilities are capable of transporting material from the surface into the ocean interior and are likely a key element in the ocean general circulation. This research will yield quantitative estimates of these transport processes that can be used to improve parameterizations for ocean models used in climate studies. Participation by a graduate student for the duration of the project is planned and results will be published in recognized peer-reviewed journals. Elements of this investigation will be incorporated into Oregon State University graduate curriculum as well as in public learning efforts through a summer internship program involving high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on the properties and dynamics of coherent structures in the turbulent ocean boundary layer and on the conditions that support their development. This work will extend and complement previous studies that have examined or invoked Langmuir or symmetric instability processes to explain ocean boundary layer observations. It is hypothesized that the coherent, large-eddy structures observed in preliminary large-eddy simulation numerical experiments may be best understood as non-symmetric linear instabilities of a basic state that incorporates surface stress and buoyancy flux modification of a geostrophically balanced, horizontal density gradient. The first goal of this work will be specifically to address this hypothesis. The second, broader goal is, with the results of the first part as context, to use the large-eddy simulation to explore and characterize the dependence of ocean boundary layer turbulent processes, including especially the vertical fluxes and mixing associated with coherent structures, on the strength and character of mean horizontal gradients. A range of large-eddy simulations will be conducted to assess the relative influence of frontal gradients and surface forcing on coherent structure development and characteristics. Specific forcing parameters examined will include surface stress and buoyancy (heat) flux, surface waves (Langmuir circulation), and frontal (horizontal density or temperature gradient) strength, including where appropriate the derived Ekman buoyancy flux as a scaling parameter. The numerical simulations will be complemented by theoretical studies in the form of linear stability analysis for a generalized basic state that will provide a conceptual and quantitative framework for characterization of instabilities in the ocean boundary layer.  Specific objectives include: 1) Development of a generalized linear instability theory for comparison with large-eddy simulations and testing of the initial hypothesis; 2) Characterization of the dependence of turbulent structures and flux scaling regimes on the imposed surface fluxes and mean horizontal gradient, using large-eddy simulations; 3) Physical interpretation and rationalization of the large-eddy simulation regimes in terms of the results of the generalized linear instability theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ocean fronts have taken the center stage in recent research on small-scale mixing and transport in the ocean.  Fronts are often regions where material at the surface is transported to the deep ocean, enhancing both fluxes of heat, salt, and ocean nutrients.  Here we examine fronts using a turbulence resolving model to better understand the interaction between baroclinicity and surface fluxes in generating both vertical transport and horizontal spreading of fronts.  Both surface cooling and surface wind stress are considered.  In general, without wind stress we find that frontal instabilities follow a lifecycle beginning with 200-300 m lateral scale coherent roll structures that are aligned with the front.  With weak surface cooling and no wind, the alignment is nearly perfect, yielding results that are equivalent to symmetric instability cases.  Over time, the symmetric modes transform into baroclinic modes with an off-axis orientation, referred to as baroclinic mixed modes.  After ~48 hours, traditional baroclinic instability develops along the front and dominates the overall circulation.   We find that the action of surface buoyancy flux and wind forcing disrupt the geostrophic balance that is produced by density fronts.  This imbalance causes an inertial oscillation that persists until traditional baroclinic instability dominates the flow field.  Overall, our study determined that frontal instabilities are relatively short-lived, less that 2-3 days, but can have a significant impact on the vertical transport of water into the ocean interior.  These results suggest that for small fronts, parameterization of frontal instabilities is probably not essential for global scale ocean models.  However, persistent frontal features, such as the Gulf Stream wall, could generate instabilities that persist and may require changes to exisiting subgrid scale mixing models.
