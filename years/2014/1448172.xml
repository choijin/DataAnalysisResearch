<AbstractNarration>The objective of the proposed workshop is to provide a forum for disseminating information and sharing ideas about the frontiers of Food Safety research, education, and technology transfer. The workshop will discuss the current state-of-the-art and future potential of Food Safety Technology, analyze the gaps between the future potential and the present reality, and identify what needs to be done in the areas of research, education, and technology transfer in order to close the gaps. This workshop will be a two-day event on October 29-30, 2014 in Alexandria, Virginia. The workshop will cover four themes: 1) Processes, 2). Global Trends, 3). Packaging, and 4). Supply Network Risk Management. Each speaker, who is an expert on the presentation topic, will introduce the state-of-the-art of a specific topic area as well as present his/her views on the future directions and needs in that area. This workshop will have up to 75 participants, including the speakers and moderators to be invited and other stakeholders from academia, industry, and government. The ideas presented by the speakers and generated from the discussion sessions will be summarized in the final project report. This report will be delivered to all workshop participants and relevant funding agencies as well as disseminated widely to industry, government, and academic stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>

The final project report was delivered to all workshop participants and relevant funding agencies as well as disseminated widely to industry, government, and academic stakeholders.    Background  Food safety combines a number of scientific disciplines fundamental to the handling, preparation, transportation, and storage of food ingredients and final products in ways that prevent foodborne illness. This includes understanding the risks about the sources and origins of food products, processing and packaging of food products, and the practices relating to import and export inspection and certification systems for foods.  Food safety is a multifaceted issue and made even more complex in todayÆs global economy.  According to recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration figures, imports account for 80 percent of the seafood, 50 percent of fresh fruit, and 20 percent of fresh vegetables that we eat each year. While the benefit to the consumer is being able to enjoy a wide variety of foods all year round, there are challenges to consistently maintain a high degree of food safety.  Hundreds of thousands of growers and processors worldwide are producing food for the United States and other markets. They use increasingly diverse and complicated processes, and manage complex and extended supply chain networks with millions of daily decisions that affect food safety. Many of these decisions are being made within countries that historically have had no effective health and regulatory systems in place for food safety and public health.  The private sector has stepped in to fill some of the gaps especially in training and educating the work force in emerging countries. That has helped to partially reduce risks to food safety and preventable foodborne illnesses. However, more work is needed to develop competencies and capacity building in food safety before there is uniformity in health protection practices and harmonized standards worldwide. The private sector is also challenged by the risk posed from a diversity of suppliers within supply chain networks.  The global scale, exponential growth and complexity of the food system makes it impossible for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and other regulatory bodies to employ historic approaches to food safety and still provide the assurances needed to maintain a high level of consumer confidence in the safety of food coming from global supply sources. Regulatory agencies and the private sector worldwide are transforming to a paradigm where food is produced in a global market with diverse risks. That has led regulatory counterparts becoming stakeholders with the private sector to jointly focus on achieving a common goal of safe food for consumers everywhere.
