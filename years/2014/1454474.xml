<AbstractNarration>Today's automobiles are increasingly autonomous.  The latest Mercedes S-class sedan applies corrective action when its driver strays out of lane or tailgates too closely.  Semi-autonomy will soon yield to full autonomy. Nissan has promised a line of self-driving cars by 2020.  Maritime craft are likewise moving from rudimentary autopilots to full autonomy, and autonomous aerial vehicles will doubtless play a significant role in the future economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current versions of these vehicles are cocooned in an array of sensors, but neither the sensors nor the timing, navigation, and collision avoidance algorithms they feed have been designed for security against malicious attacks.  Radar and acoustic sensors transmit predictable, uncoded signals; vehicle-to-vehicle communication protocols are either unauthenticated or critically dependent on insecure civil GPS signals (or both); and vehicle state estimators are designed for robustness but not security.  These vulnerabilities are not merely conceptual: GPS spoofing attacks have been demonstrated against a drone and an ocean vessel, causing the drone to crash and the vessel to veer off course; likewise, it appears possible to cause road accidents by fooling a car's radar sensor into thinking a crash is imminent, thus triggering automatic braking.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding to fix these vulnerabilities by developing sensors and high-level decision-making algorithms that are hardened against such so-called field attacks.  The goal of secure control systems is to survive and operate safely despite sensor measurements or control commands being compromised.  This proposal focuses on an emergent category of cyber-physical attack that has seen little scrutiny in the secure control literature.  Like cyber attacks, these attacks are hard to detect and can be executed from a distance, but unlike cyber attacks, they are effective even against control systems whose software, data, and communications networks are secure, and so can be considered a more menacing long-term threat.  These are attacks on the physical fields such as electromagnetic, magnetic, acoustic, etc. measured by system sensors. As specialized sensor attacks, field attacks seek to compromise a system's perception of reality non-invasively from without, not from within. We emphasize field attacks against navigation, collision avoidance, and synchronization sensors, as these are of special importance to the rise of autonomous vehicles and the smart grid. This proposal's goal is to develop a coherent analytical foundation for secure perception in the presence of field attacks and to develop a suite of algorithms and tools to detect such attacks.  A key insight behind this proposal's approach is that the physics of field attacks impose fundamental difficulties on the attacker that can be exploited and magnified to enable attack detection.  This work will progressively build security into navigation, collision avoidance, and timing perception from the physical sensory layer to the top-level state estimation algorithms. The outcome of this work will be smarter, more skeptical sensor systems for autonomous vehicles and other autonomous systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project "CAREER: Secure Perception for Autonomous Systems" proposed to develop a coherent analytical foundation for secure perception in the presence of sensor attacks -- especially against timing, collision avoidance, and positioning sensors -- and to develop a suite of algorithms and tools to detect such attacks.  It seeks to develop systems that are both secure in the faceof deliberate attack and robust in the face of accidental or natural faults or failures.  The project ran from 2015 to 2020.  It produced 11 archival journal papers, two book chapters, 9 conference papers, and supported two Ph.D. dissertations.  As regards intellectual merit, the project achieved five major accomplishments:  (1) Techniques and a demonstration system for robust and secure cm-accurate positioning in deep urban environments. (2) A global survey of GPS/GNSS interference using a science instrument on the International Space Station. (3) A fundamental theory of secure time synchronization. (4) Characterization and analysis of a wide range of sensor attacks, and development and performance assessment of defenses against these. (5) A new technique for provably high-integrity integer ambiguity resolution for safety-of-life precise positioning  The focus of the project's education plan was the creation and refinement of a new undergraduate course in Aerial Robotics at The University of Texas at Austin.  A video summary of the course may be found at this link: https://goo.gl/1K1KtH  The project achieved substantial broader impacts.  Participants made a concerted effort to reach the public though articles and experiments reported in the scientific and popular press.  The most comprehensive popular reporting was done in August 2020 when the NewYorker published a long-form article on Dr. Humphreys's work over the past decade, much of which was supported by the NSF CAREER award:  https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-vulnerable-is-gps  Besides this, the project made other substantial efforts at outreach: * Dr. Humphreys collaborated with a Washington think-tank called C4ADS to publish a major  report on Russian GNSS interference activities.  The report, titled "Above Us Only Stars," was covered by many news  outlets, including CBS News, Foreign Policy, and even by Trevor Noah on the  Daily Show. * The Times of Israel published a story based on an interview with Dr. Humphreys in which he explained why the Ben Gurion airport was experiencing GNSS interference  problems.  The story was also covered in Popular Mechanics. * Paul Tullis from Scientific American wrote an extensive article on GNSS  security problems, based on several interviews with Dr. Humphreys. * MIT Technology Review wrote an article based on several  interviews with Dr. Humphreys on so called "GNSS crop circles" in China. * The cover story of the January issue of InsideGNSS Magazine is an article on detecting GNSS interference from space that Dr. Humphreys and his students wrote. * Fortune Magazine published an article in January 2020 based on extensive  interviews with Dr. Humphreys. * Dr. Humphreys and his postdoc Peter Iannucci and I gave two presentations to the National Advisory Board for  Space-Based Navigation and Timing in 2019 * Publications and datasets: The Radionavigation Laboratory website offers  public access to (1) all papers produced under this project, (2) dozens of  explanatory videos produced under the project, and (3) public datasets.  The  TEX-CUP urban sensor benchmark dataset, developed under the project, and The  Texas Spoofing Test Battery (TEXBAT) dataset, together with the RNL Multipath  and Interference Recordings dataset, have been the basis for our testing  algorithms developed during the project, have been used by many different  research groups around the world, in academia, industry, and government.
