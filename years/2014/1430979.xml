<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) phase II project is in removing key manufacturing barriers that are currently hindering commercialization of semiconductor nanocrystals in diverse market segments worldwide.  The unique size- and shape-related properties of these materials make them ideal for light emission applications (including lighting and displays) and light harnessing applications (solar panels).  If successful, nanocrystals will be produced in large quantities, inexpensively, and uniformly, resulting in a disruptive advance for existing markets and emerging applications. With greater availability and affordability, nanocrystals can be more easily utilized for more energy efficient lighting and displays, improve color quality in displays (laptops, tablets, cameras and mobile devices), increase efficiency of solar panels, and penetrate more widely into advancing applications in medical research, diagnostics and treatment. Emerging applications include the use of semiconductor nanocrystals for biofuel cells, lasers, fiber optics, electronics, security and surveillance, aviation and geothermal tracers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project continues the work initiated in Phase I on development of a low cost manufacturing method for production of large-scale and consistently high-quality semiconductor nanocrystals quantum dots urgently needed for their commercialization. The proposed research activities directly address this need through an innovative proprietary low-temperature wet chemical synthesis route. Compared to the conventional high-temperature synthesis route, this method can more precisely control the size and shape of products - properties that are necessary for successful incorporation of these products into end-user applications.  Additionally, it circumvents scaling limitations of conventional high-temperature synthesis routes. In Phase I, we have successfully demonstrated scale up of high quality CdSe nanocrystal quantum dots in a laboratory scale while lowering cost of production using our method. This Phase II funding focuses on demonstrating scaled-up production of larger quantities of high-quality nanocrystals, including heavy metal free quantum dots using our low-temperature method. It will also focus on post-synthesis processing of CdSe quantum dots developed in Phase I to meet Original Equipment Manufacturers? specifications. Scale up to commercially viable amounts will be studied by developing a continuous flow model as well as by improving purification efficiency of the low temperature method.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Navillum Nanotechnologies manufactures chemical semiconductors, which encompasses semiconductor nanocrystals like quantum dots (QDs). Semiconductor nanocrystals are a new class of extremely small semiconductors that are unique in that it emits and absorbs light within a specific wavelength range depending on the particle size. QDs are a paradigm changing technology in a wide range of markets including optoelectronics (i.e. lighting and displays), solar energy, medicine, and many other market segments. With so many potential applications of QDs to choose from, our first target segment is the displays market because it provides us with already developing consumer products and the fastest growing market opportunity, rapidly developing applications and technologies, and the broadest application market for QDs.</p> <p>QDs have already penetrated the market with display products in the past 5 years, such as televisions and tablets from well-known display manufacturers. The rapidly growing market for QD-based technologies relies on the availability of a consistent supply of high quality QDs with precise dimensions resulting in narrow size distribution, bright photoluminescence (PL) emissions and reliable stability. The difficulty of producing QDs that meet customer specifications, is primarily due to the traditional kinetic-driven, high-temperature manufacturing technique that is used by current manufacturers. Traditional high temperature manufacturing methods (e.g. 200-350 &deg;C developed for cadmium selenide (CdSe) QDs, by far the most well-studied and most widely used type of QDs) is very difficult to control resulting in wider size distribution of the QDs. Further, this problem is magnified in large-scale industrial production.</p> <p>Navillum Nanotechnologies has an innovative thermodynamic driven low temperature synthesis approach that eliminates the current limitations of the traditional kinetic driven high temperature synthesis methods, illustrated in Figure 1. Our process relies on a thermodynamic-equilibrium between nanoparticle growth and nanoparticle dissolution processes which provides a high degree of control and precision over net QD growth.</p> <p>Navillum&rsquo;s SBIR Phase I project successfully demonstrated the feasibility for large-scale production of high-quality bright CdSe QDs at lower cost using our proprietary low temperature synthesis method. Our Phase II award enabled us to extend the results of our Phase I work to develop core/shell CdSe/ZnS and InP/ZnS QDs that meet the desired specifications for display applications (Figure 2). Furthermore, Navillum has developed new methods to increase the QD stability to make more robust QDs that can withstand application processing/incorporation requirements that has continually plagued QD-based application developers, especially in the optoelectronics industry. Navillum&rsquo;s Phase II project focused on <em>developing market-ready, application-compatible QDs at a scale and quality that satisfies customers&rsquo; specifications, specifically in the displays market.</em></p> <p class="BodyCxSpFirst">Furthermore, Navillum has found a niche application of QDs in the avionics display industry. Navillum has developed a night vision compatible QD film optic using the QDs developed in our Phase II studies, for use in the backlight component of avionics, head mounted displays and other display applications (Figure 3). &nbsp;QDs are superior to traditional night vision compatible optics, such as dichroic filters, which are extremely expensive and inefficient. Aside from improving the color resolution and energy efficiency of display devices, it can also help overcome limited viewing angle problems in compact displays and brightness limitations for full sun applications while emitting a broad color spectrum that is compatible with night vision applications.<sup> </sup>Our competitive advantages in the night vision niche market is (a) our ability to produce custom QD optic formulations for various vendors while our larger competitors only have a one-size-fits-all solution; (b) Navillum QDs have no "red-tailing" or emission in the longer wavelength region beyond the night vision cut-off range. &nbsp;</p> <p class="BodyCxSpMiddle">Our efforts in understanding the compatibility and stability of our QDs into the different film processing steps have led to the development of QDs incorporated in different polymer formulations such as QDs in heat-curable acrylic pre-polymer solution, in UV-curable acrylic pre-polymer solution, in self-curing urethane pre-polymer solution, and in silicone-compatible solution that are now part of Navillum&rsquo;s product line. This allows our partners to have more options in incorporating QDs into their applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p class="BodyCxSpLast">Finally, Navillum has developed the know how in producing our own QD films in different form factors. This achievement led to the development of QD instructional kits (Figure 4) that can be used as instruction materials to demonstrate many science concepts, such as colors in terms of light energy, quantum phenomena, spectrophotometry and nanotechnology, from middle school to advanced college courses. It allows simple demonstration of these concepts in a colorful manner which increases the interest of students and help advance STEM education.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/15/2018<br>      Modified by: Jacqueline&nbsp;T&nbsp;Siy-Ronquillo</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430979/1430979_10337497_1521100365546_QDfilmopticProductflow--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430979/1430979_10337497_1521100365546_QDfilmopticProductflow--rgov-800width.jpg" title="QD products and application"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1430979/1430979_10337497_1521100365546_QDfilmopticProductflow--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="QD products and application"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 3.
