<AbstractNarration>The investigators propose to use the naturally occurring isotope beryllium-7, which is produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays and has a 53.3-day half-life, as a tracer for estimating the atmospheric fluxes of a variety of trace elements to the surface of the Arctic Ocean. They have collected samples of snow, sea ice, surface waters, and atmospheric aerosols through an international collaboration concurrent with the preparation of this proposal. This project provides funding for the analysis of Be-7 and for trace elements including aluminum, manganese, iron, cupper, zinc, cadmium, and lead. The atmospheric input of numerous chemical species into the global ocean has been shown to equal or exceed that from river sources. In the Arctic, several contaminant elements in particular are dominated by atmospheric sources, with implications for the Arctic ecosystem and human health. The project will investigate several elements of interest to the international GEOTRACES program, which is currently formulating plans for coordinated Arctic work. The project will support a Ph.D. student who will incorporate these results into his dissertation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the Arctic, the atmospheric deposition of numerous species,  including contaminant elements (e.g. Hg, Pb, Se) is significant.  This  input has implications for the ecosystem, and even human health. However  measurements of deposition rates in the Arctic are rare and difficult  to execute; we simply cannot "be there" to sample flux in a routine  manner. This is further complicated by existence of different catchments  (snow/ice/meltponds/ocean) resulting in elements following circuitous  paths within the ecosystem.  We used the cosmic ray produced  radioisotope, 7Be, to trace the atmospheric deposition of elements  within the Arctic water/ice/snow system, and linked aerosol  concentrations to flux. Seawater, ice, snow, melt pond, and aerosol samples were collected during late summer 2011 as part of the German Icebreaker RV Polarstern's ARK-XXVI/3 campaign.  7Be (T1/2= 53.3d) is particularly well suited for  studying the deposition of chemical species into the Arctic as the  inventory of 7Be, as partitioned between the ice/ocean, is a direct  measure of its rate of atmospheric input to these catchments. We used the  inventory and distribution of 7Be within the water column, ice, snow,  and melt ponds to trace the partitioning and pathways of elements input  through atmospheric deposition within the Arctic system. Coupled with  the 7Be and trace element concentration of aerosols, estimates of the  atmospheric depositional flux of trace elements (TEs) were also derived.  The combination of a tracer (7Be) immune to anthropogenic contamination and the strong seasonality of regional anthropogenic aerosol contributions  provide insight not only into the amount and timing of TE deposition into the Arctic, but also into the partitioning and uptake of elements in the Arctic ecosystem, illuminating how TE deposition will change as sea ice conditions in the Arctic evolve in the future.  A PhD student, Ben Galfond (UM), an undergraduate student at FSU (Brian  Kilgore), and a post-doctoral research associate at FSU (Rachel  Shelley), were involved in various aspects of cruise preparation, cruise  participation, sampling, analysis, and data interpretation for this  project.
