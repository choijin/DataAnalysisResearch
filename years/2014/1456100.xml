<AbstractNarration>This award is for operations of R/V Sikuliaq in calendar 2014, and is year-one of a three-year cooperative agreement to the University of Alaska Fairbanks for operations of the research vessel to support peer-reviewed sea-going science. In calendar year 2014, R/V Sikuliaq will transition from construction to operations after a series of sea-trials.  Approximately 90 science/operational days will be carried out in the latter half of 2014.  R/V Sikuliaq will be operating in the Western Pacific off Hawaii and Guam, with one cruise utilizing an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) SENTRY within the Emperor Seamounts, specifically Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, and a second cruise operating a high resolution AUV to conduct a magnetic survey of the Hawaiian Jurassic Basin.  One of R/V Sikuliaq's missions will include provision of educational opportunities both for students of the marine sciences and the general public. Periodically, the University plans to hold open houses and outreach events to provide early exposure to oceanography that target Alaskan tribal nations.   Additionally, community events will include tours through the ship facility, hands-on demonstrations of on board marine science research guided by faculty, students and ships' crewmembers, or at sea real-time internet connection to classrooms with the ship's telepresence capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;R/V Sikuliaq - pronounced see-koo-leee-auk, and translated from Inupiaq as "young sea ice" - is a 261-foot ice capable research vessel designed to weather harsh conditions to help advance polar and sub-polar scientific research.  Owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by the University of Alaska Fairbanks, R/V Sikuliaq was launched in October 2012 and is outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment to bring scientists to ice-choked polar regions, able to cut through ice up to 2.5 feet thick.  In this calendar year, one of the cruises will utilize SENTRY, an AUV operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, which is equipped with a standard suite of scientific and engineering sensors. SENTRY is a flexible platform where scientists, according to their specific interests and scientific needs, can interface additional sensors. R/V Sikuliaq is well suited to support these research programs in terms of equipment and ship capabilities for AUV operations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ R/V Sikuliaq [pronounced: see-KOO-lee-auk] is a 261-foot Global-Class oceanographic research vessel capable of bringing scientists to the ice-covered waters off Alaska and other polar regions. Sikuliaq is one of the most advanced university research vessels in the world, capable of breaking ice up to 2.5 feet thick. Constructed at Marinette Marine Corporation shipyard in Marinette, Wisconsin, Sikuliaq's homeport is located at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) Seward Marine Center (SMC) in Seward, Alaska.  The vessel is owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by the UAF College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences (CFOS), as part of the U.S. academic research fleet. Sikuliaqis used by scientists in the U.S. and by the international oceanographic community through the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System(UNOLS).   With funding from the European Commission, CFOS and R/V Sikuliaq recently joined 13 partners from Europe and Canada in the international Arctic Research Icebreaker Consortium (ARICE). This collaboration supports transnational planning and implementation of Arctic research cruises.  Dating back to 1973, marine scientists in the U.S. first proposed the need for an ice-capable research vessel. After 36 years of development and consideration of multiple vessel designs, construction began on the ship in December 2009.  Glosten Associates, a marine architecture and engineering firm in Seattle, designed the vessel in 2004.  R/VSikuliaq's capabilities allow researchers to collect sediment samples directly from the seafloor, host remotely operated vehicles, use a flexible suite of winches to raise and lower scientific equipment, and conduct surveys throughout the water column and sea bottom using an extensive set of research instrumentation. The vessel design strives to have the lowest possible environmental impact, including a low underwater-radiated noise signature to facilitate marine mammal and fisheries research.Sikuliaq can accommodate up to 26 scientists, including those with physical disabilities.  Sikuliaq operations also support a Sikuliaq Science Liaison personnel to help facilitate productive interactions and communication between the ship, scientific personnel, and Alaska Native subsistence hunting organizations.  Seward Marine Center has successfully operated R/V Sikuliaq since the Cooperative Agreement between NSF and UAF was signed on August 1, 2014.  The Seward Marine Center is located on the Kenai Peninsula, at the head of Resurrection Bay, Alaska, and has the distinction of being one of the northernmost ice-free ports in Alaska. With an extensive network of railway and trucking infrastructure, Seward is well suited for staging Arctic operations.   Sikuliaq has served scientists from UAF and from institutions located across the nation and around the world.          Last Modified: 02/05/2019       Submitted by: S. Bradley Moran]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
