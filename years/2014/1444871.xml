<AbstractNarration>Cybersecurity is threatened by the zero-day exploits (software vulnerabilities that have not been previously disclosed and are therefore potential vectors for attack). The threat is serious for exploits in the hands of major cyber powers that are potentially hostile nations. Publication of a zero-day exploits can enhance the resilience of domestic cyber-infrastructure (if an adversary has discovered the same exploit), and it could give other countries the opportunity to patch their systems proactively, increasing confidence that they will not be penetrated. Communicating zero-day exploits, however, has the obvious drawback that the exploit loses value as a weapon, because countries could patch their own systems to resist it. Thus, the cost of publication is the loss of such exploits for use in deterrence and/or future offensive cyber operations. U.S. policy has recently begun to address the question of which zero-day exploits known to the government should be published, both to enhance national security and to instill confidence by others. The project analyzes various costs and benefits of publishing exploits or patches, and studies how the costs might be mitigated whether through policy or technical means. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a new collaboration, computer scientist, Stephanie Forrest, and political scientist, Robert Axelrod, are developing integrated approaches to the rapidly expanding problem of cyber conflict, combining historical analysis, technical research, strategic analysis, and computational modeling.  This project focuses on three areas where U.S.  policy could provide additional leadership in cyberspace: publication of zero-day exploits; labeling of neutral infrastructure, such as networks associated with hospitals or religious sites, and shared norms to protect neutral cyberspaces; and sustainment of Internet interoperability, which allows Internet users on different networks to communicate directly without interference. The  findings may benefit national security by giving policymakers a way of assessing the costs and benefits of publishing exploits or patches. This project injects a fresh and timely voice into debates about the cyberagenda, suggesting concrete measures for minimizing the likelihood and impacts of conflict among state actors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[         Cyber conflict is now a common and potentially dangerous occurrence. The target typically faces a strategic choice based on its technical ability to attribute the attack to a specific perpetrator and whether it has a viable punishment at its disposal. Providing simple models that highlight the important aspects of formulating a response to cyber attack can help policy makers and analysts, and possibly, it could lead to a more peaceful world.  Attribution of cyber attacks is complicated for several reasons: (1) there is often uncertainty about whether the perpetrators are acting for themselves or as agents of another entity; (2) data are easily faked, so it is challenging to guarantee the provenence of digital information required for attribution; (3) to promote deterrence, countries have an incentive to overstate their cyber capabilities, both for attacking and for attribution; (4) it is difficult to find responses that are painful but not escalatory, proportionate, and legitimate. Thus, attribution of cyber attacks involves both technical and strategic considerations.    The research developed a game-theoretic model, called the Blame Game, that incorporates both the strategic and technical elements of cyberattribution.   Numerous historical examples were studied to determine how the model applies to cases of cyber or kinetic conflict involving the United States, Russia, China, Japan, North Korea, Estonia, Irael, Iran, and Syria.    Mathematical analysis of the model showed the conditions under which it is rational to tolerate an attack and when it is better to assign blame publicly.   The analysis showed that, in many cases, it may be rational for nations to tolerate cyberattacks, even in the face of strong public criticism.  It also showed that highly unbalanced attribution capabilities between adversaries can increase the risk of conflict.   The model is general enough that it could be applied to problems outside of nation state-level conflict.  Children bullied by peers or abused by adults may need to decide whether to blame a potentially invulnerable attacker in a position of power.  Similarly, individuals may be unable to blame large corporations for wrongs if excessive costs have rendered litigation impossible and corporations invulnerable.  Thus, the model applies to a wide range of conflicts and can provides guidance to policymakers.                   Last Modified: 09/08/2017       Submitted by: Stephanie Forrest]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
