<AbstractNarration>Freedom and openness of the Internet are under threat.  Government censors in non-democratic countries are deploying network filters to block sources of uncensored information, suppress dissent, and prevent citizens from using the Internet to exercise their human rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to deliver robust censorship-resistant communication systems for today's and future Internet.  The main principle behind this research is that censorship resistance must cease being an ad-hoc, add-on component and instead become a first-class property of the networking infrastructure.  In contrast to the existing circumvention tools, which are easy to recognize and block, censoring the communication technologies developed by this project comes at a significant technical, economic, and social cost to the would-be censors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project encompasses several research thrusts.  The first thrust is integrating support for censorship-resistant communications directly into popular networked services (for example, cloud storage and streaming video) that already provide encrypted channels and cannot be easily blocked without causing significant disruption.  The second thrust is devoted to new multi-streaming transport protocols and ubiquitous proxying systems that, by design, hide the contents of transmitted information and thus resist censorship.  The third thrust is the study of censorship risks in future Internet architectures, as well as the design and implementation of censorship resistance mechanisms for these architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In summary, this project aims to produce censorship-resistant communication systems and networking protocols that help make free Internet accessible to millions of potential users, encouraging and fostering democracy and human rights throughout the world.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project outcomes fall into the broad areas of censorship resistance and privacy-preserving data sharing.  Specific results include:  Trust-aware path slection in Tor Practical, privacy-preserving protocols for two operations that law-enforcement and intelligence agencies have used effectively: set intersection and contact chaining Two protocols for two-party, secure function evaluation that use the Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) platform: In one protocol, both parties are SGX-enabled; in the other, only one party has direct access to this novel hardware.  These protocols can be made secure in the malicious model and could be deployed in a wide variety of use cases. PriFi: a novel client/server/relay protocol that provides group anonymity in wireless LANs  Analysis of the incomensurability of law and technology, using the fact that "rule of law" actually consists of both the "rule of rules" (which are susceptible to deterministic evaluation against a set of facts) and the "rule of principles" (which express important values but are not susceptible to purely formal evaluation) PRShare: a framework for interorganizational data sharing that achieves privacy using the novel technique of Attribute-Based Encryption with Oblivious Translation   In addition to the PI, 2 PhD students, 2 Postdocs, and 1 Research Scientist received partial support from this award.  With the exception of one PhD student, all have completed their training at Yale and are now in tenure-track academic jobs or staff positions in industrial-research labs.  The remaining student will finish her PhD in 2021.          Last Modified: 11/29/2020       Submitted by: Joan Feigenbaum]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
