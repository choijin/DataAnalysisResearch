<AbstractNarration>The University of Minnesota Duluth has been awarded a grant to add a smaller research vessel to the marine facility of the Large Lakes Observatory.  The vessel will be a 20' to 24' long aluminum boat with a cabin and a trailer to facilitate near-shore research on the North American Great Lakes as well as research on lakes, rivers and estuaries throughout the upper Midwest.  The Large Lakes Observatory's (LLO) marine facility currently houses the R/V Blue Heron, a 78' former Grand Banks fishing trawler outfitted for scientific research which is part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System, the umbrella organization for the U.S. academic fleet.  The addition of a smaller vessel will allow the LLO to facilitate the research and educational needs of a broader clientele.  The boat will be housed at the LLO marine facility in the Duluth(MN)/Superior(WI) harbor and will have easy access to western Lake Superior and the St. Louis River estuary.  Since the vessel will have a trailer, it will be used on all the Great Lakes as well as smaller lakes and rivers throughout the Midwest.  Users of the smaller boat will be able to take advantage of the expertise of the crew and marine technical staff of the R/V Blue Heron, as well as the large pool of shared-use equipment that is a part of the marine facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new vessel will be used in a broad array of research in shallow water areas including riverine, estuary and coastal ecosystem monitoring in the Lake Superior National Estuarine Research Reserve and studies of contaminates in aquatic systems such as the St. Louis River and Bay Area of Concern.  Additionally, researchers will study the inorganic and organic carbon pools and how carbon cycles in aquatic systems, nutrient cycling, especially nitrogen, in the Great Lakes, and the diversity of invasive bacteria and zooplankton in lacustrine and estuarine systems as well as ship ballast waters.  The vessel will be used in the mapping of the bathymetry of the lake floor including commercial fishery spawning areas, studies of nearshore fish habitat and spawning, and work on understanding the physical limnology of the Great Lakes.  The LLO's larger vessel has often been used as a platform for educational outreach, and the additional of this new vessel will allow classes to explore areas unreachable by the larger boat and will be used in teacher education programs.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) purchased a 25Æ aluminum research vessel with a pilothouse, outboard motors and a trailer using funds provided by the National Science Foundation in a grant entitled æAcquisition of a Small Boat by the Large Lakes ObservatoryÆ (DBI-1418809).  UMDÆs Large Lakes Observatory operates the research vessel Blue Heron, an 85Æ former east-coast fishing trawler that has been refitted for research work on the Great Lakes.  The R/V Blue Heron is a member of UNOLS, the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System, which is the umbrella organization for the U.S. academic research fleet.  The R/V Blue Heron is a wonderful tool, but its large size makes it so it cannot operate in the shallow nearshore of the Great Lakes and it cannot be transported to the numerous rivers or smaller lakes in the upper mid-west.  By acquiring the 25Æ vessel, we will be able to assist researchers in their work in the nearshore of the Great Lakes and on rivers and smaller lakes.  Researchers working on the St. Louis River estuary, working on aquatic bacteria, studying nitrogen and carbon cycling in aquatic systems, working on fish habitat and spawning, studying invasive species monitoring and detection, and studying the physics of water movement have all expressed interest in using the vessel.     During the one-year duration of the grant we undertook the tasks necessary to acquire the vessel.  These tasks included: meeting with potential users to ensure that we requested a vessel that would be appropriate for as many areas of research as reasonably possible; generating a request for proposals that outlined a vessel that met our goal to assist as many researchers as possible with their research while still being within our budget constraints; selecting a vendor and then patiently waiting while the vessel was manufactured; and finally, visiting the manufacturer, undertaking seatrials to test the vessel, and accepting the vessel once it was delivered to Duluth.  While we have only had the vessel for a month, we have already used the vessel on a research cruise.  During the cruise an autonomous wave powered vertical profiler called a æwirewalkerÆ was deployed by researchers from the Large Lakes Observatory and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.  We expect to have heavy use of the vessel in the future.           Last Modified: 08/10/2015       Submitted by: Richard D Ricketts]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
