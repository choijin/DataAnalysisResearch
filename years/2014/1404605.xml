<AbstractNarration>A new family of innovative immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) resins based on graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets for protein purification is proposed. These IMAC resins potentially constitute a disruptive technology in the protein purification market well beyond the current level of application of IMAC stationary phase materials. This novel IMAC material is expected to provide improved protein loading capacity and specificity compared to commercially available resins. Alternative applications in response to customer needs of the IMAC material and its possible derivatives will be explored. The most promising commercial applications of the proposed IMAC resins will be determined on the base of a customer discovery and business development effort by means of a targeted market exploration in the biotechnology sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IMAC method is an elegant and powerful approach for isolation of proteins with high purity. The team estimates that the IMAC resin global market is likely to experience further growth. The IMAC resin proposed herein, when compared to existing commercial products, will: a) be endowed with higher volumetric and gravimetric metal density, b) exhibit superior protein loading capacity and purity, c) ensure state-of-the-art durability and chemical stability, d) promote high retention of activity of isolated proteins, e) provide control of binding affinity versus analyte protein specificity. Some of these characteristics have been investigated in the course of the research conducted. Other applications may be possible beyond the natural business segment of the IMAC resin.</AbstractNarration>
