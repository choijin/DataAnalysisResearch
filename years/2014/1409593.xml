<AbstractNarration>The growing polarization of opinions in America on a wide range of topics has attracted attention in both public discourse and academia. Widespread adoption of personalized recommender systems has transformed the way that opinions are formed, expressed, changed and disseminated. As a consequence, opinions tend to be reinforced by exposure to cultural and ideological grouping even when individuals within those niches are not explicitly tied by social relations. This project will use data from Amazon book reviews and purchases to construct a book co-purchase and co-reviewer network with which to study opinion clustering and polarization of options. Particular attention will be directed to four key questions: Are there dense clusters of books, with few ties between the clusters? What genres of books produce clustering? Are there sorts of books that bridge between the clusters, and do these books then cluster into a smaller number of topics that correspond to crosscutting cultural dimensions? Do books that bridge between clusters enjoy greater sales, given the broader market, fewer sales, given their deviation from the core in each cluster, or similar sales but with a higher standard deviation? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will make use of advanced computational methods to collect and process book co-purchasing data and time-stamped book reviews from Amazon.com. Books will be hand-coded into categories and network analysis will be used to locate the structural positions of those topics in the co-purchase and co-review. This dissertation makes three principal contributions to research on opinion dynamics: 1) a better understanding of how online recommender and review systems both reflect and promote opinion polarization, 2) the extension of theories and models of homophily to clustering within bipartite networks of people and cultural objects; 3) the development of novel research methods that use digital traces of consumer purchases and reviews to study opinion dynamics and polarization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has practical implications for understanding and addressing social divisions in America. It provides a unique but complementary perspective on the causes and dynamics of polarization and may yield practical suggestions for ways to bridge divisions. This project is also one of the first to use "big data" to study polarization, and will provide the research community with new datasets and tools. In addition, the results may be helpful for authors who want to target their books to a more diverse audience. The project will also advance the training of undergraduate and graduate students who work on the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[1. Political Alignment of Scientific Disciplines. Our results on the political alignment of scientific disciplines based on their copurchase patterns confirm the commonly perceived liberal bias in sciences, with traditional physical sciences and mathematics leaning towards liberal ideology. However, we have observed additional patterns in the results. First, social and behavioral sciences are more conservative than physical sciences and mathematics, to the contrary of the liberal bias suggested by the conservative politicians and pundits. For example, in 2013, a Senate Appropriations Committee bill mandated the NSF discontinue funding for much political science research (CITE) and the Republican-led House Committee on Science, Space and Technology recently proposed to cut NSF social science funding in half (Mervis 2014).

Medicine (0.58) is also on the moderately conservative side, partly because many of its politically copurchased books are on the topic of nationalized health care system. 2. Political Relevance and Internal Structure of Disciplines With the political relevance measure, detailed in the Final Project Report, we found that political and social sciences are among the most politically relevant disciplines. Moreover, some scientific disciplines, which are not substantively related to politics, are relevant politically. For instance, climatology and environmental sciences are highly relevant to politics, based on our measure. We also found a negative linear relationship between the internal polarization of disciplines and the positions of ideology books in disciplines. As the disciplines become more polarized internally, the blue (red) books tend to be located in the center (periphery), and blue books have a wider reach of distinct science books than red books. In other words, red books tend to be concentrated in the periphery of the network and share connections with only a handful books in the discipline. Environmental Science and Climatology are consistently low on both ratios of network positions and are among the most polarized disciplines.
