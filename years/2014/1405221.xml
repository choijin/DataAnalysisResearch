<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Van der Waals materials resemble a layered deck of cards: they are made of individual sheets which are weakly bonded to their neighbors.  In this last decade it was discovered that these individual sheets can be peeled off to produce a one-atom thick material.  This highly surprising discovery was first made with graphite to isolate single atomic layers called graphene.  Since then this technique has been applied to a range of materials to isolate new forms of 2-dimensional layered crystals.  When isolated in this way, it has been found that the thin layered sheets take on new properties which can be useful for a wide range of electronics applications.   At the forefront of this research is the creation of van der Waals heterostructures, which are made by combining thin layers from different materials to create entirely new structures with novel functionality.  This research project explores how the properties of the combined structure can be altered by "twisting" the structure, i.e. by changing the rotational alignment between adjacently stacked layers.  Twisting one layer with respect to another can drastically affect the coupling between the two layers, resulting in widely different electronic properties for the combined structure.  In this way the properties of the new electronic material can be tuned for different purposes such as for the study of exotic quantum phenomena or to obtain novel quantum nanodevices with new electronic and optical properties.  This project will be accomplished as part of a broadly integrated program aimed at building a collaborative and open scientific community, mentoring the next generation of scientists, and communicating physics to industry leaders and the general public. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stacking of 2d crystalline layers to form van der Waals heterostructures constitutes a new paradigm for creating designer electronic materials.  The range of possible electronic phenomena is especially rich due to the sensitivity of interlayer coupling and Coulomb interactions to the rotational alignment between layers, or twist angle.  The research objective of this project is to understand the interlayer physics that determine the properties of twisted van der Waals heterostructures and to build upon this understanding to engineer novel quantum circuits.  The proposed research objective will be achieved through the nanofabrication and transport measurement of van der Waals heterostructures made from stacking atomically-thin layers of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride.  The success of this project will result in an understanding of the effect of interactions within van der Waals heterostructures due to interlayer coupling and electron-electron interactions.  Moreover, electron-electron interactions are expected to give rise to new highly-correlated ground states and novel edge state configurations such as the fractional quantum spin Hall effect.  This project will probe these novel many-body states in twisted van der Waals heterostructures and explore their potential for realizing building blocks for future topological-protected quantum circuits.  This research may also result in new quantum coherent electronic devices, and will be of importance in assessing the potential of van der Waals heterostructures to become a component in future nanoelectronics and quantum information technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Supported by this NSF grant, the PI started his investigation of the twisted bilayer graphene system, with experiments ranging from the realization of quantum spin Hall effect to revealing novel electronic insulating states induced by the moir&eacute; superlattice potential.  Observation of Helical Edge States and Fractional Quantum Hall Effect in a Graphene Electron-hole Bilayer  Twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) consists of two graphene sheets stacked directly on top of each other, where the interactions can be tuned solely by the relative twist angle. By imparting a large twist angle, we have engineered 1-dimensional edge states which can be independently controlled within each layer. In particular, we can tune these edge states to be counter-propagating with opposite spins. A helical edge state system like this serves as a fundamental building block for many topological systems.

Despite its material simplicity, graphene has proven to be a valuable platform for hosting novel edge state systems, a starting point for creating topological qubits for quantum computing.  Electronic Transport in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Moir&eacute; Superlattices  Whenever two periodic structures are stacked together with misalignment, a spatial moir&eacute; pattern emerges. This long-range "superlattice" can greatly alter the material properties of the constituent layers.  We studied the moir&eacute; superlattice in twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) which consists of two closely stacked graphene layers with a small relative twist angle. Despite stacking two highly conductive materials, We observed two insulating states when the TBLG is tuned to a carrier density that corresponds to one electron per moir&eacute; unit cell.

We also demonstrated a different Landau level sequence associated with the insulating states.  This work provides a new platform for realizing superlattice effects in 2-D systems and poses important questions about the interactions in hybrid graphene systems.  Outreach  Our group has had a long-term active involvement in the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) at MIT which provides research experience for undergraduate students.  We also invited two deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) students with hearing disabilities (and their sign language interpreters) from Gallaudet University for a summer research program in our laboratory.  We also host students from foreign universities for exchange research programs. In the past year, three students from Universitat Polit&egrave;cnica de Catalunya (UPC) and &Eacute;cole Polytechnique F&eacute;d&eacute;rale de Lausanne (EPFL) have joined our group to pursue research towards completion of their theses.  The PI is the organizer this fall of the first Rising Stars in Physics Workshop, a career workshop for outstanding women postdocs and senior graduate students.
