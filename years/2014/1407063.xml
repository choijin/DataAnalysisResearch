<AbstractNarration>Humans are dependent on plants as critical sources of food, fuel, and fiber.  Understanding the biological principles that govern the growth and development of plants therefore has great practical value.  The science of plant genetics provides one of the most productive approaches to understanding plant biology.  Recent advances in genome science have provided a rich suite of tools and resources that have greatly accelerated the pace of plant genetics research.  Missing from the plant scientist's toolbox, however, is a practical strategy for engineering precise deletions of genes at chosen positions in the DNA on a chromosome.  This Early-concept grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will address this deficiency by testing a promising new strategy for producing targeted genome deletions in plants.  The resulting technology has the potential to be widely adopted as a standard tool for exploring gene function in plants.  In addition, the project will provide training opportunities for students at the graduate and undergraduate levels.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team recently described the isolation of a unique Arabidopsis thaliana mutant carrying the precise deletion of three tandemly-duplicated genes on chromosome IV.  This deletion appears to have been caused by an unequal meiotic crossover directed by T-DNA insertions located 25 kilobases apart in the genome.  This deletion was found by screening 2,000 F2 plants by PCR to search for recombinants. Because only one instance of this deletion was observed in the previously published work, it is impossible to accurately estimate the rate with which these deletions occur.  In order to determine the potential value of this system for performing genome engineering the following studies will be performed:&lt;br/&gt;1.  Measure the rate with which T-DNA directed deletion occurs at several loci throughout the genome.&lt;br/&gt;2.  Determine the effect that T-DNA structure has on deletion frequency.  The T-DNA insertions that produced the previously characterized deletion had an inverted-repeat structure.  The correlation between hairpin-forming ability and deletion rate will be explored.&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research could ultimately lead to the development of genome engineering methods that could be applied to a wide range of plants species, including crop plants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As scientists develop an improved understanding of how specific genes and groups of genes contribute to the phenotypes displayed by plants, there is a growing need for methodologies that allow scientists to efficiently manipulate the genomes of plants.  In addition to targeted modifications of individual genes, there is also interest in developing tools for performing targeted deletions of chromosomal regions. The objective of this research project was to test the efficiency of a novel approach to performing this type of chromosome engineering in plants.      In previous work, the research team had observed that targeted deletions of precise regions of a plant genome could be produced by screening the progeny of plants carrying two separate DNA elements inserted in close proximity to each other in a genome.  This original observation was intriguing because it produced a valuable chromosomal deletion, but it was unknown whether or not the process that produced this deletion event was common or rare.  For this project the researchers designed a genetic screen through which they should have been able to easily detect the occurrence of new chromosomal deletions by counting the frequency with which seedlings with a striking visual phenotype arose in specially designed genetic backgrounds.  The outcome of this project was a demonstration that this type of chromosomal deletion is much more rare than the research team had hoped it would be.  As a consequence, the underlying phenomena may not represent a tractable approach to genome engineering in plants.  This project provided training opportunities for a post-doctoral researcher, a research technician, and an undergraduate student.
