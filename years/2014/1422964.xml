<AbstractNarration>Interference between wireless devices will become a serious bottleneck for future wireless networks as&lt;br/&gt;they become more pervasive in our everyday lives. The traditional approach of dealing with interference&lt;br/&gt;is to share limited resources, such as spectrum, among many users such that a given resource is used by&lt;br/&gt;only one user at a time. The recent notion of interference alignment (IA) proposes a new paradigm where&lt;br/&gt;several users can simultaneously send information by sharing the same resource. This new approach&lt;br/&gt;results in increased network capacity where every user gets half the interference-free throughput. In this&lt;br/&gt;research, the project team will leverage reconfigurable antenna systems to design and enhance&lt;br/&gt;interference alignment techniques for multi-user wireless networks. Reconfigurable antennas are capable&lt;br/&gt;of electronically switching between different radiation patterns (or 'states') in response to the needs of&lt;br/&gt;the overlying communication link and network. In this regard, reconfigurable antenna systems represent a&lt;br/&gt;significant new degree of freedom for developing interference management techniques. The project team&lt;br/&gt;proposes new ways of using the antennas to enable more practical solutions for future multi-user&lt;br/&gt;networks and also provide a software defined radio platform to enable further research within the&lt;br/&gt;community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the vast majority of existing research in this area considers an antenna to be a monolithic 'black&lt;br/&gt;box', the project team will develop and demonstrate new compact form-factor electronically&lt;br/&gt;reconfigurable antenna technologies that are capable of providing pattern agility. This additional degree&lt;br/&gt;of freedom allows for the dynamic selection of radiation patterns to seamlessly integrate with, and extend&lt;br/&gt;interference alignment techniques. The first objective is to demonstrate how electrically reconfigurable&lt;br/&gt;antennas can greatly enhance the sum capacity achieved via distributed interference alignment, especially&lt;br/&gt;at low SNR, by improving the subspace design. The second objective is to demonstrate how blind&lt;br/&gt;interference alignment can be practically achieved by combining antenna state selection algorithms with&lt;br/&gt;multiple physical layer transmission schemes. The additional channel diversity provided by&lt;br/&gt;reconfigurable antennas comes with an overhead to acquire information about the state of all the channels,&lt;br/&gt;revealing a need for a strategy to select the optimal state and most importantly an ability to learn the&lt;br/&gt;changes in the channel state in order to adapt. With these goals in mind, the project team will utilize&lt;br/&gt;online learning based on multi-armed bandit theory to design algorithms to control and adapt the state of a&lt;br/&gt;reconfigurable antenna system. For the multi-user network, the team will analyze the cost of learning&lt;br/&gt;under an unknown statistical model of the channel and compare it with the oracle with full prior&lt;br/&gt;knowledge. Finally, the team will focus on implementing the developed interference alignment algorithms&lt;br/&gt;on Drexel's Software Defined Communications (SDC) testbed. The SDC testbed is based upon a Scalable&lt;br/&gt;OFDM physical layer, which operates close to many different standards. The project team will develop&lt;br/&gt;new blocks for precoding and decoding, cross-transmitter symbol-timing synchronization, as well as&lt;br/&gt;implement more efficient synchronization techniques that require less data overhead. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;combination of the Drexel SDC testbed with IA algorithms will result in a product that has high relevance&lt;br/&gt;to the industrial and academic research communities. Special effort will be made to not only disseminate&lt;br/&gt;research results through relevant conference and journal publication, but also through testbed technology&lt;br/&gt;demonstrations. In order to extend the outreach of the proposed research beyond the research community,&lt;br/&gt;high school students and teachers, specifically under-represented populations, will be invited to&lt;br/&gt;participate in the PIs research laboratories through pre-existing educational programs. The developed&lt;br/&gt;testbed will be used to develop demonstrations and laboratory-based course modules.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Interference management in multiuser wireless networks is a critical problem that needs to be addressed for enhancing network capacity and developing future wireless standards. Conventional wireless devices are designed to access the shared wireless medium through various techniques which prevent devices from transmitting simultaneously, thus avoiding interference.  In this project, we development new strategies to help mitigate the effects of interference in wireless networks using new types of antenna technology.  The objective of this proposal was to demonstrate how electrically reconfigurable antennas can be coupled with interference alignment algorithms to enhance interference management in multiuser wireless networks. Reconfigurable antennas are capable of electronically switching between different radiation patterns (or ``states'') in response to the needs of the overlying communication link and network.   From the perspective of intellectual merit, the project has had the following major results:  * A repeatable and efficient measurement methodology was developed for characterizing the performance of reconfigurable antennas and physical layer processing algorithms. The measurement approach leverages a reverberation chamber for emulating various radio propagation environments in a controllable and statistically repeatable manner.  Through the careful placement of radio frequency absorbers, positioning of antennas and rotation of mechanical stirring paddles, it is possible to generate wireless channels with varying spatial (angular), temporal and spectral characteristics.   * An extensive measurement campaign was conducted using the aforementioned approach to quantify the pattern diversity benefits of reconfigurable antennas in wireless networks.  We did simulations and field experiments in both terrestial wireless communication networks, as well as in air to ground communication links representative of drones and unmanned aerial vehicles.  * We considered the feasibility of new antennas for 5G millimeter wave systems to mitigate the effects of blockage and interference at 60 GHz frequencies that will be used in next generation cell phones.  * We developed new antenna technologies using non-traditional materials that can be used to rapidly "spray paint" antennas as an attractive alternative to existing antenna manufacturing techniques.  In the area of broader impacts, the project results have been disseminated through conference and journal publications.  We have involved both graduate students and undergraduate students on design projects relavent to project activities.  Our research has also drawn attention in the popular media through press-releases, while also being featured on the front page of the NSF website.
