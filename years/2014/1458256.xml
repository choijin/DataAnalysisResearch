<AbstractNarration>Americans depend on the existing Emergency Communications Systems (ECS) to save lives, either via 911 calls to ambulance, police and fire services or via the broadcast Emergency Alert System.   The existing Emergency Communications Systems (ECS) infrastructure is becoming increasingly outdated due to the migration of voice and video services to Internet-based technologies.    The Network Slicing for Emergency Communications (NSEC) is a prototype US Ignite demonstration project that will utilize GENI slices to create a demonstration system of a robust, reliable, and scalable alternative to existing ECS.   This demonstration will use network slicing to provide priority and dedicated bandwidth and cloud services to simplify operations, create sustainability and maintain extensibility.   The GENI slicing framework will also provide isolation from Denial of Service attacks.  The City of Ammon (Bonneville County), Idaho, Albion Telephone Company (ATC), an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC) with territories located in Southern Idaho and Northern Utah, and Utah Telecommunication Open Infrastructure Agency (UTOPIA) with serving territories throughout Utah will support this effort. This proposed effort will document technical and organizational issues, serve as the initial demonstration of the feasibility, and provide the initial building blocks for an open standard implementation of a next generation ECS.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses critical needs in emergency communications, a national priority issue; provides a path forward for communities and agencies desiring to address current ECS deficiencies, and provides a small scale transportable system for on-location demonstrations; and establishes an extensible open source ECS capable of supporting continued research and development without affecting current emergency communications systems operations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary: Network Slicing for Emergency Communications (NSEC) is a prototype US Ignite demonstration project that utilizes GENI slices to create a demonstration system based on network slicing (to provide priority and dedicated bandwidth) and cloud services (to simplify operations, create sustainability and maintain extensibility).   This executed effort serves as the initial demonstration of the feasibility and provides the initial building blocks for an open standard implementation of a next generation Emergency Communications Systems (ECS).  Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of the project lies primarily in its ability to demonstrate how NSF funded research and development can be applied to meet a national priority. The intellectual deliverables include: 1) A prototype reference model to identify circumscribed costs and operational responsibilities for a larger to scale demonstration; 2) Initial high level identification of barriers to construction, implementation (cost) and adoption from affected organizations and users (sociological); 3) The proofs of the necessity and merit of NSF funded research by demonstrating potential application and commercialization of SDNs through public/private partnerships.  Broader Impacts: 1) Meets a national priority by addressing the critical needs in emergency communications; 2) Provides a path forward for communities and agencies desiring to address current ECS deficiencies, and provides a small scale transportable system for on-location demonstrations; 3) Establishes an extensible ECS capable of supporting continued NSF research and development without affecting current emergency communications systems operations; 4) Practical first step towards commercial implementation of network slicing all the way to the premise.     Project Outcomes:  The outcomes of the project include the following:  The test bed utilized      specific hardware that was assembled, connected, and configured. Standardized protocols for      communication were identified and implemented. Streamlined Linux-based      hypervisor and Open Flow/VSwitch system which connects and controls the      applications running on the Virtual Machines (VM) at the endpoints was developed      and implemented. The communication context      for the applications was created via OpenFlow utilizing the Flow Visor which      controls the OpenFlow switches. The  feasibility      of a basic emergency Alert System using the end-to-end system was      demonstrated.   Thus, the project outcomes address the aforementioned intellectual merit and broader impacts.             Last Modified: 09/30/2015       Submitted by: Milos Manic]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
