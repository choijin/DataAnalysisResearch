<AbstractNarration>#1435269&lt;br/&gt;Zikanov, Oleg&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan - Ann Arbor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Energy storage is required to reconcile the Nation's demand for uninterrupted energy supply, when utilizing wind or solar energy that are supplied intermittently. A liquid metal battery is a device that can be a promising solution to this problem. The decisive factor, however, for transitioning this technology to the marketplace is the development of a flow instability that shorts the circuit in the battery. The objective of this proposal is to control this instability by advancing understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for it. The broader impact of this proposal, therefore, is quite important. The proposal also offers a strong education plan, including an international component. The proposed work will contribute to establishing a competitive research environment at the University of Michigan - Dearborn, an institution focused on serving the metropolitan Detroit community. A graduate and several undergraduate students will be involved in the research and results of the project will be incorporated in teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal with a very fundamental objective that can eventually have an impact in energy storage and in manufacturing. It is focused on hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic instabilities that develop in a liquid metal battery, and it proposes a theoretical and computational analysis leveraged with experiments that will be carried out with an international collaborator. The project advances understanding of complex instabilities in multi-layer fluid systems with electromagnetic effects. The instability mechanisms, some of which are poorly understood, will be analyzed as fully coupled phenomena in the framework of a realistic and practically important system. Advanced techniques of numerical stability analysis will be developed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of the project was to understand the hydrodynamic instabilities in a liquid metal battery - a promising new device for grid-scale energy storage. It was anticipated on the basis of earlier preliminary studies that the instabilities would be a major obstacle on the way from small laboratory prototypes to large commercially meaningful devices.  Intellectual merit. The main goal of the project has been fully achieved. In collaboration with scientists in Germany and France, we have analyzed all the possible instability mechanisms. The work of our group has primarily focused on two mechanisms, which were poorly understood in the beginning of the project and later were found critically important for battery's operation. One of them is the thermal convection driven by the Joule heating of electrically poorly conducting molten salt electrolyte. Another is the so-called rolling pad instability arising from the electromagnetic interaction between the liquid layers of different electric conductivities filling the battery.  The key conclusions of the study are as follows. (1) The thermal convection is nearly always present in a battery. It has a minor positive effect on the operation via additional mixing of reagents, and is not expected to have significant negative consequences. (2) The rolling pad instability, on the contrary, presents a danger of strong interfacial waves growing to disrupt operation of large batteries unless special care is taken of the distribution of the magnetic field inside the battery cell. (3) Other instability mechanisms, such as the electromagnetic Tayler instability and the Marangoni convection at the metal-electrolyte interfaces, are likely to lead to flows of only small amplitude, and so to present no significant danger to the technology.  The results of the project also contribute to better understanding of fundamental physical effects, such as thermal convection caused by internal heating and interfacial waves.  Broader impacts.The project has contributed to development of the energy storage technology critical for the transition of society to massive utilization of renewable, in particular solar and wind, energy sources.   The project has allowed us to train several graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Michigan &ndash; Dearborn in the subjects of advanced fluid mechanics, electrodynamics, numerical methods, and energy technology. The results of the project have been implemented as instructional materials in several graduate and undergraduate courses.
