<AbstractNarration>Ocean scientists are beginning to employ unmanned robotic vehicles to conduct surveys in oceans, lakes, and estuaries. The goal of these surveys is to provide a better understanding of underwater biology, ecology, geology, physical oceanography, and the interaction of air, sea, and ice worldwide. These data improve scientists' understanding of global ecology and climate that are of great societal importance. Having the ability to conduct precision near-bottom oceanographic surveys with unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) is unprecedented, yet the widespread use of precision navigation techniques on UUVs is limited by the high cost of true-North attitude sensors. This project seeks to develop a high-accuracy comparatively low-cost, compact, and low-power true-North seeking attitude (heading, pitch, and roll) sensor, and to incorporate this new instrument into a tightly integrated precision Doppler navigation system for UUVs. The goal is to develop a comparatively low-cost and high-accuracy navigation system to enable small low-cost UUVs to perform science missions requiring high-precision navigation (e.g. high precision hydrographic survey, time-series acoustic and optical survey for environmental assessment) that are presently considered impractical or infeasible with low-cost UUVs. This project will enable hands-on research by undergraduate and graduate students and dissemination of their research results. The instrument design will be made open-source, including mechanical designs, and electrical designs, and software algorithms that will be freely available as open-source software packages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has three technical goals: First, employ the new class of relatively low-cost commercially-available-off-the-shelf (COTS) inertial measurement units (IMUs) equipped with integrated 3-axis fiber-optic gyro (FOG) angular-rate sensors and 3-axis micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometers, together with real-time state estimation methods to provide accurate estimation of the heading, pitch, and roll of the instrument relative to true-North and the local gravity field. Second, develop improved underwater navigation methods employing low-cost FOG IMUs and bottom-lock Doppler sonars. Third, evaluate these navigation methods in full-scale experimental trials with UUVs in a test-tank and at sea.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project seeks to develop a high-accuracy comparatively low-cost, compact, and low-power true-North seeking attitude (heading, pitch, and roll) sensor, and to incorporate this new instrument into a tightly integrated precision Doppler navigation system for UUVs. The goal is to develop a comparatively low-cost and high-accuracy navigation system to enable small low-cost UUVs to perform science missions requiring high-precision navigation (e.g. high precision hydrographic survey, time-series acoustic and optical survey for environmental assessment) that are presently considered impractical or infeasible with low-cost UUVs.  In year 1 I recruited a graduate student to work on this project.  Together we performed mathematical analysis and numerical simulations to quantify the accuracy of the KVH 1775 fiber-optic inertial motion unit (IMU) which includes a 3-Axis  fiber-optic angular rate sensors, a 3-AXIS MEMS accelerometer, a 3-Axis magnetometer, and a temperature sensor.  Our results suggest that when properly calibrated for sensor bias the angular rate gyro data may be integrated over time to provide a fixed angular pose reference (fixed with respect to the stars) with a drift rate below 1 degree per second --- considerably below Earth's rotation rate of 15 degrees per hour.  Our study suggests that it may be possible to use this unit to estimate true-North heading with accuracy of a degree or better, and to very accurately estimate roll and pitch.   We  developed novel estimation algorithms for this purpose. In year 1 we also acquired one KVH 1775 unit, have developed custom software to interface to it, and conducted preliminary experimental evaluation.   In year 2 we conducted extensive analytical research and experimental evaluation: First we conducted static bench top experiments with the KVH 1775 IMU to establish the noise models for sensor bias and sensor stochastic noise.  The sensor noise was verified to be zero-mean Gaussian with significant boas terms that vary slowly over time.   Second we conducted static experimental evaluation of the unit and static-attitude estimation algorithms to verify that the system, with proper bias compensation, could dynamically estimate roll, pitch, and true-North heading to within a fraction of a degree solely from the signals of its 3-axis MEMS accelerometers and 3-axis fiber-optic gyro (FOG) angular rate sensors.  Third we developed and analyzed (analytically and in numerical simulation) a novel attitude estimation  algorithm for the non-static case where the IMU is moving dynamically in all axes.  The results show that when sensor bias is properly calibrated we can estimate roll and pitch to a small fraction of a degree, and heading to a fraction of a degree.   Fourth, motivated by the need to simultaneously dynamically estimate 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyro bias terms, we developed and evaluated in numerical simulation a novel adaptive algorithms for sensor bias compensation.  Fifth, we designed and fabricated a 6,000 m pressure housing and associated electronic chassis and equipment for the proposed field trials.  We communicatied with the Sentry operations team who will assist us in pressure-testing the housing.   In year 3 and 4 we made made major improvements in the true-North attitude estimation algorithm by completely reformulating it in a fully matrix approach that can operate in the presence of vehicle acceleration as well as rotation. In Year 4, we improved upon the algorithm and completed extensive in-water tests with the JHU ROV at the JHU test tank. We also experimentally evaluated the proposed systems in full-scale sea trials on the Sentry AUV. We benchmarked the navigation system performance in the context of conducting a high-resolution multibeam hydrographic survey of a sea floor on the Bowditch Seamount NE of Bermuda.
