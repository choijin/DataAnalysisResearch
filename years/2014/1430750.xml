<AbstractNarration>This award is for the oversight and management of the annual science workshops offered by the SHINE (Solar, Heliospheric, and INterplanetary Environment) program community over the five years. SHINE unites the U.S. scientists within the solar, interplanetary, and heliospheric research communities, who are dedicated to promote enhanced understanding of the processes by which energy in the form of magnetic fields and particles are produced by the Sun and accelerated in interplanetary space, and on the mechanisms by which these fields and particles are transported to the Earth and elsewhere in the solar system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SHINE research focuses upon the connection between events and phenomena on the Sun and their relation to solar wind structures in the heliosphere, as well as the origin and evolution of the solar wind, the nature of turbulence in the interplanetary medium, and the production and transport of solar energetic particles from the Sun through the heliosphere.  The goal of SHINE activities is to enrich and strengthen our physical understanding of, and predictive capabilities for, such phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the course of this workshop support project, SHINE mentors and trains next-generation scientists, while facilitating the community's exchange of ideas and providing directions for future research.  In addition to providing all logistical support for the workshop's activities, this specific five-year effort will fully fund the participation of at least 55 U.S. students and 5 U.S. postdoctoral fellows annually, as well as up to five foreign students and scientists able to make unique contributions to the SHINE science community.  As a community-based research group engaged in space weather science, SHINE is also allied with other community science programs within the NSF that support research in magnetosphere physics, ionospheric physics, and aeronomy.</AbstractNarration>
