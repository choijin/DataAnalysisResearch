<AbstractNarration>The University of South Dakota's CC*IIE Networking Infrastructure: Science DMZ for Campus Bridging and Computationally Assisted Research project aims to improve scientific data movement by isolating research network traffic from the friction of the traditional campus network.  Traditional enterprise networks are designed to support applications serving a variety of organizational missions as well as security measures to protect the organization's financial and other sensitive data. The result is a network that is neither designed for nor capable of serving the mission of data intensive research. The dedicated research network (Science DMZ) supports the following objectives: (1) Provide friction-free access to wide area networks; (2) Support streamlined end-to-end data flows from experimental data acquisition through analysis and post analysis; and (3) Ensure secure performance of data transfer applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Science DMZ enables a multidisciplinary collaborative research campus, supporting campus bridging in several disciplines including: particle physics, neuroscience, materials science, biomedical research, biology, and renewable energy. Laid out in the wider context of the USD's Campus Cyberinfrastructure plan, the project incorporates national best practices in network implementation and measurement as well as federated authentication. The implementation plan includes a dedicated Data Transfer Node, specifically configured to enable data transfers across wide area networks. These goals are being realized through network optimization with tools such as perfSONAR for monitoring network performance. The project accelerates the adoption of national best practices in big data movement and contributes to South Dakota's continued competitiveness as an EPSCoR state.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Traditional campus networks are designed to support applications serving a variety of organizational missions and to provide security measures to protect financial and other sensitive data. The result is a network that is neither designed for nor capable of serving the mission of data intensive research. While technologies such as network firewalls are essential to protecting and managing the general-purpose campus network, they also inhibit the accessibility and movement of big data.  Historically, increasing research data volume has been addressed by simply overprovisioning the entire campus network. However, the now widespread use of instrumentation such as next-generation gene sequencers has caused the growth rate of research data to rise at a rate that is not addressable by these traditional means.  The Department of Energy?s Energy Sciences Network developed the concept of a Science DMZ to formalize an approach to "common network performance problems encountered at research institutions by creating an environment that is tailored to the needs of high performance science applications, including high-volume bulk data transfer, remote experiment control, and data visualization."  USD?s Science DMZ aims to:  provide friction-free access to off-campus networks;  support streamlined end-to-end data flows from experimental data acquisition through analysis and post analysis; and  ensure secure performance of data transfer applications.    The Science DMZ supports scientific research across multiple disciplines at USD, including: particle physics, neuroscience, materials science, biomedical research, biology and renewable energy. Although diverse, these fields are bound by the common themes of cross-institutional collaboration, remote data access, and real time data analysis. USD scientists, for example, are investigating, the general properties of neutrinos and the nature of dark matter -- two of the most important pursuits in modern science. This data intensive effort, whose work involves state, federal and academic collaborators from around the world, requires a direct, high-speed path capable of hosting, sharing and analyzing large datasets to facilitate their work.  USD?s Science DMZ architecture comprises the following three components:  1.      High-speed data transfers   USD?s Science DMZ project extends the capabilities of the Globus data movement and management system to all USD researchers. Globus provides an easy-to-use graphical interface for moving data into and out of USD's Vermillion campus. USD's Globus system resides on a high-performance data server called a Data Transfer Node, also funded through the Science DMZ project.  2.      Performance Measurement   This project also funded network measurement servers based on the PerfSONAR software system.  perfsonar1.usd.edu in USD?s edge network  perfsonar2.usd.edu in USD's Science DMZ network  perfsonar3.usd.edu in USD's datacenter core network  perfsonar4.usd.edu in USD's campus core network  3.      Security   Big Data needs to be moved both quickly and securely. USD's Science DMZ project funded an advanced Intrusion Detection and Prevention system that monitors USD network traffic, protecting both the Science DMZ and the rest of the campus network.
