<AbstractNarration>The stability of the Greenland Ice Sheet is of critical interest to scientists and society&amp;#8232;at large in the context of future sea-level rise. The extent to which the Greenland Ice Sheet will lose mass and contribute to rising sea level&amp;#8232;in the coming decades depends on the discharge from glaciers at its edges and on the surface mass balance, which is the balance between snow accumulation and surface melt. Estimates of Greenland surface mass balance increasingly utilize climate reanalyses and high-resolution regional climate models to determine snow accumulation, surface melt and runoff/refreeze. These models show significant, and model-dependent, biases (differences from observations) along the steep edges of the Greenland Ice Sheet where the highest and most variable (in space and time) rates of accumulation and surface melt are observed. Thus, the edges of the Greenland Ice Sheet are in critical need of updated accumulation&amp;#8232;and melt data to validate models and improve mass balance estimates. The investigators propose a traverse in the Western Greenland percolation zone over two field seasons to develop continuous in-situ snow accumulation and firn density records using ground-based radar and shallow firn cores. The research objectives include: (1) determining the patterns, in time and space, of snow accumulation in Western Greenland over the past 20-40 years; (2) evaluating surface melt refreeze and englacial meltwater storage in the Western Greenland percolation&amp;#8232;zone over the past 20-40 years; and (3) quantifying the accumulation and surface melt biases of the most recent climate reanalysis models and their regional climate model counterparts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance knowledge and understanding by providing in-situ validation observations for both the mass gain (snow accumulation) and mass loss (surface melt) components of Western Greenland surface mass balance. The western edge of the Greenland Ice Sheet has been losing mass at an accelerating rate since 2005, due mostly to decreasing surface mass balance. However, surface mass balance trends derived from regional climate models differ by a factor of ~2.5 in this region. Western Greenland firn core accumulation records, required for model validation, generally end in 1996-1998, before the most recent period of accelerated mass loss. The investigators will develop continuous records of Western Greenland snow accumulation over the last 20-40 years using ground-penetrating radar validated by frequent snow pits and&amp;#8232;firn cores (25-30 m) analyzed for chemistry. They also propose to use a multi-offset radar method to calculate continuous firn density&amp;#8232;data, providing a means to assess past surface melt, refreeze and current meltwater storage&amp;#8232;in glacier aquifers. Meltwater refreeze shows the largest variability in regional climate&amp;#8232;models among surface mass balance components, and thus validation observations are critically needed. The traverse route will crisscross the percolation zone, near-parallel to the steepest accumulation and surface melt gradients, which will increase the value of the dataset for model validation. The traverse will overlap previous traverse routes and reoccupy previously sampled sites to update firn core accumulation records by 18-20 years. In addition, the project will collect cores from new sites in data-poor regions at lower elevations, where both accumulation and surface melt increase and regional climate model validation is most needed. Surface mass balance validation of several climate reanalysis models will lead to more accurate assessments&amp;#8232;of current and future Greenland Ice Sheet mass balance trends, which is critical for accurately predicting&amp;#8232;future sea-level rise. The project will integrate research with student&amp;#8232;learning at multiple levels, with an emphasis on the participation of students from underrepresented groups. The project will fund four graduate students, and incorporate numerous undergraduate researchers recruited through successful programs like the Dartmouth Women in Science Project and the Diversity in Undergraduate Geoscience Alliance. K-12 students will be engaged in this project through inquiry-based, web-hosted climate lessons incorporating the University of Maine Climate Reanalyzer and Environmental Change Model, and through field-based programs in the Boise Mountains focused on snow science. The PIs will continue their active public outreach through established and successful programs like the monthly Upper Valley Science Pub and the biannual Snow Day at the Discovery Center of Idaho, in addition to their frequent public presentations and media interviews through their respective Public Affairs offices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This collaborative project, the Greenland Traverse for Accumulation and Climate Studies (GreenTrACS), involving Dartmouth College, Boise State University, and University of Maine, used firn core chemistry and radar observations along a 3000+ km traverse in West Greenland, to improve understanding of melt and snow accumulation rates.  These constraints on the surface mass balance will improve models of climate and ice sheet dynamics, leading to improved estimates of future sea level rise.  Dartmouth College performed the drilling and geochemistry, Boise State University developed and deployed a multi-offset radar for mapping snow density and accumulation between core sites, and University of Maine performed regional climate modeling in the region of the traverse.   The GreenTrACS team successfully completed two 10-week field seasons in Greenland, covering over 3000 km on the ice sheet in an area with uncertain snowfall rates and melt.  A total of 16 firn cores were drilled for chemistry, and a suite of radar systems profiled the snow and firn between cores.  The figure "GreenTRACSmap" shows the traverse, with the 2016 field season in black, and the 2017 field season in red.  Example results from the multi-offset radar are shown for the area around core 15.   This was the first traverse to successfully deploy multi-offset ground-based radar, which is a unique radar technique that allows an independent estimate of snow density and thickness of stratigraphic layers, leading to more accurate snow accumulation estimates along the traverse.  The figure "MultiOffsetRadar" shows the radar set-up, with transmit and receive antennas in the black sleds behind the snowmobile.  The arrows show the different paths that the radar waves take, and when reflections can be identified in separate transmit/receive pairs, the average velocity to that boundary can be estimated.  Since in dry snow and firn the velocity is controled only by density at these frequencies, the average density to that interface can be estimated.  In contrast, traditional single-offset radar that has been used previously, requires an estimate of density from a model or regular field observations.   The figure "DensityLog" shows a comparison of the radar estimated density profile (red) and the firn core manual density measurements in black.  The radar estimated profile uses direct radar observations to several near-surface layers, combined with a densification model.  The figure "DensityTransect" shows example accumulation rates, density estimates, and depths to the annual layer for a 45km example near Core 15.  The density estimates from the multi-offset radar will be used to improve accumulation rate estimates from airborne radar observations, and to constrain surface mass balance and regional climate models of Greenland, leading to improved predictions of sea level rise.
