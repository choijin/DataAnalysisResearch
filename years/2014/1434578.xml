<AbstractNarration>In this project, a team of investigators participating in the 2015 U.S. Arctic GEOTRACES expedition will study the distribution of the naturally-occurring radioactive isotopes lead-210 and polonium-210 in the western and central Arctic Ocean. These measurements are expected to be very useful in helping to meet the goals of the U.S. Arctic GEOTRACES expedition: namely, to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes (TEIs) in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions. Some trace elements are essential to life, others are known biological toxins, and still others are important because they can be used as tracers of a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the sea. A primary source of lead-210 to the oceans is from the atmosphere, where it is produced from the decay of radon-222. In the oceans, it decays to polonium-210. The half-lives of polonium-210 (138 days) and lead-210 (22.3 years) provide "natural clocks" with which to investigate processes such as the sorption of elements on to sinking particles, and the transport of elements between the ocean margins and deep basins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lead investigator proposes to concentrate sampling and investigate processes at three "interfaces:" the air-sea-ice interface at the surface, the interface between biologically produced particles and water, and the interface between non-biological particles and water. The investigator proposes the following three hypotheses: 1) At the air-sea interface, the polonium-210/lead-210 ratios can be used to "age date" the sea ice (and sediments contained within the ice).  2) At the biotic-water interface, different biogenic particle types encountered in the upper waters will affect the fractionation and remineralization depths of polonium-210 and lead-210. 3) At the particle-water interface, layers of resuspended sediments in the water column will be zones of enhanced polonium and lead scavenging from the surrounding waters. These processes are important for understanding the distributions of other key particle-reactive trace elements such as iron, lead, and manganese. To test these hypotheses, the investigator will sample and analyze about four hundred dissolved and particulate (large and small) samples, 10 multi-year ice cores, ice-rafted sediments, and water from melt ponds for polonium-210 and lead-210 along the GEOTRACES Western Arctic section. About half of the samples will be focused at the four designated "super stations", with half of these in the highly dynamic upper water column and the other half near the sea floor where resuspension of bottom sediments can affect element cycling. The depths will be chosen according to regional atmospheric input, ecosystems, and coordinated sampling with groups measuring other trace elements and isotopes. The remainder of the samples will be ice cores, water from melt ponds, ice-rafted sediments in sea ice, and atmospheric aerosol samples. The proposed work will be closely coordinated with other GEOTRACES. The broader impacts are closely linked to the GEOTRACES program as a whole to enhance (1) research infrastructure by providing a broad array of polonium-210 and lead-210 data useful for biogeochemical scavenging models, (2) education by mentoring graduate and undergraduates, teaching by example&amp;#8232;from proposed research, (3) participation of under-represented students careers in the geosciences, (4) research training of graduates in marine radiochemistry, and 5) broad dissemination of results through publications, presentations, and on dedicated public Wayne State University websites (www.clas.wayne.edu) and at GEOTRACES (www.geotraces.org).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Trace element cycling in the ocean plays an important role on marine ecosystem functioning and the carbon cycle. Pb-210 and Po-210 are the progeny of Rn-222 in the U-238-decay chain and has contrasting biogeochemical behavior in marine system. Most of the Pb-210 in the surface ocean are derived from atmospheric deposition of Pb-210 which is derived from the decay of Rn-222. Since the average residence time of water vapor in the atmosphere is ~ 10 days, generally the radon progeny is also expected to have comparable residence time. When there are no anthropogenic (e.g. fossil fuel combustion, use of phosphate) or natural (e.g. volcanic eruption, forest fire) sources of polonium, and all the atmospheric polonium is derived from atmospheric Pb-210, then, the Po-210/Pb-210 activity ratio (Po/Pb AR) is expected to be about 0.1 or less. The initial Po/Pb AR in a given rain/snow precipitation is similar to that of atmospheric aerosols at that site and the in-growth of Po-210 from the decay of Pb-210 with time in snow, provides time elapsed since the incorporation of Pb-210 into the snow. During storm events in early autumn, atmospherically-delivered Po-210 and Pb-210 in the coastal Arctic, with Po/Pb AR of &lt; 0.1, are scavenged by finer resuspended sediments and eventually are incorporated into coastal sea ice which are subsequently transported to the interior Arctic. The in-growth of <sup>210</sup>Po increases with time and the disequilibrium between<sup> </sup>Po-210 and Pb-210 in the ice-rafted sediment is utilized to determine the time elapsed since its incorporation (?age?). Melt water from ice and snow in conjunction with a fractional amount of surface seawater are the sources of water for the melt ponds. From an independent determination of the fractional amounts of water from these three sources and knowing the Po-210 and Pb-210 activities in these three fractions, the ?age? of the melt pond can be determined.</p> <p>We collected and analyzed for particulate and dissolved phases of Po-210 and Pb-210 from a total of 43 water samples (2 super stations), 14 different aerosol samples, 6 ice cores (31 split sections), 5 melt pond water samples, 6 snow samples, 6 under ice samples, 12 ice-rafted sediments and 2 surface water samples for inter-calibration. Based on our results, we report the following: i) from the measured Po-210 and Pb-210 activities in aerosols, collected from 13 from different stations covering the entire 10 weeks Western Arctic GEOTRACES cruise track from Dutch Harbor, AK to the North Pole, we show that the mean Po/Pb AR of 0.039?0.026 (n=13) which corresponds to a residence time of 12.9?7.0 days; ii) from the measured Po/Pb AR in snow and using the mean AR in aerosol as the initial AR in snow, the calculated snow age for 6 different ice stations varied between 1.7 and 34 days (mean: 13 days); iii) the age of 5 different melt ponds, based on the measured Po/Pb AR and three end-member mixing model, ranged between 18 and 79 days; iv) the measured activities of Po-210 and Pb-210 in melt-ponds is about 10 times higher compared to the surface seawater in the Arctic Ocean; v) The transport velocity of the ice-rafted sediment in the shelf and interior Arctic Ocean, estimated based on the calculated age using Po/Pb AR, 0.08 and 0.17 m/s agree with the data obtained using buoys and Acoustic Doppler current profiler; vi) we report highly elevated levels of <sup>210</sup>Po in biogenic particulate matter in snow and melt pond compared to <sup>210</sup>Pb indicating biogeochemical cycling of biogenic elements such as polonium is different in the Arctic; vii) analysis of the water column samples from two super stations (ST-30 and 43) indicate gross disequilibrium between total <sup>210</sup>Po and <sup>210</sup>Pb throughout the water column in the central Arctic basin suggesting the preferential removal of <sup>210</sup>Po taking place in the water column. This is the first observation reporting Po-210 deficiency for the whole column which we did not find in any of the superstations in the North Atlantic or East Pacific GEOTRACES cruises; and viii) The residence time of <sup>210</sup>Pb in the Makarov Basin seems to be the longest compared to all other published deep water stations from the Arctic Ocean.</p> <p>The implication of this study for the future is that the routine identification of multi-year (those that survived more than one melt cycle) ice is now possible using Po/Pb AR as a metric. Furthermore, long-term longitudinal study on the annual variations in the age of snow and melt pond in a particular region caused by climate change in the Arctic may enable us to quantify the radiation balance changes caused by faster melting of snow and later freeze.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/01/2020<br>      Modified by: Mark&nbsp;Baskaran</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1434578/1434578_10327570_1580607361960_ScienceAdvancems_13Jan2020_Fig1BB--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1434578/1434578_10327570_1580607361960_ScienceAdvancems_13Jan2020_Fig1BB--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Total activity of Po-210 in solid and liquid water"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1434578/1434578_10327570_1580607361960_ScienceAdvancems_13Jan2020_Fig1BB--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Total activity of Po-210 in solid and liquid water"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Total Pb-210 activity in snow, melt pond, ice core and surface ocean water from Ice Stations, Western Arctic, GEOTRACES cruise</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mark Baskaran</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mark&nbsp;Baskaran</div> <div class="imageTitle">Total activity of Po-210 in solid and liquid water</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1434578/1434578_10327570_1580607898923_ScienceAdvancems_13Jan2020_Fig1AA--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1434578/1434578_10327570_1580607898923_ScienceAdvancems_13Jan2020_Fig1AA--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Total activity of Po-210 in solid and liquid water"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1434578/1434578_10327570_1580607898923_ScienceAdvancems_13Jan2020_Fig1AA--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Total activity of Po-210 in solid and liquid water"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Activity of total Po-210 in snow, melt pond, ice core and surface seawater.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mark Baskaran</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mark&nbsp;Baskaran</div> <div class="imageTitle">Total activity of Po-210 in solid and liquid water</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1434578/1434578_10327570_1580608076920_ScienceAdvancems_13Jan2020_Fig1CC--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1434578/1434578_10327570_1580608076920_ScienceAdvancems_13Jan2020_Fig1CC--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Po-210/Pb-210 activity ratio in solid and liquid water"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1434578/1434578_10327570_1580608076920_ScienceAdvancems_13Jan2020_Fig1CC--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Po-210/Pb-210 activity ratio in solid and liquid water"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Total Activity Ratio in snow, melt pond, ice core, and surface ocean water in the Western Arctic, GEOTRACES cruise</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mark Baskaran</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mark&nbsp;Baskaran</div> <div class="imageTitle">Po-210/Pb-210 activity ratio in solid and liquid water</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
