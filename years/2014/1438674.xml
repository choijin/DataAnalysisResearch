<AbstractNarration>This is a request to support participation of U.S.-based graduate students who are presenting papers at the 20th International Union of Soil Sciences World Congress in Jeju, South Korea, during June 8-13, 2014. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those supported by the fellowships will benefit by interacting with leading persons in their field of research and discussing their work with them. Their involvement in the congress will expose them to new areas of research and keep them engaged in the field, helping to build the future academic infrastructure. The fellowship program will enable those who might not otherwise&lt;br/&gt;be able to attend the congress to do so, encouraging the participation of the strongest U.S. soil science research talent at this meeting.</AbstractNarration>

The WCSS attracted more than 2,000 scientists from all over the world to present their latest research findings. The presentations often define the future of scientific and technological advancements, and the interaction that occurs at the meeting helps to promote close collaborations and enhance important networking. Through a fellowship program named after the founding chair of the USNC/SS and renowned soil scientist, the late Wilford R. Gardner, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, 13 students were funded to attend the WCSS. Dr. Gardner was involved in international science throughout his career and was a strong supporter of the formation of the International Union of Soil Sciences. He was also a champion of involving younger scientists in the international arena.&nbsp;The recipients of the travel fellowships were: Jason Ackerson (Texas A&amp;M University), Nazanin (Nazanin) Akrami (Louisiana State University), Amanda Joy Ashworth (University of Tennessee, Knoxville), Eduardo Chavez (University of Florida), Youn Jeong Choi (Purdue University), Davide Ciceri (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Jason Fischel, (University of Delaware), Matthew Fischel (University of Delaware), Joshua LeMonte, (University of Delaware), Joseph Martin (Purdue University), Dinesh Panday (Trivhuvan University of Nepal), SaeRom Park (Purdue University), An-Min Wu (University of Minnesota).
