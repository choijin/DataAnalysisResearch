<AbstractNarration>The principal investigator of this proposal will assess whether changes to the structure of the jet stream that occur in conjunction with the development of cyclones are significant sources of weather forecast errors further downstream.  These events can result in poorly forecast extreme weather events.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to the future US workforce through the training of a graduate student in state-of-the-art approaches to predictability, data assimilation, and synoptic/mesoscale meteorology.  A successful project will develop understanding that can lead to improved weather forecasts, and in turn provide greater lead time for warnings and reduced loss of life and property due to certain mid-latitude extreme weather events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to evaluate the hypothesis that waveguide perturbations associated with midlatitude cyclones and the extratropical transition of tropical cyclones (ET) are an important source of downstream forecast errors. The first phase of this proposal involves evaluating this hypothesis by comparing the downstream predictability following the development of midlatitude cyclones and ET and comparing it to a predictability climatology using 31 years of ensemble forecasts from the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory 2nd generation reforecast project. Moreover, this study will evaluate hypotheses regarding the predictability of midlatitude vs. ET cyclones and how this predictability varies depending on the magnitude of the waveguide perturbation. In addition, this study will evaluate hypotheses related to how uncertainty in the outflow and thermodynamic profile in the vicinity of waveguide perturbations impact the downstream predictability. The role of the outflow on the downstream state will be evaluated by comparing the sensitivity of forecast metrics related to the downstream state to the outflow against the sensitivity of the forecast metrics to other aspects of the state.  The role of the outflow will be confirmed by performing a series of perturbed initial condition experiments where aspects of the initial-time outflow properties are modified, and then evaluating the impact on the downstream state.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The overarching goal of this project was to study how uncertainty associated with the clouds and precipitation that are associated with low pressure systems (i.e., cyclones) affect the ability of numerical weather prediction models to provide accurate forecasts downstream (i.e., to the east) of these systems in the midlatitude (30-60 degree latitude).  These clouds and precipitation are associated with latent heat release, which is the energy that is released when water vapor condenses into liquid or frozen water in the atmosphere.  The first part of this project compared the uncertainty in subsequent downstream forecasts associated with situations where hurricanes move into the midlatitudes to typical midlatitude cyclones. Generally speaking, the movement of the tropical cyclone into the midlatitudes introduces a source of uncertainty into the midlaitude forecast by producing waves in the jet stream, which subsequently move downstream.  By contrast, some midlatitude cyclones are associated with higher forecast uncertainty compared to the typical forecast, while other cases are associated with less forecast uncertainty.  One potential reason for the difference in downstream uncertainty from one midlatitude cyclone case to another is the orientation of the midlatitude jet stream, such that some configurations are associated with more forecast uncertainty than others.  This hypothesis was tested by categorizing each midlatitude cyclone case into one of six typical midlatitude jet stream patterns and determining the number of cases where the forecast ends up being more uncertain than normal compared to the number of cases where the forecast is more certain than normal in each of these patterns.  These results indicate that the jet stream pattern that is characterized by broad southwesterly flow is more likely to be associated with a higher than normal downstream forecast uncertainty, while the cases with a more wavy jet stream pattern is associated with lower than normal downstream forecast uncertainty.  This southwesterly flow pattern is associated with more latent heat release, which can lead to uncertainty in whether the jet stream will be rearranged.  The second phase of this research involved evaluating how the winds associated with this latent heat release can rearrange the midlatitude jet stream using a process-based perspective.  This is accomplished by comparing numerical model forecasts that are characterized by a more amplified jet stream (i.e., the jet stream is more directed to the north) to forecasts where the jet stream does not get deflected as far to the north.  The results of these calculations indicate that the forecasts with a more amplified jet stream are the result of the latent heat release producing stronger winds in the upper troposphere.  Furthermore, these experiments indicate that small changes to the water vapor distribution and the winds near the surface in the eastern part of the cyclone have an outsized impact on the subsequent forecast compared to other forecast fields and locations.  This is the region where the southerly winds associated with the cyclone transport warm and moist air poleward and is associated with the majority of precipitation with these systems.  This result indicates that improving the representation of precipitation in these regions of cyclones could reduce the uncertainty of forecasts downstream of cyclones.
