<AbstractNarration>The funding of this proposal will support the development of a new high-resolution, high-sensitivity ion microscope to serve as the prime instrument of the UCLA/NSF national, multi-user facility for secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) research in the geosciences. The UCLA laboratory has served as a world-class facility for in situ microscale isotopic analyses of geologic materials for 18 years. The Principal Investigators will continue their programs of research training for graduate students (both at UCLA and elsewhere) and young postdoctoral scholars. In addition, they will continue their popular and effective outreach and inreach workshops for SIMS training of the next generation of geoscientists. The Principal Investigators and UCLA scientists and students continue to be involved in synergistic activities both locally and nationally, including professional activities and K-12 education and public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central research tool of the UCLA National Ion Microprobe Facility has been the CAMECA ims 1270, the first commercial large-radius SIMS built by CAMECA instruments in consultation with UCLA scientists 23 years ago.  Although the ims 1270 has been upgraded over the years, it is no longer state-of-the-art, and in several important research areas the ability to innovate and to undertake new types of investigations is limited by the instrument's technical capabilities.  The PIs propose to partner with two instrument manufacturers (CAMECA, Oregon Physics) to develop a new ion microscope that will have (1) high brightness ion sources, (2) improved lateral spatial resolution, (3) improved mass resolving power, (4) improved throughput speed and sample capacity, (5) improved detector sensitivity and linearity leading to higher precision and accuracy in isotopic analyses, and (6) improved reliability. Although this development will be done cooperatively with two commercial entities, UCLA scientists and engineers will accomplish the overall design and implementation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This goal of this project was the development of a new high sensitivity ion microscope to serve as the focal point of the UCLA-NSF National Ion Microprobe Facility. The instrument, named the ims1290, is based on a CAMECA ims1280HR2 onto which we adapted an Oregon Physics Hyperion-2 plasma ion source, a UHV sample storage carousel, and a modified vacuum system.      A series of experiments (Liu et al., 2017) demonstrated between 6 and 10 times the current density delivered by the Hyperion source compared to the "classical" CAMECA duoplasmatron for 16O2&minus; and 16O&minus; beams, respectively. This leads directly to a significant improvement in spot size and/or analysis time.  Subsequent analyses have shown that it is possible to generate intense O3&minus; primary ion beams, which have distinct advantages for depth profiling applications and also can enhance the yield of some positive secondary ions.      Measurement protocols were developed for both stable isotope (e.g., Mg, Si, Ca) and radiogenic isotope (e.g,. Pb) analyses as well as for high resolution scanning ion image analysis.  A new ultra-high-vacuum sample storage carousel was added to the instrument with support from NASA.  This accessory has important practical advantages, especially for analysis of volatile elements since vacuum storage helps to degas the sample (and standards) prior to introduction into the analytical chamber. The ability to store up to 6 samples and/or standards improves throughput.      We have demonstrated important improvements in precision and speed of analysis for major geoscience applications using the ims1290, relative to the original (almost 30 years old) ims1270 instrument, with the end result that it has become the preferred analytical tool for users to the National Facility.  This was a primary goal of the project and one which has had significant impact in the geoSIMS community.              Last Modified: 11/04/2019       Submitted by: Kevin D Mckeegan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
