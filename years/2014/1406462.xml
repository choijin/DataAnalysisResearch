<AbstractNarration>Hydrogen embrittlement, a sudden and catastrophic failure, of metallic structures, accounts for losses equal to 3 percent of the gross domestic product.  This enhanced failure mechanism presents a significant challenge to transitioning from a fossil fuel powered transportation system to one powered by hydrogen.  For this to occur, the mechanisms by which hydrogen enhances the failure must be discovered.  This advance will enable design of alloys for use in hydrogen environments as well as development of models to predict component lifetime. This experimental collaborative effort between UW-Madison and Cornell University seeks to identify the fundamental mechanisms driving the hydrogen-enhanced failure.   Students educated in this effort will gain international experience through collaboration with faculty at Kyushu University in Japan and their International Institute for Carbon Neutral Energy Research.  In addition, the PIs will develop and distribute engineering based in-class activities that emphasize mechanical properties of metallic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deleterious impact of a hydrogen environment on the mechanical properties of metallic structures is well-documented and yet the fundamental mechanisms driving the enhanced sudden failure remain elusive.  This collaborative effort will employ a multi-scale experimental approach designed to test the premise that solute hydrogen can accelerate the evolution of the microstructure (strain) and it, along with attendant high hydrogen concentration, establishes the local conditions that determine the fracture path and mechanism. The influence of hydrogen on the evolution of microscale lattice strains and orientations will be probed dynamically using high energy x-ray diffraction and in-situ mechanical loading at Cornell High-energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). This effort will be coupled with post-loading microstructure characterization in the TEM of materials loaded to varying degrees of strain under different conditions, including those used in the in-situ testing.  Confirmation of the premise will provide a basis for design of hydrogen tolerant microstructures as well as for physically-based predictive models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Hydrogen embrittlement is the sudden failure of metallic structures in a hydrogen-rich environment.  It is ubiquitous, occurring in all but a few metals and alloys.  A challenge is that component failures occur at applied loads well below the design limit and the failure occurs abruptly with no advanced warning, which can have catastrophic consequences.  The failure may result in loss of revenue through loss of production as well as equipment replacement and depending on the application may have significant environmental impact.  Although the phenomenon has been documented for over a century, the fundamental relationship between the deformation state generated in the presence of hydrogen and the unexpected cracking remains to be revealed.  This lack of understanding prohibits development of physically-based models to predict the performance of a metal in a hydrogen environment.    This study examined over multiple length scales the deformation state produced under different modes of loading in both pure metals and alloys in the absence and presence of hydrogen gas.   At each length scale, and independent of the metallic system and loading mode, the deformation states generated in the absence and presence of hydrogen were dissimilar.  The state produced in the presence of hydrogen was always more advanced and more complex than in the absence of hydrogen despite the premature failure.  Qualitative connections between the deformation state and the failure mode were established.  These connections can serve as the foundation on which to build physically-based models to predict performance of metals in hydrogen environments.   Over the course of this project two gradaute students and one post-doctoral fellow were supported.   The output of this effort has been reported at professional conferences and in peer reviewed journals.               Last Modified: 09/30/2018       Submitted by: Ian M Robertson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
