<AbstractNarration>Increasing the safety of high-capacity, high-discharge rate batteries is essential for all battery technologies.  The safety problems stem from the breakdown of membranes separating the positive and negative poles of the battery.  Such events lead to short-circuits leading to overheating and fires. Polymers for these membranes must be strong, temperature resilient, and have very small uniform pores. Successful preparation and use of these new materials could raise the specific energy of batteries to 200 Wh/kg, making possible a new generation of electrical vehicles with longer range, lower weight, higher speed, and better safety standards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is focused on new approaches to resolve this problem of safe membranes by evaluating the platform technology of aramid nanofibers membranes recently invented at University of Michigan.  They are made from well-known Kevlar and show exceptional resilience to high temperature as well as high strength.  Aramid nanofiber sheets can be potentially applicable for a wide spectrum of batteries.  In the course of this project the team will establish the technological potential of the nanofiber-based membranes for automotive industry and consumer electronics producers.  The team will also evaluate other potential uses of aramid nanofiber  membranes for filtration and desalination.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our team has evaluated commercial potential of novel ion-conducting membranes (ICMs) made of aramid nanofibers (ANFs).  A wide range of applications in the energy storage, filtration, and advanced materials fields was identified at the onset of the project.  During the iCorp-funded customer interview process we focused primarily on energy storage and set of technologies including lithium-batteries, thin-film batteries, redox flow batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells.  With the help of iCorp instructors, we evaluated various commercialization routes for this technology.  After more than 120 detailed customer interviews, we identified separators, i.e. the thin membranes preventing the short-circuiting between anode and cathode, as the most promising areas for realization of the technological potential of ANF membranes. The problems with ICMs have received much less attention than materials for anodes and cathodes, however, they are equally significant for enhancing our future energy landscape and multitude of battery users. We learned that it is possible and technologically essential to raise the specific energy of batteries to allow electric vehicles with longer range, lower weight, higher speed, and better safety standards.  Electric vehicles and non-intermittent solar/wind energy conversion will be strongly impacted by the appearance new, disruptive ion-conducting membranes. A new generation of electrical vehicles with longer range, lower weight, higher speed, and better safety standards will also be enabled by new membranes.  In the course of this project, we also calculated the economic viability of ANF membranes and created its prototypes for calculating the expected cost of new ICMs.  The initial estimates gave us assessments in the range of $10 per sq. ft.  It was too high to compete with current materials that have the cost ca. $1-2 per sq. ft.   The team looked at both market opportunities and technological foundation of ANF-based ICMs to find the cost-benefit match for this technology.  It was successful and we were able to reduce the expected costs to $2.0 per sq.ft.  We also further simplified the methods to manufacture the ANF-based ICMs completing a roll-to-roll production prototype.        The team continues the project "full steam" and the company "Elegus Technologies" was formed.  As a result of iCorp experience and better understanding the customer needs we were able to form a partnership with XALT Power Systems and raise more than $250,000.  We are currently working on the manufacturing the new membranes in Detroit area.        Last Modified: 07/22/2015       Submitted by: Nicholas A Kotov]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
