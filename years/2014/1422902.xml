<AbstractNarration>The project develops and compares cutting edge methods for the classification and analysis of American scientific research and compares them to existing manually generated approaches.  The project examines the strengths and weaknesses of four computational approaches: topic models, network-based partitioning methods, Wikipedia-based labeling, and an active-learning approach. In particular, the research examines whether or not the different approaches can correctly classify established research areas and discover emerging fields across a broad range of disciplines.  Each approach is evaluated based on a set of metrics measuring effectiveness, computational costs, human oversight costs, and the need to retain consistency with existing classification frameworks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work directly responds to a number of National Academies recommendations and National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) reports that suggest using computational approaches to classify scientific research fields. A longer-term impact is improvement in data collection, processing, and reporting of key national statistics on science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In this final year, we completed three exciting aspects of the funded project. First, we&nbsp;were able to directly identify and extract methods from grants (and papers) with significantly higher precision, and substantially greater (more than double) recall of any other published method. This approach drew on the implicit crowd-sourcing of the web, and specifically involved classifying methods as a function of text on pages that described them as methods or in methodological contexts.

We did this by projecting sections of abstract, proposals and articles (e.g., &ldquo;abstract&rdquo;, &ldquo;introduction&rdquo;, &ldquo;literature review&rdquo;, &ldquo;methods section&rdquo;, &ldquo;findings&rdquo;, &ldquo;discussion&rdquo;, &ldquo;conclusion&rdquo;) across many fields into a single latent space and identifying the regularity with which these sections were distinct from each other and in precisely what ways.</p> <p>Third, we developed high performance and novel topic modeling techniques to identify textual or discursive influence across millions of articles, which will has (and will continue to) enable the identification and classification of those facets (e.g., methods, topics, etc.) responsible for that influence. This approach to the identification of direct scholarly influence allowed us to &ldquo;diagnose&rdquo; the cognitive and political bias of citations, and to use this discursive measure alongside citations to both capture a full-spectrum influence, and also to identify its source. For example, important dataset contributions are almost always captured by citations and not discourse, while popular new concepts are often captured by discourse, but not citations, especially if they originated beyond one&rsquo;s field. The paper associated with this last contribution was published in PNAS in 2018, while the earlier two contributions are still winding their way through the review process.</p> <p>In summary, this grant has enabled us to &ldquo;move the needle&rdquo; to identify grant proposal and abstract facets that could allow the federal government to account for, index, and manage its research as a portfolio.
