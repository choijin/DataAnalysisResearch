<AbstractNarration>This research will provide critical information on the Sin Nombre Virus (SNV) that can help improve the safety of hundreds of thousands of National Park visitors each year, as well as involve two graduate students and a postdoctoral scientist. Many diseases that affect humans (e.g. Lyme disease, hantaviruses, West Nile disease, rabies, toxoplasmosis) are zoonotic diseases, i.e. diseases where an animal is the primary host for the disease.  As a result, understanding the ecological forces that govern the prevalence of disease in animals is very important for understanding human disease risk. However, predicting disease prevalence can be difficult because the size of animal populations is likely affected by both predators and by resource availability (e.g. the amount of food available for animals). Understanding how predators and resource availability interact to affect host populations may be further complicated by extreme climatic events that may become more common under future climate scenarios, since climate (e.g. the amount of annual precipitation) often determines resource availability. In addition, human activities are changing the worldwide distribution of top predators, likely affecting the nature of predator effects on animal populations. Despite the importance of understanding how predators and climate shape disease, such research is challenging because predators are rarely known with certainty, and because extreme climatic events may occur so rapidly that it is difficult to study them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will use multiple island ecosystems where predator diversity is known, providing an unprecedented opportunity to understand how extreme climatic events and predator diversity affect the prevalence of Sin Nombre Virus (SNV), which causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a severe disease in humans. Specifically, this research entails measuring SNV prevalence in deer mice on the California Channel Islands during and after a drought more severe than any drought in the last 500 years. These data, especially when coupled with existing pre-drought data, provide a rare opportunity to understand the interplay between extreme climatic events and predators in affecting large-scale prevalence of disease, and also provides an opportunity to evaluate the novel hypothesis that predator diversity reduces the rate at which disease prevalence rebounds in animal populations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many diseases that have significant effects on human health (e.g., Lyme disease, Zika virus, rabies) are diseases that exist in animal populations and can be transmitted to humans.  Sin Nombre virus is found in wild deer mice and can have serious human health consequences, including very high rates of mortality in infected humans (e.g., approximately 40% of cases).  Understanding the factors that affect animal-borne diseases, such as Sin Nombre virus, is essential for being able to predict situations where human disease risk is greatest.  However, our ability to predict disease risk is limited because the relationships between ecological factors and disease can be complex and are poorly understood.  For example, rainfall might affect Sin Nombre virus in rodent populations by fueling the growth of plants rodents eat, leading to increases in rodent density and disease transmission.  Alternatively, the diversity of rodent predators might reduce Sin Nombre virus in rodent populations by serving to keep rodent populations under tighter control, reducing transmission and lowering prevalence.  Understanding the role of precipitation and rodent predator diversity is particularly important because data suggest that both are changing.  Climatic extremes are becoming more common: many parts of the world are experiencing record-setting droughts, while other parts of the world are experiencing increased frequency and severity of precipitation events.  Predator diversity is also highly variable in time and space: humans frequently introduce predators to areas where they have been eliminated, introduce them to areas where they have never existed, and also drive predators locally extinct from areas they have historically occupied.  Despite the potential importance of precipitation and predator diversity in affecting the prevalence of this disease, evaluating these factors is difficult because few systems exist where there are large-scale precipitation data that are coupled with precise data on the diversity of predators.  This research project is the first project to evaluate the potential interaction between precipitation and predator diversity in affecting the prevalence of Sin Nombre Virus in wild mice.  This project obtained 2,941 samples from mice across all 8 of the California Channel Islands for four years, representing an unprecedented large-scale, long-term dataset on Sin Nombre virus.  When coupled with historical data from 1994, the results demonstrate that precipitation plays a significant role in affecting the large-scale prevalence of Sin Nombre virus: the recent drought that has affected the Channel Islands (as well as much of California) has resulted in reducing Sin Nombre virus prevalence by more than half on some islands.  The reduction in Sin Nombre virus caused by drought may have been sufficient to remove the virus from two of the islands where it was historically found in low prevalence, as we did not detect Sin Nombre virus on those two islands despite levels of sampling that were well in excess of historical sampling efforts.  These results provide important insight into how extreme climatic events may affect the large-scale prevalence of disease: climatic events that reduce host density, such as drought that reduces rodent abundance, may cause large drops in disease prevalence.  Although the analyses are not fully finalized, preliminary analyses suggest that drought has primacy in Sin Nombre virus dynamics, as predator diversity was not strongly associated with decreases in Sin Nombre virus in post-drought years when Sin Nombre virus prevalence was much lower than historical levels.  Combined with previous research in this system, this finding suggests that there may be some thresholds of disease prevalence that govern when and where predator diversity becomes important for affecting disease prevalence and thus human disease risk.  Given the projected increases in climatic variability and the rapid loss of top predators from fragmented terrestrial systems, these results are expected to have implications that extend beyond insular systems. In addition to illustrating the overarching role of precipitation in affecting large-scale and long-term disease prevalence, the results of the project help directly inform the risk of human virus exposure on the California Channel Islands, an area that receives over 250,000 visitors a year.  In the course of conducting this research, a novel method for tracking the timing of rodent activity was also developed:  this new method should help researchers test many new ideas regarding how changes in the environment and predators affect the timing of animal activity.  This project has provided training opportunities for one postdoctoral researcher, three graduate students, two undergraduates, and two recent graduates; 3 of the project personnel were from groups underrepresented in STEM fields.  In addition, case studies from this work are used in Introductory Biology and Behavioral Ecology lectures at UW-Madison, serving to inform and enrich the learning of approximately 1,100 undergraduates during each year of the 4-year project.
