<AbstractNarration>The Transmission Control Protocol and its socket interface are used by most network applications today---viewed as a software program, it is likely the most popular one in the world. Over thirty years old, this program is now showing signs of age. Web, mobile, and embedded applications use it in unanticipated ways (many interacting flows of different lengths with different objectives); it does not properly support mobile devices with multiple networks; it does not allow an application to adapt quickly to changing network conditions; it does not work well in fast datacenter networks; and it has a fruitless, adversarial relationship with in-network "middleboxes".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;App-Centric Transport (ACT) aims to solve these problems. Unlike today's transport architecture, ACT takes application objectives into account in making its transmission decisions.  ACT uses a computer-generated transmission control program, which takes models of the workload and objectives to automatically synthesize protocols.  This program (Remy) serves both as a way to implement protocols and as a design tool to answer fundamental questions about congestion control. ACT explores centralized control over transmission and path selection for datacenters, and uses machine learning classifiers to select the best network on mobile devices. It aims to resolve tussles between endpoint transport and in-network middleboxes by viewing middlebox interposition as a generalization of multi-path transport. Project participants are collaborating with Facebook and Google on some of these ideas. The education plan introduces protocol design contests where students can run and measure their protocols over trace data and compare their protocols on a leaderboard.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project outcomes fall into the broad area of ``application specific network protocols.''  Specific results include:  analysis of the tension between ubiquitous encryption and lawful surveillance a Baysian network model of FB data mining for the prediction of voting behavior improvement of Tor security through trust aware path selection efficient two party secure function evaluation using Intel's Software Guard Extensions a low latency and tracking resistant protocol for local area anonymous communication a scalable protocol for bias resistant distributed randomness a cryptographic protocols for privacy preserving, lawful contact chaining a database architecture for privacy preserving, cryptographic credentials from federated online identities a reputation management system that supports tracking resistant anonymous reputations, and a distributed system for witness co-signing that proactively protects authorities and their clients from undetected exploits and misuse   In addition to the PI, six PhD students and one research scientist received partial support from this award.  All but one of these project participants have completed their training at Yale and are now employed as researchers; one is in academia, and the other five are in industrial research labs.  Widespread interest in the work supported by this award on law-enforcement access to encrypted data was influential in the Association for Computing Machinery's decision to initiate an activity in Computer Science and Law.
