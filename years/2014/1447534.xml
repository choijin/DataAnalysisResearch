<AbstractNarration>Data are often modeled as matrices; and, as a result, linear algebraic algorithms such as matrix decompositions have proven extremely successful in the analysis of many data sets.  Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA) integrates the complementary perspectives that Theoretical Computer Science and Numerical Linear Algebra bring to matrix computations, and it is a new paradigm for the design and analysis of such algorithms and for using the resulting insight to solve important scientific and societal problems.  Current RandNLA algorithms extract linear structure from data matrices.  The proposed work will extend RandNLA methods to multi-linear and other non-linear structure in data matrices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the proposed work will investigate two important, non-linear, structural settings in order to start making progress towards using RandNLA approaches in situations where the underlying data exhibit non-linear structure: it will investigate how to design the next generation of RandNLA algorithms that can handle data that exhibit multi-linear structures captured by tensors; and it will investigate the applicability of RandNLA approaches to data that exhibit non-linear structure, as captured by non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques, local spectral methods, and related semi-supervised eigenvector tools. In addition, it will evaluate the proposed approaches on data applications where the PIs have significant expertise, such as the statistical analysis of population genetics data and astronomical data.  Broader impacts of the project include graduate and undergraduate training, workshops and code development for RandNLA.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research supported extensions of Randomized Linear Algebra techniques beyond core Randomized Linear Algebra to include non-linear, multi-linear, first- and second-order optimization, and other areas.  The theoretical methods used are central to the theoretical foundations of large-scale data analysis, and the broader impact lies in the usefulness of these methods in domains such as genetics, mass spec imaging, astronomy.  Major accomplishments include demonstrating that Randomized Linear Algebra methods can improve first-order and second-order optimization, that they can be used with local methods such as local spectral methods to identify non-linear structure in large-scale data, and that they can be used with multi-linear and non-negative constraints.  Implementations and applications of these methods in several scientific big data domains, including tera-byte scale implementations of low-rank approximation, and applications in astronomy, physics, and climate science.  In terms of broader impact, major summer schools associated with SIAM (G2S3) and IAS (PCMI) were organized to disseminate these and related techniques to a broad range of students; and workshops and meetings such as MMDS 2016 and the Simons Institute program on Foundations of data were organized.  Related to these were articles such as a review article in CACM and a summary in SIAM News highlighting these events.
