<AbstractNarration>Title: Novel alloys based on nitride semiconductors for ultraviolet light emitters and high-efficiency power electronics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical description: &lt;br/&gt;The nitride semiconductors, including gallium nitride (GaN), aluminum nitride (AlN), and indium nitride (InN) are the enabling materials for solid-state lighting based on light-emitting diodes.  These materials are also used in power electronics, particularly for achieving power conversion (between alternating and direct current) with much higher efficiencies. In both areas, fabrication of high-quality nitride alloys with larger energy band gaps is desirable.  In optoelectronics this will enable ultraviolet light emitters; in power electronics, higher voltage transistors. Computational theory, in tight collaboration with materials growth and characterization, will be used to accelerate these developments by exploring suitable alloy compositions and novel layer structures based on an atomistic, quantum-mechanical description of the materials.  The results will have a strong impact on technologies ranging from optical data storage to water purification.  Graduate and undergraduate students will benefit from the tight collaboration between theory and experiment. Outreach will take advantage of the Allosphere facility at the California Nanosystems Institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description: &lt;br/&gt;Computational and experimental efforts will be tightly coupled to address the development of materials and heterostructures based on wide-band-gap nitride semiconductors.  First-principles calculations based on cutting-edge theoretical techniques will be performed, yielding the most accurate description currently available at the system sizes needed for modeling defects and heterostructures.  Topics to be addressed include alignment of band structures at interfaces, polarization properties, identification of suitable dopants, the role of unintentional impurities, and devising strategies for avoiding detrimental defects. The growth will be carried out by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) or ammonia MBE.  The materials to be explored include AlN and Al-rich AlGaN and InAlN alloys, as well as a largely unexplored novel alloy system, namely BAlN. Closing the loop between theory and experiment will provide deep understanding of fundamental atomic-level mechanisms and phenomena associated with synthesis and processing, benefiting the research training of graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

These materials are also used in power electronics, particularly for achieving power conversion (between alternating and direct current) with much higher efficiencies.  In both areas, fabrication of high-quality nitride alloys with larger energy band gaps is desirable.  In optoelectronics this will enable ultraviolet light emitters; in power electronics, higher voltage transistors. Computational theory, in tight collaboration with materials growth and characterization, was used to accelerate these developments by exploring suitable alloy compositions and novel layer structures based on an atomistic, quantum-mechanical description of the materials.   Alloy materials studied in the course of the project included AlGaN, InAlN, and novel boron-containing alloys such as BAlN and BGaN.  Defects and impurities may lead to electronic levels that can severely impact devices.   A new methodology for calculating capture cross sections of point defects and impurities was developed to enable direct comparison with deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) and deep-level optical spectroscopy (DLOS).    Random BGaN alloys were grown using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).    In parallel, computational studies were performed of the electronic properties of BAlN and BGaN alloys, producing detailed results on band-gap bowing and crossover from direct to indirect gap.  Techniques for growing high-quality InAlN films across the entire range of alloy compositions were developed, enabling a full characterization of the alloy across the entire compositional range.  Results for p-type doping of boron nitride polymorphs and on n-type doping of AlN and AlGaN were obtained.   Specific results were reported for defects giving rise to yellow luminescence, point defects in AlN, hydrogen in BN, and brittle fracture toughnesses of GaN and AlN.  17 papers have been published over the course of the project; 19 invited and 4 plenary talks were given.  The research results obtained here will aid the development of compact UV light sources, which impact a wide range of technologies, including photolithography, optical data storage, detection of hazardous particles, water or air purification, and sterilization.  High-power electronics can lead to tremendous energy savings in power conversion.   Six graduate students were trained in the course of the project; four obtained their PhD and moved on to industrial or academic positions.   Broader groups of students benefited through regular group meetings and seminars about the research at the department and college level.  Examples from DMREF research were included in the courses taught by the principal investigators and in outreach programs and public lectures.
