<AbstractNarration>Tick-borne diseases pose a significant and growing global health burden due to the expanding range of tick vectors, reservoir hosts, and pathogens, as well as a suite of other environmental pressures.  Lyme disease is the most prevalent tick-borne disease in the US and the vast majority of cases occur in the Northeast.  Over the past forty years, it has rapidly spread from southern New England through Maine as well as through the Upper Midwest.  Despite its epidemiological importance, the source and trajectory of the ongoing invasion remains poorly described.  This project harnesses the tools of next generation sequencing to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the Lyme disease bacteria, Borrelia burgdorferi.  Surveying the genomic diversity of the pathogen will allow us to infer the probable origin of invasion and pathways of spread and will inform a better understanding of the environmental or ecological factors driving the emergence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resolving the invasion history of B. burgdorferi will inform models of continued spatial spread and targeted control measures for this important human pathogen.  Further, this project will support the research of a team of three female scientists and the training of at least four undergraduate assistants, including women and minorities, and several high school students in field ecology, epidemiology, and evolutionary genomics techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Lyme disease was first described in Lyme, Connecticut in 1976 and over the past forty years, it has rapidly spread across the Northeast and Midwest United States. Lyme disease is now the most commonly reported vector-borne disease in the United States; the CDC reported 30,000 cases of Lyme disease in 2013 although the true burden of disease is estimated to be ten times greater.  Despite its public health importance, the source and history of the ongoing invasion remains poorly understood.  Why was Lyme disease first described in Connecticut and why in the seventies? Where did it come from and what is driving its ongoing emergence?  This project seeks to reconstruct the invasion history of the Lyme disease bacteria, Borrelia burgdorferi, using bacterial genomes.  Patterns of variation contained in bacterial genomes contain a signature of the history of the Lyme disease bacteria in North America.  We have collected hundreds of ticks infected with B. burgdorferi from across North America and have sequenced 160 bacterial genomes.  This has allowed us to reconstruct the trajectory of Lyme disease spread across North America and will contribute to an understanding of how B. burgdorferi moves across space.  This will inform predictions about future spread of Lyme disease and will help target public health control and prevention measures.
