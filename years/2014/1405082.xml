<AbstractNarration>In this program we propose to invite a cohort of PREM undergraduate scholars who will engage their peers, materials researchers, from graduate students to PhD-level scientists and engineers, and other stakeholders in the materials research community at the 2013 Fall Meeting of the Materials Research Society.   The program will provide professional and leadership development, and networking opportunities for the students from the PREM attending the program. They will be able to present their research in a special poster session. In addition, they will be invited to join the MRS Mentoring Program. The program will also highlight the importance of excellence, integrity, and service in the interest of society as guiding principles in science and engineering careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For the first time, MRS hosted undergraduate students for a two-day program culminating in a poster competition that took place on Monday afternoon.  The students were part of an NSF-sponsored Partnership for Research and Education in Materials (PREM) program that promotes materials research in minority-serving institutions (MSI) to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields.  The mission of the program is to develop a diverse community of graduate students who are engaged in materials research and who will have the knowledge and skills to become leaders and innovators.  This mission is based on the assertion that diverse talent can be developed through effective mentoring, preparation, and network building through positive involvement in organizations that promote materials research such as MRS.  Seventeen undergraduate students, with more than half of them being women, participated from ten MSIs across the US.  Three students received awards: Brandon Newton (Jackson State University), Milana Jones (Xavier University of Louisiana), and Horaco Gutierrez (University of Texas Pan Am).  All participants greatly impressed the judges.  This highly successful initiative, sponsored by NSF, several partner MRSECs, the Materials Research Society Foundation and Angstrom Engineering, included a tour of MIT and Harvard University; a poster-training session; a networking luncheon with keynote speaker Dr. Christine Ortiz, Professor of Materials Science ad Engineering and Dean for Graduate Education at MIT, and a special mentoring workshop.  The students had opportunities to attend technical sessions and engage graduate students as well as senior researchers from universities (including MRSEC directors), national laboratories, and industry.  Alla Zamarayeva, a senior at City College of New York, praised the program:  "This has been an outstanding opportunity for us not only to attend the MRS meeting but also to receive tremendously helpful information.  I am super excited about materials research!"  Credit for developing programs to support the MRS diversity mission goes to the Chair of the MRS Diversity Subcommittee, Dr. Magaly Spector, and MRS Manager of Volunteer Affairs, Michele Feder, who are both grateful for NSF support and partnership with MRS and both look forward to the extension of the Mentoring Program to undergraduate students, starting with the PREM students.  The PREM program highlighted the importance of excellence, integrity, and service in the interest of society as guiding principles in science and engineering careers.
