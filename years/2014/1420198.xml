<AbstractNarration>This broadening participation research project will contribute to foundational knowledge about how college students with learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, and autism spectrum disorders learn statistics in an on-line course when the instructor and the students participate in discussions at the same time or when the discussions are asynchronous.  Students with these types of disabilities are the largest group of students with disabilities taking courses at our nation's colleges and universities.  Online postsecondary STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education is growing at a rapid rate with little research conducted about how students with disabilities learn in this environment.  Additionally, as college faculty engage students in on-line discussions and classes, the varied timing of the information delivered may negatively or positively impact how students learn STEM content. While there have been several studies to support a positive relationship between the increased presence of the instructor during on-line courses and student satisfaction with online discussions and online learning performance, there is a need to determine if learning is maximized when the instructor is or is not present and the interactions with the instructor are asynchronous. This is an even more critical issue for students with disabilities who have deficits in executive function, which may negatively impact their on-line learning and which may be lessened by the presence of the faculty during instruction.  Knowing more about how college students with learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, and autism spectrum disorders learn statistics in an on-line course, when faculty-led discussions are varied between synchronous and asynchronous formats, has great potential to lead to improvements in how these students with disabilities learn STEM and how college faculty teach on-line STEM courses.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project leaders at Landmark College will determine the best ways to investigate how college students with learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, and autism spectrum disorders learn statistics in an on-line course when the instructor-led discussions are either synchronous or asynchronous.   Students with these disabilities typically exhibit difficulties with executive function, which negatively impacts learning, and which may be mitigated by the presence of an instructor during on-line learning.  Using social presence theory as the grounding for their work, the researchers will conduct an exploratory study to examine the research question: Does the inclusion of instructor-mediated virtual synchronous discussions of online statistics content result in improved conceptual understanding of statistics concepts for students with disabilities?  The hypothesis for this work is that students with disabilities learning introductory college statistics online will develop a deeper understanding of statistics concepts following synchronous, as compared to asynchronous, virtual instructor-mediated discussions.  At the completion of the project, it is anticipated that results will inform future basic and applied educational research about students with and without disabilities learning STEM in on-line courses. The results of this work are expected to be shared with education researchers and the public in professional publications.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Despite the exponential growth in online programs at the postsecondary level, many questions remain about the effectiveness of online learning for students with disabilities. Assessing the effectiveness of online learning for this student population is complicated by the many ways in which the content is delivered. Some delivery methods include synchronous interactions, such as when all students participate in a video chat at the same time. Other online courses include asynchronous interactions, where students can log in and post or engage with the online content on their own time. Each of these formats affects student engagement differently and the goal of this project was to add to our understanding of social presence theory and how students learn and engage with each other in online statistics courses.</p> <p>The results of our research revealed several key findings. Our predictions prior to data collection were guided by social presence theory. The theory predicts that students who see others in their online class as colleague they can socially interact with will be more engaged with the course and will have better learning outcome than students who feel more disconnected from their peers. The theory also predicts that synchronous discussion should facilitate stronger social engagement than asynchronous interactions. Student feedback in interviews and focus groups indicated that most preferred the synchronous discussions and felt they were more engaged and learned better in those discussions. What was surprising however was that when we looked at students? gains on tests of conceptual understanding, students in the synchronous condition did no better after the discussions than before, but the students in the asynchronous discussions showed some improvement.</p> <p>These findings are important because they highlight the discrepancy we sometimes see between how students perceive a learning interaction and whether it actually improves their performance. Most of the research on social presence theory relies on students? self-reported impressions off the interventions and future research in this area needs to take this finding into consideration. Many of the students likely did prefer the synchronous interactions and enjoyed them better. Synchronous interactions however tend to be fast and require a lot of language processing, attention, and knowledge of social norms. These are all areas which can be challenging for many students with disabilities.</p> <p>To explain this discrepancy, we analyzed the video recordings of the online discussions. Students seemed to struggle because of a number of factors. Based on the videos and feedback from the students, some had a difficult time keeping up with the speed of the discussions. Others found some of the video feeds coming from other students distracting. While others still had a hard time figuring out when and how to participate in the discussion. These are all areas that a broad range of students struggle with. Another area where we noticed a difference between the discussions is with technical issues. While technical issues tended to happen occasionally in both formats, they had a much bigger impact in the synchronous discussions because it usually meant that the student would join the discussion late or not at all.&nbsp;</p> <p>This research has also contributed to looking at assessments for students with disabilities. Analysis of the data from this project showed that many students struggled with some of the statistics word problems used in this study. Specifically, a subset of the students tended to do worse on word problems that had very long sentences. By using a model comparison approach with Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models, we were able to statistically demonstrate this and provide a methodology to explore the impact of factors that are not part of the intended assessment even when the data is noisy and includes a mix of students. This result is particularly important because many decisions in education are made based on the results of tests that may not be valid for a significant number of students taking them. When decisions are made based on bad data, they tend to result in wasted resources and poor outcomes.</p> <p>The results of this research will help to inform ways that we can make online learning and learning assessments more accessible and effective for students with disabilities. Our findings however are not unique to this population and it is likely that any improvements made to help students struggling with language processing, attention, or social engagement will benefit all students learning online.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/20/2018<br>      Modified by: Ibrahim&nbsp;H&nbsp;Dahlstrom-Hakki</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1420198/1420198_10373497_1545363373734__207_(800x533)_400_267shar-80_s_c1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1420198/1420198_10373497_1545363373734__207_(800x533)_400_267shar-80_s_c1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Working with a student in the lab"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1420198/1420198_10373497_1545363373734__207_(800x533)_400_267shar-80_s_c1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Working with a student in the lab"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This is an image of Dr. Dahlstrom-Hakki working with a student in the Landmark College Innovation Lab.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Landmark College</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ibrahim&nbsp;H&nbsp;Dahlstrom-Hakki</div> <div class="imageTitle">Working with a student in the lab</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1420198/1420198_10373497_1545363156005_VoiceThread--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1420198/1420198_10373497_1545363156005_VoiceThread--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Threaded Video Discussion Software"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1420198/1420198_10373497_1545363156005_VoiceThread--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Threaded Video Discussion Software"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">VoiceThread was used as the asynchronous platform to allow students to conduct asynchronous video discussions with each other.</div> <div class="imageCredit">VoiceThread</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ibrahim&nbsp;H&nbsp;Dahlstrom-Hakki</div> <div class="imageTitle">Threaded Video Discussion Software</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1420198/1420198_10373497_1545362160371_CanvasVideoConferencing--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1420198/1420198_10373497_1545362160371_CanvasVideoConferencing--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Video Conferencing Software"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1420198/1420198_10373497_1545362160371_CanvasVideoConferencing--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Video Conferencing Software"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">BigBlueButton was used as the synchronous video conferencing platform in this study.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Instructure, Inc</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ibrahim&nbsp;H&nbsp;Dahlstrom-Hakki</div> <div class="imageTitle">Video Conferencing Software</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
