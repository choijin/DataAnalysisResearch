<AbstractNarration>This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site is focused on recruiting community college students and providing them with technical experience and training that will assist them to obtain a STEM degree. While ~80% of community college students plan to get a bachelor's degree, only ~10% achieve this goal, mainly due to academic hurdles that include insufficient funds and insufficient professional development. Through this REU award, the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations (CDEBI) will provide research opportunities for 24 (8 per year) highly motivated community college students interested in environmental microbiology. Students will participate in an 8-week residential program based at the University of Southern California. Working in select labs, these cohorts will learn DNA sequencing techniques, microbial culturing, light and electron microscopy, and analytical chemistry to fully characterize novel bacterial and archaeal isolates from marine environments of interest to C-DEBI. The students will be mentored individually by a scientist and a graduate student or postdoc, and they will benefit from group activities and multi-lab meetings. In addition to the research component, the program will provide professional development activities that focus on successful transfer to a 4-year university and the application procedures for admission to graduate school.</AbstractNarration>

students interested in expanding their science horizons and learning research skills associated with environmental microbiology.&nbsp; C4 was first tested as a pilot study within the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations (C-DEBI), an NSF Science &amp; Technology Center. &nbsp;After a successful run as a non-residential program for Los Angeles community college students, the program was expanded into a residential program at the University of Southern California (USC) with a nationwide recruitment strategy and funded by a 3-year NSF REU grant. &nbsp;As part of the C4 program, cohorts of 8 students a year spent 9 summer weeks characterizing the physiology (cellular function) and phylogeny (evolutionary history) of 1-2 recently isolated, novel bacteria. &nbsp;C4 students worked individually and in teams, learning and applying state-of-the-art techniques ranging from DNA sequencing to microscopy and sterile techniques to analytical chemistry. &nbsp;Our long-term objectives were to attract and retain students in STEM majors, have them earn undergraduate degrees in STEM, and continue onto graduate school and/or STEM careers. &nbsp;During the program we strived to: 1) provide an integrated STEM research opportunity to research-limited, community college students from under-served and diverse socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds; 2) train community college students in several advanced laboratory techniques; expose them to a broad range of techniques; teach them to report, interpret, and present new data; and guide them to develop testable hypotheses around research questions and; 3) provide professional development resources during the program to inform students about STEM opportunities at 4-year universities, graduate school, and career pathways. &nbsp;On a broader scale, our REU was unique in that all participants worked on the same umbrella project, providing detailed and specific results and interpretations. &nbsp;We successfully delivered the proof-of-concept for a new REU model in geomicrobiology that relies on microbial ecophysiology and bioinformatics research.</p> <p>The C4 students, in collaboration with PI Amend and several postdocs, generated original data in the characterization of several novel bacteria from marine systems.&nbsp; These studies resulted in 5 manuscripts, of which 3 are published and 2 will soon be submitted to peer-reviewed journals. &nbsp;C4 students are authors on each of these papers, including as lead author on 3 of them.&nbsp; <em>Geothermobacter</em> strains HR-1 and EPR-M are iron-reducers isolated, respectively, from the Loihi Seamount, Hawai&rsquo;i and a deep-sea hydrothermal vent on the East Pacific Rise; <em>Hydrogenovibrio</em> strain SC-1 is a chemolithoautotrophic sulfur and iron oxidizer from near-shore waters of Catalina Island, California; and Zetaproteobacterium strain EBB-1 is an iron-oxidizing chemolithoautotroph isolated from an Fe-S mineral.</p> <p>In addition to the research components, a bioinformatics course and professional development seminars were built into the program. &nbsp;None of the twenty-four students had any previous experience with bioinformatics, but by the end of the project, all were capable of interpreting genomic databases and generating phylogenetic trees. &nbsp;These skills are crucial for all future work in microbiology and general biological sciences. &nbsp;Further, several students incorporated their new bioinformatics skills into their undergraduate and even graduate studies. &nbsp;Students also met weekly to participate in professional development seminars to learn transferable skills like how to set up an effective LinkedIn profile and how to succeed in graduate school.</p> <p>Part of the recruitment process was to ensure that we not only had motivated and talented students, but they came from diverse backgrounds. &nbsp;Our cohorts consisted of an even split of male and female identified students, 13 students were from underrepresented minority groups with 1 veteran and 2 LGBTQ+ students, 17 were low income and 20 students identified as first generation college students.&nbsp; Of the 24 total students, 19 have transferred to a four-year institution (the other 5 are still at their community college), 5 students have graduated, and 5 are in graduate school/been accepted to graduate school.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/25/2019<br>      Modified by: Stephanie&nbsp;Schroeder</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent"
