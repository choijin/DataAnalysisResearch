<AbstractNarration>Classical imaging is limited in sensitivity and resolution by the statistical noise properties of the light used to create the images.  In everyday life a classical description of light usually suffices; however this leads to limitations on both the sensitivity of detecting objects as well as the resolution with which one can detect them that are not fundamental.  Using a quantum mechanical description of the light, "non-classical" light fields can be envisioned that will lead to better detection sensitivity and imaging resolution than with classical light.  Using non-linear optical properties of certain materials, non-classical light fields can be created and these fields can be investigated to see how much better they are than the classical limits.  Such "quantum illumination" has been shown to be capable of improved detection sensitivity, but has not been demonstrated in an imaging situation before, where very different detector and light-source technologies are required. These techniques are especially useful at very low light levels, and thus are interesting in the field of imaging of live biological tissues where one would like to avoid damage to the tissue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been demonstrated that four-wave mixing in atomic vapors can generate light with interesting quantum properties, and do so under conditions where non-trivial imaging is possible.  This project takes advantage of the development of this light source to investigate three distinct ideas:  the "SU(1,1)" interferometer which potentially exceeds the sensitivity of conventional interferometers, the copier-phase sensitive amplifier (a low-noise optical amplifier for images), and quantum illumination for remote sensing.  The extent to which the advantages of quantum illumination and coherent detection can be achieved in practice will be investigated.  The work involves the investigation of newly introduced quantum techniques in the context of interferometric sensing and imaging, and it allows the further development of quantum-noise-limited imaging and detection. Quantum entanglement of the light beams could allow improvements in imaging, and have an impact on the study of quantum information processing techniques.  These techniques are especially useful at very low light levels, and thus are interesting in the field of imaging of live biological tissues in order to avoid damage to the tissue.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our research is centered on using the quantum-mechanical properties of light to improve measurements. The primary outcomes of this grant are that we have demonstrated a new way to measure an optical phase shift with higher precision using a new design for a phase-measuring device, and we have learned about general advantages and limitations to quantum-enhanced measurements.  Our new device is related to conventional optical interferometers, but makes use of quantum correlations (two-mode squeezing) in the light generated in a non-linear gain process inside of the device in order to improve its measurements.  We had examined a device that was proposed in the literature some years ago and decided that there was a simpler version of this device that could work just as well.  We determined theoretically that this was the case and we then built this simpler, "truncated" non-linear device.  In the laboratory the real device has its performance limited in a number of ways, the most important of which is that any optical loss in the system will degrade the sensitivity.  In addition, scattered light can be a problem, and this forces us to use detection methods that can selectively filter the light (homodyne detection). We have determined the optimal detection schemes under various conditions of gain and loss in the system.  We have also studied some of the fundamental limitations on this device and how the results obtained here can be generalized to other quantum-enhanced measurement schemes.  The Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) is the noise limit for a similar measurement made using only classical light sources &ndash; typically this means a laser.  For the same amount of light used in the measurement, our new nonlinear phase measuring device was shown to be more than a factor of two (4 dB) more sensitive than the SQL for a conventional optical interferometer. The hope is that, in the future, what we have learned can be applied to the improvement of our understanding of quantum metrology in general, where we can explore how taking advantage of the quantum properties of the systems involved can improve measurements.  In particular, the present results are related to work with other sensitive measuring devices such as interferometric gravity-wave detectors or low-light-level imaging devices for biomedical imaging or trace-chemical detection.  The project has contributed to the training of graduate students involved in the research and to the integration of faculty and students from an undergraduate institution (Williams College) into our research program.
