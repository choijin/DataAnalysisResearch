<AbstractNarration>This award supports fundamental research on additive manufacturing of metallic materials, in which the primary goal is to uncover the relationships between thermal processing cycles, microstructure, and mechanical properties in parts made through additive manufacturing. In the laser-based additive manufacturing techniques studied here, a powder feedstock material is delivered to a desired location, and a laser locally melts the powder to fuse it to the material below, building up a component one layer at a time. The thermal cycles generated by the subsequent laser passes affect the microstructure of the underlying material, and therefore the mechanical properties (e.g., strength and ductility) of the component. Here, two materials systems will be examined: a titanium alloy that undergoes diffusion-based phase transformation upon cooling, and a stainless steel alloy that undergoes diffusionless deformation-induced phase transformation upon mechanical loading. This research aims to: elucidate the effect of thermal history on the local microstructure and mechanical properties in additive manufactured materials, and develop physically based plasticity models that take into account the effect of thermal history, resulting microstructure, and microstructural evolution on the local plasticity properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additive manufacturing has great potential to transform U.S. manufacturing, allowing for the production of custom-designed structural components for countless applications where the cost to develop tools for forging, casting, or forming of metal components is not warranted for the small number required (e.g., replacement parts for aging Department of Defense airplanes, ships, and submarines) in an economical procedure with less waste material than traditional subtractive manufacturing.  Fundamental research will lead to the development of fully integrated computational models in which the processing parameters (e.g., laser power, path, and speed) are determined to produce an end net shape component with specified mechanical properties, providing the infrastructure for a design space with practically no limitations on geometries that can be fabricated.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For this award, fundamental research on the mechanical behavior of additive manufacturing (AM) of metallic materials was conducted.  AM is a layer-by-layer manufacturing technique that allows for the fabrication of components with complex shapes that cannot be fabricated with traditional manufacturing methods.  This research focused on laser-based powder-based AM in which 3D components are fabricated through a repetitive process of delivering powder metal feedstock to a desired location within a 2D horizontal slice of a 3D component, scanning a laser to melt the powder in the 2D layer, and allowing the melted material to cool and fuse to the material below.  The thermal cycles generated by the subsequent laser passes impacted the microstructure of the underlying material, and therefore the mechanical properties (e.g., strength and ductility) of the component.   The primary goal of this research was to uncover the relationships among thermal processing cycles, microstructure, and mechanical properties in parts made through AM. Two materials systems were examined: a titanium alloy, Ti-6Al-4V, which undergoes diffusion-based phase transformation upon cooling, and a stainless steel alloy, stainless steel 304L, which undergoes diffusionless deformation-induced phase transformation upon plastic deformation.   To achieve this goal, the microstructures of these additively manufactured materials were characterized, and correlated to the local thermal histories in the fabricated components to develop processing-structure links.  Models to link the thermal history, including influences from both changes in input linear heat input and location within a component, were developed.  Novel mechanical experiments were used to measure the multiaxial deformation (plasticity) behavior of these materials.  This was critical because the material of the complex shaped parts that AM can be used to fabricate will be subjected to location-dependent multiaxial stresses under load.  Therefore, in order to enable the use of AM for such structures, the stress-state dependent behavior must be understood.  Finally, predictive computational plasticity models were developed, calibrated, and validated.  In particular, for the stainless steel alloy, first a model was developed to incorporate the effect of chemistry (which was a function of both starting powder chemistry and thermal history), texture (a feature of the microstructure), and stress state on the microstructural-level phase transformation from a soft austenite phase to a stronger martensite phase.  Second, a plasticity model was developed and coupled to this microstructural model.  Due to its explicit link to the evolving microstructure, the plasticity model was able to capture and predict the stress-state-, texture-, and chemistry-dependent plasticity behavior of this alloy.  For Ti-6Al-4V, an anisotropic stress state-dependent plasticity model was developed, calibrated, and validated.  Both of these plasticity models are important because they allow for the prediction of the deformation behavior of these two additively manufactured materials under multiaxial loads, to which they will be exposed in service in structural applications.   In terms of broader impacts to society, AM has great potential to transform U.S. manufacturing, allowing for the production of custom-designed structural components for countless applications where the cost to develop tools for forging, casting, or forming of metal components is not warranted for the small number required (e.g., replacement parts for aging Department of Defense airplanes, ships, and submarines) in an economical procedure with less waste material than traditional subtractive manufacturing.  However, the adoption of AM necessitates studies such as this, which bring a fundamental scientific understanding of the mechanical behavior of these materials under complex multiaxial stress states.
