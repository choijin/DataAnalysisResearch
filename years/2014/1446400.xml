<AbstractNarration>The Department of Mathematics at Florida State University in conjunction with The Department of Mathematics at The University of Arkansas is organizing the conference "Clifford Analysis and Related Topics" to take place at Florida State University during December 15, 16 and 17, 2014.  A conference has been established: http://www.math.fsu.edu/cart2014/. The motivation for this conference is to bring together top researchers in this field along with students and early career mathematicians to discuss and collaborate on recent and continuing research.  Such interactions are especially valuable to students.  Clifford Analysis has ties to many other branches of mathematics as well as important applications in physics and in particular to signal processing.  This award supports travel for participants in the conference.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clifford analysis is based Clifford algebras in the same way that complex analysis is based on the complex numbers.  Indeed the complex numbers are a simple Clifford algebra.  However higher dimensional Clifford algebras are noncommutative and contain zero divisors.  The topics of this conference include compactification of Clifford algebras and their Mobius geometry, representation theory of conformal and orthogonal groups, Clifford analysis on Heisenberg groups, and subelliptic Dirac operators on CR manifolds.</AbstractNarration>

It was co-organized by John Ryan, University of Arkansas, and Craig A. Nolder, Florida State University. Paul A. M. Dirac, around 1928, used a Clifford algebra to describe the physics of an electron and the subsequent mathematics predicted the positron, which was discovered a few years later. For this he received the Nobel prize. Professor Dirac spent the last part of his professional life at Florida State University. Clifford analysis has at its core the use of Dirac operators, which generalize the construction of Dirac. Professor Dirac passed away in 1984. So our conference was in his honor thirty years after that event. Our National Science Foundation Grant funded three female mathematicians to participate, C. J. Vanegas, Universidad Simon Bolivar, Caracas, Venezuela, P. Cerejeiras, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal and Mihaela Vajiac, Chapman University. Two students from Aveiro, four from the University of Arkansas and one from Chapman University were also supported by this grant. Other speakers included Kerr Ballenger and John Emanuello, both graduate students at Florida State, N. Faustino, University de Campinas, Brazil, M. Libine, University of Illinois. Both John Ryan and Craig A. Nolder also gave talks. Tim Raeyemaekers, a graduate student at Univ. of Gent gave a talk about his thesis. Moreover the two students from Aveiro both gave talks. One of the students John Ryan brought from the University of Arkansas is an advanced young student, Raymond Walter, who is disabled and restricted to a wheelchair. This was his first conference. Also Professor Stanley Einstein-Mathews, an African American Professor at Howard University attended. We had a banquet where two professors from the Department of Physics at Florida State recalled their times with and recollections of P. Dirac. The proceedings of our conference is in preparation and will be published by Spinger&rsquo;s PROMS series.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/14/2015<br>      Modified by: Craig&nbsp;A&nbsp;Nolder</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
