<AbstractNarration>Research Initiation Awards (RIAs) provide support for junior faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) who are starting to build a research program, as well as for mid-career faculty who need to re-direct and re-build a research program.  It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at the researcher's home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RIA project at Fisk University, in collaboration with Vanderbilt University, tests the hypothesis that the transcription factor FKH-8 regulates dopaminergic (DA) neuron function upstream of the dopamine transporter, DAT-1, based on an exciting discovery that mutation of the previously uncharacterized C. elegans FKH-8 gene leads to a dopamine-dependent paralysis phenotype.  Dopaminergic (DA) neurons regulate critical signaling pathways that drive many facets of motor and cognitive behavior. In DA neurons, switching on the right DA-specific genes and switching off certain progenitor or non-neuronal genes is a critical step, but much of the regulatory machinery is still unknown. The nematode C. elegans is a highly tractable and powerful model for studying regulation of DA neuron cell fate and function-- it has a simple, readily observed and manipulated nervous system, while still expressing homologs of the essential mammalian biosynthetic enzymes, receptors, and transporters. Using this system, the discovery that FKH-8, a molecule with no previously known role in C. elegans, is necessary for normal DA function. This research leads to increased understanding of gene regulation involved in specifying and/or maintaining DA neuron identity, and provide insight and data for subsequent proposals testing genetic networks that could help bioengineering efforts to more faithfully recapitulate DA neuron specification from induced pluripotent stem cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project precisely defines the position of FKH-8 in the dopamine signaling pathway through the following objectives, with the overall goal of gaining key knowledge of DA neuron regulation applicable across many species.  The project's two objectives are to:&lt;br/&gt;-Test the hypothesis that FKH-8 regulates DA neuron function as part of the same&lt;br/&gt;pathway as dat-1 by performing genetic, pharmacological, and biochemical assays. &lt;br/&gt;-Test the hypothesis that FKH-8 controls DA function through transcriptional regulation&lt;br/&gt;of dat-1 and other DA-specific genes by a multi-pronged approach to identify targets of the FKH-8&lt;br/&gt;transcription factor to include identification of novel genes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic research from this project in developmental biology has the potential to contribute to future studies and technologies connected to addiction, paralysis, Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.  In addition, through this project, Fisk University involves 2-3 undergraduates from populations underrepresented in STEM fields, integrates them into the lab which is staffed by Fisk Masters-to-PhD Bridge Program students.  Undergraduate mentoring involves in-depth hands-on experience with genetics and molecular biology techniques fundamental to many biological disciplines, academic and professional.  The broader impact stretches statewide in increasing research capability and capacity to stimulate academic research within the state as an NSF Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) jurisdiction.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF HBCU-UP Research Implementation Award ?FKH-8 control of dopamine signaling? at Fisk University has enabled us to demonstrate that a previously uncharacterized protein, FKH-8, is expressed in and plays a critical role in dopamine neurons that is independent of the well-known dopamine transporter protein.  This finding represents a new, less-studied area to uncover the players involved in dopamine regulation outside of dopamine transport.  Using next-generation RNA sequencing, we have also identified over 500 additional genes that are expressed more highly in dopamine neurons than in other cells, and thus likely contribute to their unique function.  We have shown that several of these are required for normal dopamine neuron function.     Intellectual Merit: Dopamine is an important molecule that helps facilitate brain processes across the animal kingdom, including regulation of movement, pleasure/reward, learning, and memory.  Although some of the important molecules in the neurons responsible for making and releasing dopamine are known, there are many that have not yet been discovered or characterized, and our understanding of regulatory pathways is incomplete.  Using the dopamine neurons of a small organism, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, as a model for how dopamine neurons work in other animals including humans, we have discovered and characterized the role of several important proteins involved in dopamine neuron function.  Among these, we have shown that the transcription factor FKH-8 is present in all of the dopamine neurons at an early stage and persists there throughout the lifetime of the organism.  This FKH-8 protein is required for dopamine function; deleting it causes dopamine-dependent movement defects.  We have also described the roles of several other proteins that are required for normal dopamine neuron function including CPX-1, CALF-1, and AMX-2, and are testing whether any of the genes encoding these proteins are targets of regulation by FKH-8.  In addition to a role in the dopamine neurons, we have found FKH-8 to be expressed in several other neuron types, including neurons necessary for the organism to sense and/or respond to carbon dioxide.     Broader Impact: Although we have focused on uncovering the fundamental, basic biology of dopamine neuron function, the molecules we have discovered and characterized will provide insight across the animal kingdom, and particularly human biology, as many of the specific proteins have human counterparts that act in similar or even identical pathways (FKH-8 is related to a group of important proteins known as Fox proteins in humans).  Much of what we learn from this model system will be applicable and could shed light into the underpinnings of human dopamine neuron function and related disorders such as Parkinson?s disease, ADHD, schizophrenia, depression, and addiction.  The work facilitated by this award has allowed the lab to branch out from originally studying one protein, FKH-8, in one class of neurons, to now studying many different proteins in dopamine neurons and investigating the role of FKH-8 in other neuron types.
