<AbstractNarration>This project builds on the successful prior work of proven partners to support and expand the primary international research and education (R&amp;E) network connections supporting global scientific collaborations involving U.S. researchers and students in the Pacific and Oceania.  The project has two main thrusts.  First, it leverages prior NSF investments and mature international partnerships to maintain support for the current resilient production 2 x 40Gbps submarine fiber connections from Australia (AARNet) and New Zealand (REANNZ) to the U.S. and, in 2016, upgrades these connections to 2 x 100Gbps.  Since the fiber connecting Australia and New Zealand passes through Hawaii, the project also connects one of the world's most important international astronomy sites, Mauna Kea (Hawaii Island), as well as the international observatories on Haleakala (Maui).  The project leverages the trans-Pacific submarine fiber backbone to terminate and transport the connections at major U.S. open R&amp;E network exchanges and hubs.  Second, the project provides leadership in R&amp;E network capacity building throughout the Pacific Islands, the region of the planet most on the front line of climate change and the last area of the world with no regional R&amp;E network initiative.  Intellectual merit and broader impact are reflected in this enabling role for international research collaborations in astronomy, oceanography, high energy physics, coral reef research and more.  Outreach into the Pacific Islands provides an unparalleled opportunity to engage Pacific Islanders, who are highly underrepresented in STEM fields, in a wide range of scientific research and education initiatives that are both appealing (astronomy) as well as of critical concern to their communities (oceanography, biodiversity coral reef health, and climate change).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Intellectual Merit  The SX-TransPORT:Pacific Islands Research and Education (R&amp;E) Network (PIREN) international network backbone between Australia, Guam and the U.S. via Hawaii and the Pacific Wave exchange plays a pivotal role in support of research and education worldwide by connecting researchers, educators and resources in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region with the U.S. and beyond to address world science challenges and advance science education. This international network enables major advances in astronomy, oceanography, coral reef research, high energy physics and more.   This project leveraged a proven partnership to provide and support the submarine fiber connections from Australia to the U.S. and between Guam, Hawaii and the US. This international research and education network supports connectivity to the world?s most important international astronomy site, Mauna Kea, and supports existing partnerships to develop R&amp;E networking to underserved Pacific Islands.  The SX-TransPORT submarine fiber capacity connecting Australia via AARNet to Hawaii and the US mainland, as well as the PIREN submarine fiber capacity connecting Guam to Hawaii and to the US mainland by the University of Hawaii is provided at no cost to the NSF.   Major outcomes of this award included building capacity on major international links, improving redundancy and access to interisland networks and significantly, the establishment of the Guam Open Research and Education exchange (GOREX) point in Guam, a strategic location in the Asia Pacific Region. The location of the GOREX exchange point in Guam at a carrier neutral facility allows it to interconnect to a larger number of submarine cables at potentially much lower costs. These opportunities enabled the building of higher capacity connections and increased the reliability and resiliency of the global research and education network fabric in and around the Asia-Pacific area. The participation of U. Hawaii and its US partners and Australia in this project built new relationships, notably with New Zealand, France and Japan international networks.  The resulting groundswell of interconnectivity to Hawaii and Guam are direct results of this project.  The build-to-meet and shared-cost models common to R&amp;E operators has resulted in substantial and material benefits to all of the partners directly connecting at GOREX, both through extending additional high-capacity networks for R&amp;E traffic, and in creating high value path diversity benefiting all R&amp;E operators in the Pacific region. The major impact of this project on human resource development has been through the partnership with the University of Guam in shared responsibility for the GOREX. This human resource development took place in collaboration with our long-term partner the Network Startup Resource Center. The Astroflows data movement project demonstrated improvements in the transfer of astronomy data between Hawaii and national data archives using strategically placed data transfer nodes.  Working closely with researchers new engagement methods were used to identify bottlenecks and educate users on best practices.  Broader impacts Connectivity is critical infrastructure for the Pacific Islands and the timely availability of new and geographically diverse fiber optic submarine cable capacity in the region creates an unprecedented opportunity for the Pacific Islands to advance.  This project has built and extended capacity to connect Pacific Island institutions to the broader R&amp;E network and leveraged long standing partnerships with Australia and New Zealand.  These partnerships have led to increased awareness, plans and physical R&amp;E links and have advanced our efforts in technical education and training with network engineers in Pacific Island institutions.  This project has been transformational for the University of Guam in particular, which has stepped up to leverage the geographical and fiber assets of its island to play a significant role in R&amp;E networking in the region and create a positive view of itself as a place that matters. All participating universities, major research institutes and organizations have education and outreach programs which inform citizens and policy makers and inspire a new generation of scientists. The opportunity to engage large numbers of Pacific Islanders, who are highly underrepresented in STEM fields, in international research and education is unprecedented.
