<AbstractNarration>The award funds work that will develop new methods for analyzing economic data.  Researchers working with economic data often rely on asymptotic approximations in making statistical inferences. However, we know that standard asymptotic theory fails when identification is weak.  Therefore these approximations are not very accurate in a number of cases. The PI proposes a possible solution. The new methods could potentially be used in a variety of applications. The project advances science by developing new methods for conducting formal statistical tests of certain kinds of economic theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to develop testing procedures in nonlinear Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) models that have correct asymptotic size for a virtually unrestricted parameter space, except for uniform moment bounds on the moment function and its derivative.  The proposed test is a generalized form of the Conditional Likelihood Ratio (CLR) test. He then wants to show that this tests have (near) optimality properties in terms of power for certain models and classes of tests.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ When an applied researcher tests a hypothesis, two types of mistakes can occur. First, a true hypothesis may be rejected or second, a false hypothesis may not get rejected. In frequentist inference, one often fixes the probability of a type I error uniformly over all empirically relevant null data generating processes, that is, one fixes the size of the test, at 5% say, at least asymptotically. Subject to this restriction, one tries to find tests that "minimize" the probability of a type II error, in other words tests that have "highest" or "overall attractive" power.  This research project is concerned with developing tests that control the (asymptotic) size in generalized method of moments (GMM) models and in linear instrumental variables (IVs) models when identification may be weak. Weak identification occurs quite frequently in applied work in labor economics or macroeconomics, simply because it is hard to find IVs that have high (strong) correlation with the endogenous regressors.  Specifically, first, we are interested in developing tests in GMM models that have correct asymptotic size for a parameter space that only imposes minimal conditions on the data so that an applied researcher can be confident that she is not imposing any invalid restrictions. This agenda is studied in Andrews and Guggenberger (2018, AG from now on). The test suggested in AG controls asymptotic size under very weak restrictions on the parameter space, in particular, the parameter space in AG does not impose any restrictions on the strength or weakness of identification and in addition does not impose any rank restrictions on the covariance matrix of the moment conditions. The latter is, for example, important for inference based on maximum likelihood under weak identification, because if the expected Jacobian is rank deficient, then, by the information matrix equality, the same is true for the covariance matrix.  Secondly, and quite distinct from the first project, in linear IV models, the objective here is to develop tests for a simple subvector hypothesis (say, involving only one coefficient of the structural parameter vector) because this is the problem that applied researchers typically face. The objective is to improve on the power properties of tests that result from projection of full vector tests. Two cases are considered here, namely the first setup that imposes conditional homoskedasticity, and the second setup, that allows for general types of conditional heteroskedasticity. More precisely, the paper Guggenberger, Kleibergen, and Mavroeidis (2018a, GKMa from now on) considers the linear IV model with conditional homoskedasticity while Guggenberger, Kleibergen, and Mavroeidis (2018b, GKMb from now on) allows for conditional heteroskedasticity. GKMa uses the Anderson and Rubin statistic coupled with new conditional critical values. To the best of our knowledge GKMa is the most powerful currently available robust subvector procedure under these assumptions.

The challenge there, of course, is to implement the pretest in a way that the null rejection probability of the two stage procedure is controlled.  As an important impact of this research agenda, applied researchers in labor economics, development economics or macroeconomics will be able to conduct more powerful inference for individual components of the unknown parameter vector.
