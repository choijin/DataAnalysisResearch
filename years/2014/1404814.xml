<AbstractNarration>Drift Counteraction Control: Theory and Applications&lt;br/&gt;In many existing and emerging engineering systems there is an inherent tendency of process variables to drift. In some systems this drift is caused by large, persistent disturbances due to interactions with the external environment.  In other systems, similar drift is caused by finite resources (fuel, energy, component life etc.) being continuously depleted.  The operating objectives for such systems with drift are reflected in a set of constraints that must be satisfied for as long as possible by countering the drift, rather than in terms of usual set-point command tracking requirements.  This research project advances theory and methods for designing control algorithms that perform drift counteraction thereby establishing a foundation for addressing practical drift counteraction applications, and for incorporating drift counteraction technology into industrial products.   These advances will represent contributions to several areas of control theory including stochastic control, set-theoretic control, game-theoretic control, constrained control, and nonlinear control. The developments in theory will proceed in close synergy with the demonstration of their benefits in several engineering applications to automotive and aerospace systems and dynamic motion simulators. The research results will be integrated into university courses for graduate students, short courses for industrial and academic audiences, and into the computational software package implementing drift counteraction control design techniques.  &lt;br/&gt;The drift counteraction control is based primarily on constraints and does not use conventional set-points, differently from most of the traditional control theory.  The development of effective techniques for drift counteraction will be based on treating external disturbances causing drift and constraint violation first in the stochastic and then in the deterministic setting. In the stochastic setting, advances in Stochastic Drift Counteraction Optimal Control (SDCOC) that maximizes the expected cost before the imposed constraints are violated will be pursued.  Stability and boundness conditions for closed-loop trajectories of systems operating under SDCOC control laws when disturbances settle to constant values or vary within a subset of the full range will be derived. Sub-optimality and convergence properties of receding horizon and reinforcement learning variants of SDCOC will be studied. Advances in SDCOC computational procedures will be made, firstly, by exploiting decomposition of the system dynamics into slow and fast subsystems and, secondly, based on Markov Chain models that use Fuzzy Encoding (MCFE).  By combining SDCOC and MCFE, evidence based control framework for drift counteraction in uncertain systems will be defined and complemented with estimation algorithms.  In the deterministic setting, set-theoretic, game-theoretic and disturbance estimation/cancellation based approaches to drift counteraction problems will be pursued.  The advances will focus on formulation and derivation of algorithms, the improvements in their off-board and on-board computations, and characterization of closed-loop properties (constraint violation time, ability to prevent constraint violation over an infinite time interval, trajectory bounds, etc.).  Synergistically with the theoretical advances, several practical applications of drift counteraction control will be considered. These applications will include increasing comfort and fuel efficiency of adaptive cruise control systems for conventional and hybrid passenger vehicles, extending range and life of electric and hybrid electric vehicles and their batteries, improving the ability to replicate motions in small scale dynamic motion simulators, and improving the capability and efficiency of spacecraft attitude control using momentum exchange devices.  For each application, its requirements will be reflected in a drift counteraction problem formulation, appropriate models will be established, drift counteraction control algorithms will be designed, and performance benefits will be quantified. To ensure practical relevance of the results and facilitate their experimental validation in the vehicle adaptive cruise control case, interactions and collaborations with industry partners will be leveraged.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Drift counteraction optimal control (DCOC) involves operating a system in such a way as to maximize time (or more generally a yield) till the system trajectory exits a prescribed region, defined by system safety constraints, operating limits and/or efficiency requirements (Figure 1).  In particular, system operating life, which is a finite resource, can be extended by exploiting DCOC.  Unlike traditional control problems which involve tracking a prescribed command or a set-point, in DCOC the objective is to satisfy the specified constraints for as long as possible.   In this project methods and algorithms have been developed for prolonging safe operation in environments with large disturbances and stringent constraints, and for extending system/component operational life.  In terms of their industrial and societal use, such methods have a broad potential to improve survivability, energy efficiency, and autonomy, and to enable achieving objectives with downsized/low authority systems and components.  More specifically, the research undertaken in this project has advanced theory and methods of DCOC for deterministic and stochastic systems, and it has improved the understanding of how to exploit DCOC in specific engineering applications. In particular, sufficient conditions for DCOC solution existence have been established to provide insight into when DCOC problems are well-posed.  Computational methods for solving DCOC problems for deterministic and stochastic nonlinear systems based on dynamic programming have been advanced.  Conditions for convergence of value iterations have been obtained, and it has been shown that to maximize convergence rate the optimal value iteration algorithm settings can and should be different from theoretically optimally values when numerical approximations are involved.   Improved value iteration methods called adaptive proportional value iterations, adaptive proportional value iterations with damping, and modified value iterations have been developed which reduce the number of iterations required for convergence, improve accuracy of the numerically computed DCOC solutions and reduce time to compute the DCOC policies. Convergence of the modified value iteration algorithm has been proven and its ability to reduce numerical approximation errors due to interpolation has been demonstrated.  Approximate dynamic programming techniques based on Kriging interpolation and neural networks have also been developed for DCOC and shown the ability to reduce the time to compute the solution.  In order to handle higher order systems than possible with the dynamic programming and value iterations, novel model predictive control (MPC) approaches have been established for both deterministic and stochastic systems.  For deterministic systems, it was shown that MPC-based control laws for drift counteraction can be implemented in real-time using linear programming to solve a suitably reformulated and relaxed dynamic optimization problem at each update time instant.  For stochastic systems, it was shown that MPC-based control laws for drift counteraction can be developed using a scenario-tree to represent possible system trajectories and by applying mixed integer linear programming to solve a suitably defined dynamic optimization problem at each update time instant.  Theoretical results which guarantee the ability of MPC-based solution to recover the solution of the DCOC problem as the number of nodes in the scenario tree increases have been obtained.      The applicability of DCOC to a variety of problems in applications to engineering systems in aerospace and automotive domains has been successfully demonstrated with detailed case studies.  These case studies include extending spacecraft operational life in Geostationary (GEO) and Low Earth (LEO) orbits by optimally compensating the orbital drift or, respectively, the orbit decay with limited fuel available onboard (Figures 2-4).  These case studies also include compensating spacecraft attitude drift caused by nonzero angular momentum and disturbance torques as needed to maintain spacecraft pointing for extending periods of time in imaging missions, including when there are on-board reaction wheel failures.   The methods to use DCOC for extending range or endurance of unpowered gliders by optimally taking advantage of updrafts and thermals have been also advanced during the project period.  In the automotive domain, it was shown that adaptive cruise control systems and control policies for self-driving cars can be developed using DCOC framework applied to stochastic models of surrounding traffic. Besides automotive and aerospace applications, the developed theory and methods can be exploited in other engineering domains, such as naval engineering, where drift counteraction optimal control problems emerge.  The results have been disseminated through conference and journal publications, a Ph.D. dissertation, and presentations and seminars which include a plenary talk given by the principal investigator at 6th IFAC Nonlinear Model Predictive Control conference.
