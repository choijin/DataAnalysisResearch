<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative recruitment and retention strategies and experiences in support of groups historically under-represented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wisconsin Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (WiscAMP), led by the University of Wisconsin(UW)-Madison, consists of 13 four-year UW campuses (Eau Claire, Green Bay, La Crosse, Madison, Milwaukee, Oshkosh, Parkside, Platteville, River Falls, Stevens Point, Stout, Superior and Whitewater); 4 private (not for profit) schools (Alverno College, Beloit College, Lawrence University and the Milwaukee School of Engineering); and 2 two-year institutions (Madison Area Technical College (Madison College) and UW-Rock County, 1 of 13 UW-College campuses managed as a single institution in the UW-System). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a senior alliance, WiscAMP capitalizes on its momentum toward achieving the twin goals of broadening participation in advanced STEM degree career pathways and transforming WiscAMP institutions to support and sustain diversity across and throughout the alliance through the following program objectives: (1) doubling the current number of URM students who graduate with STEM baccalaureate degrees, (2) doubling the current number of WiscAMP students who enter STEM graduate programs, and (3) tripling the number of STEM faculty in the alliance who adopt evidence-based broadening participation practices in their research mentoring and/or classroom instruction. Undergraduate students, including community college students, participate in STEM recruitment and retention interventions such as faculty-mentored undergraduate research, graduate school preparation, summer research experiences, including international experiences abroad as appropriate. Faculty are involved in producing evidenced-based broadening participation research to increase the body of knowledge in retaining underrepresented minority students in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[In order to remain competitive in the global economy, the United States needs a domestic workforce that is highly trained in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The Wisconsin Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (WiscAMP) has helped to address this important need. Established in 2004, WiscAMP is now a senior alliance with collaborative programs to develop leaders and broaden participation in STEM through multi-level interventions intended to transform the culture of academic STEM to be more welcoming and inclusive of all potential talent. These efforts have resulted in the following:   An average of 200 more underrepresented minority (URM) students graduated with STEM baccalaureate degrees each year over the last five years compared to the previous five years, with 550 graduating in 2018 compared to 345 in 2013.   Alliance institutions collectively enrolled an average of 965 more URM STEM majors per year over the last 4 years compared to enrollments in the previous five years, with 3169 enrolled in fall 2017 compared to 2324 in fall 2012.   New grant funded initiatives totaling $101,251,698 at 3 alliance institutions leveraged from successful WiscAMP Small Grant (WSG) programs.   Decreases in the average number of semesters and credits to complete a degree for URM students graduating in 2017 compared to those graduating in 2013.   Providing direct support to 535 unduplicated students between 2013-2017. Based on available data, 82% were retained in STEM, 48% have graduated in STEM and 21% of those who have graduated have continued in graduate research programs in STEM disciplines.   WiscAMP activities and outcomes demonstrate the importance of supporting the development of students? relationships with STEM faculty (social capital) and involving students in the research enterprise (cultural capital). Faculty-mentored research experiences play a key role in improving retention of URM students in STEM majors. These activities improve learning for all students and cultivate the skills students need to work collaboratively in diverse groups.  The WiscAMP project has helped to expand the institutional capacity of colleges and universities in Wisconsin to support and graduate larger and more diverse classes of students in STEM disciplines.
