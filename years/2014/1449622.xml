<AbstractNarration>The move to digital learning is well underway.  The instructional materials market includes both textbooks and supplemental materials; however, this market is changing as content formats and adoption cycles change, but experts expect it to remain strong in years to come. Organizations of all kinds and sizes can benefit from content management strategies as they adapt their practices and infrastructures away from hastily organized web pages, limited access databases, or worse--URLs printed on paper. Each year, millions of high quality digital learning resources are created but only a tiny fraction of those materials are found and used by American teachers and school children. With growing pressures to transform classrooms into 21st Century education spaces, desperately needed is a tool to improve identification and organization to help "great piles of stuff" on the Internet become "piles of great stuff" for innovative and engaging educational experiences. The proposed Web2MARC technology has the potential to strongly impact current and future markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a tool like the Web2MARC,, these organizations can simultaneously retain learning assets, realize the advantages of digital content, and break the cycle of redeveloping content from the ground up at great expense every time curriculum needs to be updated or new content is created. The Web2MARC is a database plug-in that can be installed in repositories of educational content. The plug-in will allow users to download information about the content in the form of metadata records that can be tailored with information such as Common Core State Standards linkages and imported into many types of content management systems. Web2MARC is an easy-to-use tool that will allow users to quickly and easily create descriptive records for pieces of digital content that can be tagged with keywords that make them easily findable and usable. The Web2MARC will allow users and to easily and efficiently group contents such as blog posts, status updates, presentations, articles, tweets and other multimedia content into their favorite compilation site: an organization website, a personal website, a library catalog--any place users choose to organize and promote information.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Web2MARC API is an easy to use, readily available tool that will allow users to quickly and easily create descriptive records for pieces of digital content that can be tagged with keywords and other vocabularies that make the content easily findable and usable. Through its unique combination of content scraping and vocabulary assignment scaffolding, the Web2MARC API will allow users and to easily and efficiently group content such as blog posts, status updates, presentations, articles, tweets and other multimedia content into their favorite compilation site: an organization website, a personal website, a library catalog&mdash;any place users choose to organize and promote information.   The Web2MARC team (Team 416, Fall 2014 Los Angeles Cohort) included Jennifer Luetkemeyer Wood (Entrepreneurial Lead), Lawrence Tinker (Industry Mentor), and Marcia Mardis (Principal Investigator).   Intellectual Merit As part of the I-Corps curriculum, the Web2MARC team engaged in customer discovery and business model generation. The teamÆs investigations demonstrated that content organization, description, and location were indeed pervasive problems that spanned sectors such as education, law, and health. The team also discovered that most large corporations that produce and share documents require enterprise-level support for keeping those documents organized.    Through the teamÆs interviews, they also discovered that the end user was not the target customer. Content providers, particularly content catalogers, were adversely affected by trying to create consistent, accurate descriptions for large amounts of content in as short of an amount of time as possible. The impact of content backlogs was felt in terms of low usage and diminished collection quality. This problem was particularly acute in the education sector.   However, the team also learned that catalogers do not make the decision about solutions. When the team talked with decision makers, we learned that they were looking for the solution to be integrated in their content repositories so that it would be seamlessly integrated into the catalogerÆs workflow. At this point, the team realized that the Web2MARC API would need to be useful to both new and legacy installations of repository systems. The team then contacted and interviewed repository system companies.   Another key discovery we made through the I-Corps process was that while neither the content scraping nor the vocabulary assignment scaffolding were novel on its own, the combination of the two technologies was new.   Broader Impact At the conclusion of the I-Corps program, the Web2MARC team chose to "go," that is, to continue developing Web2MARC as a product that can be licensed to a repository system company as a "plug-in" that would work with an existing or new installation.    The potential broad impacts of Web2MARC now far exceed what the team had envisioned. The experience that I-Corps afforded the team has allowed us to develop a strategy that now includes the creation of a MVP for repository companies.   While learning more about these additional industry sectors was affirming and presented possibilities, the team opted to continue working on an API for educational content because it matched best with our expertise and allowed the team to build upon existing relationships with content providers in this sector. Our intention is to use this industry sector as a starting point to develop our modular scraping and scaffolding technology for more sectors.
