<AbstractNarration>This project, funded jointly by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in MCB and the Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering Program in the CBET,  aims is to contribute a synthetic biology workflow for the efficient production of non-natural molecules in living cells. The specific aim is to produce novel biofuels that match the performance of existing fuels, while overcoming their limitations with respect to soot and nitrogen oxide formation. The outcomes will propel the development of Synthetic Biology in Europe and the US, as it contributes significantly to the development of a bio-refinery approach in the chemical industry.  On the educational side, the investigator is involved in graduate education and research training. The project will also contribute to established REU programs at the University of California, Berkeley. Results will be disseminated broadly via publications in interdisciplinary international journals. Long-term, the major potential benefits of the proposed activity to society will be replacement of existing, petroleum-based fuels with fuels derived from renewable resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multinational SynPath project follows a classic engineering approach of design, synthesis and analysis to explore metabolic pathways in microorganisms for production of drop-in biofuels. The focus will be on developing novel metabolic pathways for production of hydrocarbons and identify rate-limiting steps in biofuel production so that sugars can be efficiently converted to advanced biofuels.  The proposed work will also create devices and modules that can be used to regulate and optimize biofuel production pathways. The success of this project relies on the integration of expertise in thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, microbial physiology, metabolic pathway engineering, and enzyme engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The basic objective of the project SynPath is the development of a workflow for the design and construction of synthetic biochemical pathways into microorganisms for the production of novel biofuels. During the funding period, we constructed pathways for three types of fuels: long-chain saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons using the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway; short, highly-branched ketones using the polyketide pathway; and branched and cyclic hydrocarbons using a novel non-C5 isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway.       With respect to the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, we adopted a previously-developed genetic control system that allowed us to accurately vary the amount of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the membrane, which allowed us to explore the impact of fatty acid saturation on membrane fluidity. A major finding from this work was that fluidizing lipids&mdash;such as unsaturated fatty acids&mdash;play an essential role in mediating reactive collisions during cellular respiration. Therefore, the physical properties of the cell membrane are intrinsically linked with its metabolic activity. This has led to a numerical model for the electron transport chain based on diffusion of membrane components, which is modulated by lipid composition.     With respect to our work on polyketide biofuel pathways, we engineered Strepomyces albus with hybrid polyketide synthases to produce various short-chain ketones. Introduction of the genes into the chromosome of S.albusenabled it to produce high levels of six- and seven-carbon ethyl ketones and five- and six-carbonmethyl ketones from plant biomass hydrolysates.Engine tests indicated that these short-chain ketones can be added to gasoline as oxygenates to increase the octane of gasoline.

Not only will this pathway enable production of novel biofuels, it will also enable production of novel hydrocarbon scaffolds to therapeutics.      Several high impact publications and one patent application resulted from this work. The grant trained two post-doctoral fellows and one graduate student.
