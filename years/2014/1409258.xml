<AbstractNarration>Many applications of significant societal impact are modeled by&lt;br/&gt;complex dynamical system behavior, including the (life, physical&lt;br/&gt;and social) sciences, medicine, economics, law, urban development,&lt;br/&gt;international politics and global conflict. Fortunately, recent&lt;br/&gt;advances in sensor technology have allowed observation of these&lt;br/&gt;phenomena at an unprecedented scale. Unfortunately, the volume and&lt;br/&gt;complexity of available data present many challenges to extracting&lt;br/&gt;meaningful information about these systems. Low-dimensional models&lt;br/&gt;serve as a useful structure for understanding the information in&lt;br/&gt;high-dimensional signals and systems. However, this information&lt;br/&gt;often changes over time, and so these models can further be&lt;br/&gt;improved by exploiting temporal dynamics. This project is concerned&lt;br/&gt;with developing new methods for tracking changing low-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;structure in data streams and dynamical systems, particularly in&lt;br/&gt;settings where the observations may be missing, incomplete,&lt;br/&gt;corrupted, or compressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first research aim in this project is to develop new and&lt;br/&gt;substantially improve existing techniques for tracking&lt;br/&gt;low-dimensional structure and, in particular, to extend tracking&lt;br/&gt;capabilities far beyond conventional signals to much more general&lt;br/&gt;data sets with intrinsic low-dimensional structure. A second&lt;br/&gt;research aim is to develop new tools for tracking low-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;structure in systems jointly with estimating the content of&lt;br/&gt;time-varying signals and data sets. A third research aim is&lt;br/&gt;concerned with higher-dimensional and more complex dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems, and the goal is to develop improved methods that exploit&lt;br/&gt;low-dimensional structure to perform quantitative and qualitative&lt;br/&gt;analysis in systems that are too complex and high-dimensional for&lt;br/&gt;system identification. In a fourth, educational aim, accessible&lt;br/&gt;K-12 outreach materials are being developed for dissemination&lt;br/&gt;through an online digital library.</AbstractNarration>
