<AbstractNarration>1443446&lt;br/&gt;Lancaster&lt;br/&gt;National Academy of Sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI requests funds to conduct the next triennial National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) review. A review of the overall progress of the NNI is an important element of delivering on the scientific and societal benefit nanotechnology has to offer. The review committee will be a blend of academia, private sector, business community members (large and small), and members able to represent the growing community of those concerned about the ethical, legal and societal aspects of nanotechnology. Emphasis will be placed on delivering a balanced review of the science needed for basic discovery, and the science needed for execution at the application phase; namely, moving toward commercialization in a responsible manner. Progress in developing good science that supports the needs of policy makers and regulatory agencies should be an area for investigation. Results from research agencies that support commercialization, and how to evaluate the impact of that research would be a welcome and much needed component of this review. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed intellectual merit is to build upon the findings from the 2013 review. The focus will be on (1) the NNI signature initiatives as they relate to commercialization and (2) nanotechnology physical and human infrastructure needs. In addition to advancing fundamental research, the NNI user facilities are a driver for nanotechnology commercialization. Better coordination among the facilities, and potentially the introduction of new facilities dedicated to nanotechnology material characterization, should be explored further. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact from nanotechnology arises from its potential to significantly transform numerous fields, including information technology, aerospace, agriculture, energy, homeland security, environment, healthcare, national defense, and transportation systems. This next triennial NNI review will produce feedback to the Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology Subcommittee and the National Nanotechnology Coordination Office in order to even more effectively serve the Nanotechnology community in the near future.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award has produced a National Academy report and enabled the committee to make recommendations to the NSET Subcommittee and the NNCO that will improve the NNI?s value for basic and applied research and for development of applications in nanotechnology that will provide economic, societal, and national security benefits to the United States.  In its assessment, the committee found it important to understand in some detail&mdash;and to describe in its reports&mdash;the NNI?s structure and organization and how the NNI fits within the larger federal research enterprise, as well as how it can and should be organized for management purposes and the initiative?s various stakeholders and their roles with respect to research.

In summary, the NNI, including the interagency bodies and the NNCO, continues to add value to the portfolio of activities across the participating agencies.  Looking ahead, the NNI can significantly increase that value by focusing on research that will enable progress and success in other advanced technology areas of priority, especially advanced manufacturing. At the same time, the NNI agencies are called upon to sustain investment in and facilitate access to physical infrastructure and to take steps to realize the full value of educational materials and programs.  In the course of identifying targeted areas in which to focus, it is an opportunity to consider the goals of the initiative and the criteria for continuing to invest resources in its coordination and management.
