<AbstractNarration>An award is made to the University at Albany (SUNY) and several collaborating organizations, including two other SUNY campuses (SUNY Polytechnic Institute and SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry) and Boston University, to construct and test an aphid-like nanobiosensor whose purpose is to enable real-time monitoring of sugars in living plant tissues. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the development of NANAPHID technology. The results obtained in the process of NANAPHID development will be disseminated to the community through lectures, student laboratory exercises and field trips. The project will include a unique Website used to broadcast webinars addressing NANAPHID design, its capabilities, and the latest research results. The NANAPHID will make routine measurements of sugars that will benefit many biological research communities including plant ecologists, investigators at NSF-funded Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites, and scientists involved in a broad range of experimental and modelling studies of terrestrial carbon cycling. Applications in crop plant research and management are also promising. For example, the sensor has the potential to replace refractometry as the method of choice for volumetric analysis of sugars.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) are the currency of energy and growth allocation within plants. These products of photosynthesis are circulated as soluble sugars, whose concentrations are estimated using destructive analytical techniques that have difficulties distinguishing sugars in plant sap from associated cellular materials that get mixed into samples. NANAPHID technology will make real-time in situ measurements of NSC using concentrations in stems, roots, and branches and provide biologists with many new opportunities to monitor critical changes in resource allocation in plants. Tracking these changes in living plants is necessary for directly testing the effect of many environmental changes such as climate, diseases, atmospheric nutrient loads, and acidic deposition.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcome Report  Project Title: Collaborative Research: IDBR: TYPE A. The NANAPHID: A novel aphid-like nanosensor network for real-time measurements of carbohydrates in live plant tissue  Across the northern hemisphere, trees are expected to increase their growth rates in regions that are not getting drier.  This expectation is due to (1) longer growing seasons and (2) additional carbon dioxide, which make photosynthesis more efficient for many trees.  However, scientists are discovering that other factors are affecting the ways trees grow, particularly how they use the products of photosynthesis.  Unlike us humans, whose growth is regular and symmetric, trees respond to their local environments by varying their contributions to different modules (roots, stems, leaves and seeds).  Adding some extra growing days in spring and fall somehow changes those relationships.  For example, the amounts of photosynthesis measured are increasing, but the amount of wood produced is not keeping up, as it has in the past. One result is that tree rings have become less reliable indicators of recent climate,  We believe that this change is taking place because (a) light levels (solar radiation) in early spring and late fall are lower, so trees rely more on stored energy during these periods, and (b) roots are using some of the extra stored energy that would otherwise go into wood.  The best way to study this hypothesis is to measure the flow of energy (carbohydrates) in trees; this flow is mostly in the form of sugars (glucose, sucrose), so measuring them over the seasons would be a good way to do that.   However, unlike human blood, whose sugar contents can be readily monitored in humans, tree sap is very difficult to study, because poking a probe into conductive tissues causes them to shut down.  Our proposed solution is to develop an instrument that gives continuous readings of sugar content in sap without blocking the flow, based on the ability of aphids o feed on plan sap for long periods of time. They do so by physical and chemical means &ndash; preventing a pressure drop in sap flow and chemically interfering with the plant?s wound response.  Working with colleagues in biosensor nanotechnology, we are preparing instruments consisting of probes coated with thin layers of materials that use enzymatic reactions to generate electrical current, and other layers that soak up the calcium that plants use to give the wound signal.  Our "Nanaphid" has reached a stage where sugar concentrations (glucose, sucrose and fructose) can be measured in sap collected from trees in a forest. This is a significant advance over current technology, which takes individual tree tissue samples for processing and examining using mass spectroscopy in a laboratory. The next step will be to refine the probe so that it can be inserted into tree stems for multiple readings.  In the meantime, we have gathered a substantial amount of supporting evidence from other instruments that measure tree radial growth, root growth, rates and directions of sap flow, and leaf reflectance (to estimate photosynthesis).  Evidence from this work indicates that the onset of stem growth and photosynthesis is coordinated in spring, but stem growth peaks in summer and ends well before a decline in root growth, which continues into early winter.  These results may help explain why trees are adding less wood than previously expected.       Last Modified: 05/02/2018       Submitted by: George R Robinson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
