<AbstractNarration>Medical sociology research suggests that over the past century women's decisions about maternity care and birth have become highly constrained by medical technology and medical authority. Concurrently, various social movements, including the natural childbirth movement and health consumerism, have made alternative birthing options more visible and available to women. Taken together, the contemporary context of childbirth provides an opportunity to examine how, and in what ways, women navigate and assign value to competing types of knowledge when making health decisions. In this dissertation project, the researcher will conduct in-depth interviews with pregnant women who have never before given birth to understand the individual level influences that shape women's attitudes about birth, specifically how, and in what ways, social relationships, race, and social class influence women's attitudes about birth and their decisions about maternity care. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project engages several areas of sociology and advances knowledge in concrete ways. First, the research builds on medical sociology literature, particularly research on medicalization, by departing from the dominant "medical versus natural" framework for understanding why women make particular maternity health decisions. Whereas many studies examine only the larger context in which decisions about birth are made, this research will elucidate how individuals' attitudes about birth are shaped, and in what ways individual-level phenomenon intersect dominant discourse about birth. Second, this project will contribute to research on social relationships by exploring the role of individuals' interactions with others in shaping healthcare decisions. Many studies examining prenatal and postnatal experiences of women focus on the role of social support for shaping health outcomes, but this project will analyze the various dynamics of social relationships including the ways in which social influence occurs and how that may matter in the context of medicalization. Finally, examining women's health care behaviors will allow enable this research to speak to sociological research on gender and family by exploring ways in which notions of femininity and good mothering impact the highly gendered experience of pregnancy and childbirth.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding Maternity Care Decisions  PI: Mary Nell Trautner, University at Buffalo  Co-PI: Jessica Hoffman, University at Buffalo   There are several research findings from the project, "Understanding Maternity Care Decisions" that highlight the intellectual merit of this work. First, individual women?s understandings about childbirth do not adhere strictly to cultural messages about birth, in terms of a medical or natural event. This finding challenges the theoretical frameworks used to understand approaches to birth and, further, complicates efforts to simply align individual women with culturally dominant birth ideologies for understanding behavior. Accounting for the diversity in women?s understandings and approaches to birth practices helps propel future research to adopt different, less rigid frameworks for examining birth.   Second, findings highlight a new area of interest for examining women?s decisions about maternity care: women?s perceptions of the body and its relationship to risk construction. Women?s understanding and beliefs about the body are important for how much and what types of risk they perceive may occur during pregnancy and labor and, in turn, the healthcare interventions they seek. Theoretically, this challenges the idea that women?s perceptions of risk in childbirth should be understood simply through the terms of biomedical or non-medical; beliefs about the body intersect cultural ideologies to differently shape women?s decisions. In practice, it can provide opportunities for providers to attend to patient?s perceptions of the body as inadequate or "designed" for birthing as an avenue to lower rates of medicalization among a wide-range of women.   Third, women make evaluations about appropriate or deviant pregnancy behaviors by negotiating cultural messages of how to "do" pregnancy within their varied and dynamic social context. These negotiations are influenced by interactions with partners, interactions with providers, their immediate environment, and their personal desires for outcomes. Women react to similar pregnancy expectations in different ways at different times, depending on their evaluation of others? perceptions about pregnancy, including their providers.  This is useful for developing practical recommendations for providers to manage the doctor-patient relationship and improve satisfaction with care, particularly when the expectations of birth experiences do not align among doctors and women.    Finally, resulting from this research project is a publicly available data set containing de-identified qualitative data, to be available by June 2017.
