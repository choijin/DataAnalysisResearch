<AbstractNarration>This project aims to develop enhanced energy storage devices, in particular, supercapacitors, that can store large amounts of energy or charge per unit weight of the material and deliver them at high power. The ability to store large amounts of charge will enable their use in high-demand applications such as electric and hybrid vehicles. High power will ensure that these devices can be charged at a fast rate with charging times of a few seconds to a few minutes (unlike rechargeable batteries that require several hours for charging). The potential improvement in energy storage attributes will, for example, contribute very significantly to technology that supports electric vehicles. This project will provide two PhD graduate and several undergraduate students with an interdisciplinary educational experience in nanomaterials and renewable energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific research objective of this project is to fabricate and study process-structure-performance correlation in a novel hybrid supercapacitor electrode composed of porous carbon-electroactive polymer core-shell nanofibers. The fabrication will be conducted via a simple two-step process. In Step 1, nanofibers of blends of two polymers; carbon precursor and sacrificial polymer, will be fabricated via electrospinning followed by high temperature pyrolysis to convert the carbon precursor to carbon and decompose out the sacrificial polymer, resulting in hierarchically-porous carbon nanofibers exhibiting high specific surface area (&gt;1500 m2/g). In Step 2, the porous carbon nanofibers will be shrink-wrapped with an ultrathin shell of conducting polymer of thiophene, pyrrole or aniline using a novel "liquid-free" chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approach. The aim is integrate electric double layer capacitance from porous carbon nanofibers with pseudocapacitance from thin and conformal polymer coatings to achieve synergistic performance effects including optimized energy density and power delivery and improved cycling performance. Collaboration with industrial partners will enable a feasible path for future manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>

Summary of Results  We have demonstrated a single step oCVD technique to synthesize thin porous PANI films using vaporized aniline monomer and SbCl5 oxidant, and to deposit conformally and uniformly the porous PANI with ~20 nm pore openings around individual electrospun carbon nanofibers. This nanoscale porosity leads to greater surface area that enhanced the energy storage capacity of electrospun carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with remarkable rate capability and excellent cycling. Detailed kinetic studies were performed and deposition parameters such as stage temperature, substrate orientation, oxidant flow rate, monomer flow rate, reactor pressure, and nitrogen flow rate were optimized to give conformal and uniform coatings throughout CNF electrodes. Additionally, we investigated the use of neutral aqueous electrolyte (Li2SO4/H2O) that promise to offer great operating voltage window in addition to environmental friendliness in comparison with acidic electrolytes used in state of the art PANI cells. This study involved cell assembly, electrochemical testing as well as in-situ infrared spectroelectrochemistry to study the mechanism of PANI redox behavior in neutral electrolyte. This work was conducted on a more well-understood model system on electrodeposited PANI-Carbon Nanofibers.  Broader Impact  This project involved several undergraduate and 5 PhD students from the PI?s research group. It provided all the students involved with inter-disciplinary experience in nanomaterials and alternate energy along with an opportunity to enhance their presentation and technical writing skills via several conference and group meeting presentations and paper and report writing.  To demonstrate the broader technical impact, we showed the application and benefits of carbon nanofiber-based freestanding architecture in Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. In particular, we investigated the synthesis and deposition of sulfur-rich copolymers on freestanding carbon nanofibers as active material showing stable capacity in lithium-sulfur batteries, a battery chemistry that promises to offer 2-3-fold higher energy density than state of the Li-ion batteries.
