<AbstractNarration>Recent technological advances have made it possible to reconsider the idea of distributing spatially a large number of small devices that have actuating, sensing, computing, and telecommunications capabilities.  Such spatial implementations can provide unprecedented capabilities for new applications in spatially distributed networks.  The investigator explores methods of nonlinear sampling for distributed signal acquisition systems, with attention to engineering applications.  This interdisciplinary project has broader impact on mathematical, engineering and industrial problems, ranging from nonlinear frame theory and nonlinear signal processing to smart energy, transportation, and security networks.  Students are trained in the course of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     In this project, the principal investigator develops a novel mathematical framework to analyze and synthesize spatial signals with compressive parametric representations.  He develops globally robust algorithms for cases where communication and energy resources are limited.  He investigates development of optimal sampling methodologies for analysis and synthesis of smart signal acquisition in engineering networks.  The main themes of this project are based on localization techniques in spatial domains, quasi-Banach algebraic relaxations of sparsity measures, and Hilbertization of quasi-optimality in Banach spaces.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This is interdisciplinary project on mathematical, engineering and industrial problems, ranging from nonlinear frame theory and nonlinear signal processing to smart energy, wireless sensor networks and smart grids.  The PI has made some significant progress on control theory and sampling theory on spatially distributed networks, phase retrieval of real signals, and nonlinear frame theory for localized maps.  The results of this project will have serious impacts in the applied harmonic analysis community in mathematics  and in the optimal control and signal processing communities in engineering.   Spatially distributed networks contain a large number of spatially distributed small devices that have actuating, sensing, computing, and telecommunications capabilities. This class of networks/systems arises in various applications, such as (underwater) multivehicle and multirobot networks, wireless sensor networks and smart grid.  The principal investigator made some fundamental contributions to control theory and signal reconstruction on spatially distributed networks. For the control theory, the principal investigator introduced a Banach algebra of localized matrices and proved that quadratically optimal state feedback controllers on spatially distributed networks are sparse and spatially localized. For the signal sampling and reconstruction, the principal investigator found a distributed-verifiable stability criterion that could be pivotal to design a spatially distributed network against supplement, replacement and impairment of agents, and also the principal investigator proposed a distributed algorithm for signal reconstruction, that provides a suboptimal approximation to the original signal in the presence of bounded sampling noises.  Phase retrieval consists of recovering signals of interest from magnitudes of their (non)linear measurements. It arises in various fields of science and engineering, such as X-ray crystallography, coherent diffractive imaging, and optics, and it is used to align the mirrors in the new James Webb Telescope. The principal investigator made some significant progress on  affine phase retrieval and phaseless signal sampling and reconstruction. The affine phase retrieval arises naturally in holography and the principal investigator discovered that the nature of affine phase retrieval and that of standard phase retrieval is quite different from minimal number of measurements, to topology of measurement matrices, and to bi-Lipschitz property of the measurement map. Phaseless sampling and reconstruction is an infinite-dimensional phase retrieval problem with specific features and the principal investigator characterized all signals that are recoverable from their phaseless measurements and proposed a robust distributed reconstruction algorithm.  Phase retrieval and sampling operators on spatially distributed networks are (non)linear operators of well-localized maps. The principal proved a novel fixed point theorem of Brouwer type for a well-localized map on Banach spaces, proposed iterative algorithms to reconstruct signals from their noisy nonlinear measures, and created an optimization framework to find suboptimal approximations to sparse signals in a Banach space from their noisy nonlinear measurements.   The two PhD students in mathematics department and one PhD student in the computer science department are trained under this project. They had postdoc positions after graduation.
