<AbstractNarration>This collaborative, exploratory, learning strand project focuses on improving reflective decision-making among elementary school students during the planning and re-design activities of the engineering design process.  Five teacher researchers in three elementary schools provide the classroom laboratories for the study.  Specified units from Engineering is Elementary, a well-studied curriculum, provide the engineering content.  In year one, the qualitative research observes student discourse as students develop designs.  Based on the results, a paper engineering note book with prompts is designed for use in year two while a digital notebook is developed.  In year three, the students use the digital notebook to develop their designs and redesigns.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research identifies patterns of language that contribute to the reflective discourse and determines how the paper and electronic versions of the notebook improve the discourse.  An advisory committee provides advice and evaluation.  The notebooks are described in conference proceedings and made available online. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work synthesizes what is known about the use of the notebooks in science and engineering education at the elementary school and investigates how to improve their use through digital media.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The <em>Collaborative Research: Multimedia Engineering Notebook Tools to Support Engineering Discourse in Urban Elementary School Classrooms </em>project has helped advance the field of engineering education by informing what we know about teaching science to racially and ethnically diverse communities. This research has informed understandings of the role of language, culture, and discourse in science classrooms and how students who bring different linguistic identities to the classroom use their unique knowledge and skills to engage in engineering tasks and communicate about design challenges. This work has also informed the field by explicating elements of reflective decision-making. Evidence from this project suggests that students engage in six reflective decision-making elements: articulating multiple solutions, evaluating pros and cons, intentionally selecting a solution, retelling the performance of a solution, analyzing a solution according to evidence, and purposefully choosing improvements. These patterns of discourse affected design outcomes in a variety of ways. In some cases, discourse patterns supported design goals, and in other instances, they interfered with design goals. Additionally, this research has helped us to better understand the role of risk management in students' science engagement. A better understanding of how minoritized students deal with potential risks helps to inform how teachers support students in taking risks when engaging engineering design challenges. Furthermore, this project has helped to explicate the role of professional development communities and teacher identities in the kinds of support teachers receive in their role as engineering educators. Finally, this work has contributed to teacher preparation and professional development through the development of curriculum designed to help teachers better understand the unique needs and experiences of students from minoritized groups as they engage in science instruction.&nbsp; Through this curriculum, practicing teachers and pre-service teachers have been equipped with the tools needed to support students' science development in culturally responsive ways.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/29/2019<br>      Modified by: Chonika&nbsp;C&nbsp;Coleman-King</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
