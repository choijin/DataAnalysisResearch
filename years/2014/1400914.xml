<AbstractNarration>Understanding and simulating the magnitude and timing of the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels at the end of the last ice age has been a major challenge for the Earth Science research community. At the same time, a well-informed long-term societal response to climate changes requires a detailed understanding of climate-carbon cycle feedbacks on a variety of timescales. This project addresses these challenges through an in-depth study of the evolution of the marine carbon cycle over the past 25,000 years and its relation to ocean circulation changes and carbon reservoir exchanges. The information gained from this project will be beneficial for assessing the performance of earth system models under past, present and future climate conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a series of transient earth system model experiments with time-varying boundary conditions, the research team will identify deglacial ocean circulation scenarios that reproduce the existing paleoceanographic tracers, with special focus on radiocarbon. By including other age tracers into the proposed model simulations, the fidelity of various radiocarbon-based "ventilation" age methods, such as the projection age and the benthic-planktonic age difference method will be tested. The proposed numerical experiments will provide deeper physical insights into the dynamics of climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. Specific questions that will be addressed include: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. How did the time-varying signal of atmospheric radiocarbon production rates "propagate" into the deep ocean? &lt;br/&gt;2. How did ocean circulation changes during the last glacial termination affect the three-dimensional structure of radiocarbon anomalies in the world's oceans? &lt;br/&gt;3. What is the potential carbon storage capacity of the Arctic Ocean under glacial periods?&lt;br/&gt;4. What is the spatial and temporal variability of reservoir ages over the course of Termination 1 and into the Holocene?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main objective of this project was to investigate the role of large-scale circulation changes on marine radiocarbon and to elucidate deglacial dynamics in a potential release of excess carbon from the ocean to the atmosphere.  Using idealized freshwater hosing experiments in combination with paleo-proxy records, our results clearly demonstrate the large impact of overturning changes on regional as well as the near global marine radiocarbon distribution. A weakening of the AMOC and an associated strengthening of the North Pacific meridional overturning lead to large-scale ventilation changes that result in a Atlantic-Pacific radiocarbon seesaw pattern during the last glacial termination.   Our transient hindcast simulation of Termination 1 and the extensive comparison with paleo-proxy records of &Delta;14C reaffirms the lack of a distinctive signature of radiocarbon depletion and therefore do not support the notion of interhemispheric exchanges of strongly radiocarbon-depleted middepth water across the tropical Atlantic during Heinrich event 1 and the Younger Dryas.  Our NSF-funded research also facilitated novel insights into Earth's climate sensitivity and the climate drivers of early human migration.  Based on a transient simulation of the last eight glacial cycles and an extensive network of paleo-SST reconstructions, we derived a reconstruction of the global mean surface temperature and radiative forcing evolution over the course of the last 784,000 years.  Our research reveals that Earth's climate sensitivity is strongly dependent on the climate background state and attains larger values during warm phases. Using the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 for future greenhouse radiative forcing, we show that the range of paleo-based estimates of earth?s future warming by year 2100 CE overlaps with the upper range of the CMIP5 climate simulations - providing an independent validation of the magnitude of current CMIP5 projections. Furthermore, our results suggest that it is very likely that within the 21st century global mean temperatures will exceed maximum levels reconstructed for the last 784,000 years.  Using a human dispersal model forced by climate data from the transient model simulations and sea level changes we demonstrate that orbitally-forced climate swings played a major role in controlling the dynamics of human migration during the Late Pleistocene. Precession-driven shifts in vegetation across Northern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the Sinai enabled early Homo sapiens to embark onto their journey into Asia, Europe, Australia and the Americas.
