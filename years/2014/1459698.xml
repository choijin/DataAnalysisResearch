<AbstractNarration>Nitrogen is a critical nutrient in the world's oceans because, among other things, it is a major component of living organisms and can be a driver in primary productivity. Nitrogen is present in the ocean in a number of organic and inorganic forms, which vary in their ease in being assimilated by marine organisms. Cyanate is a simple form of organic nitrogen present in the ocean, although its abundance and importance to the ocean nitrogen cycle is poorly understood. Using newly developed and tested methods for measuring ambient cyanate concentrations and its uptake in seawater, researchers will analyze the distribution, sources, and geochemistry of cyanate in shelf waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Results from this project will elucidate the importance of cyanate in the marine nitrogen cycle and transform understanding of cyanate production and assimilation in the sea. This project will provide a unique opportunity for both graduate student research and undergraduate training, and will likely expose underrepresented groups to marine sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although physiological and genomic evidence suggest that marine microbes can utilize a broad array of inorganic and organic nitrogen compounds, cyanate's role in the marine nitrogen cycle has not yet been examined. As one of the simplest organic nitrogen compounds, cyanate has likely been present in the environment over Earth's long history. Evidence suggests that cyanate metabolism appeared early on in bacterial genomes and thus, the study of cyanate assimilation in the contemporary ocean may illuminate microbial processes with deep evolutionary roots. However, a decade since discovering the genomic capacity for cyanate utilization in marine cyanobacteria, little is still known about cyanate distributions in the environment, how it is produced, and how widespread cyanate utilization is among marine microbes. To further understanding of cyanate's role in the marine nitrogen cycle, a combination of geochemical approaches will be used to assess: 1) the distribution of cyanate in the marine environment, 2) potential sources of cyanate and the timescales at which cyanate is produced, 3) the rate of cyanate removal via microbial uptake and spontaneous decomposition, and 4) the geochemical coupling between cyanate production and consumption. Results generated from this study will be important for augmenting knowledge of the marine nitrogen cycle, refining biogeochemical models, and further understanding of the functioning of marine microbial communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nitrogen (N) is thought to limit productivity in large parts of the ocean.  Because productivity in much of the ocean is limited by N, the oceanic N cycle is linked to the uptake (and release) of carbon dioxide by the oceans and as such, is sensitive to many climate change drivers. We live in an era when many of Earth?s ecosystems are under increasing strain due to accelerating human exploitation and disruption of natural nutrient and carbon cycles.  As a result of this project, we are discovering that cyanate plays a dynamic role in the oceanic N cycle and is bioavailable to marine microbes.  Until now there was no method for estimating cyanate concentrations in seawater or its uptake by microorganisms.  As part of this project, we have applied a sensitive method for measuring cyanate concentrations in seawater (Widner et al. 2013, Analytical Chemistry) and a tracer method using highly enriched (15N and 13C) cyanate to estimate its uptake by microorganisms.  We provided the first cross-system comparison of cyanate concentrations and uptake by microbes.  In addition, we made a detailed examination of environmental gradients in cyanate concentrations and compared cyanate concentrations and uptake kinetics with those of other bioavailable N compounds.  We provided the first evidence that cyanate is photochemically formed in surface waters, at rates similar to those shown for ammonium photoproduction and the cyanate is produced during the degradation of organic matter.  Additionally, we found that cyanate is taken up by mixed phytoplankton assemblages across diverse oceanic environments. Based on these results, we contend that cyanate contributes substantially to nitrogen cycling in both coastal and offshore marine environments. While not explicitly a part of this project, we used the cruise opportunities to expand our measurements of cyanate concentrations in the sea and examine rates of cyanate uptake and losses in the eastern tropical North and South Pacific Ocean associated with the oxygen deficient zones there.  We discovered that cyanate was denitrified by marine microbes in oxygen deficient waters and dubbed this process ?cyanammox?. During our dedicated cruise for this project, we also facilitated research by NASA scientists.  Because of the likely sources of its production and consumption, cyanate exhibits a nutrient like distribution in the environment.  We continue to identify sources of cyanate in the environment and quantify rates at which it is produced and consumed. These observations may contribute to balancing the marine N budget and understanding the metabolic diversity of marine microbes in the ocean at present and the diversity of microbial metabolisms over Earth?s history.   Our results also generate a multitude of questions that are likely to be fodder for decades of research to come.  What are the dominant sources and sinks of cyanate in disparate marine environments?  Is cyanate also involved in dissimilatory nitrogen losses from oxygen deficient oceanic systems?  Which organisms produce and consume cyanate, and does this change depending on environmental conditions?  Might this simple compound have been important in the evolution of life?  Is cyanate also an important participant in nitrogen cycling in freshwater and terrestrial systems?  Are there agricultural, urban, and industrial sources of cyanate? These questions are of interest not only to marine biogeochemists but also to freshwater and terrestrial biogeochemists; environmental chemists, engineers, and microbiologists; molecular biologists and evolutionary biologists; geobiologists and paleochemists; and astrobiologists.
