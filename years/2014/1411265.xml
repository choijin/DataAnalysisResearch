<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program is funding T. Randall Lee of the University of Houston for research to develop new and better materials that will find use in technologies ranging from medical implants to corrosion-resistant films. The approach involves the fabrication of films composed of dissimilar chemical species, such as oil and water that would not normally mix. When these films are applied to a surface, the result is a "conflicted" interface, where one part of an adsorbing molecule the oil-like part, for example may stick, while the other part will be repelled. Since unwanted or undesirable substances are less likely to adhere to these types of mixed surfaces, they have certain advantages. They are especially valuable for producing medical implants since they are more biologically inert than other surfaces. They are also more resistant to corrosion, opening up new realms of application for these materials. The work is having a broader impact on the development of new materials for a variety of technologies including the possible development of smart surfaces that will be capable of detecting trace chemical hazards. It is having a further broad impact on the training of a diverse future generation of scientists through the investigators' participation in several educational and outreach programs, including the University of Houston Latino Outreach program and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, the investigators are conducting a systematic exploration of organic thin films composed of chemical species that would normally phase separate in order to prepare ultrathin paint-like coatings that do no not exist in nature. The research focuses on three systems of current technological interest: (1) the design and development of multidentate adsorbates for stable thin-film coatings that contain a specified mixture of functional groups, either chemically similar or chemically dissimilar, to generate heterogeneous interfaces with unique composition and function; (2) the preparation of custom-tailored, partially-fluorinated adsorbate molecules to generate nanoscale fluorinated films having well-defined composition and structure, with the goal to define the critical elements needed to construct organic interfaces with controlled hydrophobicity, anti-adhesiveness, and lubricity; and (3) the investigation of thin-film architectures that mimic the backbones of industrially relevant polymers, with the goal to evaluate the properties and reactivity of ideal polymer surfaces. The research and education program has four main thrusts: (1) design and synthesis of new molecules to assemble structurally and chemically well-defined interfaces; (2) detailed characterization of the corresponding films; (3) thorough examination of interfacial wetting, adhesion and friction in these systems; and (4) integration of the major research concepts of organic chemistry, molecular self-assembly and nanotechnology into course modules for use in minority participation projects at the University of Houston.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Technological advances are driving several industries toward the miniaturization of devices and materials, highlighting the important role that surfaces and interfaces play in the design of such materials.  Of particular importance is the ability to design molecules that generate versatile, and stable films.  Of current technological interest is the development of versatile molecules to generate (1) multi-component interfaces; (2) anti-adhesive, hydrophobic surfaces with properties similar to polytetrafluoroethylene; and (3) surfaces that behave similarly to industrially relevant polymers, but at the nanoscale.  Prior to the work reported here, there were no examples detailing the science behind the construction of these types of unique surfaces.  When taken as a whole, this research will lead to the design of new and better materials for use in a variety of technologies ranging from ultra-inert coatings for biomedical implants to nanoscale sensing devices for the detection and identification of toxic and/or pathogenic substances.  The Intellectual Merit of this project can be gleaned from the published work and public presentations over the award period, which are summarized herein: we designed and synthesized a wide variety of adsorbate molecules for the generation of stable, multi-component films exhibiting unique properties and nanoscale coating capacities.  The results of this research were disseminated in the form of seventeen international peer-reviewed publications, three additional manuscripts submitted for peer review, 20 invited talks, and 23 oral/poster presentations at various conferences.   With regard to Broader Impacts during the award period, this project led to the research experiences of six postdoctoral fellows, seven graduate students, three undergraduate students, and three high school students, many of whom hold underrepresented status (four women and five minorities; three of the undergraduate and two graduate students are described by both categories).  In addition, eight graduate students who worked on this project were granted their Ph.D. degree after successfully defending their dissertation.  During the award period, the PI supported and promoted science education at two inner city schools in transition (Milby High School and Mickey Leland College Preparatory Academy for Young Men) as their campuses were being rebuilt, providing laboratory supplies and support for their chemistry programs as well as sponsoring "Day of Discovery" visits of the students to the campus of the University of Houston.
