<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor R. David Britt from the Department of Chemistry at the University of California-Davis (UCD) and colleague Neville Luhmann from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCD as well as various senior personnel from California, Oregon, Massachusetts and Florida will develop a pulsed EPR spectrometer that will work at a high frequency (260 GHz), with low power (50 W), and bandwidth (20 GHz) capable of carrying out electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) methods and double electron-electron resonance (DEER). The heart of the spectrometer design is a compact 260 GHz Sheet Beam Traveling Wave Tube (SBTWT) amplifier operating at a voltage of 20 kV with a 1% pulse duty cycle. The design is scaled from that of a 220 GHz SBTWT developed under the DARPA HiFIVE program. An industrial partner (Bridge 12) is also going to be involved. In general, an EPR spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid state materials. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive species involved in valuable chemical transformations as well as the initiation of pathological tumor growth. These studies will impact a number of areas, from the synthesis of inorganic and organic molecules to the development of new solid state materials to compounds of magnetic and biological interest. Importantly, participation of students will allow preparation of the new generation of instrumentalists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will produce an instrument capable of carrying out a series of high impact research in various interdisciplinary fields while involving multiple departments across the United States. The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) using Gd(III)-DPTA labeling; (b) studying mechanisms of activation in proteins of GPCR signal transduction; (c) studying how metals bind to the antimicrobial Calprotectin S100-family protein; (d) using ENDOR to probe a high affinity Mn(II) binding site in the catalytically active Mn-substituted form of the hammerhead ribosome; (e) studying oxidation of Mn(II) in manganese dioxide biomineralization by the bacterial multicopper oxidase MnxG; (f) studying the circadian clock of cyanobacteria; (g) analyzing the effects of metal ion binding in activity of DNA polymerase; (h) studying how metal ion binding affects protein folding and misfolding in a variety of proteins with Cu(II) and Zn(II) binding domains; (i) studying water oxidation and hydrogen reduction catalysts to be employed in solar fuel systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Magnetic resonance is a powerful technique for studying chemical and biochemical reactions.  The most common form of magnetic resonance is NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) which can be used to study individual molecules in detail (NMR spectroscopy) by revealing the magnetic environment of magnetic nuclear spins like those of protons.  Alternatively, NMR serves as the physical basis for magnetic resonance imaging, detecting protons in tissues and water in the body. Over the last few decades the sensitivity and resolution of NMR spectroscopy has greatly increased with consistent developments in higher magnetic field magnets.  The NMR frequency, typically some hundreds of MHz, scales directly with the magnetic field.     Certain chemical species have unpaired electron spins, for example organic radicals and some metals and metal clusters.  In this case one can do magnetic resonance on the unpaired electron spins, which have much larger magnetic moments than nuclei, and hence resonate at much higher frequencies than nuclei at a given magnetic field.  This has resulted in this field of magnetic resonance, termed Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR), to be performed at relatively low field, since the frequency is still relatively high because of the larger magnetic moment of the electrons compared to NMR nuclei. A big issue going to higher magnetic field is that the technology for delivering high power pulses at the much higher EPR frequencies  (say above 100 GHz/100,000 MHz) is still quite challenging.     Our MRI project is to build a high field/frequency/power pulse EPR spectrometer to achieve higher sensitivity and resolution for this important technique probing chemical structures and reactions. We have successfully built and characterized a low power version, working at 263 GHz in a 12 Tesla magnet.  Unfortunately, the challenges of building the high power amplifier have been a bottleneck so far, but our collaborator on this part of the project, Professor Neville Luhmann, is collaborating on a new design that we hope will give the high power performance we need to achieve the full promise of this high field/frequency EPR instrument.
