<AbstractNarration>MRI:  Acquisition of High-Speed Cameras with Quantitative Stereo Imaging and Digital Image Correlation Capabilities for Multidisciplinary Research and Education&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visualization and imaging are important aspects in the processes of discovering and understanding new phenomena.  Because of recent advances in imaging technologies and related hardware and software, improved capabilities to perceive and measure three-dimensional events at high-speeds allow for investigating various phenomena at a more detailed level than ever before.  Furthermore, as new materials, devices, and systems move beyond the exploration stage and relatively simple configurations to more complex ones, high-resolution analysis and testing become critical issues and particularly to those involving both, spatial and temporal domains.  These state-of-the-art imaging instruments will provide new capabilities for three-dimensional imaging of a variety of collaborative and multidisciplinary projects spanning from testing materials and systems at the meso- and micro-scale to biomedical, manufacturing, and energy applications.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These high-speed cameras with quantitative digital image correlation will facilitate the complete three-dimensional investigation of transient events with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions.  Examples of the use of these high-speed cameras at Worcester Polytechnic Institute will include a- high-resolution acoustic-solid interactions and micro-/nano-systems; b- measurement of bubble departure diameter rand frequency under extreme heat fluxes for electrically driven liquid film flow boiling over surfaces enhanced with nano-mats; c- capturing both instantaneous damage initiation events (occurring at micro-/nano-structural features such as secondary phases/metal matrix interfaces, grain/phase boundaries, defects, etc.), as well as crack propagation phenomena at various growth rates; d- investigating the structure and turbulent mixing processes of dust-air flames; and e- understanding of MRI-guided deep brain surgery through quantitative assessment and optimization of motion of the piezo crystals and surrounding tissue.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ MRI: acquisition of high-speed cameras with quantitative stereo imaging and digital image correlation for research and teaching  This MRI project involved the acquisition of sets of high-speed cameras with image acquisition capabilities ranging from 7.5 fps to 2M fps (i.e., up to 2 million frames per second)  and with spatial resolutions at low rates of 2448 &times; 2048 pixels to 128 &times; 16 at the highest rates of acquisition.  Cameras operate in quantitative stereo vision configurations with added digital image correlation (DIC) capabilities.  These combined imaging technologies enable full-field-of-view, non-contact, 3D measurements of complex structures and systems with very high temporal and spatial resolutions over range of sizes from macro-scale to micro-scale.  Camera systems are primarily located in a suitable optics environment of one of the laboratories of Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)?s Center for Holographic Studies and Laser micro-mechaTronics (http://chslt.wpi.edu/) and have also been transferred to and operated in other laboratories across the university campus.  Intellectual merit.  High-speed cameras with DIC systems are enabling fundamental and applied transformative discoveries within current and future funded multi-disciplinary research projects.  Particularly, as new devices and systems move beyond the exploration stage and relatively simple configurations to more complex ones, high-resolution analysis and testing become critical issues.  Motions and deformations that are too small to be of any consequence at the spatial and temporal scales that we are used to think about can have detrimental consequence in the performance of new components and materials and, therefore, methods of detection must be rethought.  The specific capabilities of the high-speed camera systems are being used to achieve the following: (a) development and application of new testing methodologies involving hardware and software controls for quantitative measurements of transient events with high-temporal resolution; (b) quantitative 3D measurements of transient events that are of relevance to biomedical, energy, fire protection, materials, manufacturing, MEMS/Microsystems, and robotics; (c) development of high-speed non-destructive testing methodologies for challenging applications and for the realization of advanced components and materials not existing today and that will be needed in the future; (d) perform highly multidisciplinary research (fundamental and applied) as well as teaching within the wide spectrum of the state-of-the-art activities being conducted across the Science and Engineering disciplines at WPI.  Broader impact.  The highly capable and portable imaging instruments are providing new opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to acquaint themselves with the capabilities of quantitative 3D imaging and their application to a variety of collaborative and multidisciplinary projects spanning from testing materials and systems at the meso- and micro-scale to biomedical, manufacturing, and energy applications.  Projects of interest at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate levels have been developed and additional projects are underway.  Further, results have been and are being disseminated through publications, conferences, as well as with industrial, federal, and other research institutions sponsoring the relevant centers and laboratories involved in 3D imaging at WPI.  Quantitative high-speed imaging capabilities are regularly demonstrated to visitors from academia, industry, and national laboratories as well as featured in visits by K-12 students and aspiring candidates to WPI?s programs.
