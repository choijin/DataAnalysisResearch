<AbstractNarration>The southeastern USA is botanically rich, with areas of high global biodiversity in both the Appalachians and the coastal plain.  Millions of plant specimens have been collected from this region over the past four centuries, and these specimens and the information they contain currently reside in museums, or herbaria, at universities across the area.  Scientists study these specimens intently; however, it is difficult to retrieve information at broad geographic and taxonomic scales without pipelines to move the information electronically from the specimen to an accessible pool of data.  SERNEC, or the SouthEast Regional Network of Expertise and Collections, is a large regional network of botanical experts and collections that has, through an NSF-sponsored research coordination network (RCN) project, developed critical skills in biodiversity informatics.  The current project will allow the SERNEC group to make data available for over 3 million specimens using the latest photography and information capture tools and to engage citizen scientists and students to assist in transcribing and georeferencing this large dataset.  The research generated through this project can help regional planners, land managers and communities to manage their natural resources in our ever-changing environment.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interaction of scientists, citizen scientists, and students will provide a synergy to build a research tool of an unparalleled scale and scope.  The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an imaged and databased set of over 3 million specimens from over 100 herbaria in one of the most floristically diverse regions in North America and a global hotspot of plant diversity. This will represent a valuable data source for research on the response of vegetation to climate change, human development, and rapid migrations of introduced species. This region has been a biodiversity hotspot for 100 million years and this project should encourage research on changes over time to develop better predictive models as areas of biodiversity change. By partnering with Symbiota, Notes from Nature, GEOLocate, Adler Planetarium, iPlant/TACC, and Specify, the project will develop ways to best integrate various efforts for data accessibility. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program, and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Natural history museums conserve and provide access to specimens crucial to our understanding about our natural and cultural heritage.  A herbarium is a natural history collection of archivally preserved, pressed, and dried plants that have crucial data (such as locality and ecology) associated with them on printed labels.  The Southeast Regional Network of Expertise and Collections (SERNEC) is a consortium of all herbaria in the southeastern United States.  The overall goals of this SERNEC NSF Thematic Collections Network (TCN) project were to develop a digitized  (imaged and databased) set of 4.7 million plant specimens from the southeastern United States from 107 herbaria in the region, and to make these images and data available in a searchable format via an Internet portal.  The state of Georgia's contribution to this five-year project comprised digitizing 186,355 specimens from herbaria at six institutions throughout the state: Armstrong Atlantic State University, Columbus State University, Georgia Southern University, Georgia Southwestern State University, University of Georgia, and University of West Georgia.  The digital specimens are now available via the SERNEC portal [http://sernecportal.org/portal/].     The main outcome of the study, creation of the southeastern U.S. plant specimen database, has many practical applications for field-based studies, such as defining under-collected areas, ranges of endangered/exotic species, and location of plant communities requiring management.  Other significant research use of the data include exploration on the effects of climate change on this floristic region, modeling of vulnerable populations, and conservation tactics to conserve regional biodiversity.  These data have, therefore, been eagerly awaited by amateurs and professionals alike who desire access to specimen images and distribution data.     The Georgia portion of this NSF TCN enabled training and mentoring in museum protocols and outreach activities for 41 undergraduates, two graduate students, and three post-baccalaureates at five institutions in the state.  In addition, four undergraduate research projects were based on data from digitized specimens, resulting in two posters and eight papers presented at several professional venues, and two scientific papers.  Formal class assignments at Valdosta State University and the University of Georgia, involving herbarium specimen data-entry via Notes from Nature [https://www.zooniverse.org/organizations/md68135/notes-from-nature], introduced many students to citizen (crowd-sourced) science: this activity provided an opportunity for these students to contribute significantly to data tracking global biodiversity.        The database itself addresses a broad audience in a rapidly growing state.  The current momentum for development of collections-based informatics supports permanency of plant collections at home institutions and also in the public sphere.  This project has, therefore, also strengthened the Georgia Herbarium Alliance in efforts to promote the value of the smaller collections in the state.
