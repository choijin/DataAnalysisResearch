<AbstractNarration>Assembly is traditionally considered an externally-directed process, where a person or machine assembles components according to a list of directions. An alternative process is self-assembly, where components themselves encode information specifying their ultimate position, and mere random mixing leads to spontaneous assembly. The complexity of structures self-assembled at molecular-scales has increased dramatically over the last ten years, especially in the field of DNA nanotechnology. In contrast to molecular self-assembly, the complexity of larger self-assembled products - i.e., of the scale routinely manufactured using externally-directed assembly - has remained low. This award supports fundamental research to generate the essential knowledge for the application of molecular-scale self-assembly techniques to larger scales.  Such fundamental knowledge will eventually enable the development of a new manufacturing paradigm where diverse products are made through unsupervised and parallel self-assembly. Work in this project includes collaborations of scientists, engineers, and artists, as well as support of undergraduate research and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rigid products self-assembled from flexible DNA strands now routinely consist of hundreds of unique components. Structures have been designed in 2D or 3D, with overall dimensions up to 100 nm.  In contrast, self-assembly at larger scales remains limited to a handful of components, in part due to the low information content of the components and poor mixing strategies.  This award supports the development of a theory describing the minimum material requirements for DNA-like self-assembly at any length scale.  It will be demonstrated with the construction of a cm-scale DNA-like polymer system as well as a compatible stochastic mixing environment.  Data taken from this new system will in turn demonstrate random perturbation, sequence-specific pairing of polymers using three and four-arm junctions, and complex product assembly using "Single Stranded Tile" and other frameworks.  Analytical comparison to chemical kinetics will further demonstrate scale-independent phenomena and provide a theoretical basis for predicting performance at intermediate length scales.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In contrast to the everyday experience of directed assembly, where components are put directly into final position, self assembly is the design of component interactions such that they spontaneously form the desired assembly through random interaction.  Until the development of the "DNA origami" technique ten years ago [Rothemund, Nature 2006], the promise of self-assembly was only apparent in the spectacular success of biological structure development, growth, and maintenance, and largely inaccessible in man-made systems.  With the rise of DNA nanotechnology, researchers finally had a material and basic design principles that allowed straightforward, de novo design of complex structures containing thousands of unique elements [Ke et al., Science 2012].  It quickly and vastly surpassed 50 years of research into the field of macroscopic self-assembly, which could assemble only small numbers (a dozen) of elements; we did not understand the requirements for success.  Despite some opinions that practical self-assembly is impossible at these scales, our and other advances in this area are demonstrating a renewed optimism. Researchers will apply these developments to both understand the basis and requirements for macroscopic self-assembly, especially as it is differentiated from molecular self-assembly, and to develop more complex and imaginative assembly elements.  Over the course of the research we constructed a novel system to randomly mix components for more reliable assembly, and attribute much of our success to the design.  We then designed and investigated three types of cm-scale rigid tile assembly: First, in analogy to DNA "Single Stranded Tiles" [Wei et al., Nature 2012], 23 unique rectangular tiles each with four uniquely addressed domains assembled into a complex of arbitrary, pre-programmed shape.  Each domain interacts with a domain on another tile, with a single tile ultimately interacting with four others.  When interacting domains were complementary, the stabilizing energy protected against rapid disintegration by the randomizing motion and allowed for a chance at further assembly.   Second, "Algorithmic Self-Assembly" [Rothemund et al., Plos Biol 2004] functionality was demonstrated by assembling 60 tiles of four species into a full 4-bit counter pattern (i.e., a ?0000? row followed by a ?0001? row, a ?0010? row, etc., to ?1111?).  This represents the largest number of macroscopic components assembled to date.  Third, we developed and demonstrated square tiles in the philosophy of "ribbon," or "tube"-type assembly [Yin et al., Science 2008], where only a few tile species define the cross section of the structure, but are repeated indefinitely along its length.  All tile types used a combination of magnetic and geometric information to convey preferred assembly relationships.  Assembly was completed in minutes to 1-2 hours, depending on system and complexity, and analyzed for robustness and kinetics.  In addition to technology development itself, NSF funding of this project has touched on the professional development of no less than 12 students, staff, and post-docs.  The project has resulted in multiple presentations, poster sessions, and (pending) publications.  The accessible nature of macroscopic self-assembly has and will continue to draw teachers and students keen on actually observing tangible models of diffusion, chemical kinetics, energy and entropy, and self-assembly that are foundations of physics, chemistry, and biology.  Outside of academics, we believe that, in the next ten years, techniques in macroscopic self-assembly will spread to the manufacturing discipline, allowing for the effort-efficient manufacture of many copies of the same structure in parallel, perhaps where directed assembly is impractical, unhealthy, or time or resource-limited.  A US and international patent on this material has been granted as:  Thomas E. Schaus, Peng Yin, Wei Sun, David Yu Zhang, "Compositions and methods for self-assembly of polymers with complementary macroscopic and microscopic scale units," US9617392 B2 / US 14/131,701.
