<AbstractNarration>This project, from the University of Houston (UH), creates an I-Corps Site at UH.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This UH Site builds on several iniatives including a faculty inventor/entrepreneurship student partnering program, an internal Technology Gap Fund, and a UH start-up incubator and various public-private partnerships providing access to investment capital. The long-term goal of this Site is to build a sustainable, innovation ecosystem anchored at UH with strong links to the local entrepreneurial community while also helping to address the national "innovation gap". &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objective for the UH Site is to create an innovation culture at UH by establishing an I-Corps site to house an institutional-led, cross-disciplinary, initiative providing a combination of academic and "hands-on" entrepreneurial business training in STEM + Business (UH?s STEM-B program). Funding from this program, coupled with institutional resources, will be used to "seed" the formation of entrepreneurial teams around technologies "spun-out" from the UH IP portfolio or "spun-in" from the local ecosystem. The I-Corps site and STEM-B will be used to coordinate a range of other related activities such as a Life Sciences Entrepreneur Associate internship program, the UH Entrepreneur-In-Residence (EIR) program, a new Life Sciences Laboratory Incubator facility to complement the existing UH Innovation Center and UH's recent $25 M strategic partnership with a venture capital firm, all located at the UH Energy Research Park.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The creation of an I-Corps site at UH will augment the number of STEM-qualified entrepreneurs available to enter the growing Greater Houston-area innovation ecosystem, while helping to address the national "innovation gap". It will also serve to strengthen existing relationships with the local and regional ecosystem by providing formal bi-directional partnering mechanisms for technology commercialization that takes advantage of the burgeoning UH entrepreneurial workforce. A key goal is to develop a cadre of qualified "Entrepreneurial Leads" eligible to serve on I-Corps grants submitted by both UH and non-UH inventors. It will also provide ongoing support and mentoring to these early-stage entrepreneurs, thereby leveraging UH's infrastructure to assist in enhancing the local, regional and national innovation systems in bringing technologies to market.</AbstractNarration>

While technology transition requires access to many different types of resources including capital, ensuring access to a well-trained innovation workforce with both the technical <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> entrepreneurial training required to explore, identify and capitalize on viable commercial opportunities remains one if not the greatest challenege faced by early-stage U.S. start-companies.</p> <p>A central pillar of our recently completed project entitled "<strong>STEM-Business; The Fifth Element of Technology Innovation"</strong>&nbsp;was the creation of<strong> </strong>the<strong> UH I-Corps&nbsp;</strong><strong>Site </strong>by the Office of the Provost. The UH I-Corps Site provides institutional leadership, support and coordination of new and existing innovation and entrepreneurial (I&amp;E) programs at the University of Houston, while intentionally combining the technical skills of faculty inventors with the entrepreneurial expertise already resident on campus. As such, the major goals of the UH I-Corps Site were to: inform faculty members on innovation topics; educate and train individual faculty inventors in technology transition based on the NSF I-Corps approach to technology commercialization; and to provide UH students from both STEM and business disciplines the opportunity to participate in formal, academic experiential learning opportunities involving "real-world" technology transition using the NSF I-Corps model.</p> <p>Since late 2015, the <strong>UH I-Corps</strong><strong>&nbsp;Site</strong> has collaborated with multiple faculty instructors from five different UH academic colleges (i.e. Business, Natural Sciences and Mathematics, Engineering, Technology and Architecture) to create a total of <strong>thirteen (13) formal academic I&amp;E classes</strong> offered at least once per academic year. Each of these classes utilize the <strong>NSF I-Corps lean launch/customer discovery-based approach </strong>to guide student entrepreneurial teams (<strong>E-Teams</strong>) focused on developing a discipline-specific, technology-enabled product or service as part of the class curriculum. By providing such real world experiences, students not only learn the basic principles of successful technology transition but also receive invaluable training for potential careers in technology-based innovation and product development. While the majority of these classes are offered within a specific academic discipline, the growing popularity of such innovation-related classes with a diverse population of students is exemplified by the "<strong>Women in Entrepreneurship"</strong>&nbsp;class series offered every semester in the College of Business, which attracts women students from multiple academic disciplines across campus.</p> <p>Since the <strong>UH I-Corps</strong><strong>&nbsp;Site </strong>was initially established in late 2015, more than 940 UH students from both STEM and business disciplines have successfully completed a formal academic class incorporating the <strong>NSF I-Corps lean launch/customer discovery-based curriculum </strong>and&nbsp;created more than 500<strong> <em>nascent</em> E-Teams</strong> designed to initially explore the commercial potential of a range of technology-enabled business opportunities.

A significant number of these <em>traditional</em> E-Teams explored the commercial potential of patented technologies created not only at UH but by researchers at NASA, DOE National Laboratories and the Texas Medical Center. In addition, ten (10) <em>traditional</em> E-teams subsequently participated in the NSF Southwest Regional Node I-Corps program, while ten (10) went on to successfully complete the NSF I-Corps national program.

The second was the annual "Fem Tech Innovation Challenge" open to nascent E-Teams enrolled in the "Women in Entrepreneurship" class series and women innovators from the Greater Houston area. During the recent COVID pandemic, delivery of all UH I-Corps Site programming was transitioned to a completely virtual format, including the creation of standardized virtual LLC/customer discovery curriculum available to any faculty instructor for inclusion in their academic class, and completely virtual versions of both the Battle of the Classes and the Fem Tech Innovation Challenge pitch competitions.
