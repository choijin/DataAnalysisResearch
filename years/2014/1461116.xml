<AbstractNarration>BROADER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site Program, Explore it! Building the Next Generation of Sustainable Forest Bioproduct Researchers aims for participants to develop and utilize new knowledge to address forest bioproduct issues impacting society in an ethical manner. The REU Site recruits minorities through extensive use of existing linkages with primarily minority serving institutions. Results are disseminated via campus and international presentations, and through journal articles and symposia. REU students work alongside middle-school teachers creating curricular modules to teach STEM principles to middle school children employing the concept of sustainable forest bioproducts as a vehicle. Participants present to and interact with FBRI faculty, thereby broadening both their and the faculty experiences. Society benefits as participants disseminate their findings, impact middle school education, obtain a broader understanding of research ethics, and further, enroll in graduate school to advance their careers. The international scientific community benefits as the REU participants present their findings to our Chilean colleagues, while learning of the parallel research performed at the University of Concepcion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a continuation of a previously funded REU Site: Explore it! Building the Next Generation of Sustainable Forest Bioproduct Researchers. This REU Site provides 10 undergraduates with a ten week summer research experience, leveraged on the focus areas of the University of Maine, Forest Bioproducts Research Institute (FBRI). Focus on sustainable forest bioproducts is highly topical and of great global importance in the area of sustainable bioproduct alternatives. Students conduct research advancing their knowledge of the field in general and one of the thematic elements, specifically: 1) sustainability and LCA, 2) feedstock extraction/modification, 3), process control and sensing, 4) nanomaterial production and utilization, and 5) new product development. REU funding provides stipends and professional development activities for 30 undergraduates over 3 years. Additional non-NSF REU funded students will participate, including 6 Chilean students on a mutual exchange with 6 US students, thereby broadening the impact of the program. Students are mentored by one of 12 Faculty, all of whom are senior personnel in the FBRI, Maine Maritime Academy (MMA) or University of Concepcion-UDT, Chile. The REU program concludes with a forest products industry field trip to Chile, and also involves a research conference where participants present their work to Chilean faculty and students. A unique set of evaluation and assessment tools are employed that allow tracking of student performance, thus enabling feedback to students and the program alike. The Site Proposal EEC-1461116 acknowledges the support from the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The objective of the REU Site is to provide active research participation among a diverse group of undergraduate students in the area of sustainable forest bioproducts. Through NSF support, the program comprises a cadre of 10 students for 10 weeks during each summer. The cadre is typically 12 students including 2 Chilean students per cadre, supported by colleagues at the University of Concepci?n, Chile. An ethics in science and engineering program is held during the first week of the program. Exceptional students from a variety of academic institutions including public and private universities and colleges as well as community colleges are targeted. A special emphasis is placed on recruiting from primarily minority and undergraduate serving institutions. A diverse group of participants results, with an annual average of 45% minority student participation over the 3 years of the program. The intellectual focus of the REU Site research on sustainable forest bioproducts is in the following thematic areas: i) sustainability and life cycle analysis, ii) solids extraction/modification, iii), nanomaterial production and utilization and iv) new product development. The program involves faculty research mentors, each working with one student. The participating faculty has research interests in biomass processing, biotechnology, surface chemistry and characterization, polymer chemistry, forest operations, environmental economics, life cycle assessment, etc. The breadth of faculty expertise allows the accommodation of a large range of student interests and enhances the interdisciplinary nature of the research experience. In addition to the research experience, the REU students are involved in curriculum development with middle and high school teachers through an RET add on to the program. Upon completion of the research program, the UMaine REU student cadre, including the two Chilean students (12 students total and 2 faculty mentors) participate in a one-week exchange to Chile to tour eucalyptus and radiata pine forest plantations, and forest products production facilities (cellulose, kraft pulp and paper, fiberboard) as well as the University of Concepci?n. The field trip to Chile provides opportunities for students to better understand how different academic disciplines contribute to forest bioproducts research. In addition, students learn the nuances of technical practices in the forest products industry in Chile and vary in comparison to the state of Maine as well as discuss business, marketing, technology and environmental issues. It is anticipated that one outcome of the field trip is improved interdisciplinary and international communication skills among REU students. REU student final presentations (20 minutes each plus questions/discussion) are held at the University of Concepci?n-UDT, during the exchange trip in the format of a research conference). The entire conference is streamed to the U.S. so that the UMaine-based research teams can participate. This provides a true international flavor to the FBRI REU program in sustainable forest-based bioproducts and benefits the international scientific and engineering community as a whole. In particular, the REU students are better prepared to collaborate with international scholars and develop a broader international perspective.</p> <p>&nbsp;<strong>Intellectual Merit</strong>. Focus on sustainable forest bioproducts is highly topical and of great global importance in the area of sustainable bioproduct alternatives. The REU program builds on substantial research strengths at UMaine. The participating faculty have mentored over 240 undergraduate students in research and co-authored 55 publications with undergraduates. Students and faculty are exposed to an international element which builds upon existing research collaborations with Chilean colleagues. As such, an understanding of the global importance of the research endeavor, especially as it relates to sustainable forest bioproducts is achieved.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;<strong>Broader Impacts</strong>.
