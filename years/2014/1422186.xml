<AbstractNarration>Machine Translation, automated question answering, dialogue systems -- the many useful, emerging language technologies -- depend on recognizing patterns in text. Right now, the only patterns that can dependably be recognized are very local, no bigger than a sentence clause. Enabling patterns to be recognized across clauses in a text by identifying what links them and what the link conveys was the goal of the NSF-supported Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB), a nearly 1-million word text resource labelled with text-linking devices ("discourse connectives" and adjacency), the spans of text they link, and what the link conveys. In the five years since the release of the PDTB, computational linguistics researchers from around the world have used the format it pioneered,to develop similar resources for other languages and to use these resources for recognizing larger patterns in text. The current PDTB, however, lacks the full range of explicit and implicit text-linking devices in English and what they convey; the information which is badly needed by many forward-looking language technology applications. The goal of this project is to conduct research with the purpose to enrich the PDTB with these additional devices and to develop ways for authoritatively annotating other texts with similar information, but with less manual effort, as a basis for extending the range of texts whose larger, cross-clausal patterns can be recognized automatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a response to calls (from both the language technology and computational psycholinguistics communities) for increased coverage and continuity of discourse relation annotation, both across and within the sentences of a text. To ensure a systematic annotation scheme grounded in evidence, the project starts by addressing some foundational questions about the properties of additional linguistic signals of discourse relations and how to capture these properties consistently and completely through manual annotation. From this follows systematic, evidence-grounded annotation of Entity Relations; constructions (other than discourse connectives) that reliably signal discourse relations; implicit intra-sentential discourse relations (building on PropBank annotation of the Penn TreeBank, and concurrent discourse relations (where implicit relations hold in addition to ones signaled explicitly). The project  also explores the use of crowd-sourcing to support sub-tasks in discourse relation annotation that would lead to a reduction in the manual effort needed for expert annotation of other corpora, or enable large-scale experiments on aspects of human understanding of discourse relations. As with the Penn Discourse TreeBank 2.0, the enhanced corpus resulting from the project will be disseminated by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), a well-established institution for world-wide distribution of language resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Penn Discourse TreeBank version 3 (PDTB-3) is an enlarged, simplified, and, we believe, more consistently annotated corpus of discourse relations than the previous NSF-funded version of the corpus, the PDTB-2. With over 53,000 discourse relations annotated over the 1-million word Penn Wall Street Journal corpus, it is the largest manually-annotated corpus of discourse relations produced to date.     Although the field of Natural Language Processing aims to move away from inducing models from manually-annotated corpora, and replace this with exploiting unannotated text or inducing models from text annotated by naive subjects through crowd-sourcing, it is still the case that when one is trying to understand linguistic phenomena, such as how discourse coherence is established in a text through a combination of explicit and implicit means, nothing can replace humanly-annotated corpora.  Such corpora not only provide data from which machines can induce models, but also provide a way for researchers to better understand the phenomena and their distribution.     From a computational perspective, the PDTB-2 laid a foundation for the task of ``shallow discourse parsing'', which was used as a Shared Task at both the  2015 and 2016 conferences on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL). The new PDTB-3 corpus will support the Shared Task planned for the 2019 Workshop on Discourse Parsing and TreeBanking, to be held in Minneapolis MN, in connection with the North American Chapter of the ACL.     The new corpus and its enlarged, simplified sense hierarchy is also being used to support cross-lingual research on discourse coherence, through the TED-MDB corpus -- a set of TED talks independently translated into a range of languages -- whose translations into Turkish, Portuguese, German, Russian, Polish, and Lithuanian have been annotated for discourse relations using the PDTB-3 sense hierarchy and the Annotation Tool that is being distributed with the corpus.     New features added to the PDTB-3 (that were not already part of the PDTB-2) include: (1) annotated relations between verb phrase conjuncts (with either explicit or implicit conjunction markers); (2) annotated relations between implicitly-conjoined clauses within the same sentence; (3) annotated relations between free adjuncts and their matrix cause; (4) annotated relations between infinitival adjunct clauses and their matrix clause; (5) annotated relations between preposition-subordinated adjunct clauses and their matrix clause; and (6) annotation of partly-lexical, partly-syntactic constructions as unambiguous signals of discourse relations. For backward compatibility, the provenance of each token in the corpus is marked, allowing researchers to distinguish those tokens whose annotation is unchanged from the PDTB-2, those tokens from the PDTB-2 that have been changed in some way, and those that are new to the PDTB-3.     Researchers around the world (in the Americas, Europe and Asia) have been using the  PDTB-2 since its release in 2008, and requests already received for the PDTB-3 show that the community believes it will be equally useful (or more so) for computational, linguistic and psycholinguistic research and development.
