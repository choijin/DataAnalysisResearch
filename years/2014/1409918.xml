<AbstractNarration>Research Initiation Awards (RIAs) provide support for junior faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) who are starting to build a research program, as well as for mid-career faculty who need to re-direct and re-build a research program.  It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at the researcher's home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tuskegee University's RIA project, within the Department of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE), develops its research capabilities in Computational Nanomechanics and Nanoscale Testing, areas of research which are essential to the development of a deeper understanding of the interaction of nano fillers with the matrix materials and their role in enhancing the mechanical properties of composite structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific activities undertaken through this project include: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Setting up the initial structure with various amounts of cross-linking between SWCNT and Epon molecule and with varying diameters of SWCNT, &lt;br/&gt;2) Determination of interfacial binding energy and frictional stresses between carboxylic (COOH) functionalized SWCNT and Epon composites,&lt;br/&gt;3) Measurement of frictional stresses as a function of the density of chemical bonds between COOH-SWCNT and Epon composites, &lt;br/&gt;4) Quantification of how these stresses scale with the surface area of COOH-SWCNT, &lt;br/&gt;5) Determination of interfacial strength using fiber pull-out and nanoindentation tests to compare the trends in shear strength with respect to SWCNT size and density of interfacial bonds observed in MD simulations, and&lt;br/&gt;6) Involvement of undergraduate students in this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a collaboration with the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Air Force Research Laboratory and the NSF funded Materials for Information Technology (MINT) Center at University of Alabama.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of a competent and diverse workforce in MSE is very critical for the United States to maintain global competitive edge.  The RIA allows TU to introduce new research areas and academic courses to prepare undergraduate students who can compete successfully in the global market.  A robust infrastructure and expertise exists at the institution in cutting-edge research in various aspects of advanced materials that are of interest to the military, automobile, sports, civil and healthcare industries.  In addition to broadening participation through the inclusion and development of underrepresented minorities in STEM, the institution broadens participation in STEM geographically as an Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) jurisdiction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination of research and education outcomes generated from the project?s implementation will be available in several venues including publications in refereed journals and presentations, including student research presentations, at national and international conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Overview</strong>: Through this HBCU-UP Research Initiation Award Grant, the Department of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) at Tuskegee University (TU) developed its research capabilities in Computational Nanomechanics and Nanoscale Testing, areas of research which was lacking and essential to the development of a deeper understanding of the interaction of nano fillers with the matrix materials and their role in enhancing the mechanical properties of composite structures. Dr. Shaik Zainuddin, Assistant Professor of MSE department spearhead this critical task. Specific activities undertaken through this grant include: 1) Setting up the initial structure with various amount of cross-linking between SWCNT and Epon molecule and with a varying diameters of SWCNT, 2) Determination of interfacial binding energy and frictional stresses between carboxylic (COOH) and amine (NH<sub>2</sub>) functionalized SWCNT and Epon composites, 3) Measurement of frictional stresses as a function of the density of chemical bonds between COOH-SWCNT and Epon composites, 4) Determination of interfacial strength using fiber pull-out and nanoindentation tests to compare the trends in shear strength with respect to SWCNT size and density of interfacial bonds observed in MD simulations, and 5) Involve undergraduate students in this research. Dr. Zainuddin was trained and assisted by Dr. Izabel Szlufarska at the University of Wisconsin and Dr. Ajit Roy at the Air Force Research Laboratory. A part of Dr. Zainuddin&rsquo;s research was also carried out at NSF funded Materials for Information Technology (MINT) Center at University of Alabama. The molecular dynamics simulations showed enhancement in interfacial bonding between the COOH and NH<sub>2</sub> functional groups with epon molecules, thereby, increasing the elastic and interfacial properties. The frictional stresses increased linearly with the density of chemical bonds between COOH/NH<sub>2</sub>-SWCNT and epon composites. Also, the increase in SWCNT length and density of interfacial bonds enhanced the interfacial shear strength. However, the change in SWCNT diameter and variation in temperature did not show any considerable change in these properties.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong>: Development of atomistic computational models and experiments at the nanoscale provided significant knowledge about the behavior of advanced composite materials that can be used in a variety of applications. The knowledge developed through this research project benefitted the ongoing research projects in MSE, and enhanced the research and mentoring capabilities of the PI. This also allowed TU to introduce new research areas in Computational Mechanics and Nanomechanical characterization, and a course MENG 493J-Introduction to Computational Nanomechanics. Several undergraduate students from Mechanical Engineering, Biology and Chemistry were involved in this research projects and eighty students successfully completed the course. In addition, the PI and his colleagues have successfully received several research and educational grants from the NSF and other federal agencies as a result of the research conducted in the RIA project.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong>: Development of research capabilities in the area of computational nanomechanics and nanoscale testing allowed Tuskegee University (TU) faculty to conduct cutting-edge research and add to the world&rsquo;s knowledge of the role the nano fillers play in enhancing the performance of nanocomposites in various service conditions. This enhanced capability also broaden the areas of research for students involved in the research and educational activities of the MSE department. We were able to recruit, train and graduate twelve African American students at the undergraduate level, out of which eight students have transitioned to pursue M.S. and Ph.D. degree at TU and other institutions. In addition, eight students from four-year and community colleges recruited during summer through the NSF funded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) participated in the RIA project. Four of these REUs have joined M.S. program in the department of the Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) at TU and continued to work on computational modeling and nanomechanical testing. These graduates will help bring much-needed diversity to the nation&rsquo;s advanced technological workforce. The data generated through this research was disseminated through publications in refereed journal and conference papers, and presentations at national and international conferences and meetings.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/07/2018<br>      Modified by: Shaik&nbsp;Zainuddin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1409918/1409918_10306144_1543035036128_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1409918/1409918_10306144_1543035036128_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Presentation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1409918/1409918_10306144_1543035036128_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Presentation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student making presentation at ERN 2017 conference in Washington DC.</div> <div class="imageCredit">NSF HBCU RIA</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Shaik&nbsp;Zainuddin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Presentation</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1409918/1409918_10306144_1543035130437_2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1409918/1409918_10306144_1543035130437_2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Simulation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1409918/1409918_10306144_1543035130437_2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Simulation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student performing computational simulations</div> <div class="imageCredit">NSF HBCU RIA</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Shaik&nbsp;Zainuddin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Simulation</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1409918/1409918_10306144_1543035236684_3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1409918/1409918_10306144_1543035236684_3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Nanoindentation testing"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1409918/1409918_10306144_1543035236684_3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Nanoindentation testing"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students along the PI performing nanoindentation test</div> <div class="imageCredit">NSF HBCU RIA</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Shaik&nbsp;Zainuddin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Nanoindentation testing</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1409918/1409918_10306144_1543035392069_4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1409918/1409918_10306144_1543035392069_4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Students"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1409918/1409918_10306144_1543035392069_4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Students"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students participated in the RIA project</div> <div class="imageCredit">NSF HBCU RIA</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Shaik&nbsp;Zainuddin</div> <div class="imageTitle">Students</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1409918/1409918_10306144_1543033643351_FarooqSAMPE--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1409918/1409918_10306144_1543033643351_FarooqSAMPE--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SAMPE/CAMX Conference"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1409918/1409918_10306144_1543033643351_FarooqSAMPE--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SAMPE/CAMX Conference"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student receiving an award at SAMPE/CAMX Conference</div> <div class="imageCredit">NSF HBCU-RIA</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Shaik&nbsp;Zainuddin</div> <div class="imageTitle">SAMPE/CAMX Conference</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
