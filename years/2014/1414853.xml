<AbstractNarration>Problems as diverse as jaguar conservation, power grid management, Internet backbone routing, and pen-and-paper puzzles can be abstracted and mathematically formulated as computational 'reconfiguration problems'. As a concrete example, consider establishing patrols for art gallery guards such that all the art is always being observed and the guards transition between two desired configurations. Techniques from theoretical computer science have been applied to determine efficient ways to solve broad classes of these types of problems and demonstrate that, in many instances, they cannot be solved efficiently. This project aims to develop efficient algorithms for constrained cases that still have potential real-world applicability. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Professor Ryuhei Uehara, a world expert on reconfiguration problems, at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sliding Token is a well studied reconfiguration problem in which an instance is a graph and two independent sets of the same size on that graph, and one is tasked with deciding if there is a sequence of independent sets, each differing from the next by removing one vertex and replacing it with a neighbor. Sliding Token is PSPACE-complete on perfect graphs but was recently shown be efficiently decidable for proper interval graphs, trivially perfect graphs, and caterpillars. This research will focus on finding efficient algorithms or hardness proofs for Sliding Token and similar reconfiguration problems on trees, chordal graphs, interval graphs, and similar very structured graph families. Progress on this line of research will hopefully lead to a characterization of the graph properties that tend to make reconfiguration problems intractable. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>
