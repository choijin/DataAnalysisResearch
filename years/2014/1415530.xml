<AbstractNarration>This proposal provides travel support for the 2013 Energy CPS workshop, covering speakers, breakout session moderators, and scribes important to the workshop's overall success. Support will also be provided to enable the participation of underrepresented minorities and women, to ensure the discussions will represent important and emerging areas throughout the CPS and energy research communities. The intellectual merit of the proposal is due to the important nature of the workshop -- to define a research agenda for cyber-physical systems in the context of energy. The broader impact is due to the pervasive nature of energy in CPS, and the generation of a long-range research agenda as well as the formulation of new collaborative teams pursuing efforts in this space.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The NSF CISE Program invited the academic community to participate in an NSF Workshop on Energy Cyber Physical Systems, which was held at the Water View Conference Center in Arlington, Virginia on Dec 16-17, 2013. With over 100 participants and as many written contributions, and with a day and a half of intensive discussions, the community has identified many research challenges and opportunities related to energy CPS.This award covered travel grant for faculty from multiple universities to attend this Workshop.  The Intellectual merit of the discussions:  This Workshop contributed to the discovery of research issues that remain to be explored in the future. The following are the topics that were identified by the Workshop participants:  Explore further the physical laws of energy systems and synergy with the CPS design properties, which is needed if the ECPS is to be effective and responsive to the future control needs. Recognize the shortcomings of traditional approaches and develop fundamentally new approaches that will meet new expectations for the performance of ECPS, including enhanced resiliency and cyber-physical security. Advance the fundamental understanding of hybrid control systems where the continuous dynamics are affected by structural (topology) changes. Focus on development of fundamentally new evaluation metrics and testbeds to support the validation of new solutions. Devise an educational and training program that will allow both academic and industrial specialists to make the transition from legacy systems to new paradigms for ECPS.   The broader impacts:  The energy cyberphysical systems are in integral part of the energy supply chain that feeds all the citizens, government offices and businesses with essential lifelines associated with heating, cooling, transportation and other essential necessities of everyday life. The scientific focus that helps improve such public lifelines, which was the topic of the discussions at the Workshop, is affecting the entire nation.
