<AbstractNarration>In the Succeed in Engineering Technology Scholars (SETS) project, the PIs will plan to award 20 scholarships per year over a five-year period to academically talented engineering technology (ET) students demonstrating financial need. A goal of the project will be to improve the academic performance, time-to-graduation, and career-readiness of these scholars. Students will be selected from those enrolled full time in the targeted ET programs: Computer ET, Mechanical ET, and Electrical Power ET. Eligible students from underrepresented groups will be encouraged to apply for the scholarship. By developing academic support services and programs for the SETS recipients, the SETS project team will ensure the success of the project, thus increasing the number of well-educated and skilled employees to fill local, regional, and national needs in the engineering technology workforce. The project team will establish strong partnerships with university student service offices and local industry and community colleges, to create a sustainable career-path and scholarship program for aspiring students in ET programs. Six industry partners have committed to providing guest speakers, arranging field trips, sponsoring student projects, and providing internship and job placement opportunities for SETS recipients. A project advisory board including members from these collaborative partners will be established to ensure project success. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team has established four objectives that tie directly to measurable outcomes: 1) Award 20 scholarships per year to academically talented students demonstrating financial need enrolled full time in targeted ET programs; 2) Ensure 90% of SETS recipients maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.0 during the semesters for which they receive the scholarship; 3) Grant at least 30% of scholarships to students from underrepresented minority groups; and 4) Assure all SETS recipients participate in at least 80% of the activities designed for them. SETS recipients will develop a Technology Leader Game Plan (TLGP) with their assigned mentors when they enter the SETS program. The TLGP will be used to guide and monitor their academic progress and ensure their timely graduation. The project will advance discovery and understanding by increasing opportunities for students to fully engage in academic education and research as well as technology leadership development activities.  Both formative and summative assessments will be performed to gauge the impact that the SETS programs is having on the learning experience and career prospects of the SETS recipients.  From an analysis of the data and from surveys, the PIs will identify and disseminate the best practices and lessons learned to other UH colleges, administrators, and student support staff, as well as the larger engineering educational community.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overarching goal of the Succeed in Engineering Technology Scholars (SETS) Project is to provide financial support, academic services, and leadership development opportunities &nbsp; to cohorts of low-income and academically talented engineering technology students in alignment with the mission of the NSF S-STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) program as well as the Student Success pillar suppporting the mission of the University of Houston. During the six years of the SETS project, including one-year no-cost-extension, we improved the academic performance, time-to-graduation, and workforce-readiness of selected SETS scholars (a total of 86 students, with 83 graduated before May 2021 and the remaining few expected to graduate timely). We also worked closely with the department and college administration to built up the student support and service infrastructure in the college of technology (COT) and the engineering technology (ET) department. We established some innovative&nbsp;activities&nbsp;and events to nurture students' belongingness by strengthening all three pillars of student success: fulfilling academic potential, navigating career pathway, and jump-starting their professional career.</p> <p>Thanks to the hard work of our faculty mentors (including most of the full time faculty in the programs) and project leadership team, as well as the support from department and college and our industry advisory board members, we achieved the four expected outcomes set out in our project proposal in spite of unexpected external challenges like Hurricane Harvey and COVID. During the 15 months of COVID, we helped our students to maintain their focus on their academic study by tying it to the potential contribution and positive impact they can make to better the society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Outcome 1&nbsp;</em>(O1)<em>:</em>&nbsp;The project awarded more than 200 scholarships during the last six years to a total 87 students in four cohorts, with 74 students graduated by December 2020 and the remaining on target to graduate with B.S. degree in Summer 2021. Given the steady increase in the enrollment of our ET programs and the quality of our students,&nbsp; as well as the success of the SETS program, we see our application pool getting bigger and academically stronger each year throughout the project.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Outcome&nbsp;2&nbsp;</em>(O2)<em>:</em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Among the 87 students receiving SETS scholarship, most of them maintained their academic eligibility by improving their term GPA above 3.0. Almost all of them graduated with accumulative GPA above 3.0. As the program become more and more well-known and well-respected among our students throughout the last six years, the quality of our scholarship application pool improves too, including their GPA.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Outcome&nbsp;3&nbsp;</em>(O3)<em>:</em><em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;Based on the demographic data we collected from the scholarship recipients, including one year no-cost extension, we were able to award scholarship to at least 60% traditionally underrepresetned and minority students even after we eliminated diversity criterion from scholar selection rubrics from the second year of the project.&nbsp;</p> <p>&lt;p<em>Outcome&nbsp;4&nbsp;</em>(O4)<em>:</em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Because all our students take more courses than minimum required credit hours for full time students in order to graduate earlier, their time becomes the most precious and limited resource. We adjusted the objective associated with this outcome in the 2nd year of SETS project in two aspects. First of all, we limited the mandatory activities to three (annual scholarship award and orientation meeting -- half day, research experience, and annual leadership retreat sponsored and led by our industrial advisory board members) and provided ample choices for them to fullfill these requirements throughout the year they are awarded the scholarship.&nbsp;</p> <p>Since Harvey 2017, we highly encouraged scholars to 'pay themselves first' by reserving at least one hour study time per weekday outside their classroom time. This practice turned out to be very helpful during COVID period as well -- helping them not only survive but thrive through the exprience. Many of them still find time and opportunity to help their family and friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The clearly demonstrated commitment of faculty mentor and staff to students' success from our SETS program and several other similar projects on campus also made certain that Student Success was recognized as one of the four pillars of university mission in 2016.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/17/2021<br>      Modified by: Xiaojing&nbsp;Yuan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1458772/1458772_10354502_1626577391104_SETS-UG-RE-Sample--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1458772/1458772_10354502_1626577391104_SETS-UG-RE-Sample--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SETS Research Projects Examples"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1458772/1458772_10354502_1626577391104_SETS-UG-RE-Sample--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SETS Research Projects Examples"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SETS Research Projects Examples</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xiaojing Yuan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaojing&nbsp;Yuan</div> <div class="imageTitle">SETS Research Projects Examples</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1458772/1458772_10354502_1626577144296_ProgramArtifacts--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1458772/1458772_10354502_1626577144296_ProgramArtifacts--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SETS Program Artifacts"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1458772/1458772_10354502_1626577144296_ProgramArtifacts--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SETS Program Artifacts"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SETS Program Artifacts</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xiaojing Yuan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaojing&nbsp;Yuan</div> <div class="imageTitle">SETS Program Artifacts</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1458772/1458772_10354502_1626577011218_AnnualLeadershipRetreat--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1458772/1458772_10354502_1626577011218_AnnualLeadershipRetreat--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Annual Leadership Retreats"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1458772/1458772_10354502_1626577011218_AnnualLeadershipRetreat--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Annual Leadership Retreats"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Annual Leadership Retreats</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xiaojing Yuan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaojing&nbsp;Yuan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Annual Leadership Retreats</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1458772/1458772_10354502_1626577237783_SETS-UG-RE--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1458772/1458772_10354502_1626577237783_SETS-UG-RE--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SETS Undergraduate Research Experience"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1458772/1458772_10354502_1626577237783_SETS-UG-RE--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SETS Undergraduate Research Experience"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SETS Undergraduate Research Experience</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xiaojing Yuan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaojing&nbsp;Yuan</div> <div class="imageTitle">SETS Undergraduate Research Experience</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1458772/1458772_10354502_1626577324708_SETSscholarShare1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1458772/1458772_10354502_1626577324708_SETSscholarShare1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SETS Scholars Share"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1458772/1458772_10354502_1626577324708_SETSscholarShare1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SETS Scholars Share"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SETS Scholars sharing their experience with students in the department, colleges, and University</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xiaojing Yuan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaojing&nbsp;Yuan</div> <div class="imageTitle">SETS Scholars Share</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
