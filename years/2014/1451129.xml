<AbstractNarration>This project funds a workshop that brings together researchers from the US and Korea, for the purpose of describing and assessing the impact of advanced networking on the engineering of smart cities.  Researchers who specialize in programmable networking, including SDN (software defined networking) and NFV (network function virtualization) will work with leading researchers interested in the broad areas of smart cities, including enabling technologies such as large-scale sensor and actuator deployment (wireless and wired) and the Internet of Things (IoT) as applied to the smart city application domain. Research in smart cities has a clear benefit to society, in improving the lives of people through the use of technology, including in the domains of energy efficiency and health-care delivery.  However, techniques for how to structure secure, reliable, and flexible networked communications in support of smart cities is poorly understood.  The workshop will explore and document key technology challenges and opportunities that arise when next generation networking and smart cities are considered together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be held August 16-17, 2014, in Chicago, Illinois.  Potential US participants will be invited to submit one-page abstracts of their interest and ideas in the workshop areas. These abstracts will be reviewed by the US workshop organizers, and approximately 20 participants will be selected.  This proposal supports travel expenses for the US participants only; Korean participants are being selected and funded by their national agencies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    There was consensus among the workshop participants that SDN/NVF for smart cities using the IoT was an important are of research for the good of society in both the US and Korea. There are many hard research problems, and significant synergies between Korean and US researchers that would benefit from a joint research program.  Architecture: SDN (software-defined networking), NFV (network function virtualization), and the IoT (Internet of things) will all be critical technologies for future smart cities. The research challenge is how to evolve beyond current technologies (e.g. OpenFlow) to support this complex multidomain (service providers and operators; interdependent infrastructures) heterogeneous multitechnology environment. The architecture must support service virtualization over these domains and technologies, and previous programmable network architectures such as DARPA Active Nets and the PSTN (public switched telephone network) IN (Intelligent Network) may provide some insight. Instru- mentation and management is critical, and must be designed into the architecture.   Platforms: A number of platforms will be necessary to support the architectures developed that go beyond existing OpenFlow and NFV capabilities for the smart city environment. This includes the development of scalable, highly dependable and resilient, high-performance SDXs (software designed exchanges), distributed SDN controllers, and measurement and instrumentation platforms. Interoperability standards will be needed that do not constrain capabilities, and that are in harmony with future IoT, 5G, and 802.11x wireless technologies and platforms, as well as with interdependent critical infrastructures such as smart grids and VANETs (vehicular ad hoc networks &ndash; that supplement network connectivity and are dependent on the network for control and autonomous behavior). Testbeds will be essential to research platform interconnection and interoperability.
