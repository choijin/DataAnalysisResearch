<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support to the International, Mind, Brain, and Education Society (IMBES) conference, scheduled to be held at University of Texas at Arlington in November 2014.  The conference emphasizes translating what is known from educational neuroscience research to educational practice, in effect taking the latest brain-based research and using it to improve education.  The award supports presentations related to the neural basis of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) learning, including participation costs for researchers, educators, and students.  This project helps the REAL (Research on Education and Learning) program, within DRL (Division of Research on Learning), fulfill its goal of supporting the STEM education research community as it pursues innovative research methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topics covered at the conference include affective aspects of learning, physical components of early cognitive development, neuroscience education, special education, memory, implications of embodied cognition for early STEM education, brain-based teaching techniques, and informal science education.  The conference includes keynote speeches, symposia, workshops, general paper sessions, and poster sessions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Project Outcomes Report for the General Public  The mission of the International Mind, Brain and Education Society (IMBES) is "to facilitate cross-cultural collaboration in biology, education and the cognitive and developmental sciences." Science and practice benefit from a rich, bi-directional interaction, and the IMBES conference provides a forum for this focus.  The conference has taken place every two years since 2007.  In November 2014, the University of Texas at Arlington hosted the Society?s fourth international conference in Fort Worth Texas, bringing together nearly 300 researchers and educators from 20 countries. At no other conference is there such a range of specialist knowledge about the neural and cognitive bases of learning and education. The work presented at the conference is 'cutting-edge', and because of the spectrum of knowledge, experience and insight between researchers and educators in the field of Mind, Brain and Education (MBE), the conference provides a forum where the field marks its collective progress and sets its collective agenda for the period until the next meeting.  Four keynote sessions presented a strategic picture for areas of future work in the field, and 19 symposia and workshops focused on particular tools and issues covering a wide range of topics relevant to the overlapping disciplines of mind, brain and education.  All sessions were led by a moderator bringing new scientific information into focus and a facilitator tasked in exploring how to leverage, explore or challenge the research in educational contexts.  Fifteen graduate students in the MBE program at the University of Texas at Arlington participated as co-facilitators helping them take a more active role in the future of the Society.   Two separate poster presentations were held to accommodate the 41 posters representing work of over 100 researchers.  The host university, UT-Arlington and the president of IMBES presented the Outstanding Poster Award to the researcher(s) demonstrating work of the highest intellectual order as well as exemplifying the Society?s mission.  Three additional awards were given to support and encourage the work of the Society: The Early Career Award, recognizing early career researchers who made significant research contributions to the field of MBE; The Translation Award, recognizing senior scholars who have identified, generated or overseen significant approaches in achieving greater links between research and practice in MBE; and, The Exemplifying the IMBES Mission Award, recognizing pre K-12 educators, institutions or programs demonstrating success in establishing, building and supporting infrastructures of change which enhance collaboration in the field of Mind, Brain and Education.
