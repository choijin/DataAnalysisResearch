<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL AND NON TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The "Controlled/Living Polymerization" symposium offers a comprehensive coverage of recent developments in the very active field of polymerization methods resulting in macromolecules with  precisely controlled dimensions, topologies, and functionalities, and the consequent structure/property characteristics and the diverse applicationsof these  materials. The symposium offers a comprehensive opportunity for the exchange and cross-fertilization of ideas among both academic and industrial experts in the field. The symposium also offers an opportunity for participating young researchers, including the planned participation of underrepresented minorities, to gain from such career orienting exposure , as well as to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
