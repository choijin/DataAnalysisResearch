<AbstractNarration>This study makes an important contribution to workplace safety and economic security in managing risky, dangerous, yet essential operations in industries such as offshore oil exploration, shale gas drilling, nuclear power generation, as well as mining for the United States and the rest of the world.  Such industries, vital to the continued exploration of new sources of energy and economic efficiency for the United States as a nation as well as a global trading partner, nonetheless create risk to workers, plant operators, and neighboring communities that potentially multiply the costs of error many times over. Reducing the risk of error can be done effectively through the development of a complexity index to measure the degree of strain placed on the performance of large-scale, technical systems by unexpected disruptions. Such an index also measures the impact of strain on the stability of the managing organization and its ability to adapt to sudden, unexpected threats more effectively and resiliently.   Timely, accurate measurement of risk enables decision makers to manage resources and personnel in complex technical systems, marshal needed expertise, and communicate to relevant audiences more effectively.  Developing improved measures of tension between strain and stability occurring within complex, sociotechnical systems provides an index of resilience that enhances not only economic productivity, but also increases the innovation and creativity of U.S. industry. Mismanagement of complex, sociotechnical systems, in contrast, leads to large losses in lives, property, and economic security as witnessed by the May 13, 2014 mining disaster in Soma, Turkey; the 2011 nuclear breach in Fukushima, Japan, and the 2010 BP Oil Spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Reducing the risk of large-scale, sociotechnical disasters through informed management of resources, knowledge, trained personnel and timely communication represents a substantive investment in economic security for U.S. industry and continuing global trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will develop a prototype complexity index to measure the rate of evolving strain vs. adapting stability in complex, sociotechnical systems operating in rapidly evolving conditions.  The two functions of strain and stability will be measured as a joint distribution that will serve as profile of resiliency for the system.  The complexity index will create a metric to indicate the current status of the sociotechnical system as it is exposed to recurring risk, while indicating, simultaneously, the status of reserve capacity available within the larger operational system that can be mobilized to counter emerging threats. A critical factor in the sustainability of a sociotechnical system's operation is its capacity to adapt to threatening or damaging conditions.  A prototype complexity index, designed to identify the structure of a technical system's operation as well as its range of tolerance to varying levels of demand, represents a fresh means of measuring the rate of adaptation to recurring risk for sociotechnical systems under stress. The index will measure the functions of strain and stability at different scales of operation in reference to the overall system's capacity for innovative response, based on the resources, skill, and knowledge of its managing organization. Well designed, a complexity index may be adapted to measure strain vs. stability in other sociotechnical systems operating in rapidly evolving conditions of risk. This practical measure of resilience contributes to addressing management problems in both technical and organizational systems. Findings will contribute to the research literature on managing sociotechnical systems under stress.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Risk, Profit, or Safety: Sociotechnical Systems under Stress  Broader Impact  The issues of mine safety and occupational health have attracted significant interest and attention by researchers from a range of disciplines. Much of the earlier research has treated the mining industry as a set of independent components that could be managed separately, without acknowledging interactions among the components that make the system function or fail as a whole.  In contrast, we propose that the mining industry operates as a sub-system embedded within the larger sociotechnical system of the wider society. This approach represents a æcomplex, adaptive system of systems,Æ a set of concepts and metrics developed at Sandia National Laboratories to characterize and measure change in interdependent systems as they adapt to new conditions and novel interactions among their components. This approach uses an iterative process of defining a problem, designing a conceptual model for solution, and implementing the trial solution in actual practice, evaluating the results and adapting the model as necessary to changing conditions. This iterative process means that all participants are actively involved in the design, monitoring, evaluation, and redesign of an unfolding process.  The mining industry, viewed as a sub-component of the larger societal system, constitutes an interdependent system of public laws, private investment, and voluntary compliance with industrial standards that produces energy, a valued resource for society. Identifying the major actors and their interactions (or lack of same) offers a systematic means of characterizing the performance of the mining industry as a complex, adaptive system embedded in the still larger system of the whole society.  As in any dynamic system, underperformance in any one component triggers underperformance in related components and disrupts performance of the system, whether it is the mining industry as a whole, or as a contributor to the wider society. The reverse is also true, where distinctive performance in one component of the subsystem catalyzes effective performance in other components, leading to a readjustment or adaptation of the whole system.  Intellectual Merit  Conflicting goals among interdependent actors create cumulative stress in the underground mining industry. These goals include managing the technical constraints of underground operations, reducing physical risk to miners, and ensuring a profitable return to mining companies seeking to maintain their investment.  Approached from a strictly linear perspective, each separate goal limits the achievement of other, related goals.  Consequently, the risk in underground mining comes not only from the uncertainties embedded in the operation itself, but from the uncertainties exacerbated by the loss of the energy resource that coal provides to the wider society.  The dynamic tensions that drive the search to reduce risk, increase profit, and enhance safety lead the major actors committed to those goals in opposing directions, creating a thin margin for error in any direction. To explore these tensions in more detail and consider an alternative model for managing this conundrum more effectively, we analyzed the conditions, actions, and decisions that characterized the mine fire of May 13, 2014 in Soma, Manisa, Turkey.  We reframed the problem of managing risk in underground mining as an interdependent, sociotechnical system, and asked four basic research questions: 1.What major risks and benefits characterize underground mining?  2. Who are the major actors engaged in underground mining operations, and what are their points of potential conflict and collaboration? 3. What are the existing patterns of interaction among these actors?  4. What kinds of information and incentives would lead interdependent actors to adapt their performance to create a sustainable, productive, safe mining industry?
