<AbstractNarration>Phenology - the seasonal timing of biological events - is one of the most important organismal responses to climate change. For annual plant species, the seasonal timing of seed germination and flowering is crucial. Germination and flowering time interact to determine patterns of growth, flowering and seed set. Thus, an integrated life-cycle model that includes these events and their interactions is necessary for predicting under natural conditions each phenological transition, the overall life cycle, and the persistence of effects of environmental perturbations. Using the abundant genetic information on the molecular-genetic basis of flowering and germination in Arabidopsis thaliana, this project will develop integrated life-history models to predict genotype-specific performance across a geographic range with different climatic scenarios. These predictions will be tested using unique genetic material of different combinations of germination and flowering alleles in seasonally contrasting field sites.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work directly pertains to predicting plant responses to climate change. It aims to predict germination timing and synchrony under various climatic conditions, which is of direct interest in agricultural settings. The model will also predict how changes in germination timing affect reproductive timing and yield, which is important for predicting responses of crop species as well as the weeds that grow with them. Finally, it uses genotypes containing candidate genetic loci for dormancy manipulations to assess how those genes will respond to altered climates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit: Changes in phenology- the timing of biological events - are a commonly observed and important organismal response to climate change.  For annual plant species, the seasonal timing of seed germination and flowering are both crucial for reproductive success and depend upon one another.  The timing of germination strongly influences flowering time, and flowering time determines the timing of seed maturation, which in turn influences germination timing.  Thus, to predict how annual plant phenology will respond and evolve under climate change it is necessary to consider how the genes influencing germination and flowering time interact across the life cycle.  The goals of this project (in collaboration with Kathleen DonohueÆs group at Duke University) were 1) to develop a genetically informed integrated model of annual plant phenology across the life cycle and 2) to examine how natural variants of genes affecting germination and flowering time interact to affect phenology and plant performance in natural and experimental environments.    To address these goals, the research team used the model annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana (a close relative of Brassica crops such as mustard, kale, and broccoli).   The genes underlying geographic variation in germination and flowering are well characterized in this species, which made it possible to examine how natural variants of these genes interact to influence phenology through the life cycle.  The collaborating team developed a genetically informed computer model to predict the germination and flowering phenology of different genotype combinations in different climates. The team also performed experiments with inbred lines containing different combinations of early or late variants of germination and flowering time genes under natural conditions in the field and screen house.   A two-year field experiment in Rhode Island showed that different genetic combinations produced dramatically different life cycles, ranging from multiple overlapping generations throughout the year to a single generation of winter annuals germinating in autumn and flowering in spring.  The screen house experiments at UC Davis manipulated winter rainfall to test how different genetic combinations would perform under changing precipitation patterns in a Mediterranean climate. Natural selection on flowering variants depended dramatically upon the length of the rainy season, but also upon the timing of germination.   These results demonstrate that phenological and evolutionary response to climate change will depend upon genetic variation expressed across the entire life cycle.  Broader impacts: The genetically informed integrated phenology models developed in this project will be valuable for predicting how crops and wild plant populations will respond to climate change. Both the modeling and empirical results will be of interest to plant breeders and conservation managers as they plan for future climate change impacts.  The inbred lines developed for the project will be a useful resource for future studies of life history evolution.  This project contributed to the research training and professional development of several postdoctoral researchers, "postbac" research assistants, and undergraduate students, including outreach to undergraduates at University of Maine, Presque Isle.
