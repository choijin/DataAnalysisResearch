<AbstractNarration>Pan-continental North American droughts, defined as droughts that impact multiple water resource and agricultural areas, can exert severe stress on society in excess of more localized, but equally severe, droughts. For example, the drought of 2012 struck both the Plains and the Midwest and caused tens of billions of dollars in crop losses. However, events like the 2012 pan-continental drought take both the public and climate researchers by surprise. They do not appear to be easily explained in terms of ocean forcing, and cannot be predicted by current operational seasonal forecasting systems. However, pan-continental droughts have occurred repeatedly over the instrumental record and also appear in tree-ring reconstructions of climate and precipitation in North America over the last thousand years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will examine the causes and dynamical mechanisms of pan-continental droughts in North America on seasonal to multidecadal timescales. The work will use instrumental records, proxy climate records of the past millennium, atmosphere models forced by historical sea surface temperatures, coupled general circulation models and idealized model experiments. The time period of interest will be the last millennium and the next few decades. The hypothesis is that preferred states of the coupled Pacific-North America-Atlantic atmosphere-ocean system cause pan-continental droughts, including potential contributions from internal atmospheric modes that are unpredictable on seasonal and longer timescales. The project will also determine the role of soil moisture and vegetation conditions on the occurrence and evolution of pan-continental droughts. The record of regional and pan-continental drought in the newly updated millennium-long tree-ring based North American Drought Atlas will be examined. The research team will assess whether the current climate system can also explain the record of the past millennium or whether fundamentally different modes of operation (e.g. climate shifts in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans) are required. The ability of current generation climate models to simulate pan-continental droughts, and with what mechanisms, will be examined. Finally, analyses of the past and current model projections will be used to determine changes in the likelihood of pan-continental drought in the coming decades.</AbstractNarration>

Understanding the causes, characteristics, and dynamics of these droughts is thus important for developing adaptation strategies and defining their potentially changing frequency and severity in a warming climate.  The primary motivation of this project was to determine how frequently pan-continental droughts occur, understand their causes, and determine how their risk changes in the future under increasing greenhouse gas concentrations.   We used paleoclimatic evidence, observational records, and model simulations to estimate the historical incidence of pan-continental droughts in North America.  These droughts occur an average of about 20 times per century and have been a consistent feature of U.S. hydroclimate over the last thousand years or more.  We subsequently confirmed that variations in sea surface temperatures strongly influence the occurrence of pan-continental droughts.  There is a particularly strong association between these events and La Ni&ntilde;as in the tropical Pacific Ocean.  We nevertheless found little association between pan-continental droughts and sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean, which is a notable finding considering the influence of the Atlantic on other hydroclimate variability in North America.  We also demonstrated that internal atmospheric variability (weather) has a strong influence on the probability of pan-continental drought occurrence.  These findings are important with regard to efforts to predict the occurrence of pan-continental droughts before they happen.  While we can predict La Ni&ntilde;as with a reasonable degree of success on 6-12 month timescales, atmospheric variability is inherently unpredictable beyond several weeks.  Advance prediction of pan-continental droughts will therefore be very limited.   The work on the project has also refined understanding of droughts that occur in specific areas of the continental U.S., with implications for how regional dynamics may combine to generate pan-continental droughts. We determined the causes of the 2016 U.S. southeastern drought, which was tied to moderate La Ni&ntilde;a conditions and internal atmospheric variability. Our understanding of the causes of the drought supported our larger interpretations of the causes of more broadly distributed pan-continental droughts.  We similarly investigated the pattern of widespread coastal droughts that occur along the western coast of the U.S. Overturning contemporary thinking, we showed that the leading pattern of cold-season precipitation variability along the western U.S. coast favors spatially coherent precipitation anomalies instead of a north-south dipole pattern. Sixteen coastal-wide droughts occurred from 1895&ndash;2016, that clustered during the 1920s&ndash;1930s and post-2000 periods, all of which were most strongly linked with internal atmospheric variability.  Another important aspect of pan-continental droughts is the degree to which they can be impacted by multidecadal variability, of the type that is known to have caused megadrought events during the Medieval period.  Our work showed that the occurrences of pan-continental drought events were most frequent during megadrought periods. We also showed that megadrought clustering during the Medieval period is potentially the result of natural variability in ocean conditions. We found important connections to both the tropical Pacific and the Atlantic, suggesting that natural ocean variability in both basins may have been important for explaining past megadrought clustering.  Given the importance of the tropical Pacific Ocean in our pan-continental framework, we additionally clarified some specifics of tropical Pacific variability and how they translate into hydroclimatic connections on land.  These investigations led to improved understanding of how specific patterns in sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean are related to drought and its predictability in the U.S.  Finally, we worked to connect our findings to their agricultural implications.  The conditions that lead to pan-continental droughts in North America depress crop yields.  We specifically showed that tropical Pacific Ocean conditions account for significant variability in U.S. maize, soybean, and wheat production.  This award supported the development of multiple large ensembles of atmospheric model simulations in which different configurations of sea surface temperatures were used.  To investigate the influence of soil moisture feedbacks, a large ensemble was also derived for conditions in which soil moisture was constrained to vary only according to seasonal climatology.  All of these simulations have been publicly archived and are freely available without restriction.  This project partially supported the doctoral work of two graduate students.
