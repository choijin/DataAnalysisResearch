<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in developing the world?s first ultra-high-speed variable focus optical lens that can be fully mass-produced with low manufacturing costs and high yield. The company?s proprietary tunable acoustic gradient lens technology provides versatile solutions for unmet market needs across multiple sectors, including health, security, and manufacturing. While valuable as an add-on to existing systems for imaging and processing applications, its use can be extended to other applications such as point of care medical diagnostic imaging and consumer optics/electronics.  The proposed second generation lens is expected to grow the existing market for variable focus optical lens by a factor of 5 to 10 and help transform this small business into a major original equipment components manufacturer and supplier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to engineer a high volume manufacturing process that will increase product yield, reproducibility, and reliability for a novel ultra-high-speed variable focus device.  The company?s patented tunable acoustic gradient lens technology uses sound to shape light, which enables the change of focal position without any moving parts at rates that are 3 orders of magnitude faster than competing technologies.  The innovation is based on propagation of sound waves that can be controlled by the modification of the index of refraction by piezoelectric elements within the liquid lens. Phase II plan is focused on engineering and optimizing new lens designs that preserve the fundamental functionality and benefits of the first generation lens while also capturing the unique and industry leading benefits of the company's core technology. It also includes semi-automated prototype fabrication, careful system optimization, analysis and testing that pave  the path to a next generation product that can be scaled up for mass-production.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project sought to develop high volume manufacturing processes and methods with small batch-to-batch variations and enable large-scale commercialization of a novel ultra-high speed variable focus device.  In early 2011, TAG Optics, Inc. was created to commercialize the Tunable Acoustic Gradient (TAG) Platform, a breakthrough technology in the field of adaptive optics that uses sound to shape light.  Originally developed at Princeton University and exclusively licensed by TAG Optics, Inc., the Company continued to develop proprietary technologies leading to the creation and eventual commercialization of the TAG Lens&trade;.  During the two years following its introduction into the market, the TAG Lens&trade; received over a dozen national and international industry awards and accolades.  However, its commercial distribution and market penetration was somewhat limited to academic and research institutions.     The overarching goal of this SBIR Phase II Project was to enable the widespread distribution and dissemination of the TAG Technology.  This required adequate market penetration via entry into multiple market verticals and public adoption by key known commercial entities.  Following customer discovery processes, including discussions with interested key commercial partners, barriers to entry were identified as hurdles to the achievement of this goal and their resolutions were integrated into the research and development undertaken under this grant.  Prior to the start of this Phase II project, each TAG Lens&trade; manufactured at TAG Optics? facility was a hand-built optical component assembled in-house by skilled technicians. Such an assembly process limited our ability to meet rigorous OEM product demand and exhibited a relatively low production yield following internal quality assurance assessments.  This made it difficult for TAG Optics to gain market traction with large volume system integrators.     This Phase II project took advantage of the proof of concept developed in an earlier Phase I project where we demonstrated through scientifically-informed design modifications that it is possible to significantly enhance the functionality of our TAG Lens&trade;. These results have not only allowed us to sell our products in additional market verticals, as originally envisioned by the Phase I project, but have also opened the door to new markets such as general imaging, optical inspection, and manufacturing through the development of more robust supporting technologies.     The successful completion of this Phase II SBIR Grant is enabling the company to bring the TAG Technology to more consumer centric markets that depend on machine vision technologies such as robotics/UAV vision, QR code reading, 3D object recognition, and Go/No-Go high speed part inspection. Specifically, TAG Optics created new designs and assembly processes of the TAG Lens&trade; and accompanying technologies to meet the stringent demands of OEM customers for both ease of integration, quality, and traceability of the product.  By modifying our internal processes using the learnings from this grant, TAG Optics significantly reduced manufacturing costs and improved key metrics such as (1) product reliability, (2) fabrication yield, (3) reproducibility, (4) ease of operation and integration.  This will enable TAG Optics and its commercial partners to produce and utilize reliable, cost competitive focusing devices with unparalleled functionality, thereby overcoming existing barriers to technology adoption.
