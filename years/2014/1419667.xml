<AbstractNarration>Stratospheric ozone depletion is a well-known phenomenon, largely because of the Antarctic ozone hole and concerns over adverse effects on ecosystems and human health.  But ozone depletion also occurs in the Arctic stratosphere, where reductions of 10% to 20% can be seen in satellite data, for example in differences between the means for years 2000 to 2005 and 1979 to 1984.  Unlike the Antarctic, where a single ozone hole extends from altitudes below 15km to above 20km, Arctic ozone depletion has two distinct maxima, one in the upper stratosphere between 35km and 45km (roughly 5mb to 1mb) and one in the lower stratosphere between 10 and 15km (roughly 200 to 100mb).  Research by the PIs and others has produced compelling evidence that the Antarctic ozone hole has produced substantial changes in the climate and atmospheric circulation of the stratosphere and troposphere.  These changes include stratospheric cooling and a southward shift of the westerly winds around Antarctica that extends from the stratosphere to the Earth's surface.  However, analogous climate and circulation impacts of the more subtle Arctic ozone depletion have not been identified, owing partly to lack of research effort and partly to discrepancies in the satellite-derived ozone estimates over the Arctic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work conducted here addresses the impact of Arctic stratospheric ozone loss by combining three satellite derived datasets with stand-alone radiative transfer codes and the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), an atmospheric circulation model with a well-resolved stratosphere and optional stratospheric ozone chemistry.  The first stage of the research is to use radiative transfer models to calculate radiative heating rates from the ozone concentrations found in the three observational datasets, in order to determine the magnitude of the heating and the extent to which differences in ozone concentrations yield differences in heating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These radiative heating calculations are followed by WACCM simulations in which the ozone concentrations from the three datasets are be imposed, using the Specified Chemistry version of WACCM.  Experiments will be performed using ozone changes restricted to the stratosphere above and below 10mb, to determine the extent to which ozone changes in the upper stratosphere affect the lower stratosphere and the extent to which upper- and lower-level heating affect the troposphere.  These experiments are motivated by the dual-maximum structure of the ozone depletion.  Finally, WACCM will be integrated with interactive gas-phase chemistry, so that the model can simulate ozone loss internally, allowing the ozone chemistry to be affected by the temperature and circulation changes which it produces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research seeks to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms driving for climate variability and change in the Arctic, and the Arctic climate change has broad linkages to societally-relevant impacts on ecosystems, the cryosphere, and human activities in the Arctic.  Moreover, changes in atmospheric circulation over the Arctic can have substantial consequences for the weather and climate of the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.  In addition, the project provides support and training for a graduate student, thereby providing for the next generation of scientists working in this area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project?s research probed how stratospheric ozone and associated stratospheric wind and temperature changes influence winds and temperatures at ground level, with a focus on the Arctic and the northern hemisphere.   Processes at other latitudes were also examined, and help to support the needed physical and chemical understanding.  The project considered both short-term seasonal changes and longer term trends.   Seasonal forecasting is an area of special focus for this work.  How to make predictions and projections of wind and temperature more complete, and attributing the changes to their causes, is of broad interest to society, and also touches many sectors.     Major accomplishments of the project were as follows:     &bull; Analysis of an ensemble of numerical model simulations revealed that years displaying low abundances of stratospheric ozone in the Arctic are linked to large and robust effects on tropospheric wind, temperature and precipitation (rainfall and snowfall) in spring over large portions of the Northern Hemisphere (most notably over the North Atlantic and Eurasia).     &bull; Following up on the above modeling study, we then presented observational evidence for linkages between extreme Arctic stratospheric ozone anomalies in March and Northern Hemisphere tropospheric weather changes in March and April. Springs characterized by low Arctic ozone anomalies in March are indeed associated with wind changes, and these are consistent with the positive polarity of the Northern Annular Mode/North Atlantic Oscillation. The attached figure, taken from our paper published in Environmental Research Letters, 2018, highlights a key result of that work and this project.   &bull; Novel evidence was presented for significant ozone depletion and associated polar cooling in the Antarctic lowermost stratosphere region, not only in summer as has been shown in many previous studies, but through to southern hemisphere fall and particularly in May.  Changes in winds and temperatures were identified in the troposphere in May, and linked to ozone changes at the tropopause region between the stratosphere and troposphere.  This is especially important for future studies aiming to study these phenomena, since ozone changes at the tropopause are not well measured by satellites for example, and understanding the uncertainties in this region is going to be needed for accurate future work on stratosphere/troposphere coupling based on our work.   &bull; For the first time, formal statistical methods (detection/attribution fingerprinting) were used to identify influences of greenhouse gases and ozone depletion on circulation changes in the troposphere and stratosphere.  This approach revealed and quantified greenhouse gases effects in both hemispheres throughout December to May, as well as significant effects of stratospheric ozone for the northern hemisphere in March-April-May:  another key finding that supports the view that spring stratospheric ozone changes in the Arctic affect the weather at ground level.  The study provides new and stronger evidence that both greenhouse gases and ozone changes have influenced patterns of global and hemispheric wind and temperature pattern changes of both hemispheres over the last three decades.
