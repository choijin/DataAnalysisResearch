<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will funds studies in three contemporary areas that lay the foundation for a comprehensive collaboration between The Florida A &amp; M University (FAMU) and The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL), an NSF facility. Faculty at FAMU, an HBCU that is a predominantly teaching university, will collaborate with staff from the NHMFL to study new catalysts, new techniques for preparing hard/soft magnetic materials and nanoscale protein assemblies.  This collaborative activity will provide important new research opportunities to faculty and students at FAMU and will seed a long term relationship between the institutions.  The proposed activities will strengthen the activities in the existing doctoral program in Physics and will support the development of a doctoral program in Chemistry.  The multidisciplinary program that will develop will significantly impact and enhance research in physics, chemistry, biology and engineering, with a direct link to the NHMFL and will strengthen the nations STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed studies will seed activity in three areas of current interest.  These are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Catalyst and catalyst assemblies based on magnetic molecules.  This work seeks to establish the fundamental mechanisms by which high-valent species of Earth-abundant metals achieve water splitting. It will also provide information of critical importance for addressing the correlation between the nature/structure of high-valent intermediates and their catalytic activity towards water oxidation. These studies have potential implications for the development of sustainable energy systems that take advantage of catalytic water splitting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Studies of meso-scale spring-exchange magnets assembled in polymer superstructures.  This work will explore new synthetic methods to assemble hard/soft composite magnets via bottom up formation of mesoscale structures to deliberately form controlled magnetic domains by utilization of nano-processing. The proposed research will result in novel materials that will have potential to substantially decrease our dependence on the imported rare-earth metals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Studies of nanoscale protein and peptide assemblies.  These studies will result in a fundamental understanding of the different mechanisms of self-assembly in peptides and how these mechanisms give rise to a resultant macroscopic property (elastic modulus, yield stress). This will allow control over the final property and be able to tune peptide properties towards a particular application (for use as cell and tissue scaffolds).  These studies will also result in novel NMR techniques that characterize the self-assembly mechanisms which can be used to investigate aggregation and self-assembly in a wide variety of other materials. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
