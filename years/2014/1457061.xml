<AbstractNarration>Water availability has pronounced influences on animal activity and distribution patterns.  Drying due to evaporative water loss is the most common mechanism for dehydration, and it is a universal problem confronting terrestrial animals.  The majority of animal species do not tolerate severe water stress. This research will address precise mechanisms that protect animals during water stress at levels from the molecular to the organismal.  Understanding these protective mechanisms may have translational application for broad scientific communities.  For example, the ability for scientists working with important genetic models to prolong the storage of young animal stages by imposing desiccation would be of practical benefit for maintaining these animals more economically.  The advantage would extend to national stock centers and teaching laboratories.  Engineering desiccation tolerance in dehydration-sensitive organisms is complex, but could provide possibilities for dry storage of valuable live organisms that may be difficult and expensive to maintain in laboratory culture.  Further, the biomedical implications of some findings could be significant.  Storage of dried cells would increase the availability of replacement cells for many clinical applications and in regenerative medicine. Educationally, the project will facilitate the training of graduate students and undergraduates from a wide diversity of backgrounds.  Outreach activities planned as part of the project will contribute to the general education of international scientists (including researchers in biotechnology from the private sector, National Laboratory scientists, and academic faculty wishing to acquire new skills).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This collaborative research will evaluate the impact on desiccation tolerance of multiple Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins originating from anhydrobiotic embryos of the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana.  The project will refine and expand the understanding of how LEA proteins promote stabilization of targeted biological structures at various hydration states along a continuum from full hydration to water contents of 2% or less.  Hypotheses will be tested with isolated macromolecules, liposomes, insect cells lines, and larvae of Drosophila melanogaster. One novel hypothesis is that the function displayed by individual LEA proteins is multifaceted depending upon the severity of desiccation.  Such functional plasticity for individual LEA proteins would represent a new paradigm for protection of biological structures as hydration state varies.  A new LEA protein from A. franciscana (AfrLEA6), with high sequence homology to a plant LEA protein recently linked to long-term protection against desiccation damage, has been cloned, sequenced and expressed.  AfrLEA6 will be stably transfected into insect cell lines to explore whether this protein will extend long-term desiccation tolerance, in the presence and absence of other co-transfected LEA proteins and stabilizing sugars.  Finally, fly lines of Drosophila melanogaster will be created that transgenically express multiple LEA proteins.  Because larval stages of D. melanogaster naturally contain high endogenous levels of trehalose (a sugar known to provide protection synergistically with LEA proteins), larvae will be used to test for improved tolerance to drying in this species that is generally desiccation-sensitive and does not contain LEA genes in its genome.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  For multiple reasons, organisms found in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats frequently are confronted with the problem of water loss.  The most common reason for dehydration is evaporative water loss, although restricted water availability can also occur due to freezing, which reduces the liquid water outside of cells and can lead to dehydration inside the cells of multicellular organisms.  The physiological and biochemical responses of animals to desiccation are central to survival, yet the precise mechanisms that protect animals during water stress are not fully explained.  This collaborative project focused primarily on the impact of protective proteins in preventing damage due to water stress at the levels of molecules, cells and whole animals.  This project demonstrated that the functions of these protective proteins (termed LEA proteins) can change depending on the level of dehydration they experience in animal cells.  Folding of these LEA proteins occurs as water loss increases, and correlated with this coiling, is an increase in protection by LEA proteins of other target proteins as drying proceeds.  When one considers that LEA proteins in the uncoiled, aqueous state also perform other tasks in hydrated cells, it seems that LEA proteins are multi-functional depending on the degree of dryness.  These multiple functions for individual LEA proteins may improve protection against drying for cells and animals.  Results of the project also showed that transferring (transfecting) LEA proteins into an animal that is very sensitive to desiccation (and does not naturally contain these proteins) enhanced the tolerance of the animal to water stress. Thus LEA proteins have beneficial effects for whole animals, but it is also clear that these proteins are only one molecular feature, among a broad suite of factors, that are necessary for full protection.  Broader Outcomes.  This project has facilitated the education of six graduate students and nine undergraduates from a wide diversity of backgrounds as a result of their participation in this research. During this NSF award, three Ph.D. students from the laboratory of the principal investigator (PI) have successfully graduated and moved on to prominent positions in academics.  A fourth doctoral student will graduate in the spring semester, 2021.  Two other Ph.D. students are entering their second year and making nice research progress. Seven undergraduates who received research training under the aegis of this grant have now successfully graduated, and three of these completed Honors Theses.  The two remaining undergraduates also are actively pursuing their Honors Theses in the PI’s laboratory.  These opportunities for undergraduates have facilitated training in diverse research skills.  At LSU, there are many programs to foster participation of undergraduates in research.  This NSF project provided a framework for, and added value to, these programs, which promote sustained engagement of undergraduate students in academics throughout their careers.  In terms of formal teaching, the PI has offered multiple courses during each year of the project.  Outreach activities by the PI, as the Treasurer for the Mitochondrial Physiology Society, have contributed to the general scientific education of international graduate students by facilitating travel grants for these students to attend workshops and symposia sponsored by the Society.  During this NSF project, Dr. Hand has delivered four invited and plenary lectures at international meetings.          Last Modified: 12/20/2020       Submitted by: Steven C Hand]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
