<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the "Tenth Mississippi State Conference on Differential Equations and Computational Simulations," which provides a forum where mathematicians, engineers, and scientists from academia and industry exchange research and education ideas involving theoretical, applied, and computational developments in differential equations and associated simulations.  The conference will be held October 23-25, 2014 on the campus of the Mississippi State University. The website for this conference is http://www.ccs.msstate.edu/deconf/de2014.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference is a collaborative endeavor between the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, and the Center for Computational Sciences (CCS), a High Performance Computing Collaboratory (HPCC) member center, at Mississippi State University. The majority of the grant funds will be used to provide travel support to graduate students and recent doctoral recipients. The conference will provide these future research leaders an opportunity to present their work, to meet and collaborate with other researchers, educators, and practitioners, and to learn about recent developments in this interdisciplinary field.</AbstractNarration>

The conference is also to provide graduate students and young Ph.D.s an opportunity to present their work, meet other researchers, educators and practitioners, learn of recent developments in the proposed interdisciplinary field, and produce a new generation of mathematical models and challenges.     Ten principal lectures were presented by the following speakers:      Alfonso Castro, "Professor Shivaji and how to find the bottom in semipositone problems," Harvey Mudd College Pavel Dr&aacute;bek, "Results and open questions for some quasilinear eigenvalue problems," University of West Bohemia in Pilsen, Czech Republic Paul Durbin, "The phenomenon of bypass transition and its modeling in practice," Iowa State University Jonathan Freund, "Numerical simulation of cellular blood flow in small vessels," University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Suzanne Lenhart, "Modeling of Johne's disease in dairy cattle," University of Tennessee, Knoxville Philip Maini, "Modelling collective cell movement in biology," Oxford University, United Kingdom Jean Mawhin, "The multiplicity of solutions of relativistic-type systems with periodic nonlinearities," Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium Peter Polacik, "Bounded solutions of the Fujita equation: three examples," University of Minnesota Junping Shi, "Exact multiplicity and uniqueness of positive solutions of nonlinear elliptic equations and systems: Old and new results," College of William and Mary Peter Takac, "Time analyticity of solutions to the Heston volatility model in mathematical finance," Universitat Rostock, Germany       The principal lectures were from various disciplines such as applied and computational mathematics, biology, materials sciences, and aerospace engineering all of which concentrate on differential equations and computational simulations.
