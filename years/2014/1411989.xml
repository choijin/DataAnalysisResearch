<AbstractNarration>This project will determine the mechanisms by which the DNA genetic material of a virus is packaged inside a capsid. Bacteriophage T4, a virus that infects Escherichia coli, will be used as a model to analyze the functions of a molecular motor involved in DNA packaging. This research will also have broad implications to the understanding of molecular motors that carry out diverse functions in living organisms. These include: condensation of DNA into chromosomes, transport of molecules into and out of cells, and mechanical motion in muscle contraction. The research might also open avenues to discover novel antivirals, and to engineer biological nanomotors to deliver therapeutic molecules into cells. The research will serve as an excellent model to mentor students at many levels of education; high school, undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral. Students will be exposed to the most current genetic, biochemical, and biophysical approaches, and interact with investigators having expertise in interdisciplinary research areas. The students will present their research findings in international conferences on phage and virus assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large DNA viruses such as the tailed bacteriophages and herpes viruses employ powerful packaging machines to forcefully translocate DNA into the capsid.  In bacteriophage T4 a 171-kb, 56 micrometer-long, DNA is packaged at near crystalline densite into a capsid of size 120 by 86 nanometers.  The packaging machine consists of three key components: a dodecameric portal, gp20; a pentameric motor, gp17; and an oligomeric  regulator, gp16. The motor is assembled on the portal, which is located at the special five-fold vertex of the capsid. Utilizing the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis, the motor causes DNA motion at a rate of up to ~2000 base pairs per second, and a detailed mechanism has been proposed based on genetic and biochemical studies. In the current project, the functions of the packaging machine will be probed deeply by asking some fundamental questions. How is a 23Å DNA end threaded into a 40Å portal channel? How does the motor generate &gt;60 pNewtons force necessary to confine the highly charged DNA molecule in a "tiny" capsid container? What are the dynamics of motor-DNA interactions that lead to mechanical motion of DNA? How do the motor and portal interact and communicate? Do the motor subunits fire ATPases in a coordinated fashion? How are the motor domains synchronized at millisecond timescale? Multidisciplinary approaches from complementary laboratories involving genetics, biochemistry, structure, and single molecule biophysics will be integrated to answer these questions. The results may help reconstitute the detailed mechanism of a virus DNA packaging motor at near atomic resolution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project addressed a key genetic mechanism that is essential to all living organisms; the transfer or inheritance of genetic material from one generation to the next. DNA condensation is a critical component of this mechanism and the tailed bacteriophage T4 provides an excellent model to elucidate the details.   Phage T4 packages a 56-mm long (170-kb) DNA genome into a 120 x 86 nm proteinaceous capsid shell using a powerful packaging machine, one of the fastest and most powerful molecular machines reported to date. The DNA is folded about 660 times, generating a packing density (~500 mg/ml) equivalent to that of a DNA crystal.   The phage packaging machine is also an important model for the superfamily of molecular machines that are essential to life. Examples include molecular motors involved in genome replication, genome expression, and chromosome segregation.   Synergistically integrating molecular genetics and biochemical analyses with cutting edge structural and single molecule biophysical approaches, this project led to significant discoveries of the packaging mechanisms, as follows:  A single molecule fluorescence assay was developed that can image individual DNA packaging machines in real time and quantify the kinetics of packaging. A wrapped DNA structure containing the packaging motor proteins and viral genome is essential for initiation of genome packaging. Evidence shows that the packaging motor generates electrostatic force by hydrolyzing the ATP fuel which is then coupled to the mechanical movement of DNA. Modulation of the hydrophobicity of the catalytic space of the motor that burns ATP fuel controls the speed of the motor. Single fluorescent motors were designed to analyze how the motor subunits cooperate to move DNA at millisecond time scale. Determination of the structures of the dodecameric portal and the capsid led to the construction of an atomic model of the packaging machine to analyze the movements of the motor parts at near atomic resolution.
