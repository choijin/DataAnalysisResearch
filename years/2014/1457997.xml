<AbstractNarration>Muhlenberg College has received an NSF Scholarships for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) award for a project entitled The Scholars in Math and Science (SIMS) program. SIMS will target academically talented and economically disadvantaged students who enter college seeking a major within the biological sciences. Two cohorts of 8 students each will be recruited: the first cohort will receive scholarships of $9,500/year for 4 years, and the second will receive scholarships of $9,500/year for 3 years. The proposal is building upon successful program elements of a previous STEM grant that included enhanced recruitment and academic support. Through this program, Muhlenberg College will promote a robust and diverse STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program elements new to this project are being designed to develop academic and science skills, create a learning community that lasts from freshman to senior year, and develop student leadership through activities on campus and in public outreach.  The project will improve student support services including forming learning communities, providing special classes and sections to get students past hurdle classes, instituting peer-led learning, and providing long-term mentors.  SIMS will increase the leadership roles of scholars, improving their science process skills, encouraging participation in research, and improving recruitment and financial support for low income and otherwise underrepresented groups. SIMS assessment and evaluation will be comprehensive and ongoing and include both quantitative and qualitative instruments and measures from the literature.  The project external evaluator is using both formative and summative evaluations to assess student mathematics readiness, skills development, ability to understand and communicate key principles in biology, progress to degree, and graduation rates.   Particular emphasis will be placed on the surveys to assess and continually improve the elements of the program that are focused on student success.  The data will inform our understanding of effective practices that support the persistence to graduation of students underrepresented in STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Members of the Biology Department at Muhlenberg College received funding from the NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S-STEM) program to implement a five-year program to recruit, admit, and graduate a cohort of 16 talented, economically disadvantaged students.  The program included scholarships and courses in the first and second year designed to develop a supportive student cohort.   The program also provided academic support through development of a course to enhance the quantification skills required in college science courses, and through links to peer tutoring through the collegeâ€™s Academic Support Office.  STEM faculty provided advising and mentoring, and provided the students research opportunities, of which 87.5 of the students took advantage.   We were successful at recruiting a demographically diverse cohort of students, a group of students that contained multiethnic origins, first-generation college students, and students from both rural and urban hometowns.  All but one of the students graduated from college, 81% with majors in STEM disciplines, and some of them graduated near the top of their class and earned completive college honors.  The data indicate that the four-graduation rate of the cohort exceeded comparative demographic groups at both the national level and for Muhlenberg College overall and the science departments specifically.  Some of the students have entered prestigious graduate programs, and the post-graduation plans of the other students include graduate programs in biology, biochemistry, neuroscience, secondary education in STEM, and in the health professions.  Thus, our program was successful in recruiting a diverse group of students that have graduated from college and will eventually enter STEM careers, thereby benefiting society as a whole.
