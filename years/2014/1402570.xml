<AbstractNarration>NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components to prepare young scientists for careers in biology and require a plan to broaden participation of groups under-represented in science and engineering.  The fellowships advance NSF efforts to diversify the STEM workforce now and in the future. This fellowship to Jacob Allgeier supports research to measure, monitor, and improve current efforts to protect endangered salmon in the Pacific Northwest and provide tools for sustainability efforts elsewhere. The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Washington, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Daniel Schindler (University of Washington) and Chris Jordan (NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Center).  Training goals for the Fellow are to learn cutting-edge modeling techniques for predicting ecosystem function and population sustainability and measuring effectively river restoration.  A plan to broaden participation consists of an outreach program for eighth grade students including groups under-represented in science about the connections between humans, ecosystems, and sustainability. An interactive website permits students to track migrating fish from ocean to spawning grounds; and personal in-classroom teaching modules allow the students to discover the various factors that impact salmon lifecycles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Restoring degraded habitat represents a critical national goal as it has direct consequences for the sustainability of important ecosystem services, for example, fisheries, timber, recreation.  Current restoration efforts for endangered salmonid species throughout the Columbia River Basin account for ~88% of all U.S. river restorations. This research uses animal movement to assess restoration by linking feedbacks between ecosystem function and habitat characteristics. Existing datasets of spatially explicit individual fish movement behavior of more than 150,000 individuals of two endangered salmonids across streams at various stages of restoration are being used to develop population models and quantitative metrics for assessing watershed restoration efficacy.  The research promises to link population, community and ecosystem ecology through spatial dynamics and advance ecological theory by enhancing understanding of the ecological consequences of individual variation.  Societal impacts include implementing the research findings into the adaptive management framework being applied throughout the Columbia River basin.</AbstractNarration>

The proposed research sought to improve ecological understanding of restoration efficacy of natal habitat for endangered salmonids in the Pacific Northwest, USA.  Specifically, the research goal was to develop quantitative tools to understand juvenile salmonid habitat use and movement behavior to assess river restoration efficacy. This research was embedded within a multi-stream restoration project in Bridge Creek watershed, a tributary of the Columbia River, that is part of a larger consortium of restoration efforts throughout the entire Columbia River Basin.  Research findings highlight differences in the degree of specialized movement behavior and habitat selection by individual fish between populations within restored and degraded streams.  Specifically, individual fish preferentially selected habitats that were deeper and had slower velocity, characteristics of the stream bed that were enhanced due to restoration activities.  Further, individual fish tended to have more erratic movement behavior and reduced site selectivity in impaired sites, highlighting that restoration, by providing more favorable habitat, alters behavioral choices of juvenile salmonids. These data and analytical techniques will be used by fish biologists and managers and implemented within the adaptive management framework of river restoration for the Bridge Creek Watershed as well as the large basin-wide restoration efforts in which this project was embedded.      The proposed research was framed within the context of ecological theory, such that in addition to being applied to aid restoration efforts, it would improve understanding of the relationship between individual-level trait variation in behavior and emergent ecosystem properties. The Niche Variation Hypothesis (NVH) states that individual variation in resource use (individual-level niche width) is more variable in populations with a wide niche than in populations with a smaller niche.  However, a major assumption of this hypothesis is that individual-level niche widths are similar within populations (account for similar proportion of the total population niche width), irrespective of the total population niche size. A contrasting hypothesis is that individuals account for dissimilar proportions of the population niche, and thus may have disproportionate influence on ecosystem processes.  The implications of this may be important for ecosystem function particularly in the context of spatial niche widths, i.e., spatial habitat use.  If certain individual use a disproportionate amount of available habitat, they may also disproportionately influence ecosystem function (i.e., nutrient distribution) and thus emergent ecosystem properties (i.e., spatial nutrient dynamics).

Findings reveal that individual variation in habitat use leads to emergent ecosystem properties that are not predicted by theoretical expectations of the NVH.  These findings are the first to link individual-level trait variation to ecosystem function and show that understanding within-population variation is critical for predicting emergent ecosystem properties such as nutrient dynamics.  Further, this research represents a novel approach to integrate community ecology theory into ecosystem ecology through understanding the importance of spatial niche partitioning for ecosystem function.
