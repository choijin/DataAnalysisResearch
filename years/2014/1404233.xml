<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Barbara Finlayson-Pitts of the University of California Irvine is studying the fates of neonicotinoid (NNs) pesticides deposited on surfaces when exposed to oxidants that are found in the atmosphere.  The development and application of synthetic pesticides since the end of WWII has led to increased global food production, with one group of new pesticides being the NNs.  However, there is increasing evidence that some beneficial parts of the ecosystem, such as bee activity, that play key roles in agriculture are negatively impacted by these compounds.   There is past evidence for other pesticides with unintended toxic effects on ecosystems due not necessarily to the pesticide itself, but rather to the oxidation products formed after the pesticide is applied.  Hence understanding the atmospheric reactions of NNs is critical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is analyzing how fast common neonicotinoid compounds react under atmospheric conditions, as well as the nature and yields of the products and the reaction mechanisms.  Techniques being applied include attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (ATR-FTIR) and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectrometry as well as a number of state-of-the-art mass spectrometry approaches.  This research provides key data on the atmospheric lifetimes and fates of the NNs on surfaces in the troposphere, which is critical for assessing their potential impacts on food security and agricultural sustainability.  These data are being presented to the public via summer teacher workshops, hosted lab tours for students and citizen groups, and through visits of UCI researchers to local schools.  A new generation of students is being trained not only in fundamental atmospheric chemistry but also in its intersection with pesticides, food security and sustainable agriculture.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ "SusChEM: Atmospheric Fates of Neonicotinoids and Their Role in Food Security and Agricultural Sustainability"      NSF Grant No. 1404233    Barbara J. Finlayson-Pitts  Department of Chemistry  University of California Irvine  Irvine, CA  92697-2025     October 3, 2017     The major goals of the research were to assess the potential reactions of neonicotinoid (NN) pesticides in air in order to define their lifetimes and fates on surfaces in the lower atmosphere.   NNs are systemic insecticides and are applied extensively in-furrows and on seeds. As a result, they become widely distributed in and on environmental surfaces such as soils and plants (including food). While NNs are thought to have relatively low mammalian toxicity, their use has been associated with bee colony collapse and thus with deleterious impacts on pollinators that play a central role in food security and agricultural sustainability. However, how long the NNs survive on surfaces and the nature of the products they form when they do react is not known.  This project involved experimental laboratory studies of the degradation by light of commonly used NNs.  The main focus was on imidacloprid which has seen increasing use since its introduction in 1991. Its absorption of light extends weakly into the wavelength region available at the Earth?s surface.  Measurement of its quantum yield and extension to typical light fluxes at the Earth's surface at a solar zenith angle of 35&deg; (corresponding to noon at a latitude of 40&deg;N on April 1) gives a predicted lifetime with respect to photolysis of ~ 16 hours. Although the particular structure of this compound was stated to have been developed for stability in the environment, our studies suggest it will photochemically convert to products relatively quickly.  Two major products in the solid phase were identified, a urea derivative (~ 84% yield) and a desnitro derivative (~ 16% yield).  The latter has been reported by others to have higher mammalian toxicity than the parent imidacloprid, demonstrating that this neonicotinoid can generate more toxic products when released into the environment.  A surprising finding was the production of gas phase N2O as a major product.  This has not before been reported as a NN photolysis product, but is interesting as it is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of 264 relative to CO2 on a 20 year time scale (N2O is also a major contributor to stratospheric ozone depletion). Although the total amount of N2O expected from imidacloprid photolysis is small compared to other N2O sources, it could be important in measurements of N2O &shy;fluxes in agricultural areas where imidacloprid is used.  This project has provided yet another important example of the need in environmental assessments to consider not only the original parent compound, but also its fate and the toxicity of new products that are formed once it is released into the environment. The project has also provided training to undergraduates, high school students and postdoctoral fellows, the majority of whom belong to underrepresented groups in science, thus enhancing diversity in the STEM workforce.
