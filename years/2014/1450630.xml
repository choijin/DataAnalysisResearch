<AbstractNarration>Drs. Richard E. Blanton and Lane F. Fargher, of Purdue University, along with an international team of scholars from the US and Mexico, will carry out research on the impact of political policy on households at the late pre-Hispanic city of Tlaxcallan in Tlaxcala, Mexico. Social scientists have long been interested in understanding how and why cities and states evolved; especially, the strategies developed to collect revenues and govern large populations. After WWII, explanations for the evolution of social complexity and states focused predominantly on the ways in which ruling elites (e.g., kings, magnates) profited from demographic expansion and resource stress to coerce subordinate populations into supplying tribute. However, recent research has demonstrated that peasants and other commoners remain neither powerless nor passive in the face of rapacious elites. Especially important has been Drs. Blanton and Fargher's research on cooperation and collective action in premodern states. Using insights developed in economics and political science on rational choice, public goods, and bureaucratization, they showed that governing authorities who relied on a large segment of citizens for revenues in premodern states had to respond to commoner voice, control public officials, and limit their luxury consumption in order to promote compliance with taxation. Moreover, structural changes associated with building such collective political regimes were found to leave behind indelible marks on households and landscapes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given that a shift towards collective governance creates a strong material imprint on households and landscapes, archaeology is especially well suited for studying the long-term evolution of cooperation, collective action, and democracy in human societies. This is particularly the case with the late pre-Hispanic (AD 1300 - 1519) terraced, hilltop city of Tlaxcallan. In the face of growing threats from the Aztec empire, the Tlaxcalteca (the people of Tlaxcallan) built a republic rich in commoner voice and public goods to encourage citizens to defend the state and its territory. The implementation of these political policies guided the construction of an urban landscape unique in pre-Hispanic Mexico. With support from the National Science Foundation, Drs. Blanton and Fargher, and their colleagues will evaluate the impact of Tlaxcallan's collective policies in the city's households and neighborhoods. Combining geophysical survey and archaeological excavations, they will locate and expose houses, communal areas, and terrace construction histories. The multidisciplinary team will use architectural analysis, palynology, ceramic analysis, soil chemistry, stratigraphy, faunal analysis, lithic analysis, skeletal studies, and radiocarbon dating to reconstruct household organization, activity patterns, and construction sequences. This information will shed light on the ways that collective political policy affected daily life in houses and neighborhoods. These data will be pivotal to growing social scientific understanding of the long-term evolution of cooperation, collective action, and democracy in human history. They will also provide enhanced educational and training opportunities for students and young professional archaeologists.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Background and Research Design</strong></p> <p>Previous research at the Late Postclassic site of Tlaxcallan (A.D. 1420 &ndash; 1519) (located in Tlaxcala, Mexico) funded by the National Science Foundation (BCS#0809643), documented an urban landscape consistent with public policies that encouraged participatory governance (collective action) in which political officials convened in a large council (or congress) to determine the state&rsquo;s political agenda and in which large numbers of citizens assembled in the city&rsquo;s numerous plazas to participate in public festivals, attend markets, and meet with governing officials. Given these results, the present project was formulated to investigate the degree to which Tlaxcallan&rsquo;s highly democratic<a href="#_edn1">[1]</a> policies (or collective political-economic strategies) shaped everyday life at the household scale.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Fieldwork</strong></p> <p>During the summers of 2015 and 2016, Dr. Lane F. Fargher directed archaeological research at the site. At the outset of fieldwork, Drs. Robert A. Cook and Jarrod Burks, conducted a geophysical survey of 30 prehispanic terraces using magnetometry and ground penetrating radar to identify buried architecture. Afterwards, two terraces were excavated during 2015, with the assistance of Drs. Verenice Heredia Espinoza and John K. Millhauser, and another two during 2016. These excavations uncovered five houses in total. Three of these were fully excavated and two were partially excavated. Field crews also placed test excavations in one platform (or flat-topped pyramid with roofed buildings set on the elevated spaces) and an adjacent plaza.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Results</strong></p> <p>Results indicate that the site was heavily urbanized. All unroofed spaces on terraces had floors or living surfaces made of a combination of worked bedrock and hard packed soils (made from finely ground bedrock). No exterior surface was tilled or planted; thus, no part of the excavated terraces was used for cultivation. Moreover, building techniques and spatial organization of the terraces were highly uniform. Occupation of terraces began with smoothing bedrock by cutting, grinding, and filling dents and divots with the grindings. Initially, terraces were fronted by low walls of cut calcareous rocks and occupied by perishable structures. Overtime, accumulated refuse along with bedrock grindings were used to fill in and expand terraces; terrace retaining walls were raised and houses with stone foundations were constructed (Figures 1 and 2). Building materials and techniques, involving cut stones, large pebbles, fired bricks, adobes made from bedrock grindings, and bedrock slabs, remained highly uniform across the city (Figures 2 and 3). Interior floors were made of packed earth. Spatially, &ldquo;houses&rdquo; consisted of 1-5 comparatively small, rectangular dwellings arranged around unroofed patios (Figures 1 and 3). Invariably domestic terraces were organized around a right-left dichotomy, with dwellings and patios concentrated on the right half of the terrace and working spaces located on the left half.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Among households, the dwellings they occupied showed little economic differentiation; all residential units were small as compared with contemporary settlements in Tenochtitlan (ancient Mexico City), Morelos, and Oaxaca. Yet, these same households were flush with exotic goods (especially imported obsidian and fancy polychrome vessels [e.g., bowls, plates, cups, and small serving jars]).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Surprisingly, the deceased were not buried under their houses, breaking with typical Mesoamerican patterns. Instead, they were placed in communal burials under the floors of plazas. The dead were placed in the fetal position on their sides or as secondary bundle burials (i.e., mummies). Very few offerings were placed with specific individuals, but communal offerings including figurines, pottery, and projective points were scattered among all burials.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Discussion</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>These patterns are consistent with democratic mores from ancient Greece, which idealized egalitarianism in housing and the use of personal wealth for civic gifting not personal aggrandizement, and with urban landscapes in other highly collective societies, which tend to be highly urbanized, densely populated, well organized, and rich in public goods (e.g., roads, public spaces). However, the high degree of uniformity in housing and spatial organization, as well as the comparative lack of marked economic inequality sets Tlaxcallan apart. Achieving such democratic ideals entailed adherence to strict moral codes, the development of a widely accessible market system, and the redistribution of wealth through state-funded festivals. Importantly, such a high degree of social engagement with democratic (collective) ideals mobilized Tlaxcaltecan society to such a degree that it was able to stave off both Aztec and Spanish conquest and allowed it to survive the Colonial period and become the only indigenous state to join the Mexican republic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div><br />  <hr size="1" /> <div> <p><a href="#_ednref1">[1]</a> Democratic: Characterized by or favouring social equality; egalitarian; capable of being used, accessed, or enjoyed by anyone (Oxford English Dictionary Online.
