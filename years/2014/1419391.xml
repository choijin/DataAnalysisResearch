<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the Redbud Topology Conference, to be held in the Spring and the Fall of 2014.  The main subject of the conference is  low-dimensional topology, which includes the study of spaces in three dimensions, using algebraic methods such as group theory.  The aim is to investigate the symmetries of 3-dimensional space, which in turn gives insight to better understand the possible shapes and properties.  This conference is part of an ongoing series held at institutions in Arkansas and Oklahoma, which foster interactions among young and senior mathematicians in the region. It features two meetings: a graduate student and young researchers workshop in the spring, and an advanced research conference in the fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spring 2014 Redbud Topology Conference will be held April 11-13, 2014 on the Norman campus of the University of Oklahoma. The theme of this conference is centered on current topics in geometric group theory related to free groups, surface groups, their automorphism groups, and free-by-cyclic and surface-by-cyclic groups. The invited speakers are Matt Clay (U of Arkansas), Spencer Dowdall (U of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), Daniel Groves (U of Illinois at Chicago), Eriko Hironaka (Florida State U), Chris Leininger ((U of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), Johanna Mangahas (Brown U), Jason Manning (U at Buffalo), Ben McReynolds (Purdue U), Alexandra Pettet (U of British Columbia), Sam Taylor (U of Texas at Austin), and Alden Walker (U of Chicago).  The conference begins with a workshop designed to enhance the experience of graduate students and junior researchers.  The meeting will foster interactions and strengthen research ties among young mathematicians in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference website:  http://www.math.ou.edu/redbud/</AbstractNarration>
