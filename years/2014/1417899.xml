<AbstractNarration>SuperMAG is a project to provide the Geospace community with high quality ground magnetic field observations. It serves an important purpose in space physics research by providing data necessary for solving many space weather and general space physics problems.  SuperMAG is headquartered at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory that has an excellent outreach program to high school and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data available through the SuperMAG system are calibrated magnetic field data from approximately 300 observatories around the world. The data have had noise signatures removed as well as the signatures of current systems other than those in and between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere. The data can be rotated into geomagnetically useful coordinate systems. SuperMAG operates a web site which provides ready access to the data in either digital form or as plots. This grant will continue the operation of SuperMAG.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ uperMAG is a worldwide collaboration of organizations and national agencies that currently operate more than 300 ground based magnetometers. SuperMAG provides easy access to validated ground magnetic field perturbations in the same coordinate system, identical time resolution and with a common baseline removal approach.  SuperMAG utilizes 3D vector measurements of the magnetic field obtained from ground bases magnetometers. Stations providing absolute measurements (e.g. Intermagnet Observatories) as well as stations providing relative measurements are included. SuperMAG is focused on the variations caused by electric currents flowing in the ionosphere and magnetosphere and hence subtracts the dominant and slowly varying Earth main field.  SuperMAG service includes data with two different temporal resolution, 1-min and 1-sec. The latter is a subset of the former as not all stations provide 1-sec data. The 1-min data and all derived products can be accessed by selecting the 'Low Fidelity' option under Indices, Data, Polar Plots, Movies and Products. The 1-sec data and all derived products can be accessed by selecting the 'High Fidelity' option under Data and Polar Plots.  All objectives, workpackages, and other deliverables as stated in the proposal were delivered.  These includes:  1) Maintain the SuperMAG service;  2) Develop data repository capabilities;  3) Expand data holdings;  4) Develop uniform gridding tools;  5) Include real-time data;  6) Ingest OMNI data.  During this period of performance SuperMAG trebled in the number of registered users and more than 300 papers were published along with tens of thesis and virtually countless presentations.
