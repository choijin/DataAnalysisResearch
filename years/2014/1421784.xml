<AbstractNarration>This project tests and facilitates a creative problem solving methodology designed to produce radically innovative research agendas.  This project establishes a natural experiment to examine a process that develops multi-disciplinary research teams in a novel collaborative process that engages researchers in the development of potentially transformative research-based and research-generating ideas.  Specifically, the project adapts a participatory action research (PAR) approach to facilitate the development of a problem solving environment and to study this real world problem solving situation in order to: (1) iteratively examine the complex social and intellectual processes involved in collaboration and in creative problem solving and (2) develop novel interdisciplinary research agendas in undergraduate STEM education that address workforce needs unique to Engineering.  Thus, the project's impact has potential for serving as a demonstration of the complex process of collaboration in multi-disciplinary research groups, as a test of social and individual processes involved in collaboration and creative problem solving, and as a means for documenting the development of radically innovative research agendas needed to develop the current and future workforce in Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Science Foundation (NSF) is the federal government?s primary entity for funding research in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  In 2015, NSF created a new funding mechanism called "Ideas Lab," which has the goal of developing and implementing creative and innovative project ideas that have the potential to change approaches to research and/or solve difficult problems.  NSF considers ideas coming out of Ideas Lab meetings as typically high-risk/high-impact, as they represent new and unproven ideas, approaches, and/or technologies. The Ideas Lab funding process was developed collaboratively within NSF, modeled on the "sandpit" workshops that are a key component of the United Kingdom Research Council?s "IDEAs Factory" program.  In 2014 the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) hosted three pilot Ideas Labs meetings aimed at forming innovative approaches for advancing undergraduate STEM education in three disciplines (geosciences, engineering, and biology).   NSF Ideas Lab: Geoscience - March 2 - 7, 2014 - assembled multi-disciplinary expertise in the geosciences to reform undergraduate geoscience education, with the goal of developing essential competencies and skills for the workforce and increasing access for diverse student populations.  NSF Ideas Lab: Engineering - March 17 - 21, 2014 - focused on changing the systems in engineering education that contribute to social inequality and on efforts to broaden participation, increase diversity, and improve recruitment and retention of women, minorities, and people with disabilities.  NSF Ideas Lab: Biology - March 31 - April 4, 2014 - focused on strategies to integrate quantitative literacy (applying math to real-world problems) into a biology core curriculum and to study its effectiveness and/or impact.    Subsequently, ASEE hosted a fourth Ideas Lab from March 20 &ndash; 24, 2016 in suburban Washington, D.C. Called Geo Opportunities for Leadership in Diversity (GOLD), the meeting focused on unleashing the potential of geo&shy;scientists with interests in broadening participation to become impactful leaders within the community.  Meeting logistics were managed by ASEE, with meetings run by a facilitator with known expertise in guiding the creation of interdisciplinary teams and ideas. Researchers from ASEE attended the first three meetings and recorded meeting processes and outcomes, creating a report that documents the interdisciplinary meeting methodology and describes daily activities and meeting processes of awareness and discovery. These were: problem definition; idea creation; and proposals for scaling innovative ideas and developing tangible proposals. Researchers from ASEE observed participants throughout the meetings and in focus groups, conducted interviews, and administered post-meeting surveys. With these data they identified barriers to interdisciplinary collaboration that arose during the workshops, learned how those barriers were overcome, and came to understand the interdisciplinary group dynamics that led to successfully funded proposals.  Main research findings in the report include:  Barriers to interdisciplinary collaboration during the meetings were mitigated largely through the participant selection process, which favored those with a propensity for interdisciplinary collaboration, and through activities built into the Ideas Lab meeting process. The Ideas Lab meetings focused on system-level changes rather than a research topic. This focus lessened the importance of discipline at the meetings and increased the importance of knowledge gained through professional and personal activities. Far from being an impediment to innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration, cognitive frames (the way people think about situations and organize information based on disciplinary orientation, prior knowledge and life experiences) proved to be a major contributor to the development of proposals that were successfully funded.  Examples of cognitive frames include experience with educational research, experience leading faculty professional development, and experience with minority-serving institutions (MSIs) and commu&shy;nity colleges.  We found that teams that understood how team members? cognitive frames contributed to a project, created successfully funded proposals; while teams that could not articulate how team members? cognitive frames contributed to a project did not gain funding. A pivotal moment occurred at the mid-point of the meetings, when an NSF program officer delivered a presentation on existing and forthcoming NSF funding streams that aligned with the meeting topic and to which teams could apply in the future. To a significant extent, this presentation determined the scope of ideas and the proposal development process and outcome. Participants became less intent on innovation and focused more on tangible and fundable proposals. Two common characteristics were found among teams whose proposals were successfully funded.  One was team size - those that received funding were relatively small, with three to five members. Another characteristic was the ability of successful teams to articulate the contribution of team members? cognitive frames to the proposal.
