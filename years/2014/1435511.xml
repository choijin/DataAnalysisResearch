<AbstractNarration>PI:  Mitra, Kunal    &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1435511&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Florida Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;Title:  EAGER: Non-invasive Cerbrovascular Regulation Assessment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A critical need exists for a portable and objective noninvasive tool to evaluate physiological cerebral dysfunction in patients who have sustained concussive head injury (CHI). CHI is known to cause disturbances in brain blood flow as well as neuropsychological (NP) symptoms. Current clinical assessments rely entirely on NP testing, which lack objective diagnostic criteria and do not indicate the presence of actual brain injury. Many patients with normal NP test findings are cleared to resume previous activities, yet are in fact physically impaired and have heightened vulnerability to repeat injury. The proposed sensors and novel algorithms may provide crucially needed tools for initial detection, assessment, monitoring, and rehabilitation of individuals with CHI. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concussion often causes physical brain injury and dysfunctional control of cerebral blood flow (CBF), which is often undetected by current neuropsychological test methods. Objective measurement of dysfunction is difficult with currently available tools. This problem will be investigated by implementing cerebral oximetry and rheoencephalography (cerebral bioimpedance), together with novel algorithms, to evaluate mechanisms that control CBF.  The primary objective of this research is to determine whether these two easily implemented noninvasive devices can be used in combination, without the need for additional sensors, to assess cerebrovascular function, and to explore experimental protocols that could be used in clinical evaluations. Healthy volunteers will be used in the study in order to establish baseline norms and optimize test protocols. The research methods include inhalation of ambient air and a mixture of air and CO2 at predetermined intervals. Sensor responses to the expected vasodilatory response from CO2 inhalation will be analyzed for the effects of CO2 concentration, duration of inhalation, and repeated inhalation challenges (i.e., trending). The results will be used to develop protocols and adjust the sensor parameters for future studies in post-concussive individuals with impaired CBF control.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Concussive injury is believed to be vastly underreported and undertreated. Cerebrovascular mechanisms are often dysfunctional following concussion, and this condition is believed to cause at least some long term post-concussive symptoms. Incomplete normalization of physiological injury is thought to play an important role in increased vulnerability to subsequent trauma. Cerebrovascular control mechanisms in healthy people act by dilating or constricting cerebral blood vessels to regulate cerebral blood flow (CBF). Direct measurements of CBF are not practical, and surrogate parameters are substituted in current clinical protocols for cerebrovascular assessments. This project explored the use of noninvasive cerebral bioimpedance and regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) for assessment of CBF changes at rest and during hypercapnia challenges in healthy subjects. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measured rSO<sub>2</sub> values provides an estimate of oxygenation of the interrogated cerebral volume that is useful in identifying trends and changes in oxygen supply to cerebral tissue and has been used to monitor cerebrovascular function during surgery and ventilation. In this study, CO<sub>2</sub>-inhalation-based hypercapnic breathing challenges were used as a tool to simulate CBF dysregulation, and NIRS was used to monitor the CBF autoregulatory response. A breathing circuit for the selective administration of CO<sub>2</sub>-compressed air mixtures was designed and used to assess CBF regulatory responses to hypercapnia in 26 healthy young adults using non-invasive methods and real-time sensors. After a 5 or 10 minute baseline period, 1 to 3 hypercapnic challenges of 5 or 10 minutes duration were delivered to each subject while rSO<sub>2</sub>, partial pressure of end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (PETCO<sub>2</sub>), and vital signs were continuously monitored. Change in rSO<sub>2</sub> measurements from pre- to intra-challenge (&Delta;rSO<sub>2</sub>) detected periods of hypercapnic challenges. Subjects were grouped into three exercise factor levels (hr/wk), 1: 0, 2:&gt;0 and &lt;10, and 3:&gt;10. Exercise factor level 3 subjects showed significantly greater &Delta;rSO<sub>2</sub> responses to CO<sub>2</sub> challenges than level 2 and 1 subjects. No significant difference in &Delta;PETCO<sub>2 </sub>existed between these factor levels. Establishing baseline values of rSO<sub>2</sub> in clinical practice may be useful in early detection of CBF changes. The results demonstrated that rSO<sub>2</sub> can be used as an indicator of CBF response to cerebrovascular challenges, and specifically to hypercapnia. A threshold level of challenge is needed to register a response, consistent with other reported studies of CBF response to hypercapnia. In order to track arterial pressure changes, a partially inflated brachial blood pressure cuff has been used at less than diastolic pressure, with a pressure transducer in the air line. Cuff pressure measurements were recorded at 40 S/s for the duration of each study. The pressure data was used to represent variations in blood pressure. The relationship of the bioimpedance (Z) measurement to blood pressure in the frequency range over 0.08 Hz has been studied after digitally removing the pulsatile and respiratory frequencies. &nbsp;The Z signal was not correlated well with blood pressure variations below respiratory frequencies. Z was well correlated with pressure at respiratory frequencies, but that is not useful because CBF (as well as rSO2, presumably) is passive to pressure in that bandwidth. The measurements do not support the use of the forehead scalp impedance measurement as an indication of blood pressure changes. The forehead electrode configuration appears to limit the impedance signal to the extracranial tissue, with very little if any of the signal originating from cerebral tissue.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/0...]]></DRECONTENT>
