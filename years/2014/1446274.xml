<AbstractNarration>As anthropogenic climate change intensifies, coral reefs face growing threats from associated decreases in ocean pH and increases in ocean temperature. While such stressors increase steadily through time, coral reefs also experience natural climate extremes, such as El Niño events, that rapidly reshape reef structure and function over a period of months. The El Niño event forecast for 2014/2015 presents the opportunity to study how such events affect coral reef ecosystems. This research will identify which species are most resilient to high temperature stress, and determine whether the presence of specific types of algal endosymbionts in the corals is predictive of the capacity of their coral hosts to survive temperature stress. By studying the reefs at remote sites with documented gradients in human use and pollution, the investigators will be able to tease apart the influence of El-Nino induced temperature changes from local impacts on the reef. This information will ultimately help to identify which components of the coral reef ecosystem are most vulnerable and provide a prognosis for the survival of different types of corals and endosymbionts in a warming world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on reefs at Christmas Island (2N, 157W) - a site that is predicted to be heavily affected by warming during El Niño. In September 2014, roughly 3 months prior to peak El Niño warming, the investigators will install an array of ocean monitoring equipment around Christmas Island. During that field trip, they will also conduct extensive ecological surveys of the reef, collect coral, water and sediment samples for the analysis of Symbiodinium communities that will be analyzed at the University of Hawaii using high throughput sequencing approaches, and characterize ocean geochemistry at both windward and leeward sites on Christmas Island. These activities will be repeated in subsequent trips during peak El Niño conditions, and post El Niño conditions, to allow the investigators to monitor the acute responses of the environment and ecosystem and their near-term recovery, respectively. During the last trip, they will drill several coral colonies to assess how the corals record such a large thermal stress in terms of skeletal morphological and skeletal geochemistry changes.</AbstractNarration>

In particular, funding provided for multiple field expeditions to Christmas Island, located in the Republic of Kiribati, by an interdisciplinary team of scientists including physical oceanographers, climate scientists, and coral reef ecologists and genomicists. During these trips, we installed and maintained a variety of environmental sensors on the reef to monitor ocean temperatures and salinity through the event, and surveyed the coral reef via SCUBA to quantify species abundances, coral health, and fish populations. As it happens, the 2014/2015 El Ni&ntilde;o event that was forecasted by all the major forecasting centers did not materialize, but we were able to collect an unprecedented dataset of coral reef environment and composition leading up to the record-breaking 2015/2016 El Ni&ntilde;o event. The data collected as part of the RAPID included an expedition in November, 2015 that documented the early signs of coral bleaching and mortality on the Christmas Island Reef. The continuous timeseries of environmental, geochemical, and ecological data spans from 2014-2016 continuously, making it the longest and most comprehensive dataset from a remote coral reef. As such, it will provide a valuable resource for oceanographers, ecologists, and geochemists for years to come, capturing the impacts of the largest El Ni&ntilde;o event in recorded history. Our analysis of the vast trove of environmental data, coral survey data, and coral tissue genomics continues in earnest, as the project shifts from data collection to data interpretation and eventual publication. Two high-profile publications are currently in preparation, to be submitted in the next 1-2 months.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Broader impacts:</span></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PI has conducted a suite of broader impact activities over the last year related to the RAPID project.
