<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on an important group of photosynthetic algae in the Southern Ocean (SO), diatoms, and the roles associated bacterial communities play in modulating their growth. Diatom growth fuels the SO food web and balances atmospheric carbon dioxide by sequestering the carbon used for growth to the deep ocean on long time scales as cells sink below the surface. The diatom growth is limited by the available iron in the seawater, most of which is not freely available to the diatoms but instead is tightly bound to other compounds. The nature of these compounds and how phytoplankton acquire iron from them is critical to understanding productivity in this region and globally. The investigators will conduct experiments to characterize the relationship between diatoms, their associated bacteria, and iron in open ocean and inshore waters. Experiments will involve supplying nutrients at varying nutrient ratios to natural phytoplankton assemblages to determine how diatoms and their associated bacteria respond to different conditions. This will provide valuable data that can be used by climate and food web modelers and it will help us better understand the relationship between iron, a key nutrient in the ocean, and the organisms at the base of the food web that use iron for photosynthetic growth and carbon uptake. The project will also further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the general public. The project supports early career senior investigators and the training of graduate and undergraduate students as well as outreach activities with middle school Girl Scouts in Rhode Island, inner city middle and high school age girls in Virginia, and middle school girls in Florida.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project combines trace metal biogeochemistry, phytoplankton cultivation, and molecular biology to address questions regarding the production of iron-binding compounds and the role of diatom-bacterial interactions in this iron-limited region. Iron is an essential micronutrient for marine phytoplankton. Phytoplankton growth in the SO is limited by a lack of sufficient iron, with important consequences for carbon cycling and climate in this high latitude regime. Some of the major outstanding questions in iron biogeochemistry relate to the organic compounds that bind &gt;99.9% of dissolved iron in surface oceans. The investigators' prior research in this region suggests that production of strong iron-binding compounds in the SO is linked to diatom blooms in waters with high nitrate to iron ratios. The sources of these compounds are unknown but the investigators hypothesize that they may be from bacteria, which are known to produce such compounds for their own use. The project will test three hypotheses concerning the production of these iron-binding compounds, limitations on the biological availability of iron even if present in high concentrations, and the roles of diatom-associated bacteria in these processes. Results from this project will provide fundamental information about the biogeochemical trigger, and biological sources and function, of natural strong iron-binding compound production in the SO, where iron plays a critical role in phytoplankton productivity, carbon cycling, and climate regulation.</AbstractNarration>

As part of this project, we performed two sets of incubation experiments with surface seawater collected from the southern boundary of the Drake Passage, near the Western Antarctic Peninsula in early Austral Spring 2016. One experiment involved five amended treatments and a control. The amended treatments included adding iron at three different amounts (+1 nM, +4 nM), and +10 nM), a vitamin B12 (600 pM) addition, and a vitamin B12 (600 pM)/iron (4nM) co-addition. A second incubation at this location two weeks later tested whether additions of high iron water sourced from a coastal region could alleviate iron stress. Measurements of extracted chlorophyll were used to track phytoplankton growth in incubated waters. &nbsp;Samples were also collected from the incubations to analyze the community composition of diatoms in the different treatments, as diatoms are an important phytoplankton group that are known to dominate the spring bloom phytoplankton communities in this region.&nbsp; Additionally, numerous diatom species were isolated from these incubations and brought back to the laboratory for physiological experiments.&nbsp; Isolates that matched diatom species that were found to be abundant under the different treatment conditions were grown under a variety of iron and temperature conditions.&nbsp; RNA was extracted and sequenced from multiple diatom species grown under both high and low iron conditions with multiple purposes.&nbsp; One was to add to the database of sequence data from different diatom species, which is a valuable resource for the broader oceanographic community. Another important reason for the sequencing was to examine how the gene expression of multiple species differs in response to iron stress, which will hopefully shed light on why one species is more or less successful at growing in the Southern Ocean under varying iron conditions.</p> <p>In spite of the two-week separation of the two incubations, the starting diatom community composition in both sets of incubated waters was similar and they shifted in similar ways between the initial and final time points in the control treatments. Our results from the incubation experiments include that iron additions of at least 4 nM resulted in significantly higher chlorophyll (phytoplankton) growth when compared with no addition controls or the + vitamin B12 condition.&nbsp; In the +4 nM and +10 nM iron treatments the diatom communities were very similar by the end of the incubation and also different from the control (no addition), +vitamin B12, and +1 nM iron treatments.&nbsp; Addition of filtered coastal waters also led to a significant increase in chlorophyll over control treatments and resulted in diatom communities similar to those where &gt; 4 nM iron was added.&nbsp; Unlike other Southern Ocean HNLC areas that have been found to be iron/vitamin B12 co-limited in summer, vitamin B12 additions in this early austral spring season had no impact on diatom community composition or in phytoplankton biomass. These results confirm hypotheses that iron is the important limiting nutrient in the Southern Drake Passage and that coastal iron advected offshore has the potential to alleviate iron stress of phytoplankton communities.</p> <p>We successfully isolated &gt;100 diatoms and through ribosomal DNA sequence screening, reduced that number of isolates down to ~25 different diatom species.&nbsp; After evaluating the diatom community composition from the various incubation treatments, we selected ~10 species for experiments to determine the iron tolerance of a number of different species and found varying tolerances to low iron in addition to a variety of absolute growth rates.&nbsp; We also extracted RNA from select species grown under both high and low iron conditions to continue to build the global diatom sequence database and to explore how different species are able to thrive under various iron concentrations.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/28/2019<br>      Modified by: Phoebe&nbsp;Chappell</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1443646/1443646_10368893_1569672291772_BrayCurtisInc1and3M10SqrRtWide--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1443646/1443646_10368893_1569672291772_BrayCurtisInc1and3M10SqrRtWide--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Diatom community composition of Drake Passage Incubations"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1443646/1443646_10368893_1569672291772_BrayCurtisInc1and3M10SqrRtWide--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Diatom community composition of Drake Passage Incubations"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">"Tree" showing diatom community composition similarities from two Drake Passage incubations.
