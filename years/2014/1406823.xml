<AbstractNarration>Vessel noise is a worldwide concern because it is known to alter behavior in marine animals. While fishes show avoidance behavior to vessel noise, research is needed to determine how vessel noise impacts fish reproduction and larval development. In this study, the oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau) will be used as a model organism because males call to females using "boatwhistle" sounds and care for benthic, substrate-attached embryos at dens. Vessel noises can mask mating calls, which may lower female den visitation rates and alter larval development. If this study demonstrates that vessel noise alters reproduction and larval survival, then it is likely to encourage the development of noise-quieting technology for vessels, provide additional evidence to justify ocean soundscape monitoring and could impact policies that limit acoustic disturbance in protected habitats, e.g., marine protected areas, seagrass beds, and coral and oyster reefs. The investigators will continue to participate in community outreach through exhibitions and demonstrations that address the area of bioacoustics, and the findings will be used in undergraduate and graduate courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will determine if vessel noise alters adult and larval behavior and survival. Larval toadfish exposed to vessel noise experimentally will be examined for changes in sensory anatomy, sensitivity to sounds and noise, and preferred sound frequency of juvenile toadfish during settlement. Adult and larval toadfish will be exposed to two types of vessel noise (outboard motor and large vessel) and snapping shrimp sounds (natural sounds, control). Reproductive output will be monitored weekly and larvae will be collected for microscopic examination of neurological development of sound-producing (swimbladder musculature) and morphometric examination of sound-receiving (lateral line and inner ears) structures.  Larvae in each treatment will be tested for sensitivity to particle motion and sound frequency preferences to determine if acoustic imprinting occurs during development in fishes. The researchers hypothesize that vessel noise will reduce male calling rates, lower reproductive output, and cause larvae to change their acoustic behavior during and/or after settlement, potentially altering survival.</AbstractNarration>

In this project, vessel noise impacts on oyster toadfish ecology, acoustic communication, and survival were explored.</p> <p>Oyster toadfish (<em>Opsanus tau</em>) was used as a model species because of its life history. Male oyster toadfish occupy shelters on oyster reefs or other benthic habitats, producing boatwhistle courtship calls (image 1). Females are attracted by these calls to the shelter of a male, where they deposit attached eggs. Over the next month, the male fertilizes and cares for the embryos, after which the larvae detach and are free-swimming juveniles. We hypothesized that vessel noises would mask the courtship calls (image 2), reducing the ability of males to find mates, thus reducing their fitness. Additionally, we hypothesized that vessel noise would impact the ability of the larvae to develop and find food, reducing their probability of survival. If oyster toadfish are impacted by vessel noise, then underwater noise can impact other fishes that use sound for communication, especially fisheries-valuable species like seatrout, drums, and croakers (Family Sciaenidae).</p> <p>The following objectives of the impacts of underwater noise on adult oyster toadfish were investigated: (1) to determine how noise influences male oyster toadfish courtship calling behavior; and (2) to discover if fitness (number of clutches and number of embryos per clutch) is lower in areas of high boat activity when compared to low boat activity areas. Field experiments were executed in &ldquo;noisy&rdquo; and &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; areas; where &ldquo;noisy&rdquo; areas represent sites with over 200 vessels per day and where &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; sites have less than 20 vessels per day. Calls of male oyster toadfish were recorded in response to playback sounds (vessel, predator, and snapping shrimp sounds, image 3) and egg deposition by females was monitored at &ldquo;noisy&rdquo; and &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; sites. &nbsp;Oyster toadfish were impacted by underwater noise. First, males decreased their call rate (# calls per second, image 4) and produced calls with higher sound pressure levels (dB re 1 <span>m</span>Pa, image 5) in response to playbacks with increased ambient noise levels. Second, oyster toadfish had the greatest occupancy in experimental nesting sites placed at sites with little or no inboard motor boat activity when compared to sites with high inboard motorboat activity. Third, male oyster toadfish at &ldquo;noisy&rdquo; sites either had no egg clutches or the number of embryos per clutch was significantly lower than in &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; areas (image 6). Therefore, vessel noise and the physical disturbance from vessels are both influencing the fitness of the oyster toadfish.</p> <p>The second hypothesis was that vessel noise impacted the development of juvenile oyster toadfish. This hypothesis was explored by rearing embryos under two laboratory sound playback treatments: (1) recorded vessel noise and (2) natural sounds. Both treatments used playbacks of sounds recorded at the Morehead City Port, NC on the same day and same location. The natural sound playback contained typical biological sounds (e.g. fish and invertebrate sounds). The vessel noise playback included these sounds and noise from a passing vessel. These sound treatments were replayed at five-minute intervals. After rearing the embryos in these treatments for approximately two months, the behavior of the juveniles was recorded in a dark environment and assessed for their ability to locate a moving rod (a proxy for a moving prey item). Juvenile oyster toadfish reared under vessel noise playbacks were less likely to attack the rod when compared to fish reared under natural sounds. Vessel noise affected the sensory development of juvenile oyster toadfish, reducing their ability to locate water movements that are similar to their prey. This loss of sensory ability may result in reduced survival. &nbsp;</p> <p>Presentations and publications were produced based on this work to help scientists, managers, and the public understand the ecological effects of underwater noise and incorporate these impacts into their ecosystem-based management initiatives. Presentations were made at several scientific conferences, including the international meeting <em>Effects of Noise on Aquatic Life</em> (Dublin Ireland, July 2016), later published in Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics (http://asa.scitation.org/toc/pma/27/1?expanded=27). &nbsp;Based in part on our research, Thomas Bigford wrote a policy column in <em>Fisheries</em> (Vol. 40, page 432, Sep 2015), &ldquo;Vessel Noise Alters Fish Behavior.&rdquo; Also, Jim Hendricks wrote an article in <em>Sport Fishing</em> entitled, &ldquo;What Anglers Need to Know about the Effects of Sound on Fish&rdquo;, referencing this project.
