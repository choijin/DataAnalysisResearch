<AbstractNarration>An exciting and scientifically important frontier of modern astronomy is the push to understand the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), a time in the distant past when the first stars began to influence the material between galaxies.  This era is also referred to as "Cosmic Dawn", and has been identified as potentially rife with new discoveries and one of the key problems to be understood in the near future.  With that in mind, some innovative instrumentation has been under development, including new radio-astronomy arrays suchs as the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER).  The precise extraction of the needed information from such instruments requires unusual measures for instrument calibration, and this proposal addresses that need by building ECHO, a helicopter drone to carry a test transmitter over the telescope array and investigate its actual spatial response pattern to a very high precision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key obstacle to extracting the information on astrophysical processes from data measured by the new generation of telescope arrays is the accurate removal of foreground emission due to extraneous sources unrelated to the EoR emission being sought.  That foreground emission problem depends critically on an accurate knowledge of the as-built primary beam of each telescope in the array.  Current techniques, such as beam modeling, are uncertain at the 20% level; this project intends to push that limit down to 1% for MWA and PAPER.  The scientific payoff is potentially very large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ECHO project will recruit and train undergraduates interested in electronics and field experiments, and will feature strong student involvement in many phases of design, construction, and testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this project is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>

Unlike at higher frequencies where telescopes use steerable dishes, most of these telescopes are fixed to the ground and are pointed electronically.  Lacking the ability to point does not hurt the science, as the cosmological signal is the same in every direction, however it does increase the difficulty of precisely calibrating the array because one cannot move the dish to place a source at an arbitrary position in the field of view to map out the response pattern. The response pattern of the antenna on the sky has been identified as a key parameter in the processing of the cosmological signal, but was found to be difficult to measure with sources fixed to the sky or satellites not under experimental control.  This is the problem ECHO aims to solve.   To begin, we experimented with scale models to build a basic experimental procedure and to understand the interaction between antennas and drones. We then constructed a full scale system, developed a basic software analysis pipeline and performed repeated testing in the lab and in nearby parks.  A first full scale test on a radio telescope was carried out at the end of Year 1 at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory site in Green Bank, WV, resulted in a first set of complete beam maps.     These early maps proved to be extremely high quality and met many (but not quite all) of the requirements for a high quality cosmological analysis. One of the limitations which quickly became apparent was the speed with which the raw data could be analyzed, without quick feedback errors took longer to correct.

To better serve the growing community of low frequency telescope builders/experimentalist we have made it our goal for ECHO to be a completely Open Source project and to assist groups around the world in making their own local ECHO system. Beam mapping software is available on github at https://github.com/dannyjacobs/ECHO, documentation at http://dannyjacobs.github.io/ECHO and an email list  https://groups.google.com/d/forum/astro_ECHO. A paper describing work to date (including the basic ECHO system, the software methods, calibration maps, and the MWA tile) is currently in preperation targeting publication in the fall.   A principle focus for the ECHO project is to provide opportunities for undergraduates to have a hands-on science research experience.  Since 2014, eleven students have been members of the ECHO program, contributing to all areas in all aspects of the project including design, construction, field work, and data analysis. A large fraction of the student team has worked in the field at Green Bank, WV and  the Embry Riddle Observatory site in Prescott, AZ.  Accompanying this report are several photos of them at work.
