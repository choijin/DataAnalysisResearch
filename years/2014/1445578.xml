<AbstractNarration>The value of data increases as data sets grow longer, as this information can be used to answer new suites of questions that are different from those that originally motivated the data collection.  This award supports a three-staged process that will engage early-career researchers to identify new frontiers for the application of long-term data sets, with a particular focus on long-term experiments. The lead investigators propose a unique approach to identifying these questions. Results from their approach will add significant value to ongoing investments in long-term data.  They will advance the fields of ecology and ecosystem science by identifying new questions and by encouraging early-career researchers with novel perspectives to play a central role in defining directions for future long-term research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long-term experiments established through research networks or individual researchers provide some of the best illustrations of the value of long-term research, yet the potential applications of these experiments to diverse questions in ecology and evolution remain untapped. The investigators combine three activities to ensure an open and democratic development and prioritization of new research directions. An on-line survey will be used to engage the broad ecological community in identifying research questions uniquely addressed by long-term ecological experiments. Questions will be primarily closed-ended, but a small number of open-ended questions is necessary to ensure a comprehensive assessment of the community's viewpoints. Survey results will be summarized in collaboration with The Yale Project on Climate Change Communication, which delivers and analyzes online surveys to public, governmental, and academic sectors. The second stage of the project is a workshop, held at the Kellogg Biological Station, during which early-career researchers will present their own questions, evaluate and categorize questions from the survey, and use horizon scanning to identify leading questions and the rationale for their importance. A report synthesizing the approach and the leading research questions will be the final stage of the project. This report will first be reviewed by 'opinion leaders,' or senior researchers well established in the area of long-term ecological research. Their comments and critiques will be incorporated as appendices to the workshop report, which will be submitted for publication  to a leading ecological journal.   The proposed activities - a broad survey, a workshop, and a publication - will identify the next generation of questions that can capitalize on the funds already invested in long-term ecological research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Long-term research has been fundamental in improving ecological theory and understanding complex ecological and evolutionary patterns. As with all initiatives, however, the focus and approaches used must be periodically assessed to determine how they might be adapted to best address emerging issues and knowledge gaps. In particular, addressing gaps in long-term research and capitalizing on opportunities to improve long-term research studies is important if ecological studies are to successfully address the impacts of contemporary environmental challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, and habitat fragmentation. To address these gaps, we designed, implemented and then analyzed responses from the Long-Term Ecological Research survey, which is the first attempt at a national assessment of the ecology and evolutionary biology fields&rsquo; views of long-term research in the United States. Solicitations for completing the survey were widely distributed to the ecological and evolutionary biology community by partnering with professional societies and received over 1,000 responses. Because the survey was designed to be broadly inclusive of the ecological and evolutionary biology research community, the data is representative of the views of the wider ecological research community, including responses from sub-fields, such as evolutionary biology and social sciences, which have historically been less engaged with long-term research. The survey data provide a picture of the advances made through long-term experiments, areas in need of further exploration, opportunities for expanding long-term research, and barriers that stand in the way of progress. The primary objectives of the survey were: 1) To identify and prioritize research questions that are important to address through long-term, ecological field experiments (including those considering evolutionary effects and responses); and 2) To understand the role that these experiments might play, as part of a broader set of approaches, in generating and applying ecological and evolutionary knowledge.</p> <p>Key findings from the survey included the fact that of all types of research approaches, the respondents overwhelmingly agreed (&gt;80%) that long-term, multi-site research was most important for developing general theories in ecology and evolution. Interestingly the respondents felt that both observational and experimental research were equally valuable, highlighting that as a long-term ecological observatory network is established in the United States, an essential complement might be an experimental network. In addition, respondents overwhelmingly agreed that long-term experimental research was better equipped to address certain types of questions than short-term research. Over three-quarters of respondents generally agreed that short-term (&lt;5 years) experiments often quantify only the immediate and transient effects of perturbation. Of those who agreed with the limitations of short-term experiments, nearly all of these respondents felt this was a very strong or a moderately strong justification for conducting long-term experimental research. Likewise, nearly all respondents generally agreed with the statement that &ldquo;long-term changes to complex ecological systems are often unpredictable, highlighting the need for long-term study of responses to experimental manipulations&rdquo;, and of those that agreed three-quarters felt that this was a very strong or a moderately strong justification for conducting long-term experiments. The three most frequently reported incentives for conducting long-term experimental research &ndash; in order of most frequently stated &ndash; were to gain a greater or deeper understanding of the system of study, increased funding, and the potential for greater impact on a researcher&rsquo;s professional career or for addressing important applied questions.
