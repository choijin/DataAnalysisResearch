<AbstractNarration>This award will provide funds to acquire a modern Electron Microprobe. Electron microprobe analysis is a technique for the chemical quantification of sub-micron volumes of solid material, a basic requirement across the full range of natural and engineering sciences. The new instrument will maximize spatial and analytical precision (to 200-700 nanometers and 1-10 parts per million levels). A core regional facility is envisioned to enable cutting-edge science, new discovery opportunities, and to complement the teaching missions of institutions throughout the Rocky Mountain region.  The facility will support dissertations and theses for graduate and undergraduate students, and a variety of training opportunities will be offered including a new course on analytical techniques and one-day workshops on using the instrument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Identification of the chemical compositions and fine spatial heterogeneities in natural materials (e.g. rocks, minerals, fossils, soil) is crucial for understanding formation processes and material properties, whereas engineered synthetic materials require characterization for technology design and quality control. Minor and trace element compositions can enable determination of the origin of a variety of natural Earth. These data can help determine the processes associated with the formation of strategic ore deposits, and to understand processes affecting potential microbial life forms on the deep seafloor and in other planetary environments. Minor and trace element variation can dramatically alter the properties of metals, ceramics, carbides and other synthetic materials. Newly developed techniques allow electron microprobe analysis of thin films for both layer thickness and composition.</AbstractNarration>
