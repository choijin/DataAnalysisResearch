<AbstractNarration>The conference "What Next? The Mathematical Legacy of Bill Thurston" will be held at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York on June 23-27, 2014.  Bill Thurston was one of the most profound and influential mathematical thinkers of our time.  He made fundamental contributions to a wide variety of mathematical disciplines, but perhaps even more importantly he introduced new ways of thinking about and of seeing mathematics.  The connections he discovered between disciplines broadened people's perspective and changed the way they approach problems. He also had a deep interest in communicating mathematics and many ideas about how this should be done.  This meeting will bring together mathematicians from many different areas to share recent advances and explore future directions motivated by Thurston's transformative ideas.  The meeting will include events featuring different ways of communicating mathematics, both to other mathematicians and to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports participation by junior researchers and invited speakers in this large conference, which is centered on the fundamental contributions of Bill Thurston to topology, geometry, and dynamical systems. The goal of this meeting is to bring together mathematicians from a broad spectrum of areas to describe recent advances and explore future directions motivated by Thurston's transformative ideas. Video archives of conference presentations will be made available online. Details about the conference are available at the web site www.math.cornell.edu/~thurston.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In June 2014 a conference entitled ``What Next: the mathematical legacy of Bill Thurston" was held at Cornell University to celebrate the extraordinary mathematics of William P. Thurston, who tragically passed away in fall 2012. Thurston was one of the greatest mathematicians of the past century, a visionary whose work continues to heavily influence the way mathematics is done today.  The main theme of the conference was to highlight current research trends which are influenced by his work.  Twenty-one eminent mathematicians from around the world (the U.S., Canada, England, France, Germany and Japan) gave talks expanding on this theme as reflected in their own work and speculated on the question ``What next?," which was the title of the lecture Thurston himself gave at the 2004 Cornell Topology Festival, held soon after Perelman announced a solution to the Poincar\'e conjecture.  The mathematical fields covered by the research talks spanned multiple areas of geometry, group theory, topology and dynamical systems,  Thurston also had a deep interest in the questions of how we learn mathematics and the ways in which it could be communicated. As part of this he was very interested in using computers both as a tool for communication and as a tool for research. Three speakers were invited to illustrate Thurston's influence in the field of computer tools in mathematics. Two demonstrated software developed for visualizing and exploring dynamical systems and software for visualizing and computing in 3-manifolds. One explained Thurston's method for modeling curved surfaces using flat materials and discussed its application to fashion. There was a beautiful and well-attended public lecture by Jeff Weeks on ``The Shape of Space" illustrating the connection between geometries and cosmology by way of computer games. There was an evening of short films of and by Thurston moderated by a mathematician. There was a lively panel discussion on the topic of ``Communicating Mathematics" involving five panelists well-known for their communication skills as well as for their mathematics.   All of the research lectures, presentations and panel discussion were recorded on video by Cornell's CornellCast office and are now  available on the site    http://www.cornell.edu/video/playlist/thurston-legacy-conference-2014.  In addition, slides from many lectures are available from the conference page, hosted on the Cornell mathematics department site      http://www.math.cornell.edu/\tilde~thurston/   A conference proceedings is currently in preparation, coordinated by Dylan Thurston.    Almost 400 people pre-registered for the conference, and 251 of these picked up their information packets.  The lecture room has 427 seats and at times was nearly full, indicating that there were also local participants who failed to register and registered participants who failed to pick up their packets.  Partial travel support was distributed to 104 participants; because of the large demand the available participant support was used almost entirely for young mathematicians (graduate students, postdocs and assistant professors).
