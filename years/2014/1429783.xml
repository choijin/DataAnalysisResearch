<AbstractNarration>Scientific computing plays a central role in knowledge discovery and scientific advancement. Over 13% of tenured/tenure-track faculty at the University of California Merced (UCM) specialize in areas focused on computational science. This expertise at UCM cuts through the university's three schools and includes faculty-led labs in the natural sciences, engineering, and social sciences.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks support for the acquisition of a shared high-performance computing (HPC) cluster named the Multi-Environment Research Computer for Exploration and Discovery (MERCED). The cluster includes heterogeneous nodes, including nodes with large memory, nodes with large storage space, and GPU nodes. The three specific research areas benefit from this cluster, including modeling and simulation of complex systems, data enabled science, and numerical optimization. In the simulation of complex systems the cluster would advance research in high-performance molecular dynamics, computations of atomistic interactions for friction modeling, first principles simulations of chemical reactions and chemical biology, and fluid dynamics. In data enabled study, the cluster would impact the research in computational system biology, such as handling high-throughput genomics data, cognitive sciences, such as the evolution of language in human populations, history and world culture, such as integration of many datasets representing multiple spatial, temporal and thematic scales and permitting analysis and spatial visualization of this historical data in human affairs, and using GPU computing for speeding up the performance of database systems. In numerical optimization, the cluster would enhance the research in optimizing electric grid, GPU computing for 3D data processing, and signal reconstruction algorithms. The cluster enhances the educational and outreach activities at UCM as well as in the nearby universities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This National Science Foundation (NSF) Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supported the acquisition and deployment of the Multi-Environment Research Computer for Exploration and Discovery (MERCED) high-performance computing cluster at the University of California, Merced (UCM). The award proposal was submitted by a multi-disciplinary team of 17 UCM scientists and engineers. Individual research programs at UCM are especially diverse, ranging from quantum chemistry to the history of medieval China and from calculation-intensive femtosecond modeling of nanoscale friction to data-intensive statistical analysis of high-volume genomic data. Critically, the most advantageous computing environment for one these groups is often different than that for another, a key consideration that guided the multi-environment aspect of the MERCED design plan. The cluster has become quite busy (typical loads ranging from 70-100% capacity) and all indications are that the cluster is providing faculty and students with the computing resources needed to yield high quality science and superb training.</p> <p>In further support of the involved scientific research areas, a key role of the MERCED cluster is to bridge the gap between the modest sized resources that can reasonably be maintained by an individual research groups and extensive national supercomputer sites such as the XSEDE system (see www.xsede.org). More specifically, MERCED offers a number of scientific and training opportunities: (1) the ability to rapidly reconfigure software and hardware as needed for specific projects; (2) the option to run very long-time calculations that cannot be easily adapted to a queue environment as required in most supercomputer environments; (3) the ability to generate and analyze very large data sets locally, avoiding long communication delays; and (4) the capacity to train students on a full set of computational skills needed to be competitive for jobs as independent researchers. It is also necessary to demonstrate software integrity, stability, and scalability as part of allocation requests at major supercomputer sites; the MERCED cluster provides appropriate infrastructure for such software development, validation, and testing needs.</p> <p>Since it's initial deployment in 2015, MERCED has supported more than 200 accounts for students (undergraduate and graduate) and postdoctoral scientists. In addition to facilitating research projects by providing a high-performance computing resource, the MERCED cluster offers trainees hands-on experience with high-performance computing. A subset of students has also been involved in occasional maintenance and cluster expansion efforts, where they have been able to gain training in system administration, networking, and the installation of production performance computer nodes and associated hardware. Additionally, MERCED's presence on the UCM campus has motivated the development of Linux/Unix and cluster use workshops for incoming graduate students each fall. While these workshops have targeted new MERCED users, they are offered for all students and scholars on our campus.

As mentioned above, computing related research plays an important role in the work carried out in the groups at UC Merced. In addition to our Ph.D. and postdoctoral training programs, UC Merced has an active record of undergraduate education and research.
