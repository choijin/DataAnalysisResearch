<AbstractNarration>Symplectic topology is a rich field of mathematics with roots in classical physics that has blossomed into a central mathematical field that combines features of geometry (the science of measurement) and topology (the study of the shape of space).  This field has a variety of applications including fluid mechanics, differential equations, and the study of the possible shapes of the 3-dimensional space and the 4-dimensional space-time in which we live. The goal of this project is to achieve a better understanding of how symplectic and contact topology sit between geometry and topology, thereby strengthening the foundation for the aforementioned applications.  The project's research activities will increase participation and mentoring of students from undergraduate institutions in the critical STEM pipeline.  The project's activities will also encourage the exchange of ideas between faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates, thereby providing additional means of bringing undergraduates into the research process.  Research with undergraduates will also serve as a pedagogical laboratory for integrating ideas arising in mathematical research into the PI's courses at all levels of the curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approaching symplectic topology (and its sister field contact topology) through a topological lens has given rise to a young and thriving discipline with interesting questions that explore the boundary between flexibility (when the symplectic world behaves topologically) and rigidity (when the symplectic world behaves geometrically). This project sets forth a program to answer fundamental flexibility and rigidity questions about Legendrian and Lagrangian submanifolds. A number of the projects are concrete and easy to explain, and hence appeal to the imagination of a wide mathematical audience. The proposed research is framed by three themes.  The first is a focus on the global properties of the space of Legendrian submanifolds, with specific goals of introducing new quantitative techniques into the study of Lagrangian cobordisms and beginning the study of homotopy groups of spaces of higher dimensional Legendrians.  The second theme seeks to link Legendrian and smooth topology, using the Lagrangian cobordism relation to give meaning to certain quantum knot invariants and the conormal construction to connect Legendrian and smooth invariants.  The final theme emphasizes investigations into the scope and structure of Legendrian invariants, with one project, in particular, poised to uncover a new type of algebraic pattern for Legendrian Contact Homology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Symplectic topology is a rich field of mathematics with roots in classical physics that has blossomed into a central mathematical field that combines features of geometry (the science of measurement) and topology (the study of the shape of space).  This field has a variety of applications including fluid mechanics, differential equations, and the study of the possible shapes of the 3-dimensional space and the 4-dimensional space-time in which we live.    The intellectual goal of this project was to achieve a better understanding of how symplectic and contact topology sit between geometry and topology, thereby strengthening the foundation for the aforementioned applications. The specific goal of this project is to answer fundamental flexibility and rigidity questions by examining special types of knots called Legendrian knots and surfaces called Lagrangian surfaces.  In many interesting cases, Legendrian knots lie at the boundary of Lagrangian surfaces.  The PI?s work on the project revealed that Lagrangian surfaces can have interesting intrinsic "lengths" and "widths" that were heretofore difficult to quantify.  On the other hand, the PI?s work investigated and uncovered new conditions under which a Legendrian knot can actually lie on the boundary of a Lagrangian surface.   The project's research activities were designed to increase participation and mentoring of students from undergraduate institutions in the critical STEM pipeline.  The PI supervised six undergraduate researchers over three summers using the award, including four women.  All three of the students who have already graduated have gone on to further study in the mathematical sciences.  The project's activities also encourage the exchange of ideas between faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates, thereby providing additional means of bringing undergraduates into the research process.  In particular, the project supported a monthly seminar that gathered together researchers from local institutions (Haverford, Bryn Mawr, Penn, and Temple) along with prominent external speakers.  This innovative seminar gave its participants opportunities to learn both the shapes of the subfields of the speakers as well as results from cutting-edge research.
