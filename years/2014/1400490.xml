<AbstractNarration>The Pacific Northwest region has a high density of renewable energy businesses that require a technologically skilled workforce. Bellingham Technical College, in close collaboration with Western Washington University (WWU) and the Pacific Northwest Center of Excellence for Clean Energy (Center), is developing an Associate in Applied Science-Transfer Degree (AAS-T) in Sustainable Energy, which offers both preparation for technician level employment and the option of seamless transfer to a baccalaureate degree program at WWU. The jointly developed curriculum included in the Sustainable Energy Degree has enhanced general education requirements, including applied math and science courses that adequately prepare students to enter a university. A significant and novel feature of this program is the inclusion of specialized certificate options enabling graduates to enter the industry as trained technicians in several technical specializations. The AAS-T degree provides a significant opportunity to export the model to other states. &lt;br/&gt;This pathway model demonstrates a new way of offering training as well as a new way of teaching. Being offered at a 2-year open-door institution, this model provides new training opportunities for traditionally under-served community members. The college has a strong focus on serving nontraditional students and is working to increase the number of women entering advanced technology training. This degree offers new opportunities to obtain meaningful and applicable education and secure employment in a growing and well-paid career field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To maximize regional workforce alignment with the educational experience, the Center is convening and facilitating industry focus groups from among their existing stakeholders to obtain targeted input on emerging fields in Sustainable Energy. Once compiled, the project will disseminate these industry-driven training standards by leveraging an energy careers web portal developed by the Center under a Department of Energy grant. This career lattice is already in use throughout a six-state region and the inclusion of this new material adds to its usefulness as well as serves a student and educator audience in Northwestern states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an immediate and growing need for sustainable energy technological training at all levels. The college is a leader in technical education with a long-standing reputation for responding to industry needs by employing experienced technical experts as faculty and maintaining cutting edge applied learning labs. The partners provide expertise in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, research, and best practice dissemination and have established relationships with not only each other, but with industry leaders. The key team members for this project are experienced educators, researchers, and industry experts. Washington State has an interconnected two-year college system supported by the State Board of Community &amp; Technical Colleges which encourages innovation and provides an efficient platform to share best practices.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Through the NSF-funded &ldquo;Advancing Training Pathways for the Sustainable Energy Workforce&rdquo; project grant, Bellingham Technical College (BTC), Western Washington University (WWU) and the Center of Excellence for Clean Energy (CoECE) have responded to industry need for clean energy technological training that allows students to obtain meaningful and secure employment in a growing and well-paid career field. The overarching goal of this work was to strengthen the labor pool of qualified applicants who seek long-term career options in the clean energy sector.&nbsp; To meet this goal, project partners developed a stackable clean energy degree program, created articulation agreements between institutions, developed and offered clean energy courses, and connected students to industry through undergraduate research experiences and hands-on skills training.</p> <p>The Center of Excellence for Clean Energy facilitated two industry focus groups to gather information from local employers and help guide the development of the new degree program. This work resulted in a detailed summary of industry recommendations related to general program design; the knowledge, skills, and abilities required by industry; the necessary skills sets of graduates; and the description of employment opportunities and career pathways.&nbsp; The CoECE used the knowledge gained through these industry forums to create additions to their online, interactive career lattice,intended to provide a roadmap for: 1) colleges that are designing programs in the energy field, 2) employers in the energy field to create training for incumbent workers, and 3) individual job seekers who are making plans to enter a career in energy.</p> <p>Working closely with industry, BTC and WWU developed a two-year associate&rsquo;s degree that prepares students to enter the workforce as a skilled technician or transfer to the Institute of Energy Studies at WWU.&nbsp; Embedded in the Engineering Technology: Clean Energy associates degree are two certificate options: Electronics Technician and Clean Energy.&nbsp; This stackable degree allows students multiple options as they progress through their academic careers. There are currently 36 students enrolled in the clean energy program at BTC. Last year 2 students graduated with the associates degree, 6 students were eligible for the electronics certificate, 8 students were eligible for the clean energy certificate, 2 students transferred to WWU and 1 student is locally employed in the clean energy industry.&nbsp;</p> <p>BTC faculty created a series of 9 clean energy curriculum modules that were integrated into general education coursework (math, science and English) to allow for contextualization of the foundational academic curriculum required for the new degree. This contextualization of fundamental coursework allows faculty to easily modify curriculum and keep up with industry trends in the rapidly changing field of clean energy technology. Using this modularized framework allowed faculty to leverage the strengths of the existing coursework and curriculum. This design kept development costs to a minimum and increased the sustainability of the program.&nbsp; Approximately 240 students in other STEM classes at BTC have taken courses in which the clean energy modules have been inserted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>BTC and WWU faculty worked closely together on the design and development of three transferable clean energy courses as well as the development of a formal articulation agreement between BTC and WWU to ensure maximum credit transferability of the new degree.&nbsp; The two-year degree model and contextualized curriculum modules developed as a result of this project have been disseminated nationally through multiple paper publications and conference presentations.&nbsp;</p> <p>The project offered students from both institutions opportunities for collaboration, including working together on industry based undergraduate research projects and shared skills knowledge transfer.&nbsp; Working closely with a local solar panel manufacturer, BTC and WWU created a unique undergraduate research opportunity for students at both institutions.&nbsp; The students and faculty participating in the project completed cutting-edge research related to the energy production of solar panels.
