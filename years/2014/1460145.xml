<AbstractNarration>This IRES proposal will provide an opportunity for fifteen total students (five per year over three years) to conduct social-ecological research on drylands, comparing systems in Colorado and Kenya. The program will recruit students at the beginning of their sophomore year and each cohort's activities will include coursework and research over three semesters at Colorado State University plus five weeks in Kenya working with mentors at the University of Nairobi. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The student's individual projects will be "inquiry-driven" research questions developed by the students in collaboration with mentors at Colorado State's Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory and the Center for Sustainable Dryland Ecosystems and Societies at the University of Nairobi, with whom the US investigators have a long history of collaboration. The need to consider landscapes as systems of interacting elements in which humans are integral components is widely respected, and the project includes an excellent matrix and mentoring plan to ensure strong individual research activities are developed. Importantly, the inquiry-driven model has been shown to produce strong educational development outcomes for students that will provide professional development that promotes the ability to conduct self-motivated, independent work based on critical thinking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program includes four phases. The students will first spend two full semesters in training and preparation for their field research. This phase will include a drylands seminar course, training in CSU's SUPER (Skills for Undergraduate Participation in Ecological Research) program and partnering with faculty and near-peer mentors leading to drafting of a research question for their field research in Kenya. The second phase will be the field work in Kenya, working under the supervision and guidance of faculty at the University of Nairobi at one or two possible field sites. The third phase will be an academic semester of analyses of field data, culminating in scientific presentations in several venues as well as preparing materials for stakeholders in Kenya. In the fourth phase students may continue their research and/or serve as peer mentors for future cohorts and other ecological training programs at CSU. Important research results will be incorporated in course materials and program insights both socio-ecological and educational will be published in the appropriate literature. The project includes effective assessment plans and insights about student learning will be carried forward to develop courses and field experiences with UoN that combine scientific excellence with student needs/preferences.  Overall, this project has tremendous potential to help produce well-rounded students with a strong understanding of the interactions of ecological systems with human systems and who are ready to pursue a range of professional opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction:   This IRES award (1460145), IRES: Student-led social-ecological research in the Kenyan drylands (EA-IRES), was awarded to researchers at Colorado State University in 2015. EA-IRES provided research experiences to undergraduate students, employing a systems-thinking and student-driven approach to research in an international setting. In our case the research experiences were all located in Kenya and Tanzania. We were able to provide this experience to a total of 14 students over three research years. All students carried their projects from the dream phase through conclusion, including communication of results. Each student was active in the EA-IRES program for five semesters, from Fall of the first year through a second year, and into Spring of a third year. Pre-research training occurred in Semesters 1 &amp; 2. Research implementation and training occurred in Semester 3. Data analysis, communication of results to diverse audiences, and related training occurred in Semesters 4 &amp; 5.  Pre-research training  Over the course of the first two semesters, EA-IRES fellows were trained in foundational research skills (through Colorado State University?s Skills for Undergraduate Participation in Ecological Research (SUPER) Program), social-ecological systems, systems thinking, drylands, East African livestock herding systems, proposal writing, approaches to social science research, and how to work appropriately within complex international cultural contexts. ALL students chose to conduct projects with a significant social science and qualitative component, so gained experience they would not have otherwise had in their primarily natural resource-oriented programs of study. This offered an opportunity to learn, to construct, and use social science methods and tools, and to connect with communities around social-ecological questions. This was a unique and phenomenal opportunity and experience for all students. The combined training and research experience of EA-IRES developed skillsets that would prepare students for research-oriented careers, or to conduct semi-independent research in graduate school.  Research Implementation &amp; Training  Students worked closely with Kenyan mentors from University of Nairobi?s (UoN) African Drylands Institute for Sustainability (ADIS). All cohorts of fellows spent their first few days in East Africa in the city of Nairobi, meeting with faculty mentors and student peers in UoN?s College of Agriculture and Veterinary Sciences (CAVS). This helped to build community, to share knowledge, and to refine proposals. Students also formed strong relationships with our field teams in Samburu, Kenya, and Simanjiro, Tanzania. While becoming close cross-cultural friends may seem to be a superficial outcome, this was one of the greatest joys of the program according to the students. It helped them to relax, to enjoy themselves, to talk openly about cultural differences and customs that surprised or concerned them, and to help the students to talk to and relate to the people with whom they were working.   During field work, students met with village leadership, NGO representatives, and study households. They visited local markets, ate local food, disconnected from the internet and their friends and family at home, shared the cooking of meals, and visited protected areas for a wildlife safari, which was an opportunity to learn more about the local natural resources and their management.   Data Analysis &amp; Communication of Results  Our three cohorts of fellows presented a total of 46 poster presentations at multiple CSU symposia and conferences, each with a different focus and audience. Four of the students won awards for their poster presented at CSU?s University-wide Celebrate Undergraduate Research and Creativity Symposium (CURC). Eleven of our fellows presented oral presentations of their research at the National Council for Undergraduate Research (NCUR) annual meeting. All EA-IRES students who applied were accepted. Four of those eleven students submitted manuscripts to the NCUR Proceedings, and all four had their papers published. This is an extraordinary accomplishment for an undergraduate student. Finally, our students each wrote a report for communities to be stitched together by the PI into a comprehensive report for the Tanzanian and Kenyan communities.  Other Outcomes  Three cohorts of EA-IRES fellows have had an opportunity to learn from East African community members, and community members from students. This experience has been invaluable for these undergraduates who are embarking on their careers, to engage with stakeholders and to talk with people to ensure that the work that they are doing is relevant (and not just to them!). Students participated in the creation of a community report that represents their research results. These reports represent both accountability to communities, and dissemination of new knowledge and syntheses. While the impacts for students are the metrics measured by this project, the project has actually had impacts around the world, in academia, in communities, and in the lives of individual students and stakeholders.
