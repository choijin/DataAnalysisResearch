<AbstractNarration>Looking forward, a fundamental challenge in computer systems is the Power Wall, where, due to imbalances in technology scaling, not all the cores that can be placed in a many-core chip can be powered on at the same time. The Power Wall is transforming all levels of the system stack, including the many-core architecture landscape -- the focus of this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By improving power more than an order of magnitude (and energy efficiency, several times) over conventional operation, near-threshold voltage computing (NTC) has the potential to push back the Power Wall. To unlock NTC?s energy efficiency potential, however, critical barriers to NTC -- limited degree of parallelism and higher vulnerability to parametric variation -- must be attacked.  This project suggests leveraging scaling characteristics and implicit fault tolerance of emerging R(ecognition), M(ining), S(ynthesis) applications in order to overcome NTC barriers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will not only address critical barriers of NTC to unlock NTC?s energy efficiency potential, but also deliver tools and models to quantify the implications of these barriers at the system level. The deliverables will help the architecture community in reasoning about and exploring how to trade-off energy efficiency for resiliency in near-future systems capable of operating at&lt;br/&gt;as low voltages as near-threshold.</AbstractNarration>

The goal of this project was addressing these two critical barriers to NTC by exploiting the implicit fault tolerance of emerging R(ecognition), M(ining), S(ynthesis) applications.           The research efforts spanned (i) modeling of architectural implications of process variation at ultra-low voltages; (ii) devising application-specific metrics to quantify the energy-efficiency vs. accuracy trade-off in approximate computing; (iii) design space exploration, considering practical constraints. Specifically:      1. The widely used architectural process variation model (developed by the PI) tailored for ultra-low voltage operation, VARIUS(NTV), is extended for emerging FinFET devices and made publicly available [3].  2. The efficacy of application-specific accuracy metrics for approximate computing is assessed.

The results are published in IEEE Micro Magazine, Special Issue on Heterogeneous Systems [2]. The critical system bottleneck of power distribution and voltage regulation at ultra-low voltages is assessed [5, 6], considering thermal implications [7].       This project directly or indirectly unlocked the following training and professional development activities for both graduate and undergraduate students: (i) performing research; (ii) extensive training to effectively communicate research findings in periodic weekly meetings along with workshops and conferences; (iv) publishing results in scientific journals; (v) publicly releasing the research infrastructure developed and deployed; (v) mentoring graduate and undergraduate research assistants (including support via the REU program).       The findings and results of this research has been diseminated to researchers in academia and industry through presentations at workshops and conferences; journal publications; invited talks at workshops, universities and research institutions; and the website of the PI's research group which mainly serves as a repository for the public release of the infratructure developped for this research.
