<AbstractNarration>This 3-year project is aimed at studying the solar-flare-associated magnetic field evolution, which has the promise to reveal the underlying physical mechanism(s) responsible for solar eruptions --- the main drivers of space weather.  The project has a strong education component: it will mainly support a female graduate student as well as a female junior researcher.  The data analysis and imaging processing tools that will result from this project can be used in many other areas of science and engineering.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main thrust of this 3-year project is to investigate the evolution of vector magnetic fields and flow motions associated with solar eruptions.  The specific science objectives of the project are to (i) gain improved physical understanding of the rapid changes of photospheric magnetic fields following solar eruptions, and (ii) study the photospheric flow motions, both horizontal and vertical, associated with these eruptions.  The project team will use recent state-of-the-art data as well as continuing new observations from SDO and NST.  Most of the data analysis tools that are needed to conduct the research studies have been developed and validated by the project team in the past.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Using advanced data from 1.6m Goode Solar Telescope (GST) and NASA  missions,  we obtained significant progress in understanding evolution  of magnetic fields associated with solar eruptions.  Two Ph.D. students  graduated,  we  published  15 scientific papers. We also published two additional review articles to  summarize the state of research in this particular area.  Our studies made major discoveries in the following four areas:  (1) In a paper published in Nature Astronomy, we disclosed how the evolution of small scale magnetic structure near solar surface can lead to triggering of solar eruptions--the source of so called space weather that can affect human life.  (2)  In a paper published in Nature's Scientific Reports, we presented  observation of a solar flare using exceptionally high resolution images  from GST. The observation reveals the process of the flare in  unprecedented detail, including the flare ribbon propagating across the  sunspots, coronal rain (made of condensing plasma) streaming down along  the post-flare loops. (3)  In a work led by a graduate student,  we found rapid flow changes associated with the triggering of solar flares.  This is also associated with a sudden rotation of sunspots.  This is a issue debated for decades: can tail wag a dog?   The photosphere is dense,  acting like a dog,  while solar corona has much lower density, so acting like the tail of dog.  Traditionally,  dog can wag the tail, but not other way around.  We found the new physics that the tail can wag the dog. (4) We found the evidence of twisted magnetic flux ropes with highest observation,  that are crucial for magnetic instability leading to solar eruptions.  Our data analysis tools can be used in many science areas involving imaging processing.  We also involved high school students in the project in addition to  undergraduate and Ph.D. students. The project is sucessful in both research and education.       Last Modified: 07/06/2019       Submitted by: Haimin Wang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
