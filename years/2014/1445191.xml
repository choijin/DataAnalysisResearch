<AbstractNarration>Results of this research will benefit the weather forecasting and model development communities, and promote collaboration with other scientists. The project supports one full-time student. Research results will be documented in peer-reviewed publications and shared through participation in national and international workshops and conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) is a large-scale intraseasonal (30-50 day) tropical disturbance with coupled convection and circulation anomalies that propagate eastward at about 5 m/s. The MJO impacts tropical weather across the globe, and influences weather at higher latitudes via teleconnections. The extratropical impacts are especially pronounced when MJO heating is centered over the Maritime Continent and West Pacific. Most state-of-the-art general circulations models (GCMs) struggle to simulate eastward-propagating MJO convection, and those that do typically have difficulty with its propagation across and beyond the Maritime Continent.  Coupling an atmosphere-only GCM to an interactive ocean model often improves the magnitude, periodicity, and propagation characteristics of its MJO simulation, but there is no consensus as to why this is true. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will advance our understanding of the roles of air-sea interaction and Maritime Continent geography on the simulation of the MJO. Expected outcomes of this research are 1) improved understanding of processes critical to MJO initiation and propagation and 2) new insights into why so many GCMs struggle to simulate an eastward propagating MJO capable of translating the Maritime Continent. The objectives of this project are 1) to understand the mechanisms of air-sea interaction on MJO convective development and its impact on moist static energy and 2) to understand the relative influences of air-sea coupling and Maritime Continent geography on MJO propagation. Reanalysis and model output from the super-parameterized Community Atmosphere Model (SPCAM) will be analyzed to assess the mechanisms of air-sea interaction on MJO convective development in coupled and uncoupled simulations, and for MJO events that do and do not propagate across the Maritime Continent. A series of modeling exercises using idealized island geography will be performed to test existing hypotheses concerning the Maritime Continent's impact on MJO convection and its propagation. Analysis methods will be applied to a limited set of coupled climate models to examine the extent to which results are model dependent.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) is a tropical weather disturbance consisting of large-scale patterns of anomalous convection and winds that slowly propagate eastward from the western Indian Ocean to the central Pacific Ocean.  In the upper levels of the atmosphere, outflow from deep MJO convection perturbs mid-latitude jet streams, affecting a variety of weather phenomena across the globe, and their predictability up to 2-4 weeks in advance.  In the western Pacific Ocean, strong low-level westerly winds that follow western Pacific MJO convection can initiate or maintain El Ni&ntilde;o conditions by forcing deep ocean waves along the Equator.    MJO convection typically weakens as it crosses the MC and reintensifies in the western Pacific.  This weakening is exaggerated in climate and forecast models, with many models failing to propagate MJO convection to the western Pacific.  Model simulations that include ocean feedbacks to MJO convection by coupling atmospheric and oceanic models tend to better simulate MJO propagation across the MC than their atmosphere-only counterparts.  Precisely how these coupled feedbacks enable MJO propagation, however, have been poorly understood, hindering our ability to identify key ocean-atmosphere coupled processes and improve their representation in models.      In this study, we analyzed MJO propagation behavior in observations and model simulations to 1) elucidate the ocean feedback processes that enable the propagation of MJO convection beyond the MC and into the western Pacific Ocean, and 2) to better understand the processes that weaken MJO convection over the MC.  In ocean coupled and uncoupled experiments with four different models, we found that relatively fast (&lt; 30-day) ocean feedbacks in coupled simulations contribute to MJO propagation by shaping the average pattern of tropical atmospheric humidity so that MJO winds more efficiently moisten the atmosphere east of MJO convection, favoring continued eastward convective development and MJO propagation.  We further found that this result can be understood in terms of model rules that govern how easily convection is initiated and how sensitive its development is to the vertical profile of relative humidity.  Our findings suggest that detailed analysis of observations can provide metrics for each of these processes that can serve as benchmark targets during model development cycles aimed at improving the representation of convection and MJO propagation.    Our study also examined observed processes that contribute to MJO decay over the MC.  We found that regions of dry air entrained into the tropics from the extra-tropics by westward-moving disturbances in the western Pacific Ocean could disrupt the east-of-convection moistening associated with MJO eastward propagation.  These disruptions were more likely to occur over the MC during La Ni&ntilde;a conditions, when sea surface temperature (SST)-driven changes to atmospheric humidity patterns increase the likelihood of drying by winds associated with westward-propagating disturbances.  This finding represents a second method whereby ocean feedbacks affect MJO propagation, where the feedback is associated with multi-year SST variations.    Intellectual merit of our project is the identification of two pathways through which ocean feedbacks can promote or hinder MJO propagation through the MC.  These ocean feedbacks, which are driven by SST variations on both short and long timescales, are closely linked to atmospheric relative humidity feedbacks to the MJO, where the linking mechanism is the convective response to SST perturbations and pre-existing humidity.  These findings improve our level of understanding of ocean coupled feedback processes for the MJO and can form a basis for evaluating and improving convection and MJO simulation in climate and forecast models.    Broader impacts of our project include the support of one atmospheric science PhD student, and the opportunity for the PI to mentor an NSF REU summer intern, who is now a US graduate student studying oceanography.
