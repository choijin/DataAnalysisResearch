<AbstractNarration>The long-term survival of a species is dependent on the genetic diversity of the populations that comprise that species. Any reduction in genetic diversity weakens the ability of a species to adapt to changes in the environment, including emerging diseases or changing climate. Understanding how populations lose genetic diversity, and how they may recover from this loss, is fundamental to conservation efforts. This study will cap a 25-year-long project by addressing the foundational topic of the loss of genetic diversity across 270 generations of an insect (chewing louse) with a very short (33 day) generation time. This insect serves as a model for organisms with much longer generation times; for example, a 270-generation study of rodents would take more than 300 years to complete, and a similar study of human genetics would span more than 5,000 years. The distinct advantage of using this insect as a model organism promises to produce new insights that have the potential to change the way scientists think about changes in species distributions and the effect of this change on the genetic diversity of at-risk species. The study also will provide numerous research opportunities for undergraduate students and will foster discussion at the local level via the establishment of a Science Caf√© for informal interactions between research scientists, students, and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will provide empirical genetic data from a parasitic chewing louse (Geomydoecus aurei) for testing predictions produced by simulation studies. G. aurei is experiencing an ongoing range expansion that dates back at least to the 1920's. The research will take advantage of a library of louse samples collected since 1991, which documents a yearly southward movement of the parasite's geographic distribution of about 200 meters per year. To test models of population expansion, the spatial distribution of genetic variation associated with the population expansion will be compared to spatial genetic variation within the core of the species range. Genetic recovery models will be tested by comparing populations previously bottlenecked by the colonization process with populations from those same locations now embedded within the expanding range of G. aurei.</AbstractNarration>

Biologists have pieced together many of the potential consequences of these range shits on factors such as the genetic variability within populations of organisms by studying the genetic signatures of these past events on the genomes of organisms.&nbsp; Models have been constructed and predict a decrease in genetic variability as small numbers of individuals colonize newly available habitat.&nbsp; Populations with lower levels of genetic variability are particularly vulnerable to adverse conditions because they lack the raw material (variation) to respond to a change in environment (e.g., disease, parasites, or desertification).&nbsp; This project focused on testing the predictions of three of these models:</p> <p>1.<strong> </strong>The <strong>linear model of spatial expansion</strong> predicts that populations of organisms that are the result of a recent range expansion will show less genetic diversity than core populations and that genetic diversity will decrease with distance from the initial colonization site.&nbsp;</p> <p>2. The<strong> recovery model</strong> predicts that populations at the leading edge of range expansion will be slow to recover from their low genetic diversity (genetic bottleneck) and retain evidence of the event hundreds of generations after initial colonization.</p> <p>3. The <strong>allele-surfing model</strong> predicts that expanding populations will show greater genetic variation along an axis perpendicular to the axis of expansion than along an axis parallel to it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our team of Co-PIs, undergraduate students, and lab assistants tested these predictions using a novel host-parasite system involving the rapid range shift of an ectoparasitic chewing louse in the Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico.&nbsp; Samples spanning 225 louse generations (equivalent to 5000 years if this were a human study) were used.</p> <p>&nbsp;Results:</p> <p>1. Our data indicate that there is an obvious decrease in genetic diversity and that this decrease intensifies nearer the leading edge of the population expansion (Fig. 1).

Regression analysis depicts a clear, negative relationship between distance from colonization and diversity (Fig 2).</p> <p>&nbsp;2. Populations sampled in 1991 were collected soon after the initial colonization.&nbsp; Genetic recovery from the initial population bottleneck began quickly (in the first 5 years or 45 louse generations), but then tapered off. At last sampling, 25 years or 225 louse generations after population establishment, populations had failed to reach the level of genetic diversity observed in populations of lice from the core of the species distribution (Fig. 3).</p> <p>3. Our data also support the presence of allele surfing in this population expansion. Regression, PCA, and clustering methods all indicate surfing in 6 alleles in our study area. Three of these alleles contribute heavily to the detectable population structure in this zone supporting the contention that allele surfing can result in geographic structure in genetic data. Furthermore, a manmade structure consisting of a combination or roads, railway, and canal likely has intensified the surfing effect by partially restricting gene flow between surfing groups of populations.&nbsp; Therefore, this study demonstrates that allele surfing during population expansion can impart significant genetic differentiation in segments of a larger population even in the absence of selective advantage or a strong barrier to gene flow.</p> <p>To date, this project has produced two peer-reviewed publications with two more in review.&nbsp;</p> <p>Importantly, the PIs have involved many students from diverse backgrounds, in this research program and provided with educational opportunities, experience and in many cases financial compensation to allow them to concentrate on their research.
