<AbstractNarration>Networks are crucial in understanding economic outcomes.  Multiple key economic questions require a network analysis. Whether an individual purchases one commodity or another may depend on from whom he seeks advice about prices and product qualities. The care given to a patient in a hospital and how much it costs can depend on the network connections of the hospital and of the physician. Understanding how networks form, how they are used and their structure in diverse situations is important to almost all aspects of the social sciences.  To understand the fundamental properties of networked societies and economies, those that may hold in diverse situations, it is crucial to develop a deeper understanding of network theory from multiple perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Networks Conferences is for a series of four conferences to take place over four years. Network theory and application have reached the point where such a series is needed to advance research in the area, to disseminate work in progress, to enable promising research to find a critical audience and to obtain valuable feedback, to provide new researchers to the area and graduate students a source of exposure to some of the cutting-edge, new and path-breaking research on networks.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each conference in the series will have a theme but all papers submitted relevant to the general focus of the conference series will be considered. Key economic issues of interest include networked markets, contagion and diffusion, homophily, segregation and discrimination, networks in economic development, and inequality. Cooperative and non-cooperative game theoretic approaches as well as decision-theoretic approaches will be relevant. There are also related theoretical and econometric issues of developing new models and statistical techniques for estimating networked interactions, which may also be treated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the context of networked models there will be presentations of research on labor markets, risk-sharing networks, financial networks, market design, experimental and field research with emphasis on testing the predictions of network theory, and estimation of networked models.  The organizers will invite speakers doing related research from other disciplines, including computer science and sociology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While networks have been a central area of study in sociology, they have only emerged as an important -- and now rapidly growing -- part of economics over roughly the last decade. This has been accompanied by astonishing growth of research on networks in computing science, statistical physics, and engineering. The conference series will provide opportunities for stimulating cross-disciplinary interactions. &lt;br/&gt;The annual conferences would also serve expose current PhD students and young researchers to cutting edge research in networks.   Besides inviting some of the most promising PhD students that can be identified to the conference, the conference series will maintain a website to inform others about the program and its contents.   Most important, the conference series can help bring together scholars, especially those who might be somewhat isolated, and enable them to reach a critical mass to provide each other with feedback over time on ongoing projects.</AbstractNarration>

Hopefully these connections will be nurtured; they will ultimately be crucial to develop better insights that help us understand today?s interlinked world.   Summary of the Conferences  First Conference: The first conference in the series was held at Harvard University in the Spring of 2015. It included 41 presentations consisting of 9 posters and 32 papers.  Of the presenters, 10 were graduate students, 20 postdocs and junior faculty, and 11 were senior faculty.     Second Conference: The second conference was held at Stanford University in the Spring of 2016.  There were 53 presentations consisting of 16 posters and 37 papers.   The presenters comprised of 12 graduate students, 25 postdocs and junior faculty, and 16 senior faculty.     Third Conference: The third conference was held at Washington University in St. Louis in the Spring of 2017. There were 60 presentations consisting of 13 posters and 47 papers. Of the presenters, 14 were graduate students, 28 postdocs and junior faculty, and 18 were senior faculty.      Fourth Conference:  The fourth conference was held at Vanderbilt University in the Spring of 2018.   There were more than 70 presentations including 10 posters, more than a dozen graduate students, more than 30 postdocs and junior faculty, and more than 20 senior faculty.     The conference has grown each year, from 41 to 53 to 60 to 70 presentations. It has also been balanced, in the sense of involving a large number of graduate students (mostly in posters and some in full presentations) as well as many postdocs and junior faculty.

Scientific Outcomes  We surveyed those who attended the first two conferences (at Harvard in 2014 and at Stanford in 2015) to collect information about publication outcomes, collaborations, and other contributions to scientific progress.   Papers presented (or, in one case, stemming directly from interactions at the conference) were published or invited for revision at the following journals, with numbers in parentheses indicating the number of papers: Econometrica (5), Quarterly Journal of Economics, Journal of Political Economy, Review of Economic Studies (2), AEJ: Micro, Games and Economic Behavior (3), Nature Human Behavior, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2), Journal of the American Statistical Association, Physical Review E, Physica D, Operations Research (2), Economic Theory, Proceedings of the 16th Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems, EC'16 Proceedings of the Seventeenth ACM Conference on Economics and Computation, Marketing Science, Network Science, and others.[1]  Many more are submitted for publication in top journals. These outlets&mdash;which include journals in economics, physics, engineering, and computer science&mdash;display the diversity of disciplines and approaches represented at the conference.[2]          [1] Not everyone responded to our survey, so this list represents a lower bound.    [2] Detailed citations are available on request.                     Last Modified: 07/09/2018       Submitted by: Myrna Wooders]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
