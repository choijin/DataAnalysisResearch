<AbstractNarration>CBET 1438569/1438567&lt;br/&gt;This award by the Particulate and Multiphase Processes (PMP) program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET, Engineering Directorate), is co-funded by the Instrument Development for Biological Research (IDBR) program in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (BIO Directorate).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Measuring the physical and mechanical properties of biological materials and other complex fluids such as polymeric liquids poses special challenges for scientists and engineers.  The properties of these materials can change owing to the contact between the material and solid walls, such as the walls of a container holding the material.  This collaborative project involves the development of a new device and new method to measure the rheological properties of fluids or solids that avoid contact between the sample and solid walls.  The method is called acoustic tweezing rheometry, and it uses acoustic levitation to hold a small sample freely suspended in air or water while applying a force on the material that causes it to deform.  The device then reads the response of the material by recording changes in the shape of the sample as a function of time.  By comparing the shape of the sample with computer simulations carried out as part of the project, the rheological properties of the material can be deduced.  This new instrument will find applications in a diverse array of science and engineering disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acoustic tweezing rheometry will be used to measure properties of active polymeric and biological fluids and soft tissue without artifacts such as contamination, biological activation or gelation due to contact with solid walls. A model will be developed for noncontact measurement of material constants through analytical studies and computational simulation.  The acoustic tweezing technique will be developed and validated for measurement of material properties of viscoelastic fluids.  The method will be applied to biological fluids and soft tissue, including whole blood during coagulation and collagen gel.  Results will be disseminated broadly, including outreach to the biological communities that could benefit from the new method.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There are many diseases that either directly or indirectly result in a change in blood's mechanical properties.  When blood is still in liquid form, diseases such as sickle cell disease can result in life-threateningly higher thickness (viscosity) of the blood.  Other disease states and medications to treat them can affect how blood clots, resulting in either slow clotting (hemophilia, for example) or rapid clotting (some post-surgical states)  The resesrch performed in our project has developed and demonstrated a new way to test for abnormal mechanical changes in blood.  Our technique utilizes acoustic waves to levitate a single drop of blood.  Using only acoustics we can dynamically deform that blood drop and, by applying mathematical analysis, infer the mechanical properties of the blood quickly and accurately.  We hope ultimately to improve the quality of life for those individuals who suffer from undetected and untreated coagulopathies, or for those who must daily monitor coagulopathy owing to some other disease.  We also hope to enable rapid diagnosis of sickle cell crisis, as well as contribute to the understanding of the mechanical origins of the enhanced blood thickness that occurs in sickle cell sufferers.   This project has trained one PhD student from matriculation through completion of her thesis, ten undergraduate students by combination of summer research projects and senior capstone design projects, and one high school student by providing him with a senior honors thesis project.  This project has resulted in four archival journal papers and eight national conference papers.  Finally, this project has contributed to the formation of a company, Levisonics, Inc., to transfer the technology developed into a device suitable for hospital laboratory and ultimately bedside and home care use.
