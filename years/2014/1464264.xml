<AbstractNarration>This project is a collaborative effort by Desert Research Institute and Michigan Technological University to provide insight into the emissions of nitrogen-containing compounds from the combustion of peat soils.  Preliminary estimation suggests that nitrogen emissions from fires in peatlands can potentially rival that of fossil fuel combustion.  An accurate assessment of the global nitrogen cycling requires a detailed understanding of the various nitrogen-containing compounds emitted during peat fires and the factors affecting their partitioning into the gas and particle phases and the changes that they undergo in the atmosphere with age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main hypothesis of the proposed work is that an important fraction of peat fuel nitrogen (N) is contained in particulate organic nitrogen (PON), and that this fraction changes during photochemical processing in the atmosphere. The objectives of the research are: 1) to evaluate the partitioning of peat soil N into gas and particle-phase components as a function of peat fuel type and combustion efficiency, with a particular focus on quantifying the PON fraction; and 2) to assess how the oxidation (aging) of smoke by hydroxyl (OH) radicals alters the abundance and chemical properties of the PON.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work is expected to advance the understanding of the importance of peat fires for global N cycling and atmospheric chemistry. The research results will be distributed to US natural resource managers through a webinar, which may inform their decision-making on peatland restoration and preservation. A high school science teacher involved in this research will help develop material for engaging students in hands-on activities related to biomass burning, fire ecology, and atmospheric chemistry implications of these fires.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Wildland biomass burning, in the form of wildfires or prescribed burning, is an important source of organic aerosol to the atmosphere contributing to climate change, reductions in visibility, and adverse human health effects.  The molecular chemistry of atmospheric aerosol is important because it can be used to better understand its lifecycle and the physical properties of aerosol in the atmosphere.  In this work, we investigated the molecular properties of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) for five globally important fuels: Alaskan peat, Russian peat, Florida swamp peat, wildland cheatgrass, and Ponderosa pine needles.  Aerosol from laboratory controlled combustion experiments was collected on filters and extracted in HPLC grade water.  Ultrahigh resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and UV-Vis absorption measurements were performed using a 3-step solid-phase extraction method. Although thousands of individual molecular formulas were identified, the majority had low O/C ratio (&lt; 1) typical for fresh biomass combustion aerosols.  Compositions with carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen (CHO compounds) were dominant followed by those with nitrogen (CHNO compounds), and sulfur (CHOS compounds). In all cases, the reversed phase Strata-X cartridges retained the majority of the organic anions; the greater part of which was eluted during the first elution, while the larger, less oxidized, more aromatic molecules with lower average O/C and H/C ratios were eluted in a second alkaline methanol elution step. Only 25-36% of the assigned formulas were common for both elutions, indicating a good separation of compositions was achieved. We observed Absorption &Aring;ngstr&ouml;m Exponents (AAE) of 10.4-15.2 for the first elution and 6.7-8.8 for the second elution, indicating clear differences in the light absorbing properties of WSOC in the two elutions.   For the first time, we were able to identify thousands of individual molecular formulas and correlate their chemical properties with light absorption.  In this work, we found that aromatic CHNO compositions are most highly correlated with visible wavelength absorption and exhibited the typical brown carbon wavelength dependence that is often associated with biomass combustion.
