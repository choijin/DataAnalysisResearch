<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses a new microscope that represents a breakthrough in materials characterization.  The new microscope, referred to as a xenon plasma focused ion beam microscope, is being used by the research team to visualize the internal structure and chemical composition of three-dimensional volumes of opaque material with a resolution in the range of nanometers.  For the first time, it is possible to measure a large number of structural features in advanced ceramics, high performance alloys, solid oxide fuel cells, and magnetic memory devices.  The important contribution is to move beyond isolated observations to a point where we describe materials properties not only in terms of the average or representative internal structure, but also in terms of rare events (large deviations) in the microstructure.  The new microscope accelerates research not only at Carnegie Mellon, but also at research institutions and industries in the region.  Dozens of graduate and undergraduate students will be trained to use the instrument at Carnegie Mellon.  Training for the larger research community is provided through an annual three-dimensional materials science summer school and findings from the instrument are being made available through two web-based repositories: the Three-Dimensional Materials Atlas and the Grain Boundary Data Archive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The xenon plasma focused ion beam microscope deployed in this research has made it possible to both image surfaces and to remove material from the same surfaces in a highly controlled fashion with nano-scale precision, but 50 times faster than with pre-existing instruments.  The key to high removal rates is the plasma ion source, which can achieve higher beam currents than the conventional liquid metal sources.  This has made it possible to conduct three-dimensional imaging experiments throughout large volumes and conduct site-specific analysis (by transmission electron microscopy or atom probe tomography) of features buried deep within a specimen that are not accessible to conventional liquid metal source microscopes.  The project's goals are to prepare samples with specialized geometries for imaging electronic devices under operating conditions by transmission electron microscopy, for high-throughput measurements of grain boundary mobility to study complex ion transitions, for the measurement of the grain boundary character and energy distributions of engineering materials, and for studying the influence of flaw types on stress corrosion cracking in high performance alloys.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ To meet the goals of this project, we acquired a Xe-ion plasma dual beam, focused ion beam (DB-FIB), scanning electron microscope (SEM).  This instrument makes it possible to both image solid materials with nanometer resolution and to remove materials in a very precise and controlled way.  This makes it possible to create nanometer scale shapes necessary for other experiments exploring the atomistic structure of materials and the mechanisms by which electronic devices and structural materials degrade.  It also makes it possible to section through a material, recording images at each layer, so that the three dimensional internal structure of the material can be visualized.  While instruments with this capability have existed for about 10 years, earlier instruments generated the ion beam with a liquid metal source.  With the new Xe-ion source, the ion current is much higher and the material removal rates are 50 times faster; this enables experiments that were not possible with the older technology.  This is the first instrument of its kind installed at a university in the United States.    During the one year period of this award, the instrument was acquired, installed, and researchers were trained on the use of the Xe-ion plasma FIB.  The capabilities have been tested by creating three dimensional orientation maps of Ni and Ti.  These metals are comprised of many individual, misoriented crystalline grains with micron scale dimensions.  The orientation maps recorded with the new microscope make it possible to understand the relationship between the grain boundary structure and the materials properties.  The instrument is part of a shared materials characterization open to the entire university research community.  The facility is used by approximately 250 researchers each year, including students at all levels and senior researchers.  To promote the use of the new instrument and disseminate findings, a summer school on three-dimensional materials science was organized.  There were 54 participants from industry, government labs, and other universities.            Last Modified: 09/26/2015       Submitted by: Gregory S Rohrer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
