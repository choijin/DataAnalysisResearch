<AbstractNarration>Two central challenges in nanomanufacturing are to generate complex nanopatterns over large areas without using electron beam lithography or similar approaches that are based on a serial writing method, and to generate them at low cost.  Large-area complex nanopatterns have enormous technological importance and many commercial applications impacting a broad range of multi-billion dollar industries.  However, currently, the most advanced lithography, which is the workhorse in semiconductor chip industry, is extremely expensive and is limited to a 12 inch diameter area, flat surfaces, and a period of about 30 nanometers.   This award supports research that explores new path-changing innovative approaches to provide solutions to the above two challenges. The research will uniquely combine knowledge and technologies from multiple disciplines to create large-area nanopatterning. It will lead to new knowledge and technologies in the fabrication of a broad range of large-area complex nanopatterns, and will provide materials and technologies to enable many fields of study and applications, such as, solar cells, solid state lighting, biotechnology, fuel cells, data storage, optical communication, semiconductor integrated circuits, and displays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To overcome the challenges in nanomanufacturing, the research will explore a new innovative path-changing approach, termed "multi-set nanopatterning" (MSN).  MSN can generate complex nanostructures over a large area without using electron beam lithography or similar serial writing methods. The approach comprises of three innovative nonconventional techniques and their creative superposition or multiple uses. They are (i) Fourier nanoimprint patterning, (ii) edge-guided nanopatterning, and (iii) nanostructure self-perfection. Each individual technique alone can create complex nanostructures that could not be generated before, but, when they are combined, they can generate far more complex nanopatterns over a large area at low cost. The research will explore the science and technology of each method and their combined use. Furthermore, the research will advance new approaches in nanoimprint mold duplication and will use large area nanoplasmonics and roll-to-roll nanoimprint as test-beds for technology development.</AbstractNarration>
