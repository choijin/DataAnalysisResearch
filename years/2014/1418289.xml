<AbstractNarration>Today the Internet constitutes a critical infrastructure: an attack or disruption has the potential to cause serious damage to institutions supporting key resources, such as water, power, transportation, finance, emergency response, business operations and manufacturing supply chains. Consequently, there is interest in a myriad of interdisciplinary approaches to achieve increased security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to conduct a 2.5-day workshop for 20-30 invited participants in order to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and potential solutions for a secure Internet. The workshop brings together experts in network design, cybersecurity, and policy, spanning industry, academia, and the government. The goal of the Ideas Lab is to explore pathways and find solutions for a secure Internet based on interdisciplinary approaches that take into account technology, social sciences, policy and education. The Ideas Lab will be coordinated by a five-member Steering Committee composed of leading experts and the PI. In addition, expert facilitators will be used to create a highly productive workshop that will be tailored to achieve the specific objective of finding solutions for a secure Internet.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Today, our lives are intimately connected to the Internet. This integration of life and network is ongoing. Indeed, while networks were originally used for computers and their users to communicate, we now have commonplace objects (such as measuring cups, light bulbs and tea kettles) that communicate with each other and with us. This trend is accelerating, leading to what is called the "Internet of Things".  Unfortunately, many networked systems, as well as the networks themselves, are vulnerable to attack or disruption.  Since the late 1980s we have seen attacks that affect thousands (and now 10s or 100s of thousands) of people and cause many millions of dollars in damage.  Over time we have come to realize that the problem of security in our networks and networked systems is a multidisciplinary problem, touching on policy issues, economic incentives, and public and business awareness and education, along with new technical challenges.  In mid-February 2014, the National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored a 2 and a half-day workshop centered on identifying high-impact actions that could be taken to better secure the Internet.  The workshop, the Cybersecurity Ideas Lab, brought together 35 invited experts in computer science, cybersecurity, economics, social science and policy.  These experts were drawn from industry, academia, and the government.  The workshop leveraged the NSF Ideas Lab process with a twist.  Where the typical Ideas Lab seeks to identify research ideas or thrusts, this workshop combined expert facilitators with a diverse set of experts to identify actionable ideas that would lead to a more secure Internet. The Ideas Lab was coordinated by a six-member Steering Committee.  The workshop participants generated a large number of ideas for high-impact actions that could potentially be adopted by cybersecurity researchers, policymakers or practitioners to advance cybersecurity. The workshop refined, combined and adapted these ideas to yield a practical working set of recommendations. The Steering Committee assembled and, through multiple review cycles, refined the ideas into the sixteen actionable recommendations presented below.

Some recommendations are cautionary and invite us to better understand the consequences of the choices we may make.  Most envision the Federal Government playing a key role, as a technology leader, a policy ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
