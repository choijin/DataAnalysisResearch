<AbstractNarration>CBET-1403447&lt;br/&gt;Malen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GOALI partnership between Carnegie-Melon University (CMU) and and Seagate Technology makes the research directly applicable to development of new technologies in the data storage industry.  The next generation of high-density storage will be enabled by laser-excited near field transducers (NFTs) that focus electromagnetic energy onto thermally-activated nanometer-scale magnetic bits.  Heat fluxes in excess of 100 times that present at the sun's surface at the functional end of an NFT can result in excessive operating temperatures.  Similar limitations pervade plasmonics used for chemical catalysis, bio-sensing, and steam generation.  Further, the proposed  in-situ measurement of the interface temperature will enable entirely new metrology of plasmonic structures, and represents a step towards near field thermoreflectance metrology. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The educational activities will expose students to industry-driven academic research through curriculum development, guest lectures and seminars, and potential internships at Seagate.  Seagate, in turn, will receive exposure at CMU through integration of the research topics and results within courses taught by the academic PIs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical objective of this GOALI proposal is to experimentally study tradeoffs in heat dissipation and optical performance at plasmonic interfaces modified by nanoscale adhesion layers. The interdisciplinary research team will study the nature of plasmonic resonance, electron-phonon coupling, and phonon transmission in metal-dielectric interfaces with metal adhesion layers. Open scientific questions include: how do adhesion layers influence the physics of phonon transmission across a metal-dielectric interface and plasmonic resonance at the interface? Can the temperature dependence of plasmonic resonance be used to make in-situ measurements of interface temperature and thermal properties? To answer these questions,  the research will investigate transport in prototypical Au/SiO2 and Au/AlN plasmonic interfaces with Cu, Ti, Al, Cr, and Be adhesion layers as a function of thickness from 1-5 nm. Relative to Au, these metals have successively better electron-phonon coupling and vibrational alignment with the dielectrics.  Thin film samples will be sputtered and imaged by TEM.  Thermal interface conductance will be measured using two independent pump-probe thermoreflectance techniques. Plasmonic response in waveguides incorporating the adhesion layers will be measured with near-field scanning optical microscopy.  A novel in-situ pump-probe measurement of the thermal properties and temperature of the metal-dielectric interface will be developed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This GOALI award supported studies of how heat moves accross metal/dielectric interfaces in the presence of thin adhesion metal adhesion layers that bridge the top metal contact and the dielectric material.  Intellectual Merit:  Three major contributions are summarized below.  1. We show that the use of subnanometer adhesion layers significantly enhances the thermal interface conductance at metal-dielectric interfaces.  Our measurements of thermal interface conductance at the metal/Al2O3 interface made using frequency-domain thermoreflectance show that a 1-nm-thick adhesion layer of Cu or Cr is sufficient to enhance the thermal interface conductance by more than a factor of 2 or 4, respectively, relative to the pure Au/Al2O3 interface.  This work was published in Physical Review Applied.  2. Due to interdiffusion, thin adhesion layers may alloy with top contacts.  Further, the thermal interface conductance of metal-alloy/dielectric interfaces have not been previously studied.  We present measurements of thermal interface conductance as a function of metal alloy composition. Composition spread alloy films of AuxCu1&minus;x and AuxPd1&minus;x solid solutions were deposited on single crystal sapphire substrates via dual electron-beam evaporation. High throughput measurements of thermal interface conductance across the (metal alloy)-sapphire interfaces were made by positional scanning of frequency domain thermoreflectance measurements to sample a continuum of Au atomic fractions (x &sim; 0 &rarr; 1).  We found a monotonic variation of thermal interface conductance between the pure metal endpoints in these solid solutions.  An open question for future work is how intermediate phases will impact thermal interface conductance.  This work was published in Physical Review B.  3. We have more directly probed the influence of interdiffusion of adhesion layers on thermal interface conductance by applying accelarated aging studies of thin Cu adhesion layers at the Au/Al2O3 interface.  These accelarated aging studies utilize high temperature treatment to drive interdiffusion and parallel depth profiling by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and interface conductance measurements by frequency domain thermoreflectance.
