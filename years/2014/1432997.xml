<AbstractNarration>The investigators propose to create a method to teach and measure the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) professional skills in the form of an undergraduate group learning intervention called the curricular debrief (CD) method. No direct method for teaching and measuring the simultaneous presence of these skills, which are now generally recognized as the standard in the undergraduate engineering education field, has existed in the literature prior to the CD method &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will expand, empirically study, and refine the CD method and Engineering Professional Skills Rubric (EPS), which is the accompanying measurement instrument. The primary research goal is to determine the instructional and educational impacts of the integration of the CD method into freshman to senior level courses across the undergraduate curricula.. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ongoing research conducted at WSU to establish the initial reliability and validity of the CD method has shown its potential for significant nationwide impact. Yet, more research is needed to provide strong evidence that the CD method as a performance task and the EPS Rubric as a measurement instrument are reliable and valid. This study's primary research goal is to rigorously establish the reliability and validity of the CD method and the EPS Rubric. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A descriptive collective case study methodology and a randomized design will be used. This methodology will allow the investigators to establish efficacy and validity while understanding the contexts in which parallel performance tasks are implemented in three distinct sites and four distinct course-type settings. The settings are WSU, the University of Idaho, and Norwich University in Vermont. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will directly contribute to fundamental research in engineering education on a problem of national importance and interest---how the nation can prepare future engineers with the skills they need for work in a global context.</AbstractNarration>

The Engineering Professional Skills Assessment (EPSA) is a direct method and measurement tool designed to be used by engineering education practitioners to elicit and measure five of the ABET non-technical skills simultaneously for program-level assessment. The EPSA is a performance assessment, conceptualized to be both a facilitator and a direct measure of the ABET EAC Criterion 3 Student Outcomes f, g, h, i and j.

The goal of this study was to establish the reliability and validity of the method and of the inferences and uses made based on EPSA Rubric scores for program-level assessment purposes. Data were collected from three disciplinarily distinct engineering programs from sophomore to senior levels in both technical and design courses from Norwich University, the University of Idaho and Washington State University. The study?s two overarching research questions were:  To what extent does the EPSA as a performance task equally elicit students? consideration of engineering professional skills when implemented in different course types and at different points in a program?s curriculum? Do EPSA Rubric scores reliably provide information about students? engineering professional skills proficiency levels?   This multi-year three-site reliability and validity study determined (1) accuracy of measurement of student group performance by evaluators using the EPSA Rubric as a criterion-referenced instrument; (2) comparability between parallel performance tasks; and (3) calibration of the EPSA Rubric with established rubrics that purport to measure similar constructs.  The EPSA was designed to be practical, useful, and relevant, as well as to address a set of common constraints faced by engineering education practitioners. These constraints were that the method should (1) elicit and measure the ABET EAC Criterion 3 non-technical outcomes directly and simultaneously; (2) be used at any level of the curriculum, in any course; (3) engage (i.e., seem meaningful/relevant) both students and faculty; (4) be used for both course and program-level assessment purposes; and (5) be cost-effective and relatively easy to implement.
