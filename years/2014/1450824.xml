<AbstractNarration>This award is made by the Instrument Development for Biological Research program (IDBR)in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI; BIO Directorate).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cerebral cortex, the outer layer of brain, has greatly expanded in surface are during mammalian evolution. This cortical region is parcellized into discrete functional areas including visual cortex, motor cortex, and language areas. These brain areas act in concert to support behavior. Although we have learned much about how to ascribe function to particular brain areas, we know little about the cellular mechanisms by which this concert is conducted. Model systems, including mice have discrete functional areas in their brains. However, the current tools that neuroscientists have for investigating activity in brains are limited to either a sparse sampling of neurons distributed over large areas, or a large density of neurons in a single area just 500-700 microns across. Thus, it is tremendously difficult to make progress in understanding how cortical areas act in concert to support behavior. The proposed research project will develop a new type of microscope which will be able to detect single neuron spiking across a field of view of several millimeters. This area can encompass five or more cortical areas in a mouse. In addition, this microscope will contain high speed spotlights for simultaneously imaging neuronal activity in multiple cortical areas. This time resolution is crucial for understanding the information neurons encode, their dynamics during behavior, and their connectivity. A community of scientists across the US and the globe will be cultivated to disseminate the research, aid in its implementation, and accelerate collaborative progress in neuroscience. Workshops will also be held to train scientists in advanced optics and neuroscience. Ultimately, this project will provide new technology that is crucial for the BRAIN Initiative, and will foster a broader scientific community for further progress in the field of two-photon imaging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will develop a two photon (2p) imaging system with a wide field-of-view (FOV) (~ 3 mm) and cellular resolution across the full FOV. To ensure high temporal resolution of recorded activity, they will also develop multiplexed beams that image brain regions within the FOV at high speed. These multiplexed beams can be dynamically reconfigured to target different areas within the full FOV, like spotlights. The approach is to model the full system and create optimized optical subassemblies, including a custom objective. The team will make calculated engineering tradeoffs to preserve cellular resolution while still achieving a wide FOV. High speed scanning will be developed using resonant scanners and photon counting electronics. This system is scalable, as the beam multiplexing can be modularized, and multiple modules can be stacked to increase the number of beams, so long as the fluorescence lifetime is shorter than the interval between laser pulses. Thus, the Trepan2p (Twin-Region, Panoramic 2p), will enable direct measurements of cross-correlations and moment-to-moment, dynamics in extended brain networks. This technology will enable previously impossible experiments, imaging neuronal activity with single cell resolution across extended neuronal circuitry in an array of model systems including mice and primates.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Neuroscientists need to measure brain function in order to reverse engineer it. Techniques like electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offer non-invasive measures of neural activity across the entire brain, but they are low resolution. They can help localize brain functions to particular areas, but EEG and fMRI cannot resolve the activity of individual neurons. By contrast, two-photon microscopy can resolve the activity of individual neurons, but the field-of-view is only a fraction of a hair width&rsquo;s across. This is a serious limitation because multiple parts of the brain, which can be millimeters apart even in a mouse, work in concert to guide behavior. Thus, it is impossible to fully reverse engineer the brain with such a small field-of-view. It is like listening to just one side of a telephone conversation, or viewing a scene with horse blinders on. We had recently developed new technology to create a large field-of-view two-photon microscope that maintains high resolution to resolve individual neurons. We designed and built new optical systems and laser scanning strategies to enable this technology.

We used the funds from this grant to further increase the field-of-view, resolution, and imaging speed. We surpassed our goals for this project. The improved systems we developed increased the field-of-view to 4 mm across, over which individual neuron activity can be resolved at every location. This is 50-100 times larger in area than prior two-photon imaging systems. Moreover, we used beam multiplexing to simultaneously and rapidly (up to 60 frames per second per area, 120 frames per second total) image neurons in multiple parts of the brain. This technology, developed in this grant, has provided unprecedented views into ongoing neural activity.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/04/2016<br>      Modified by: Spencer&nbsp;Smith</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
