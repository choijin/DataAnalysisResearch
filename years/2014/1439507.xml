<AbstractNarration>This grant will support six meetings of Appalachian Set Theory (AST) workshop series, with the first one planned for December 2014. These are two-day conferences focuses primarily at graduate students and aiming at presenting cutting edge developments in the discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Appalachian Set Theory (AST) workshop series ran initially for the period 2006-2012, supported by NSF grants DMS-0631446 and DMS-0903845.   We propose to continue this innovative workshop series. We will hold two workshops per year, each devoted to a single topic such as a broadly applicable method, a complex seminal paper or a significant unpublished theorem. Faculty and students who are not experts will be immersed in the subject for one or two intensive days and get the tools they need to continue on their own. Each workshop will be led by one or two experts. NSF funds will be used to cover the workshop leaders' expenses, and to provide support for those wishing to attend who do not have other sources of funding. After each workshop graduate student assistants will be paid to prepare typed notes, with help from the workshop leader or leaders: these notes will be promptly disseminated online. Most of the workshop notes for the period 2006-2012 are collected in the volume "Appalachian Set Theory 2006-2012" (Cambridge University Press). In planning these workshops, special emphasis will be given to encouraging participation by young mathematicians and mathematicians from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Set theory is the study of infinite structures, for example infinite trees and infinite graphs. It is connected with many other areas of mathematical research, for example analysis and topology.  "Appalachian set theory" is a series of workshops with two main goals:  Expose junior researchers to important developments in the area of set theory, so that they can use these ideas in their own research. Bring together researchers in set theory at all levels of seniority, with a view to fostering collaboration and building a sense of community.   Seven workshops were held during the grant period. The workshops covered a wide range of topics in set theory. Each one was led by a world expert in the workshop topic. The workshop leaders made a strong effort to make some highly technical mathematics accessible to the participants, and also to motivate the workshop topic by setting it in context and showing how the main ideas can be applied.  NSF funds were used to cover travel expenses for the participants. Funding priority was given to junior researchers with no other source of funding.  The workshops were well attended. The bulk of the participants were junior researchers, but the audiences included participants at all levels of seniority. Slides and notes for several of the workshops are available online.
