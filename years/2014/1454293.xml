<AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant will build a methodology for the fabrication of free-standing, three-dimensional (3D), functionalized, graphene structures. 3D graphene structures have been of great interest in the last few years because of their unique properties and behaviors, which are different from two-dimensional (2D) graphene nanosheets. 3D graphene structures can lead to applications in optics, electronics, optoelectronics, and biomedical devices, which cannot be realized with 2D graphene structures. One of the useful characteristics of graphene-based materials is tunability of their physical and chemical properties through functionalization. Currently, functionalization of 3D graphene-based materials does not exist, because conventional lithographic techniques such as electron beam lithography, photolithography, and nanoimprint lithography are 2D methods which allow patterning and functionalizing only on planar substrates. This research plan seeks to develop nanomanufacturing processes and demonstrate that 3D polyhedral graphene structures can be realized with individually functionalized graphene nanosheets on each face of the 3D structures. The impact of the proposed work is the discovery of knowledge that can be harnessed in developing next-generation 3D nanoelectronics, 3D multi-channel filtering devices, and nanomedical sensors beneficial to human health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this award is to demonstrate the unique properties of 3D graphene materials not observed in 2D graphene nanosheets. The heterogeneous 3D functionalization will be accomplished through doping and surface patterning on the 3D structures, which will alter the physical and chemical properties of the 3D nanostructures, leading to a new generation of 3D devices. The specific research interests and CAREER objectives encompass the following: (a) develop a self-assembly and folding processes to transform 2D structures into 3D devices, overcoming the limitations of the conventional lithographic processes and allowing for the creation of free-standing 3D graphene-based (graphene and graphene oxide) polyhedral and nanotube arrays; (b) realize heterogeneous functionalization on the 3D graphene structures, with each graphene-based membrane defining each face of the 3D polyhedron structure and functionalized for specific functionalities; (c) apply the self-assembly process in the development of 3D graphene-based sensors and devices. This work will contribute to solving major problems with using 2D materials and bring significant advances in the development of next-generation nano-enabled devices.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>There are two project outcomes obtained during the submission period:&nbsp;06/01/2020 to 11/30/2020.</p> <p>First, our research has introduced the concept of three-dimensional (3D) hybridized plasmon modes in 3D graphene nanostructure (cylindrical structures) which was realized by a self-assembly process (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). While 2D graphene currently used for conventional plasmonic devices can only demonstrate bi-directional coupling of the two edges through its surface, the 3D graphene nanocylinders benefit from unique hybridized plasmon modes through simultaneous in-plane coupling and out-of-plane coupling, which yields an edge mode as well as a radially coupled mode at the small diameter openings (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). The hybridized plasmon modes induced in the 3D graphene nanocylinder significantly amplifies the limited plasmon response in 2D graphene nanoribbons. The curvature introduced in the graphene through a plasma-triggered self-assembly process offers near-field enhancements that are 4 orders of magnitude stronger than in planar 2D ribbons. The distinct 3D modes provide an insight into geometry-dependent coupled plasmon modes and their ability to achieve non-surface-limited (volumetric) field enhancements. Furthermore, this study shows that the intensity and types of modes induced can be directly controlled by the degree of curvature in the graphene nanocylinders. For the characterization of the 3D plasmon modes, synchrotron nanospectroscopy measurements were performed, which provides the first evidence of preservation of hybridized 3D graphene plasmons induced in well-defined 3D graphene nanostructures (<strong>Figure 3</strong>). The measurements demonstrate an over two orders of magnitude confinement in 3D graphene and provide a route to image the highly enhanced radially coupled plasmon modes. Given the unique properties of 3D graphene plasmons alongside the distinct advantages of a cylindrical morphology, the 3D graphene cylinders can be beneficial for a wide array of technologies such as (i) Optofluidic channels with volumetric fields for non-diffusion-limited sensing of targeted molecules and the preservation of physiological functions such as cell mitosis, (ii) optical chiral plasmonics through twisted cylinder design, and (iii) superior propagation length waveguides. &nbsp;The unique 3D plasmonic modes and advantages demonstrated by 3D graphene nanocylinders will spark further interest in the exploration of other geometrical incarnations of 2D materials for the realization of unique optoelectronic properties and applications. This result has been published in Small [1].</p> <p>Second, we have studied a self-assembly technology that uses controllable electron irradiation in a SEM to generate tunable inhomogeneous stress in the homogenous polymer thin films for doing reversible and repeatable origami-like self-assembly. This study introduces a reversible and repeatable self-assembly that offers the capability to repeatedly tune the stress gradient in a polymer thin film for altering the deformation direction and further realizing reversible assembly (<strong>Figure 4</strong>). The mechanism is based on irradiation induced degradation of polymer and subsequent inhomogeneous volume change in a released PMMA layer. As the volume change highly depends on the absorbed irradiation energy, the ununiform distribution of absorbed energy creates a stress gradient along depth of polymer thin film, leading to self-assembly. Further, by tuning the voltage of applied electron irradiation, the energy distribution and stress gradient can be precisely and repeatedly programmed, allowing reversible assembly <strong>(Figure 5</strong>). The mechanism and effective factors of irradiation induced PMMA shrinkage and subsequent assembly are investigated in this manuscript, which not only lays a solid foundation to fabricate complex polymer architectures but also opens the possibility to build micro and nano scale soft robots.
