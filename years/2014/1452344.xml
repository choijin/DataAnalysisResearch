<AbstractNarration>The global water cycle is connected to the Earth's deep interior through plate tectonics. Hydrous minerals within oceanic crust carry the components of water (H2O) into the mantle at convergent plate boundaries, having influence on melt generation and volcanism as part of a cycle that returns H2O to the surface repeatedly over geologic time. How deeply the water cycle extends into the Earth's mantle is not known. However, evidence is mounting that certain mantle minerals such as ringwoodite, found in a layer called the transition zone (410-660 km depth), may contain a significant -if not the largest- geochemical reservoir of H2O in the planet. The presence of just a few weight percent H2O bound in minerals of the transition zone would constitute more water than is present in the oceans. Determining the scale and distribution of H2O in the mantle has implications for understanding the geochemical water cycle, deep melt generation, and determining the Earth's composition and origin of Earth's water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study combines mineral physics experiments on laboratory-grown, hydrated mantle materials at high pressures and high temperatures with new and forthcoming regional seismic studies emanating from NSF's Earthscope (USArray) to constrain the scale and distribution of water in the Earth's mantle transition zone. At deep mantle conditions, water is no longer found in the familiar liquid form, but rather bound as hydroxyl (OH) through charge-coupled chemical substitutions in the crystal structure of high-pressure silicates. Hydrous melts may also be present at depths where the H2O storage capacity of minerals such as bridgmanite is relatively low. Experimental techniques including GHz-ultrasonic interferometry at Northwestern University and Brillouin scattering at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, will be employed to measure the influence of hydration on the elastic properties of mantle minerals such as wadsleyite, ringwoodite, and majoritic garnet, as well as on silicate glasses. Those results will be used to build a publically-available thermoelastic database, which provides input such as elastic moduli and their pressure-temperature derivatives needed to forward model expected seismic velocities in the mantle as a function of depth, temperature, and water content. Combined with observations from regional-scale seismic studies of the mantle, the results will be used to infer the mantle hydration state beneath North America and more globally as high-resolution seismic data become available.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project examined the role of high-pressure minerals in Earth?s mantle in the global water cycle. H2O, while largely liquid, ice, and vapor on the Earth?s surface, can be incorporated into rocks and minerals within their crystal structures. The mineral brucite, Mg(OH)2, for example, contains the ingredients of water in the solid form. In the mantle transition zone, at 410-660 km depth, high-pressure forms of the mineral olivine can incorporate several weight percent of H2O into their crystal structures. Because the transition zone constitutes roughly 7% of the Earth?s mass, a large geochemical reservoir of ?water? could be contained in the mantle and act to form silicate melts during convection and plate tectonics. This study focused on understanding how water, incorporated into high-pressure minerals stable in the transition zone, influences physical properties such as density, and the speed of seismic waves. By directly synthesizing such minerals and measuring their physical properties, the measured influence of water was used to infer the water content of the mantle transition zone from geophysical observations such as seismic wave speeds and imaging melts. It was discovered that while hydration reduces seismic wave speeds at low pressures, at higher pressures of the transition zone, the difference between hydrous and anhydrous minerals diminishes, making their detection more difficult. However, because minerals in the transition zone can incorporate more water than minerals above and below the transition zone, mass transfer during convection can cause hydrous melts to form, which would be more easily observable by seismic imaging techniques. The elastic properties of silicate glasses, mimicking such hydrous melts, were evaluated at high pressures and it was found that they exhibit higher wave speeds than previously thought, suggesting that previous estimates for the degree of partial melting in some regions of the upper mantle may be overestimated. Small amounts of water, in the form of brucite, were discovered inside natural inclusions of diamonds originating from as deep as 1000 km, suggesting that the global water cycle extends further into the mantle than previously thought. In the very deepest regions of the mantle, near the core-mantle boundary, theoretical studies showed that partial melts could originate from dehydration of the mineral post-perovskite transforming into the mineral bridgmanite, which could explain the origin of elevated water contents in certain ocean-island basalts. In general, water moves between the crust mantle system through plate tectonics, subduction, and convection. High-pressure minerals and hydrous silicate melts in the Earth?s mantle appear to play an important role in the global water cycle on geologic time scales.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/07/2019<br>      Modified by: Steven&nbsp;D&nbsp;Jacobsen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1452344/1452344_10345967_1559882381082_Jacobsen_EarthSection_With_Text_Wide--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1452344/1452344_10345967_1559882381082_Jacobsen_EarthSection_With_Text_Wide--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Cross Section of Earth's Interior"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1452344/1452344_10345967_1559882381082_Jacobsen_EarthSection_With_Text_Wide--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Cross Section of Earth's Interior"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematic cross section of Earth's interior showing the location of the mantle transition zone (blue layer) at 410-660 km depth.
