<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on a set of far-from-equilibrium phenomena in fluids that seemingly defy our intuition.  There are six specific goals: (i) to understand the mechanism of how a liquid drop splashes when it hits a dry solid substrate.  It was found that the removal of the ambient air can completely suppress a drop's ability to splash; (ii) to study how the viscous-fingering instability, which occurs as a less viscous fluid displaces a more viscous one in a thin gap between two flat plates, changes its fundamental nature when the stabilizing force, the surface tension, is removed.  It was found that, instead of becoming more unstable, it can stop fingering completely; (iii) to understand how fluid drops coalesce when they merge inside an outer fluid.  It was found that the viscosity of the outer fluid often plays an insignificant role in the dynamics;  (iv) to measure the dynamics of a Leidenfrost drop.  Such drops float on a layer of their own vapor; (v) to study how energy is dissipated in the collision between two clusters of particles.  The energy is rapidly lost as jamming fronts sweep across the clusters;  (vi) to investigate a new form of memory that is stored in the transient behavior of a fluid before it reaches its final steady state.  Such memories initially remember all inputs but then lose the ability to remember them even as they are continually applied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three distinct aspects of broader impacts that will be addressed:  (i) The phenomena addressed have important implications for technological processes; (ii) Bringing young scientists, from high-school students to postdocs, into research will remain a high priority;  (iii) Bringing the fascination with cutting-edge science to the general public, including working with museums, will continue to be pursued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to investigate fluids that are in states far-from-equilibrium. The first topic is to understand the mechanism whereby removing the ambient air can completely suppress a drop's ability to splash.  A second topic is to study how the viscous-fingering instability in the Hele-Shaw geometry becomes more stable when the stabilizing force, the surface tension, is removed.  A third project will be to understand how fluid drops coalesce when they merge inside an outer fluid.  In a fourth experiment, the dynamics of a Leidenfrost drop will be investigated.  A fifth experiment studies how energy is dissipated in the collision between two clusters of particles.  Finally, a new form of memory that can be stored in the transient behavior of a fluid before it reaches its final steady state will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three distinct aspects of broader impacts that will be addressed:  (i) Applications:  the phenomena addressed have important implications for technological processes; (ii) Education and Training: bringing young scientists, from high-school students to postdocs, into research will remain a high priority;  (iii)  Outreach: bringing the fascination with cutting-edge science to the general public, including working with museums, will continue to be pursued.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     This project has investigated several surprising phenomena discovered in far-from-equilibrium fluids. These include the counter-intuitive behavior discovered in the physics of splashing - in particular attempting to understand the mechanism whereby removing the ambient air can completely suppress a drop's ability to splash.   Another example is a study of how the viscous fingering instability changes its fundamental nature when the stabilizing force - the surface tension - is removed. Instead of becoming less stable as one would predict, it can stop fingering completely.  Understanding this behavior required investigating the three-dimensional structure of the fluid layer.  In addition, when the fluids diffuse into one another, there is an unexpected transition between two distinct regimes of fingering behavior.    In a study of forced wetting, new structures were discovered in to thin gap of air that is entrained as the substrate is forced into a liquid bath.  Similar structure was found in de-wetting phenomena as well indicating the ubiquity of these formations.    By applying new techniques, this project also investigated the geometry and dynamics of a Leidenfrost drop.  In this situation, a drop floats on a layer of its own vapor if the substrate is hot enough.  This prevents the drop from touching the surface and evaporating rapidly.  Using interferometric techniques, we were able to map out the underside of the drop where it forms a dome that holds the trapped gas.  The project has also investigated how memories can be stored in the transient behavior of a fluid before it reaches its final steady state.   This experiment represents a new class of memory encoding phenomena that can be observed in materials.  A similar phenomenon was discovered in athermal disordered systems  where they can exhibit a remarkable response to an applied oscillatory shear: After a relatively few shearing cycles, the system falls into a configuration that had already been visited in a previous cycle. After this point the system repeats its dynamics periodically despite undergoing many particle rearrangements during each cycle. As the pressure is lowered, we found that it becomes more common for the system to find periodic states where it takes multiple cycles before returning to a previously visited state. Thus, there is a proliferation of longer periods as the jamming point is approached.  The idea of studying these phenomena as forms of memory opens up many questions as to what constitutes a memory in a solid and how to classify all of them under some common rubric.
