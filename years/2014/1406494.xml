<AbstractNarration>The award funds a conference "Groups, Computation, and Geometry" at Pingree Park, a campus of Colorado State University, June 9-13, 2014. Building on the successes of an earlier conference, held at the same location in 2004, the broad goal of the meeting is to bring together researchers in the closely related fields of computational group theory and finite geometries. The scientific content of the conference is designed to explore known and emerging connections between a broad range of topics, including scientific computing, combinatorics, group theory, and theoretical computer science, with a view both to providing answers to open theoretical questions and to investigating practical applications.  Historically, the interplay between practical and theoretical concerns has led to advances on both fronts, and cross-paradigm collaboration of this type will feature prominently at the conference. Further programming details may be found at the conference website: http://www.math.colostate.edu/~hulpke/pingree/index.html.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Group theory is often described as the algebraic study of symmetry in the abstract.  Group theory arises and is used in a wide variety of other fields, including solid state physics, chemistry (crystallography), coding theory, and cryptography.  Geometry has always played a crucial role in understanding the structure of groups, and over the last forty years machine computations have been increasingly important to developments in both fields.  The subject of the conference is the interaction between theoretical questions concerning groups and geometries and algorithmic questions arising from extensive machine computation with these fundamental objects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The broad theme of the conference was to bring together two communities of researchers working in the theory and applications of the mathematics behind high capacity and reliable communication, the mathematics of modeling symmetries in chemistry and computer networks, and a range of related phenomena.  Despite their close connections, these researchers had only organized a joint conferenceonce before in 2004. The outcome of that conference exceeded expectations and the 10 year follow up continued and expanded upon the success of the first.   The conference was attended by both US and international leaders in the fields in both mathematics and computer science.  This made the interactions truly interdisciplinary with talks ranging from theoretical models to concrete algorithms, and computer assisted classifications.   Through the conference grant funds we were able to defray the costs for all graduate students and young researchers and also, on a need basis, provide financial assistance to other researchers to offset their travel costs.  A particular priority of the conferenceorganizers was to encourage participation by younger researchers and under-represented groups.     At the conclusion it was noted by members of both research groups that such joint conferences are incredibly useful in highlighting current progress and bottlenecks that go unnoticed by the complementary groups.  Future and more frequent joint conferences were encouraged.          Last Modified: 06/29/2015       Submitted by: James Wilson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
