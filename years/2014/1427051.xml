<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Georgia (UGA) located in Athens, GA, and Clark Atlanta University (CAU), in Atlanta, GA, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2014- 2018. This 14-year old program, begun as a partnership between UGA and CAU, focuses on genomics, computational biology, and epigenetics -- and their integration in the new area of systems biology.  Participants are expected to do full-time lab research as well as participate in seminars and various workshops, such as the responsible conduct of science, systems biology, molecular genetics research, career opportunities in industry and academia, and the graduate school application process. REU participants have access to a rich array of individual mentor's facilities as well as many interdepartmental laboratories and centers with core facilities for mass spectrometry, microarray analysis, next generation sequencing, nuclear magnetic resonance, etc. Mentors are drawn from a variety of departments including Genetics, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Computer Science, Physics and Astronomy, Plant Biology, and Plant Pathology. The program's recruitment effort is through http://www.genetics.uga.edu/FGCB and visits to the Atlanta University Center of Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, and Spellman College as well as Fort Valley State University. Participants are selected based on academic record, research performance, and potential for outstanding research in genomics, computational biology, and epigenetics by a committee of faculty mentors from UGA and CAU. Student participants are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Success of the program will be assessed by various means, including use of the REU common assessment (SALG URSSA). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site is designed to increase participation of under-represented groups in graduate study in the biological, physical, and mathematical sciences. It is expected that at least 50 students, many from underrepresented groups and from colleges with limited opportunities for research, will be trained over the 5 years of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://www.genetics.uga.edu/FGCB , or by contacting the PI (Dr. Jonathan Arnold at arnold@uga.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. David Logan at dlogan@cau.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The three goals of National Science Foundation Project 1427051, Collaborative Research: Genomics and Computational Biology, were to engage underrepresented students of Clark Atlanta University (CAU) in STEM disciplines in modern research during a ten-week summer REU program at the University of Georgia, Athens and to mentor and engage at least one student after their summer experience in hands-on laboratory research during the academic year at CAU.  The final goal was to have the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) participants enter STEM graduate or professional school and develop a career in science.  The students were exposed to molecular and biochemical approaches to investigating cellular behavior in a modern research laboratory setting at UGA.  By working in the CAU laboratory during the academic year the students were afforded an opportunity to build on some of the skills they were exposed to during the summer REU program at UGA.  At the end of the project period (2014-2020), five of the nine students who participated in the program are matriculating in either dental, veterinary, medical or doctoral programs at the University of Georgia-Athens, University of Alabama-Birmingham, Morehouse School of Medicine, Meharry Medical College and Tuskegee University. The collaborative efforts of Jonathan Arnold of UGA and David A. Logan of CAU with support of NSF have provided a research and mentoring experience for underrepresented students which helped them successfully develop a career in science.
