<AbstractNarration>The Fourth Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) will take place on January 14 2015, as part of the flagship programming language conference, Principles of Programming Languages (POPL), which will be held in Mumbai, India. This grant will support approximately 20 students to attend the PLMW event plus the POPL conference. While there is other funding available (through ACM SIGPLAN PAC) for students who are presenting papers at POPL, this proposal is intended specifically to increase the numbers of students from underrepresented groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents. The broader significance and importance of the grant relate to the need to broaden participation, provide opportunities for students to receive mentoring from leading members of the programming languages community, and build the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in this important research area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Attending a conference can be a transformative experience for a young researcher: it exposes them to cutting-edge topics and introduces them to leading members of the community. Hence, encouraging student attendance at conferences is critical for promoting the development of the next generation of researchers. In January 2015, the premier conference on the foundations of programming languages (POPL) was held in Mumbai, India. Historically, the participation of women and underrepresented minorities at POPL, and in computer science in general, has been low. A goal of the Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) is to help change this statistic by encouraging women and underrepresented minorities to become members of the programming language research community by providing mentorship and an introduction to the world of research to potential students and beginning PhD students abroad. This project provided financial support to bring students to PLMW and POPL to learn about current problems and interact with leading researchers. The talks are posted online as a resource for anyone who was unable to attend the workshop and is considering or just beginning a career in academia or programming languages. Furthermore, data from this event was used to improve future PLMWs, especially with respect to the aforementioned goal of increasing attendence of women and underrepresented minorites.
