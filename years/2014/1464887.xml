<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor John Brennan of Rutgers University probes the fundamental chemistry of the actinide elements combined with the chalcogens sulfur, selenium, and tellurium, including the synthesis and characterization of both molecular and nanoscale materials. An understanding of how actinides interact with these chalcogens improves our ability to separate actinide ions in nuclear fuel reprocessing and environmental waste remediation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project begins with the synthesis and characterization of select molecular actinide compounds with a variety of chalcogenolate ligands. A series of molecules with potential covalent bonding character are targeted in order to evaluate how the metal, oxidation state, chalcogenolate, and Lewis base donors influence structure and bonding. These will serve as model systems for theoretical calculations to uncover the nature of the bonding and to predict the chemical reactivity in actinide systems. The molecular products are used as starting materials in the low-temperature synthesis of nanoscale actinide clusters and solid-state materials. Both ionic (oxide, fluoride) and covalent (sulfide, selenide, telluride) ligands are incorporated into cluster cores, with chalcogenolate ligands that cap the cluster surface and inhibit the formation of solid-state products. The relationships between the electronic and magnetic properties of actinide molecules, nanoscale clusters, and solid-state materials are defined by measurements on these molecular chalcogenolate and nanoscale products. The multidisciplinary nature of this work affords undergraduate and graduate students an entr√©e to a range of potential career paths.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A team of chemists at Rutgers University has explored the chemistry of the actinide (An) elements bound to the chalcogens (E) sulfur (S), selenium (Se), and tellurium (Te).  Actinides are the least understood elements in the periodic chart, in part because they are particularly complicated but also because they are radioactive and thus difficult to work with.  The fundamental understanding gained from this work will improve our ability to separate actinide ions in nuclear fuel reprocessing and environmental waste remediation.  A wide variety of molecular actinide chalcogenolate (ER; R = C6H5 or C6F5)  compounds were prepared.  These molecules are model systems for theoretical methods that both describe the nature of bonding and predict chemical reactivity in actinide systems.  Because the An-E bond is unstable and readily replaced, these molecules are also chemically useful as starting materials in the low-temperature synthesis of nanoscale actinide clusters and solid-state materials.   A range of nanoscale actinide clusters were prepared.  Both ionic (oxide) and covalent (sulfide, selenide) ligands were incorporated into cluster cores, with chalcogenolate or iodide ligands capping the cluster surface.  These surface ligands also suppress reorganizations at the atomic level that would lead to the formation of insoluble solid-state products.  While a detailed picture of how these materials behave as we go from one to ten to a hundred metal ions will take years to assemble, the foundation for this understanding has been set. To date the work has led to surprising chemical reactivity, novel molecular structures, and unusual physical properties.  Chalcogenido compounds with two, four, six, and eight metals were isolated.  A series of bi-metallic compounds were systematically prepared, and structural characterization of these dimers, coupled with DFT calculations, reveal that covalent bonding contributions have a significant impact on bond lengths.  More extensively studied was a group of (pyridine)8An4E4(ER)8 cubane clusters - compounds with an An4E4 core surrounded by pyridines, with ER that bond to either one or two An.  Chemical routes to every possible combination E/EC6F5/EC6H5 (E = S, Se) ligands were established, the solution structures were clearly defined, and found to be remarkably rigid.  With an atomic distribution of chalcogens already achieved, the heterochalcogen compounds with both S and Se [An4S4(SePh)8 and An4Se4(SPh)4] were converted to novel solid-state materials at relatively low temperatures.     Increasingly large chalcogenido clusters were subsequently prepared, including compounds with S2- and Se2- that are totally encapsulated by An ions, in either four coordinate tetrahedral or six coordinate octahedral environments.  The latter is found in a limited number of solid-state compounds (i.e. USe) but is unprecedented in molecular An chemistry.  Similar progress building clusters with oxo (O2-) ligands was achieved.  After exploring a series of potential starting materials, it became clear that EO2 was the best source of oxo ligands.  Here, both bimetallic molecules and clusters with six metals have been isolated.   Related fluoride chemistry has also been explored, generating a series of remarkably simple, fundamentally important, and potentially useful molecules with actinide-fluorine bonds.  There is a clear tendency to form molecules rather than clusters or solid-state materials thus far, but this predisposition can be overcome by replacing the pyridine solvent with less basic solvents such as acetonitrile or THF.
