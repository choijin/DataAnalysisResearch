<AbstractNarration>The U.S. National Committee for Psychology (USNC) represents the U.S. psychological science community to the International Union of Psychological Science (IUPsyS) on behalf of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The USNC/IUPsyS provides a valuable network through which the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the NAS enhance their capacity to contribute to global research in the psychological sciences. It is also a vehicle through which the NAS can reach out to the U.S. scientific community through international activities that are designed to enhance opportunities for psychological scientists both nationally and internationally, thus helping to create a diverse and globally-oriented U.S. scientific workforce and to position the United States to benefit from global investment in science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S participation in IUPsyS fulfills a unique role in the national science infrastructure. It provides a forum for dialogue between U.S. scientists and foreign colleagues, fosters research cooperation and collaboration by sponsoring conferences and workshops on topics of interest, initiates pilot/demonstration projects for bilateral or regional research collaborations, and organizes travel grant programs for young scientists and scientists from underrepresented backgrounds in the U.S. to participate in international scientific congresses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported U.S. participation in the International Union of Psychological Sciences (IUPsyS) through the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and its U.S. National Committee for IUPsyS (USNC-IUPsyS), housed in the Board on International Scientific Organizations (BISO).  Since its inception in 1951, the IUPsyS has emphasized the promotion of international scientific programs, capacity building and training, international research cooperation, and has championed the consideration of psychological science as an important tool to understand the world.  Working with U.S. psychological societies, the USNC-IUPsyS manages U.S. participation in the union, and facilitates the participation of the U.S. scientific community in its programs.  Intellectual merit  A key role for the NAS and the USNC-IUPsyS is to be active in the programs and governance of the union, including its quadrennial International Congress of Psychology (ICP) and biennial General Assemblies.  U.S. delegates to the IUPsyS General Assemblies in 2016 (Yokohama, Japan) and 2018 (Montreal, Canada) provided input concerning the new IUPsyS strategic plan, and participated in decisions regarding the union?s scientific programs, international awards, and governance.  In addition, in collaboration with the American Psychological Association (APA), the USNC-IUPsyS nominated keynote speakers, and organized scientific sessions such as the Science of Violence invited symposium at the 2016 ICP.  The USNC-IUPsyS and APA also collaborated on a travel award program for students and early career scientists for the 2016 ICP.  These efforts broaden the reach of U.S. science by expanding opportunities to present and discuss U.S. research and develop international connections.  Within the U.S., the USNC organized an invitational workshop, Psychology in a Globalizing World, held at Pace University (New York City) in July 2017. Participants represented 17 psychological science organizations ranging in membership from hundreds to over 100,000 scientists. The society representatives discussed many aspects of psychological science in an international context. Specific topics included the roles of U.S. scientists and their organizations in a global context, how to encourage early career scientists to see their work in this context, establishment and nurturing of scientific relationships with far-flung collaborators and recognition of their contributions, representativity of populations when studying psychological phenomena, open science, data sharing, and replicability. The workshop allowed the societies to discuss topics germane to their societies and their practices, and use some of the ideas generated at the workshop in the development of their own activities.  Broader impact  Prior to 2018, IUPsyS was a member of two broader organizations:  the International Council for Science (ICSU) and the International Social Sciences Council (ISSC).  In 2018, ICSU and ISSC merged to form the International Science Council (ISC).  Because IUPsyS was one of the few unions that belonged to both and because of the importance of the social sciences in the solution of global problems, IUPsyS and its leadership now play an important role in the ISC.  Along with other ISC members, IUPsyS and BISO, including members of the USNC-IUPsyS, helped inform and shape the ISC?s new Science Action plan, Advancing Science as a Global Public Good, released in September 2019.  The Plan outlines focused work on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; the Digital Revolution; Science in Policy and Public Discourse; and the Evolution of Science and Science Systems; and Defending the Free and Responsible Practice of Science.    The USNC-IUPsyS has also had a major role in creating new opportunities for the IUPsyS within the Psychology Coalition at the United Nations (PCUN).  IUPsyS and PCUN promote the use of psychological science predominantly generated in the United States to bear on pressing global issues, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), climate change, terrorism, and migrant populations.  PCUN was an important contributor to the Non-Governmental Organizations Major Group Position Paper for the High Level Political Forum, 2018.  Two past USNC chairs, Sonia Suchday and Oscar Barbarin, served as the IUPsyS representatives to PCUN, and as part of that work, helped developed a written proposal that set forth ways for the IUPsyS and its national members to be involved in activities related to the SDGs.  These efforts have increased awareness of social science factors in global issues, as well as of IUPsyS and the USNC-IUPsyS.    Finally, in 2014, the NAS released Building Infrastructure for International Collaborative Research in the Social and Behavioral Sciences. The workshop, organized by the USNC/IUPsyS, addressed ways to overcome challenges to effective international collaborations and noted ways in which institutions can adapt and strengthen their infrastructures to make them more effective in support and facilitation of international collaboration, and in creating the environment where those collaborations might take place. Dissemination was conducted at professional society meetings, through an article in the IUPsyS newsletter, and via distribution of printed and electronic copies of the summary and the report by the Society for Research in Child Development, APA and others.
