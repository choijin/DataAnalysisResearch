<AbstractNarration>Abstract (Fefferman, 1402227): &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial funding for a three-day Conference on "Harmonic Analysis and Partial Differential Equations: Recent Developments and Future Directions", to be held  September 19-21, 2014, at the University of Chicago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on a number of different areas of partial differential equations where harmonic analysis techniques are often used, with emphasis on recent developments in non-linear dispersive PDE, inverse problems, elliptic homogenization and boundary value problems. The key issues  are global well-posedness and blow up, profile decomposition, soliton resolution conjecture, unique continuation properties, Calderon problem with partial data, anisotropic inverse problems, uniform boundary regularity estimates, etc.  Several world leading experts are confirmed as participants and will give lectures.  The conference organizers aim to attract a broad range of participants including junior researchers and members of underrepresented groups. The achievements and impacts of Carlos Kenig in analysis will be celebrated in the conference.</AbstractNarration>
