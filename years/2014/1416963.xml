<AbstractNarration>This award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program in the Division of Chemistry at NSF supports a project by Professor Jeremy Smith from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at New Mexico State University to carry out fundamental studies aimed at uncovering new reactivity of high-valent iron complexes.  The project involves the use of tris(carbene)borate ligands to prepare novel iron(IV) complexes and the use of a range of simple transition metal carbonyl and nitrosyl complexes to systematically probe their electronic structures.  The project is interdisciplinary in nature and involves synthetic inorganic chemistry, a variety of spectroscopic techniques, and the measurement of magnetic properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project could lead to the discovery of new reactivity patterns in iron(IV) complexes of potential relevance to nitrogen fixation (i.e., the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to derivatives that can be assimilated by living organisms).  In addition, this project will provide excellent interdisciplinary training of students, from undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merits  The small size of magnetic molecules has promise for application in data storage applications, which is a critical need in the future development of information technologies. These molecules may display magnetic ordering  similar to bar magnets, thus allowing for information to be stored in a quantized form.   This project explored the fundamental relationships between the electronic structure of certain metal-containing molecules and their magnetic properties in both the solid state and solution. A common theme is that the metals in these molecules were confined to unusual chemical environments, leading to the observation of unexpected magnetic phenomena as well as switchable molecular magnetism.   This research involved fundamental investigations aimed at better understanding of basic phenomena in molecular magnetism. An exciting result is the observation that molecules containing a single unpaired electron show resistance to an oscillating magnetic field, indicative of single molecule magnetic properties. Since quantum mechanics shows that there is no barrier to changing the orientation of the spin for a single electron, such molecules are not expected to show single molecule magnetic properties. The origin of this behavior is not fully understood, but may result from interactions between the electron spin and either the nuclear spin of the metal or the orbital angular momentum.  In another research area, we have investigated the relationship between molecular structure and the thermal switch from  non-magnetic to magnetic state for a series of iron-containing molecules. These studies have allowed us to develop structure/activity relationships that allow for precise control over the magnetic state through molecular design.  Building from this work, we have discovered that these molecules show magnetic ordering when exposed to light, i.e. photoinduced single molecule magnets. Specifically, irradiating a solid state sample of the molecule with white light causes the molecules to change from a non-magnetic to magentic state.  However, in contrast to the vast majority of molecules that display this phenomenon, this photoexcited magnetic state also shows magnetic ordering, observed by slow magnetic relaxation in the presence of an applied magnetic field. Such molecules have the promise for even greater density of information storage since they are able to access three different states. This contrasts with conventional materials that are only able access two different magnetic states. The flexibility in molecular design suggests that it should be possible to tune the photomagnetic behavior.  Broader Impacts  This research provides important insights into fundamantal aspects of molecular magnetism, in particular the relationship between molecular structure and magnetic behavior.  Such insights are important for the rational design of new magnetic materials, as well as understanding their behavior.  Additionally, the research has uncovered the first class of photomagnetic molecules with the potential for tuning the photomagnetic behavior. These molecules have the potential for very high density information storage.  Undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers received training in the synthesis and characterization of air-sensitive materials, as well as  developed expertise in aspects of molecular magnetism.
