<AbstractNarration>Time-series observations from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans have revealed indisputable evidence of long-term acidification of open-ocean surface seawater due to uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Concurrent evidence of negative effects of acidification on the production and preservation of calcium carbonate have fueled concern about the potential consequences to coral reefs.  Although long-term acidification in coral reef environments in general has not been observed, seawater acidification rates on the Bermuda coral reef platform between 2007-2012 have been found to be three times faster than the long-term (1983-2012) acidification rate observed at a nearby offshore open-ocean time-series station.  The investigators on this project believe that they now understand how this happens and have designed a study to confirm or refute their ideas.  Specifically they believe that the observed changes in 2007-2012 are attributable to a recent shift in reef metabolic processes associated with an increase in net reef calcification and heterotrophy.  The evidence they have in-hand suggests that these changes have been fueled by an increase in food supply to the reef as a result of increased offshore primary production seemingly linked to the state of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a periodic back-and-forth shifting of atmospheric pressure differences between the subpolar and the subtropical North Atlantic. In this project, by collecting an extensive set of physical, chemical, and biological data extending from the reef platform at Bermuda to the offshore open-water time-series station, they will explore this idea.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary scientific and societal broader impacts of this project will be its relevance to advancing current understanding of the effects of ocean acidification on coral reefs. Robust prediction of future effects on this ecosystem requires knowledge of the main drivers of reef biogeochemical processes and of local seawater acidification. Secondly, the project will support the education and research activities of both graduate and undergraduate students working as members of the research team, and foster community educational outreach through the Ocean Discovery Institute in San Diego and the Ocean Academy in Bermuda to engage students from underrepresented minorities. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The central hypothesis of this research is that during years of negative winter NAO, intensified mixing and increased nutrient supply enhance offshore production leading to coral reef calcification and reef heterotrophy, thus intensifying the local seawater acidification on the reef. To address this hypothesis, the team will measure and characterize inshore seawater biogeochemical properties (temperature, salinity, dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, calcium, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, inorganic nutrients, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, total organic carbon and nitrogen, phytoplankton pigments, and bacterial abundance) on a monthly interval across the Bermuda coral reef.  These data will be evaluated in concert with data collected as part of the Bermuda-Atlantic Time-Series and Hydrostation S programs and along inshore-offshore transects.  It is expected that this approach will further the understanding of how seawater biogeochemical properties, including seawater carbonate chemistry, vary over time and space on the Bermuda coral reef, and identify the main drivers of these variations. It will specifically address the coupling between offshore and inshore biogeochemical processes and how they are linked to larger-scale oceanographic and climatic forcings, such as the NAO. It also addresses how reef biogeochemical processes may alleviate or exacerbate ocean acidification, and whether these changes are important to reef metabolism in the context of other forcings such as light, nutrients, and food availability.</AbstractNarration>

As a result, it has been hypothesized that calcifying organisms and ecosystems, including coral reefs, could be negatively affected by these changes in seawater chemistry. In fact, coral reefs could transition from a state of net accretion to net erosion, which could have far reaching consequences for millions of people dependent on coral reefs and the services they provide including financial revenue from tourism and fisheries, food and nutrition, and protection from storms and waves. Most of our current understanding of the effects of ocean acidification on coral reefs have been derived from small-scale and short-term laboratory experiments. However, to fully understand and accurately predict the potential effects of future ocean acidification on coral reefs, it is necessary to first understand the natural environmental drivers and biogeochemical function of coral reefs. Consequently, the goal of this project was to investigate the natural temporal and spatial variations of biogeochemical properties and processes on the Bermuda coral reef, and ultimately, identify the main drivers of this variability. Bermuda was selected because of its relatively high latitude location in the North Atlantic, which makes it a marginal reef system and potentially either more resistant or more vulnerable to ocean acidification than reefs at lower latitudes. Knowledge gained from this location may be instrumental in understanding how reefs in general may respond to ocean acidification. Our research approach took advantage of autonomous instruments measuring physical and biogeochemical properties on the coral reef as well as monthly cruises inshore and offshore in the Sargasso Sea making additional measurements (Figure 1). Furthermore, this project built on a previous NSF sponsored project, making the resulting dataset one of the world?s longest records of biogeochemical parameters measured on a coral reef.</p> <p>The resulting time-series data showed that the Bermuda coral reef undergoes predictable seasonal variation in physical and biogeochemical parameters, but with both sub-seasonal and interannual variability linked to a range of forcings including mesoscale eddies and larger climate modes such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (Figure 2). During summer, surface seawater temperature (SST) were high while dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TA) and pH were low. During winter, the opposite trends were observed. These trends in DIC and TA mainly reflected the influence from net reef metabolism, oscillating between net organic carbon production (autotrophy) during spring/summer, and net respiration (heterotrophy) during fall/winter, while maintaining high rates of calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) production during summer/fall, and lower rates during winter/spring (Figure 3). Overall, the Bermuda coral reef was net calcifying with only occasional observations of net dissolution during winter. During the summers of 2010 to 2013, maximum rates of reef scale calcification were higher compared to other years. Except for 2012, these years coincided with a negative winter phase of the NAO, which is associated with stronger winds, intensified mixing, and increased injection of nutrients and nutrition to the Bermuda reef. We believe this additional supply of energy fueled the higher rates of reef scale calcification during these years. In contrast, the anomalously high rates of calcification observed in 2012 may have been related to an antcyclonic eddy that transported large amounts of Sargassum on to the reef that subsequently fueled high rates of reef scale calcification. Regardless of the exact mechanism, the results offer strong evidence that Bermuda reef metabolism and coral reefs in general are strongly influenced by offshore biogeochemical processes. Consequently, the oceanic regime is an important determinant to consider in the context of coral reef resistance and resilience in response to ocean acidification. Furthermore, numerical model analysis of the relative importance of environmental parameters on reef scale and coral colony calcification rates in Bermuda revealed that SST was by far the strongest driver of the observed variability in calcification rates. In fact, the positive effect of SST was so dominant it masked any potential negative effects resulting from low pH and high pCO<sub>2</sub> conditions. However, if SST were to exceed the mean summer SST by one degree or more it would most likely cause coral bleaching and potential coral mortality. Notably though, our model results revealed that if SST warming during the 21<sup>st</sup> century were constrained to gradual warming predicted under a minimum CO<sub>2</sub> emissions pathway (Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6), coral calcification and CaCO<sub>3</sub> production in Bermuda could actually increase and benefit from the anticipated moderate warming. These findings highlight the potential benefits of rapid reductions in global anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for coral reefs and the ecosystem services they provide.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Rodney&nbsp;Johnson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416670/1416670_10310259_1601419532635_Fig1_BDA_map--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416670/1416670_10310259_1601419532635_Fig1_BDA_map--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sampling Locations"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416670/1416670_10310259_1601419532635_Fig1_BDA_map--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sampling Locations"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Research approach and sample locations inshore and offshore the Bermuda coral reef platform.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Anderson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rodney&nbsp;Johnson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Sampling Locations</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416670/1416670_10310259_1601419651427_Fig2_Timeseries_2007_2018--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416670/1416670_10310259_1601419651427_Fig2_Timeseries_2007_2018--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Time series data"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416670/1416670_10310259_1601419651427_Fig2_Timeseries_2007_2018--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Time series data"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Time-series of physical and biogeochemical parameters on the Bermuda coral reef and offshore at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Station (BATS) between 2007-2018.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Anderson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rodney&nbsp;Johnson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Time series data</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416670/1416670_10310259_1601419807204_Fig3_NCC_NCP--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416670/1416670_10310259_1601419807204_Fig3_NCC_NCP--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Net Ecosystem Production"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1416670/1416670_10310259_1601419807204_Fig3_NCC_NCP--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Net Ecosystem Production"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Net ecosystem production (NEP) as a function of net ecosystem calcification on the Bermuda coral reef between 2007-2018 as a function of month of the year.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Anderson</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rodney&nbsp;Johnson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Net Ecosystem Production</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
