<AbstractNarration>Ultra low frequency (ULF) waves are important for the transport of energy in the near-Earth magnetosphere.  This research will improve a MHD wave code and apply it to several problems involving ULF waves in the magnetosphere.  The outcome will be a global ULF wave model that can address the specific science questions in this proposal and provide an approach that can be applied to many other problems in magnetospheric physics. Specifically the proposal will address three questions:&lt;br/&gt;1. The propagation and dynamics of ULF waves in the inner magnetosphere, to understand the dynamics of the Pi1 and Pi2 pulsations found at substorm onset and their timing at both high and mid-latitudes with respect to driving sources in the magnetotail.&lt;br/&gt;2. The use of ULF waves to determine the mass density of the magnetosphere through travel-time and field-line resonance ?magnetoseismology?. &lt;br/&gt;3. The coupling of high and low-latitude wave fields through the propagation of MHD waves through the magnetosphere and of electromagnetic waves in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide. &lt;br/&gt;This research will support a graduate student.  The wave model will be very useful in other magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling studies.  This model provides a missing link in our global models of magnetosphere and ionosphere coupling and therefore is important for space weather. As result it has high societal value.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ultra-low-frequency (ULF) waves in the Earth's magnetic field (the "magnetosphere") are responsible for the transport of energy and momentum throughout the magnetosphere as well as for carrying electrical current along magnetic field lines.  These field-aligned currents close in the ionosphere, and produce magnetic perturbations that can be seen by ground magnetometers.  This project is based on the development of a global numerical model for the propagation of these waves in the magnetosphere.  This model has been used to determine the timing of various processes in the magnetosphere.  Since this timing is dependent on the mass density of the magnetosphere, these results can be used to infer this density, an area now known as magnetoseismology.  The model results have also been compared with data from satellite observations, such as NASA's Van Allen Probes mission, as well as data obtained from ground magnetometers.  The Van Allen Probes mission consists of two satellites, leaving a large region of space unobserved.  The results from this numerical model can be used to "fill in the gaps" and provide information on the electric and magnetic fields througout the inner magnetosphere.  The development of this model has the broader impact of developing new numerical techniques that can be applied to other areas of research.  This research has also supported a graduate student through his graduate career and resulted in him successfully defending his Ph.D. thesis.  He then has gone on to a position assessing similar numerical models in industry.       Last Modified: 07/27/2017       Submitted by: Robert L Lysak]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
