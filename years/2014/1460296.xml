<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for U.S.-based graduate students, postdoctoral associates, and junior faculty to participate in the workshop "The interrelation between mathematical physics, number theory and non-commutative geometry," March 2-13, 2015, at the Erwin Schroedinger International Institute for Mathematical Physics in Vienna, Austria (www.esi.ac.at/activities/events/2015/the-interrelation-between-mathematical-physics-number-theory-and-non-commutative-geometry). This workshop explores the expanding relationship between theoretical physics and pure mathematics, which now extends from quantum field theory in physics to number theory in mathematics, two fields which were traditionally considered to be far removed from each other.  The funds will allow researchers from U.S. institutions to participate in this cutting edge workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past two decades, the newly discovered relations between Feynman integrals in quantum field theory and Grothendieck's theory of motives of algebraic varieties has become a topic of growing importance in theoretical and mathematical physics. The mathematical and physical theories have been developing along parallel tracks, and there is a pressing need to create more interaction between researchers from mathematics and physics working on these topics. This workshop will bring together researchers in both fields, and will focus on the following research directions:  1) Motives and periods in perturbative quantum field theory; 2) Amplitudes and super-Yang-Mills theory; 3) Algebraic structures in renormalization; and 4) Quantum field theory on noncommutative spacetimes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funding from NSF was used to provide travel and local support for eight junior participants (graduate students and postdocs) from US universities to attend the workshop ``The interrelation between mathematical physics, number theory and noncommutative geometry" at the Erwin Schroedinger Institute in Vienna, Austria, March 2-13, 2015.  The workshop addressed cutting edge research at the interface of these three important research fields.  All funded participants attended at least the first week of the workshop, which was devoted to master classes from senior mathematicians, as few mathematicians are expert in more than one of the three topics.  Several funded participants remained for the second week, which focused on advanced research topics in these fields.  Participants reported very favorably on their experiences at the workshop, which included ample time for junior and senior participants to network both in formal and informal settings.  Many speakers contributed lecture notes, available at http://www.noncommutativegeometry.nl/esi2015/slides/.  We feel that even though lecture notes are in rough form, they give insight into speakers' current research agendas.  In particular, they form a valuable mini-library for researchers in the field who could not attend the workshop.  Overall, the workshop and NSF's support for participants furthered NSF's mission of preparing the next generation of researchers at the interface of mathematics and physics.  Advances in this area will lead to more precise understanding of the deep mathematics that underlies formal yet accurate computations in theoretical physics, which is one of the leading intellectual issues in this broad area.
