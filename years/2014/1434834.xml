<AbstractNarration>Rolling-element bearings are key precision components used for rotor support in nearly all machinery. The annual revenue associated with bearings is a substantial $50.5 billion worldwide. Future demands on high performance rotor support for advanced aircraft engines, wind turbines and high-speed rail require bearings to survive thousands of hours and consequently billions of Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF) cycles under severe operating conditions. A new generation of high strength bearing steels with graded material properties has been designed to meet these challenges. Existing life prediction methodologies rely on empirical models dating back to the 1940s, resulting in a large discrepancy between observed and predicted life, for the new generation of materials. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) collaborative researh project aims to predict reliable service life and structural integrity of new generation bearing materials based on novel experimental and computational procedures for understanding material degradation due to RCF at the micro and nanometer scale. The results will translate to the design of other components with large economic impact such as transmission gears, cams, railway wheels and tracks, and manufacturing tooling. This research is an effort to bring back an academic focus to manufacturing-related research to campuses and to better assist US industries. The project will contribute to the education and training of future manufacturing research workforce and leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative GOALI project involves developing a novel physics-based material-specific life prediction model rooted in fundamental understanding of local material properties of as-manufactured and RCF-affected materials from sub-micrometer/nanometer to macroscopic length scales. The project will develop: 1) quantifiable measures for subsurface graded material response as a function of load, temperature and RCF cycles; 2) computational approaches for understanding the influence of microstructural features on the material cyclic response, resultant stress and strain fields, and fatigue damage; and 3) a material-specific RCF life prediction methodology based on enhancements to the existing Lundberg-Palmgren empirical approach by the evolving elastic-plastic subsurface stress and strain fields. Methodologies for tracking RCF material damage in the giga-cycle regime will become available for reliable life prediction, which are of considerable importance with applications to broader areas of tribology and heterogeneous materials for future component design. Intellectual significance of the project comprises of two novel contributions:  1) it will aid development of a new material-specific RCF life prediction model, particularly beneficial to accelerated design of new bearing materials, and 2) it will result in a methodology to model cycle-specific material property evolution in rolling contacts, with direct relevance to design of gears, cams, railway wheels and tooling.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have developed the following theories and methods for analyzing the contact stress fields in rolling bearing elements considering a number issues of material inhomogeneities and loading conditions.  1). A new Numerical Matrix Indentation Method (N-MIM) has been developed to model the stress field of virgin or fatigue damaged materials with inhomogeneities.  We are able to efficiently simulate the stress fields of materials with a variety of inhomogeneities, such as individual particles, strings of particles, particles of any shapes and distribution density, and to model strain accumulations in cyclic contact loading. Fig. 1  2). A novel method has been developed calculate the stress field of bearing materials with double-layered inhomogeneities by means of the elasto-plastic contact analysis based on our numerical equivalent inclusion method (N-EIM). Double-layered inhomogeneities are composed of enclosed, or layered, inhomogeneities of different material properties. They appear as embedded in a matrix material. Fig. 2  3). A new numerical contact simulation process has been structured, namely the DCS-FFT (discrete convolution with summation &ndash; fast Fourier transform) algorithm, which is efficient in handling bearing surface roughness and large amount of inclusions in the materials of roller bearings.  Together with the results of our previous works, this DCS-FFT work has completed our suite of efficient numerical simulation methods by means of the fast Fourier transform (FFT).  These are the discrete (circular) convolution and FFT (DC-FFT) algorithm, the discrete convolution- continuous convolution and FFT (DC-CC-FFT) algorithm, the discrete convolution with duplication and FFT (DCD-FFT) algorithm, the DCS-FFT algorithm mentioned above as a more advanced and accurate version of DCD-FFT, and the discrete convolution-correlation and FFT (DCR-FFT), for solving circular contact problems like those for bearing balls, the line contact problems like those for bearing rollers, flat contact problems like those for bearing face mounting, and calculating the eigenstrain-induced elastic fields. The essential portions of the software of these algorithms are now open source for public research use.  4) A new numerical method has been developed to estimate the matrix yield strength of an inhomogeneous material. The matrix yield strength is a critical measure of integrity of inhomogeneity-containing materials, like bearing steels, but it is largely unknown.  It has been difficult to directly measure this strength due to the disturbances from distributed inhomogeneities.  This new method allows for extracting the matrix yield strength of a carburized bearing steel. Fig. 3  5) New theories have been developed to consider the influences of imperfect interfaces of materials, due to dislocation-like, spring-like and force-like imperfections, on the contact stress fields.  6) A new theory and new three-dimensional model has been developed for heat conduction in a half space containing inhomogeneities, applicable to frictional heat transfer in at the contact interfaces in bearings, together with a novel combined algorithm of the equivalent inclusion method (EIM) and the imaging inclusion approach for building this model. The influence coefficients (ICs) for temperature and heat flux are obtained via converting the frequency response function (FRF) and integrating Green?s function. The model solution is based on our discrete convolution and fast Fourier transform (DC-FFT) algorithm using the ICs, convenient for solving problems involving multiple elliptical inhomogeneities with arbitrary orientations.  6)  A new theory has been developed for the impact of velocity on contact stress. The model can analyze the effects of friction, sliding velocity, and Young?s modulus on contact pressure, surface deformation and sub-surface von Mises stress. A transition map, supported by appropriate limits of friction coefficient and sliding velocity, is constructed to determine whether the location of maximum von Mises stress to appear beneath the contact surface or in the contact surface. Fig. 4  7) A group of formulae has been built to determine the point of first contact yield of case-hardened bearing steels, to link contact yield initiation with case hardening parameters, and to correlate rolling contact fatigue lives with case hardening parameters concerning contact yield initiation. If the depth is nondimensionalized by contact characteristic length a (radius for circular contact area or half contact width for rectangular contacts), and the stress by maximum contact pressure, their RCF lives can be inversely correlated to a case-hardening related parameter based on our previous experiments.  8) A group of models for lubricated contacts has been implemented to more accurately analyze the surface interaction and substrate stress fields in bearing rollers and balls.
