<AbstractNarration>In an increasingly global society archaeologists are uniquely positioned to examine cross-cultural exchange along an extended timescale.  Tracking how new ideas spread has broad implications for understanding how artisans respond to technologies, accept skilled producers and learn new ways of doing. Whether populations accept, reject, or modify these new technologies depends on how they are introduced, and what these new technologies represent.  Changes in craft production becomes a case study of how ideas are transmitted (or fail to be transmitted) in contact situations, bringing together concepts of self, identity and cultural belonging.  Specifically, this dissertation addresses how American and Mexican indigenous groups interacted and introduced new pottery manufacturing technologies across a cultural frontier. The modern international border artificially divides current research on these prehispanic cultures, creating an inaccurate image of how indigenous population exchanged ideas and goods. Additionally, both the border and language divide prevent communication between researchers. The researcher's conference presentations and publications on these data will bring northern Mexican archaeological research to an English-speaking audience, diminishing the effect of the modern boundary on cultures that were once continuous. The research will be conducted by Tanya Chiykowski, a graduate student at SUNY Binghamton and will provide data for her doctoral dissertation thesis. Thus it will further her intellectual and professional advancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The late prehistoric Southwest US was a landscape of warfare, migration and identity formation.  Archaeologists study the movement of potters, materials and techniques to understand this period of upheaval, by tracking ceramic styles, using geologic sourcing to map exchange, and recording the history of technological style. American ceramicists have developed extensive methods and databases to address questions of identity and craft production in the U.S. Southwest; however, Northwest Mexico presents an abrupt termination to these research questions.  In Sonora, archaeologists have clear evidence of population upheaval after AD 1300. Southern Arizona Hohokam groups migrated into the Altar Valley in Sonora, Mexico, bringing with them new ceramic technologies and displacing a resident Trincheras population to the Middle Magdalena valley.  While the presence of large amounts of Hohokam ceramics at Cerro de Trincheras in the Middle Magdalena valley suggests that Trincheras and Hohokam populations interacted, neither how the process occurred nor the impact of those linkages is well understood.  What processes caused such a large percentage of "foreign" ceramics at Cerro de Trincheras?  The investigators will use ceramic petrography and GIS analysis to address the likelihood of trade, community migration and the movement of women, all hotly debated mechanisms of introducing new technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The late prehistoric Southwest United States/Northwest Mexico(SW/NW) was a landscape of warfare, migration and movement.  At stake is the role of women in prehistoric warfare.  Na&iuml;ve conceptions of the peaceful ænoble savageÆ create an inaccurate perception that human trafficking in conflict is a recent phenomena.  My analysis of womenÆs roles in prehistoric pottery production show that violence against women is not a recent problem, and captive-taking in conflicts has a deep history in Sonora, Mexico.  In Sonora, archaeologists have clear evidence of population upheaval around AD 1300.  Southern Arizona Hohokam groups migrated into northern Sonora, bringing with them new pottery technologies and displacing the Trincheras Tradition population. However, large amounts of Hohokam pottery at Trincheras sites suggest that the two populations interacted, but not how the process occurred, nor the impact.    My dissertation research addresses the evidence for trade, group migration and movement of Hohokam women at the site.  The Site: Cerro de Trincheras is a late prehistoric village of approximately 1000 people located on a volcanic hillside in the Middle Magdalena River of northern Sonora. Trinchere&ntilde;os (inhabitants of the site) terraced the hillside, on which they built houses. In addition to being a permanently inhabited village the site contains El Caracol (ritual architecture), La Cancha (community integration features), several cremation cemeteries.  The Wider Context:  Prior to the late-prehistoric the Trincheras Tradition was centered on the Altar Valley.  Around AD 1300 the migration of Hohokam populations from Southern Arizona into the Altar Valley brought with them a new pottery manufacturing technology. Concurrently, Trinchere&ntilde;os founded new sites in the Middle Magdalena Valley, including Cerro de Trincheras. Both groups made pottery by hand building coils of clay, but Hohokam paddle the vessels to smooth them while Trinchere&ntilde;os scrapped the excess clay from their vessels. Despite the geographic separation of approximately 60 km, nearly a third of pottery at Cerro de Trincheras are Hohokam. This high presence of Hohokam pottery sparked the question &ndash; what was the nature of interaction between Hohokam and Trincheras populations in the late prehistoric?  The Hypotheses: Based on research in other areas of the SW/NW there are three likely explanations: (1) Trade; (2) Group migration; (3) The movement of individual women as captives or wives. Trade is the easiest mechanism to identify. My comparisons of pottery to geological sources concludes that while some trade occurred, it was minor.  Less than 10% of the Hohokam pottery at Cerro de Trincheras matches the geology from Hohokam occupied areas in the Altar Valley.  That means Hohokam women moved to Trincheras communities in order to manufacture the remaining 90% of pottery.  The Results: Demonstrating that individual women moved to the site is difficult,  however, there are subtle indications that Hohokam women alone were entering Cerro de Trincheras.   First, changes to artifacts were limited to female activities.  The two changes were to pottery and food preparation, both the role of women in SW/NW society.   If family groups were moving to the site, we would expect a wider range of changes, including alternation of domestic environment, change in shell jewelry, and religion.  Second, if family groups were moving we would expect any differences to be concentrated to specific households or enclaves of the town.   Instead, we see a pattern of dispersed low visibility change across the site, with no areas of Hohokam pottery concentration.   Discussion: Two possible mechanisms brought Hohokam women to Cerro de Trincheras: captive taking or marriage.  Recent research suggests that captive taking is one such means by which women move across cultural boundaries.  Given the defensive nature of Cerro de Trincheras, warfare or raiding may have occurre...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
