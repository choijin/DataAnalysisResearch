<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports computational and theoretical research, and education on materials deformation. The objective of this collaborative research project is to develop computational models to predict the deformation and failure of a class of materials known as amorphous solids, particularly focusing on structural metallic glasses. The atoms in amorphous solids are arranged in a highly disordered structure unlike crystals in which atoms are arranged into a regular repeating structure. The current research seeks to go beyond directly simulating the atomic scale behavior using techniques like molecular dynamics simulations. While molecular dynamics simulation has been groundbreaking, this technique is computationally intensive and cannot be scaled up to model structures on scales of typical practical engineering interest. This research will focus on translating information from molecular dynamics simulations to computationally efficient models at larger scales. In doing so, comparisons will be made between atomic scale representations and larger scale theories to ensure that the larger scale theories are statistically consistent and adequately verified. Particular attention will be paid to testing whether they capture the mechanisms governing material behavior and the inherent variability that results from the disordered atomic configurations. This verification will permit the use of these models for testing theories of large-scale material behavior, particularly failure and fracture; successful theories will help to enable the design of amorphous materials wherein the structure of a material is chosen to meet certain performance objectives, and permitting the assessment of the reliability of engineering materials. The insights gained and methods employed in this research have the potential to transform the way in which length-scales are spanned in the study of the mechanics of materials beyond those with amorphous structure.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This award also supports educational initiatives at both Johns Hopkins University and Harvard University. These will address the critical need to integrate computational methods into the core Materials Science and Engineering curriculum while also engaging elementary school students in high-need urban schools through the NSF funded STEM Achievement in Baltimore Elementary Schools project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports computational and theoretical research, and education on nonequilibrium properties of materials with a focus on deformation. Atomistic mechanisms govern both a material's kinetics and the manner in which its structure evolves during the inherently nonequilibrium process of deformation and failure. The need to establish numerically tractable continuum descriptions of viscoplasticity that incorporate atomistic mechanisms in ways that retain their essential aspects presents a grand challenge at the intersection of physics and mechanics. The strategy employed in this research for reducing the operative degrees of freedom is to extend thermodynamic concepts beyond their common equilibrium application. The configurational entropy will be deployed in the context of the shear transformation zone theory to make quantitative predictions of deformation and failure processes in amorphous solids. This study will utilize molecular dynamics simulation to parameterize a highly optimized fully Eulerian implementation of the shear transformation zone theory that permits investigation of very large strains such as those that arise in failure processes like strain localization and fracture. This will require development and analysis of new numerical projection methods for viscoplasticity. The shear transformation zone constitutive law differs from existing relations insofar as it makes reference to a configurational effective temperature that quantifies the structure. These structural parameters can be independently measured in molecular dynamics to cross-validate the predictions of the numerical implementations of the constitutive theory. Rigorous statistical comparisons will be made through a novel stochastic framework that establishes a random field representation of the atomic potential energy that is translated to a continuum effective temperature. This work will validate predictions of the mechanical response of metallic glasses, emerging structural materials, both during homogeneous flow near the glass temperature and during the development of plastic localization and fracture at lower temperatures in a manner that accounts for inherent fluctuations and correlations associated with the material's amorphous structure. This will lead to a greatly increased understanding of deformation and failure in materials with varying degrees of disorder and predictive numerical schemes suitable for large strains that can be rigorously analyzed and deployed in engineering contexts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award also supports educational initiatives at both Johns Hopkins University and Harvard University. These will address the critical need to integrate computational methods into the core Materials Science and Engineering curriculum while also engaging elementary school students in high-need urban schools through the NSF funded STEM Achievement in Baltimore Elementary Schools project.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

This requires translating the lessons learned from atomic-scale simulations to continuum models. Translating between these two scales is particularly challenging in the context of amorphous solids like glasses in which atoms are not arranged in a crystalline structure.  In this work we study the main failure mode called a shear band that occurs commonly in a relatively novel material, a metallic glass, but also can arise in other amorphous solids. Here we perform atomic scale simulations of shear bands as illustrated in Figure 1. The material is subjected to shear by moving the upper boundary relative to the lower boundary in the lateral direction. As a result, the material slips, but not uniformly. The slip is contained in a region illustrated in pink in Figure 1. This region experiences extreme deformation. Questions arise as to how this region forms, why it forms in a particular location, and how it develops as the material slips. All these factors control the material strength.  This can be simulated in an atomic scale simulation as illustrated in Figure 2. Here all the atoms of the metallic glass are represented individually. The shear band arises naturally from the disordered structure and metallic bonding of the amorphous solid. To translate this information from the atomic scale simulation to a continuum model, we need to undertake a procedure called "coarse-graining." Figure 3 illustrates the coarse graining procedure, where measurements on the atomic scale are aggregated to inform the larger continuum scale.  Once a coarse graining procedure has been determined, data from the atomic scale simulations can be used to inform and test the continuum scale model. This is useful for making a prediction without having to simulate every atom in the material. Figure 4 shows a direct comparison between data from an atomic scale simulation, coarse-grained at the 50 angstrom scale, on the left and a continuum model that was initialized identically on the right. We see very similar behavior, indicating that he continuum model does a good job of mimicking the atomic simulation.  In addition to testing the evolution of the microstructure, as illustrated in Figure 4, we can also measure the stress in the material as the strain is imposed. Figure 5 compares the atomic simulation to the continuum model. Good agreement is only achieved when a sufficiently large coarse-graining scale, here 50 angstroms, is used to translate between the two.  By undertaking this research, we have learned a number of important things.  Through our atomic scale simulations, we learned how to use this kind of detailed information to detect where the material will slip by locating defects called shear transformation zones where the material can only support a small amount of stress before yielding. Through our comparisons of atomic scale simulations and continuum models we now understand better how to make such comparisons between these two kinds of computer models so that one can inform and test the other, particularly the importance of the coarse-graining length scale used in the comparison. This has allowed us to test the assumptions of the theory that underlies the continuum model used in Figures 4 and 5. We see good comparison which provides some validation of the theory. We have also developed machine learning methods suitable for helping us bring the atomic scale simulation and the continuum model into as close agreement as possible. These methods will be generally useful for making connections between these two different levels of material description. Furthermore, implementing the continuum models themselves was challenging and required developing new mathematical methods for numerically solving the equations of the model. We employed parallel computational methods to allow them to be run on supercomputers at a large scale (Figure 6). These codes will be made available widely for solving a class of problems known as "viscoplastic" problems, particularly those in which extreme strains arise as in shear bands. The continuum numerical method has been used in collaboration with scientists at the Weizmann Institute to make testable predictions about the toughness of metallic glass as a function of the loading rate and sample preparation. Other research groups and now performing experiments to test these predictions. Finally, we learned additional important aspects of how shear bands develop in a material. Most notably we now understand that a competition between the extreme flow in the band and the slow relaxation outside determine the ultimate width to which the shear band will grow.   In summary, this project allowed us to develop new ways for computer simulations to inform our understanding of amorphous solids, and particularly metallic glasses, a complex kind of material under development for structural applications.
