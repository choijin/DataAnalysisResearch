<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Georgia, located in Athens, Georgia, will support the training of 10 students for 9 weeks during the summers of 2015-2017.  This program will introduce undergraduates to areas of microbial research and increase their awareness of careers in microbiology. Students from groups that are underrepresented in the scientific community, including deaf and hard-of-hearing students and ethnic minorities, are encouraged to participate in the program.  REU participants conduct independent projects under the supervision of faculty mentors residing in several Departments including, but not limited to: Microbiology, Marine Sciences, and Infectious Diseases. All provide a variety of research topics that address the functions of prokaryotic organisms.  Current techniques will be used in interdisciplinary approaches that combine knowledge from the fields of Genetics, Biochemistry, Bioinformatics, Physiology, Molecular Biology, Cellular Biology and Ecology.  Research projects will address broad questions including the role of prokaryotes in environmental and geochemical processes. Participants will attend workshops to become familiar with graduate school application and careers in microbiology.  Student applications are submitted electronically through the program website. Competitive students will be selected by a committee of faculty. Participants will assess the quality of the REU program by use of a common assessment tool (SALG URSSA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program.  Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.  Furthermore, students will have informal meetings with faculty, attend scientific seminars, participate in discussions of ethical issues in science, and join the regular research meetings of their lab groups. Students will present their research results at the end of the summer in a poster session. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://mib.uga.edu/programs, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Vincent J. Starai at vjstarai@uga.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Diana Downs at dmdowns@uga.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the three years spanning 2015 to 2017, the University of Georgia NSF REU Site Award: Research in Prokaryotic Biology has trained a total of 37 undergraduate students in cutting-edge microbiological research techniques.  Thirty of these students were directly supported by this funded NSF proposal, while the remaining seven students were supported by supplementary funding mechanisms.  Of the 30 directly supported students, twelve were undergraduates at liberal arts schools or community colleges (40%), where focused research opportunities for these undergraduates are limited.  In addition, our program successfully provided research opportunities to student groups who are poorly represented in scientific careers.  Fifteen of those participants (50%) were members of underrepresented minority groups in STEM fields, which included students who identified as Deaf or hard-of-hearing.   Research seminars given by guest speakers outside UGA diversified REU Site participants? exposure to scientific programming at other institutions.  Various workshops provided participants with information on professional careers in microbiology and related fields, as well as introduced students to ethical behavior in data collection, scientific publication, and data ownership.  Participants toured local biotechnology companies and government science agencies, which further broadened their views of potential career choices.  Students received instruction in presenting research results in a poster format and presented the results of their research in a final poster presentation to the UGA at-large scientific community in order to hone their scientific presentation skills.  Faculty and graduate student trainers involved with the program had access to "Entering Mentoring" workshops, a premier workshop for the training of scientific mentors.  Sixteen of our 30 NSF-funded participants have graduated from their home institutions, and the vast majority of those students have enrolled in graduate or professional schools.  Eight of the remaining 14 students who have not graduated yet are on-track to graduate by the end of the spring 2018 semester.  Five of the twenty-five REU Site participants who have graduated or are graduating this semester (20%) have either come back to UGA to enroll in Ph.D. programs (2 students; Microbiology, Integrated Life Sciences), or been offered a position in a Fall 2018 Ph.D. program at UGA (3 students; Microbiology, Integrated Life Sciences; one acceptance at this time).  The entry of past REU Site participants into graduate programs at UGA suggest that students find the research environment at UGA to be supportive for their career objectives.  Over the four years of this award, our participants have made (and continue to make) important contributions to scientific discovery and in the dissemination of research to the community.  Although none of the REU Site participants have published their research in a peer-reviewed research journal, three students were selected to present their work at national symposia.  These symposia included  the Research Experiences for Undergraduates Symposium (REUS, November 2015), the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS, November 2016), and the Emerging Researchers National Conference (ERN, February 2018).  In addition, many of the participants presented their work at smaller, local symposia and conferences at their home institutions.  Taken together, our participants have been competitive for selection into nationally-recognized conferences, thus highlighting the strength of our research experiences over the lifetime of this program.
