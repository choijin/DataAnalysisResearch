<AbstractNarration>It is known that streams collect, process, and release much of a basin's water. It is less known that streams also collect, process, and release much of a basin's carbon. Carbon is collected by streams in various forms, some of that carbon is processed by microbes in the streambed into carbon dioxide (CO2), and much of that CO2 is vented to the atmosphere during downstream flow.  These processes are particularly important in small, headwater streams.  Since headwater basins drain significant land surface, these coupled water-carbon processes may be globally significant.  This project will measure, model, and understand this coupled water-carbon cycle via intensive study of the stream carbon cycle within one headwater stream draining a 96-hectare basin in western Oregon. By using the Watershed 1 of the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest, this study will leverage a history of detailed data collection and a large number of existing measurements.  The project team will partner with the Audubon Society to teach 1000 school children stream hydrology and ecology in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has two main goals. The first is to develop an integrated modeling framework to simulate carbon cycling in streams that is widely transferable to model subsurface and surface processes of streams in earth system models. The second is to test and present an integrated theory of stream and groundwater hydrology, carbon biogeochemistry, and CO2 production and efflux in a stream. These goals will be accomplished by developing an integrated carbon model for headwater streams that simulates hydrologic processes (e.g., transport, hyporheic exchange) and biogeochemical processes (e.g., transformation between particulate and dissolved organic carbon, aerobic respiration rates of these carbon "pools"). Modeling will be coupled with direct measurements of groundwater delivery of soil-respired CO2, biological and physical processes controlling carbon cycling, measurements of dissolved oxygen, hydrology, and CO2 efflux from the stream to subcanopy respiration measured at a flux tower above the stream. In situ hyporheic mesocosms will be used to manipulate and monitor reactive transport along flow paths to parameterize biogeochemical rate expressions for use in the integrated model. Finally, the project will upscale the reach-scale processes to watershed scale to explain carbon fluxes from river networks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Aerobic respiration in stream ecosystems transforms organic matter into carbon dioxide (CO2). Streams also vent CO2 that is sourced from soil respiration and delivered to streams via groundwater. Stream CO2 fluxes are globally significant, but estimates of their magnitude are poorly constrained. The locations with the largest fluxes are likely to be headwater streams, which comprise more than 60% of stream networks, are the primary locations for groundwater discharge, and the part of the stream network where the carbon budget is most strongly influenced by hyporheic processes. Unfortunately, measuring carbon cycling and CO2 efflux from headwater streams is problematic because direct measurement of all the factors influencing carbon cycling is difficult, if not impossible, and single site measurements are not easily transferable to other streams.   Our project?s major findings agree with newer paradigms on microbial utilization of organic matter and extend these paradigms to biogeochemical processing of organic matter in headwater mountain streams: (1) quality and composition of carbon has less impact on hyporheic biogeochemical reaction than previously thought, (2) addition of microbially-accessible carbon substrate can induce priming of sediment-associated organic carbon in the hyporheic zone (HZ), and (3) buried particulate organic carbon is critically important to the carbon processing in the HZ of (this) mountain streams.  This project major scientific goals were to understand the influence of temperate headwater streams on CO2 fluxes from watersheds. More specifically, we sought to tighten constraints on the stream carbon budget through process understanding of hyporheic exchange and carbon biogeochemistry. To do this, we designed and built a stream-side hyporheic mesocosm facility to use as an experimental platform to examine the effects of carbon quantity and quality on hyporheic respiration and transformations and fluxes of carbon through the HZ.  We combined the mesocosm experiments with direct measurements of the biological and physical processes controlling carbon cycling through the in-situ HZ using a previously established network of wells and in-stream piezometers. Together, these studies allowed us to manipulate and monitor reactive transport along hyporheic flow paths and calculate biogeochemical reaction rates, thereby developing a better understanding of how quantity and quality of stream organic carbon affects C-flux through the HZ.    We addressed questions about the relative effects of varying quantities and qualities of DOC (e.g., acetate, humic acid, alder leaf leachate and forest floor leachate) on hyporheic respiration and carbon flux with a suite of controlled mesocosm injection experiments.  We observed large increases in O2 consumption and production of DIC, suggesting that hyporheic metabolism was carbon limited. However, differences between sodium acetate and humic acid were striking. While both were completely consumed along the 2-m mesocosm flowpath, addition of humic acid did not produce a parallel change in O2 and DIC. Suggesting that humic acid was lost from solution through adsorption whereas sodium acetate was metabolized, and that increasing the amount of microbially available DOC (e.g. sodium acetate) can induce priming of sediment-associated organic carbon in the HZ.  This pattern was confirmed in our experiments using sodium acetate or natural leachates.  These results contrast dramatically with previous observations that reported a lack of priming effect in the HZ.  Observations in the mesocosms were similar to those observed under baseflow conditions in the well field, confirming that heterotrophic metabolism of stream-source DOC cannot, alone, account for the amount of DIC produced or the amount of DO consumed.  Further, mesocosm results strongly support the conclusion that respiration of buried particulate organic carbon accounts for a large portion of hyporheic metabolism in this stream.  If we assume a 1:1 respiratory quotient (i.e., 1 CH2O + 1 O2 = 1 H2O + 1 CO2), then stream-source DOC accounts for 13% of the total respiration during summer and fall seasons, and as much as 49% of the total respiration during winter and spring seasons.  Our experiments and these analyses, indicate buried particulate organic carbon is critically important to carbon processing in the HZ of this mountain stream.  This project improved understanding of how quality and quantity of DOC affect carbon flux from headwater streams in the context of the specific hydrology of our experimental system.  However, additional work is needed to understand how these factors interact to affect overall carbon flux from headwater streams.  Our outreach and education program provided exposure to, and basic training in, hydrologic sciences to more than 940 fourth and fifth graders, and more than 100 adults, in the Corvallis area (location of Oregon State University).  Our outreach program was expanded to students in Idaho.  Additionally, this project developed a unique hyporheic mesocosm facility.  The facility was built to last for at least a decade, and will catalyze new collaborations and experiments that will yield novel insights into hyporheic processes for many years to come.
