<AbstractNarration>In this project, investigators participating in the 2015 U.S. GEOTRACES Arctic expedition will measure radium and thorium isotopes in the western Arctic Ocean. In common with other national initiatives in the International GEOTRACES Program, the goals of the U.S. Arctic expedition are to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions. Some trace elements are essential to life, others are known biological toxins, and still others are important because they can be used as tracers of a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the sea. The radionuclides to be measured as part of this project are important because they are oceanographic tracers that provide information on rates of cycling of other trace elements. The project will involve training opportunities for graduate student researchers and for undergraduate students from under-represented groups. Results from the study will be shared publicly through the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution?s Center for Marine and Environmental Radioactivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While other GEOTRACES projects will map the distribution of numerous trace elements and their isotopes (TEIs), their distribution cannot be properly interpreted without concurrent measurement of tracers capable of providing rates of internal TEI cycling processes and fluxes at boundaries and across interfaces. The isotopes to be measured in this project include a suite of uranium/thorium series radionuclides, including the shorter-lived 234-Th and 228-Th as well as the radium quartet (224-Ra, 223-Ra, 228-Ra, 226-Ra). These tracers have the appropriate half-lives and reactivities to allow for study of horizontal and vertical transport and mixing, as well as removal at ocean boundaries, supply via rivers and submarine groundwater discharge, surface scavenging and export and subsurface remineralization. The researchers have considerable experience developing and implementing the most efficient methods to sample and quantify this suite of tracers, which includes use of battery powered in-situ pumps for large volume sampling. Hence, in addition to the proposed work on uranium/thorium series radionuclides, the team will also provide a service to other GEOTRACES researchers by coordinating pump use and sampling for many essential particulate TEIs.</AbstractNarration>

Because radium has a sediment source, this experiment will provide a useful prediction for how the Chukchi shelf source of other sediment-derived materials, such as carbon and trace metals, will change in the future.  The short-lived 223Ra and 224Ra isotopes were low in the Arctic basin, with the exception of excess 224Ra (224Ra not supported by the decay of its parent isotope 228Th), which was high in surface waters in the Transpolar Drift and the Canada Basin. Because we only have measurements of dissolved 228Th and not particulate 228Th in surface waters, it is likely that this excess 224Ra is coming from particulate 228Th. However, the relationship between 228Th, 224Ra, and ice should be further studied to examine whether ice-rafted sediments and/or interactions between 228Th and the ice may be impacting surface water activities of these isotopes. Water column activities of excess 223Ra and 224Ra (corrected for activities supported by their parent isotopes, 227Ac and 228Th, respectively) decreased away from their shelf source, as expected, with some higher activities measured at depth indicating a benthic source.  Broader Impacts:  Two female undergraduate students were supported during three academic years and summers on this grant.  Moore has presented seminars at East China Normal University, Shanghai, and Xiamen University based on the Arctic data.
