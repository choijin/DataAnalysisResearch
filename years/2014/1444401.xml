<AbstractNarration>Volcanic lightning is a common but understudied phenomenon that is poorly parameterized. This project focuses on learning more about the properties of ash particles relating to their role in the generation of electrical fields in volcanic plumes and in volcanic lightning. In addition to being a charge carrier, volcanic ash may also influence the production of lightning due to its potential role in ice nucleation and as polarized, conducting particles. A range of material laboratory testing and characterization techniques will be used on samples obtained from several Alaskan volcanoes to determine if ash samples of different mineral and structurally bound water content will affect the functionality of conducting/insulating ash materials, and their ice nucleation affinity. Generation of volcanic (silicic glass) spherules as an indicator of the production of specific ash grain textures during volcanic lightning episodes will also be sought for.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed research include the training of undergraduate students, creation of teaching materials, and the support of an early career researcher. Improved understanding of volcanic hazards for the aviation, communication, and power generation industries are additional potential societal impacts</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project analyzed the chemical, mineralogical, and grain size characteristics of volcanic ash to determine which properties effect its electrical conductivity, influence its water electrical conductivity, and influence its ability to form ice crystals in the atmosphere.  This information is relevant to the knowledge of hazards to electrical infrastructure and water supplies following explosive volcanic eruptions and the likelihood of particular volcanoes to produce volcanic lightning during explosive eruptions. A database of volcanic eruptions with lightning has been updated to help illustrate the wide range of eruption sizes and types of activity with lightning.  Results indicate that volcanic ash is an insulating material, having very low electrical conductivity when dry at room temperature.  Variations in bulk chemical composition or mineral content do not affect its conductivity, but samples with a mixture of smaller and larger ash grain sizes appear to have higher conductivities than samples with dominantly larger grains.  Thus, the size distribution of volcanic ash particles will affect the electrical conductivity of the deposit. Minerals present in volcanic ash will not influence the electrical conductivity when it is dry, but introducing that ash into water supplies will have a significant effect.  Minerals containing magnesium, calcium, and sodium will cause increased electrical conductivity of any contaminated water supplies.   From all of the samples tested, those with a high abundance of olivine and pyroxene-group minerals had the most significant impact on the electrical conductivity of exposed waters.   Ice nucleation experiments were conducted on ash samples of various compositions from several volcanoes and show that volcanic ash is a very efficient ice nucleating particle in both the deposition-mode and in the immersion-mode.  Deposition-mode nucleation occurs when ice crystallizes directly from the vapor phase onto ash grains, and regardless of ash composition and mineral content, all samples display similarly efficient behavior.   If an ash grain is surrounded by water and reaches the appropriate altitude in the atmosphere to freeze the water droplet, immersion-mode nucleation occurs. These efficient samples nucleated ice at -20 ?, but pure water will typically freeze at -40 ?. These temperatures are found at altitudes of 7-10 km in standard atmospheres, and are consistent with the occurrence of plume lightning.  Ash abundance, which creates more available surface area on which ice can freeze, has the greatest effect on immersion-mode freezing compared to composition and mineralogy.  Greater amounts of ash in water droplets caused more ice to form at each temperature investigated.  Therefore, introduction of high-silica, fine-grained ash into the atmosphere will cause ice crystals to form at a much lower altitude than normal. This is consistent with previous observations in the database of volcanic lightning occurrence.  The explosive energy of a volcanic eruption controls both the proportion of ash generated and the size of the ash particles.  More explosive eruptions tend to produce smaller ash particles, which will make the ash more electrically conductive.   Additionally, highly explosive eruptions (with high Volcanic Explosivity Index) of compositionally evolved magmas reflect the necessary parameters for nucleating ice on ash grain surfaces, which permits triboelectrification due to collisions between ice particles and contributes to the frequent occurrence of volcanic lightning within the ash column during these events.
