<AbstractNarration>BROADER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research site will recruit undergraduate students in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. The vicinity of the host institution, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT), to a number of Tribal Colleges and Universities affords SDSMT a unique opportunity to introduce research to American Indians students and provide them with the resources to complete degrees in the STEM fields.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site is entitled "Technical Experience in Advancing Modeling Sciences (TEAMS)." As the name implies, the research projects will involve modeling in a number of areas including materials, defense, renewable energy, and three-dimensional printing. The projects will be performed in parallel with experiments to best expose the participants to the research area and to best connect their findings to problems of interest.  For example, one modeling project will investigate why purification materials in biofuel production (i.e., ethanol from corn) clog up.  By understanding what occurs at the molecular level, and how the material interacts with the waste byproducts, the models can influence the design of new materials for these applications.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, modeling projects are inherently collaborative, so the site will also teach students how to work in collaborative (i.e., team) environments. A number of skills feed into effective collaborative relationships, so workshops, seminars, and activities will be conducted to assist participants in developing these collaborative skills.  Some examples include teamwork building, writing workshops, and large data set analysis.  The ultimate goal is to provide the TEAMS REU participants the tools and experiences to increase their success as they pursue STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the proposed research is to host a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site entitled "Technical Experience in Advancing Modeling Sciences (TEAMS)." The TEAMS REU site aims to provide undergraduates with the opportunity to make a significant contribution to collaborative modeling research projects. Specifically, the goals of the TEAMS REU site are as follows: (i) provide research opportunities in a number of modeling mediums including molecular dynamics, transport phenomenon, and solid mechanics, (ii) develop students' appreciation of team diversity and collaborative efforts in research, (iii) enhance students' teamwork, communication, critical thinking, and professional skills, (iv) expose students to the importance of modeling in a number of fields, (v) transition students from pre-engineering programs into four-year degree programs, (vi) guide students to pursue graduate programs, and (vii) increase the opportunities for underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of activities are planned to meet these objectives. Some examples include developing teamwork skills, exposing students to modeling work outside the REU site, and writing workshops to enhance communication ability. The reason for developing these skills is because they are all important to modeling research. For example, modeling research is typically collaborative. As such, projects require researchers to work in a team setting and communicate their respective perspectives and expertise to their collaborative partners. Other objectives involve preparing participants for four-year or graduate programs and enhancing participation of underrepresented groups like American Indians. An example seminar is designed to guide students on how to identify and apply fora graduate program meeting their interests. With regards to research opportunities, a number of modeling projects have been designed to be completed by undergraduates within a year's time. These projects coincide with current experimental efforts and will complement those efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research site hosted at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology provided an opportunity to a number of unergraaduates to experience modeling research.   From a technical perspective, the participants all contributed to important research projects. Each of the projects involved modeling to help answer an important problem or provided additional insight into experimental research.  For example, one student used a technique called life cycle assessment to optimize the transportation network for biofuels.  From a professional development perspectiove, the site focused on providing all of the different aspects of modeling research as a whole. Specifically, modeling is inherently collaborative, so the aspects of teamwork were an integral part of the experience.  First, each student was mentored by a team and became an integral part of a research team.  In addition, explicit teamwork workshops were held to best prepare the students for participating in a research team.  Other workshops were held to improve auxilliary teamwork skills like communication.  To improve the student's perspective of modeling, they would attend weekly seminars from professionals who regularly practice modeling. These professionals performed modeling work in academia, industry, and government work. Another means for augmenting their research perspective involve large data set analysis.  Due to how modeling involves this type of analysis, the workshops were focused on organizing data and using statistics to identify whethere trends exist within the data or not.  The final perspective of collaborative modeling research is the distance aspect of research teams. After 9 weeks of training, the students would return to their home institutions.  Over the course of the calendar year, they would continue their research remotely.  They would have weekly correspondance with their mentors in order to take ownership of their research.    This level of participation allowed students to make an informed decision of whether they wanted to continue pursuing an advanced degree or be part of research in an industry setting.
