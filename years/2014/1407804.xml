<AbstractNarration>Radio astronomy has opened up new and unexpected windows on the cosmos for many decades now, and continues to provide the most definitive views of many aspects of the universe.  Construction of many new and exciting instruments and telescopes is underway or planned for the near future.  The investigators on this proposal have a strong commitment to making cutting-edge radio astronomy instrumentation available to the broadest possible user community at minimal cost and duplication of effort.  They have pioneered open-source design of the common elements that many astronomers need, and in so doing have synergized a community spirit and team effort that have gone beyond expectations and helped to fuel the current surge of exciting radio astronomy research.  In this project, they will continue that effort with a new generation of the general-purpose electronic hardware that lies at the heart of many radio instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CASPER collaboration represented by this proposal has been extremely successful in delivering open source hardware and software to the wider radio astronomy community, leading to a resurgence in radio astronomy instrumentation development at the university, national observatory, and international level. The associated science return in the last decade has been immense. This proposal would continue this work with delivery of a new generation of digital hardware through a number of new initiatives, including development of the next-generation ROACH processor board used of the kind used at observatories worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has wide-ranging broader impacts in enabling improved performance at reduced cost of a wide range of radio astronomical instrumentation.  In addition, student involvement is strong, community dissemination of design practices is broad, and there is a clear commitment to stimulation of community cooperation and sharing the excitement of advancing the state of the art of radiofrequency instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this project is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    CASPER has the following goals:  Develop the infrastructure needed for radio astronomy instrumentation and other high performance signal processing instrumentation. This includes the hardware, process flow, tools, libraries, repositories and reference instrument designs.  Facilitate knowledge transfer by workshops, web-based tools/libraries and documentation.  Facilitate the implementation of specific instrumentation with collaborators.  Engage in education and public outreach.  CASPER instrumentation is utilized at most radio observatories, and has been used to discover new planets, including a planet made from solid diamond, make the first images of the black hole at the center of our galaxy (eg: the event horizon telescope uses CASPER technology), discover roughly 1000 new pulsars, search for gravity waves (placing new limits and ruling out many models on how black holes merge), discovered the most massive pulsar ever found (ruling out many solid state theories), and discoved almost all of the known fast radio bursts (including the repeater FRB that allowed a redshift measurement and may eventually lead to measuring the baryon density of the universe).  Information is mostly disseminated via the CASPER web site (tutorials, videos, memos, schematics, libaries, gateware, GPUware, software). The CASPER workshop and CASPER mail list and CASPER github repository are also useful for dissemination.  The next annual CASPER workshop will be held August 2019 at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for  Astrophysics, with an emphasis on training students and newcomers how to design and build radio astronomy instrumentation.
