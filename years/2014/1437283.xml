<AbstractNarration>The PIs are organizing the 4th Biennial Women-in-Theory Workshop. This workshop is to take place in New York City in May 2014 immediately before the 46th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2014), in coordination with New York University and Princeton University. The intended audience of the workshop is graduate students in the field of theoretical computer science (TCS).  Motivated by the low overall number of female faculty members, researchers, and students in TCS world wide, the workshop has two goals.  The first is to deliver an invigorating educational program to the student participants by inviting leading female researchers to present tutorials of their research topics. The second is to provide an outstanding opportunity to bring together women students from different institutions across the country and internationally, so as to foster a sense of kinship and camaraderie, and to provide access to role models in this area by having senior and junior faculty members and industrial researchers present.  The format of this workshop consists of more than ten technical tutorials, one non-technical talk, a student rump session, and a panel discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first three Women-in-Theory workshops were greeted with great enthusiasm both from the participants and from the TCS research community at large. Response has been strong for this year's workshop from female students at universities across the United States.  Since the first workshop in 2008, the PIs have received overwhelmingly positive feedback and many participants have matured to be successful researchers. These serve as testimonials that the workshop is accomplishing its primary goal of helping women become more successful in TCS.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The 4th Women-in-Theory workshop was held in the Courant Institute at NYU, May 28-30, 2014. The workshop was meant for advanced undergraduate and graduate female students interested in Theoretical Computer Science. The workshop took place right before STOC 2014 in the hope of increasing the attendance of female students at STOC.

Furthermore, we had a "Google Talks" session where four Googlers talked about projects at Google that they work on and how algorithms play a part in those projects. The four speakers were: Alice Bonhomme-Biais, Joelle Skaf, Lisa Trongprakob and Farzaneh Sarafraz.   Most of the workshop included technical talks in theoretical computer science by the leading researchers. There was also one non-technical talk by Orna Kupferman about the state of women in STEM, a panel discussion and a student rump session.   On the first night we were honored to have Omer Reingold (Microsoft Research) and Nir Shavit (MIT, TAU) lead us through a session of Playback Theater. This was an amazing event that the students enjoyed very much and it helped introduce the students to one another.         We invited faculty from NYU to join the lunches and talk to the students.   More information can be found on the workshopÆs website on http://womenintheory.wordpress.com/.         Evaluation:  In our view, the workshop was a great success. The heavy emphasis on technical talks made it more specialized and relevant to the participants than general "women in science" or even "women in CS" events. The fact that we had highly accomplished technical speakers meant that the workshop was extremely attractive even to those female graduate students that identify themselves as scientists first and are sometimes hesitant to come to women-only events.  Student accommodation was arranged in undergraduate dorms. This helped keep costs down. We also arranged that the dorms would be available for the students for STOC, to encourage advisors to pay for the students to attend STOC. Also, the dorm accommodation made it easier for students to get to know each other.  Our impression was that participants liked the workshop a lot, found the talks by female researchers inspiring, and discovered a sense of community. Many told us the workshop re-energized them, and encouraged them about their research and career prospects. We did not do a complete tabulation of the anonymous evaluation forms, but overall participants rated the workshop 3.64 out of 4.   Fifteen of the students (out of 48) indicated that the will attend STOC and would not have been able to do so if they had not come to WIT. This increased the percent of female attendees at STOC in relation to prior years.             Last Modified: 07/31/2015       Submitted by: Moses Charikar]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
