<AbstractNarration>A product is said to exhibit network effects if individual consumers value it more when greater numbers of other consumers purchase or use it.  The expansion of social media and internet technology has led to the emergence of new products that display network effects (for example, multi-player online games, group buying opportunities).  It has also served to strengthen network effects for traditional products such as movies, television programs, and books by allowing individuals to easily participate in online communities built around those products. In the meantime, advances in information technology have enabled firms that sell such products to collect large quantities of data in hopes of better understanding how customers choose among multiple potential purchases.  For these firms, a significant challenge is to find ways of making product pricing and assortment planning decisions that account for network effects.  This research project will address this challenge and, in doing so, will provide methodologies that hold the potential to improve the profitability of firms engaged in internet commerce.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the project and will gain exposure to techniques of mathematical modeling and optimization, thereby providing them with sophisticated technical skills as they enter the workforce.  Consequently, the research will benefit the United States economy as well as society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will study mathematical models of customer choice behavior with network effects, and will use those models as the basis for multi-product pricing and assortment planning optimization problems.  The project will employ variations of the multinomial logit choice model, suitably modified to incorporate network effects.  In these modified models, the utility functions that drive individual customer purchase decisions are affected by overall consumption or sales levels of the products.  This feature of the choice models adds difficulty to the optimization problems, because product purchase probabilities are not merely functions of product attributes, but rather are endogenous.  This project will involve the development and analysis of approaches needed to solve these problems and will study the structure and properties of the resulting solutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This report describes outcomes from the project entitled "Revenue Management with Network Effects."  A product is said to exhibit network effects if individual consumers value it more when more other consumers use or purchase it. The expansion of internet technology, especially social media, has served to elevate the importance of studying products with network effects.  An example of a product that displays network effects is a multi-player online video game.  Individuals may enjoy such a game more, and hence assign it greater value, if there are more others playing it. This project focused on approaches to help firms that sell products with network effects make better operational decisions.    This project advanced the state of knowledge by developing and studying mathematical models that represent the purchasing behavior of customers when network effects are present, and by formulating and solving optimization problems that can be used to guide operational decisions, including pricing and assortment planning decisions, for firms that sell to such customers.    The behavioral models describe products' sales levels while accounting for network effects. The models do this by incorporating a network effect term into customers' valuations for products. Such terms are increasing in the sales of the product in question.  This yields a mathematical representation of the idea that greater sales of a product cause individual customers to value it more.  In the models, the overall level of sales of a product arises from the decisions of many individual customers, and those decisions are affected, via those individuals' valuations, by the overall level of sales.  Consequently, the modeling approach assumes that products' sales must satisfy a self-consistency or equilibrium condition.  From a technical standpoint, this means that given a seller's pricing or assortment decision, the sales quantities of its products arise as a solution of a (possibly multi-dimensional) fixed-point equation.    The optimization problems considered in this project seek to help firms make decisions.  These optimization problems assume that for a given operational decision (e.g., prices or assortment), sales are determined according to versions of the model described above.  This adds complexities to the optimization problems, which require specialized approaches and analyses that were developed within the scope of this project. Among this project's significant contributions are results that describe the structure of optimal solutions to these problems as well as algorithms that can be used to compute those solutions.  This structure may be fundamentally different from that which arises in problems without network effects. For example, in some multi-product pricing problems without network effects, it is optimal for a seller of such products to price all its products identically if demand satisfies certain homogeneity properties.   If network effects are introduced into such problems while also maintaining the homogeneity, then the form of the optimal pricing policy may change.  Specifically, it may be best for the seller to price one of the products much lower than the others in order to stimulate its sales and to profit from increased customer interest that owes to the network effects. In general, differences in the underlying customer behavior models will yield differences in the associated optimization problems and differences in the solution structure.  Another one of the contributions of this project was to create solution approaches tailored to these different optimization problems.   The project helped to expand the pool of talent in STEM disciplines through the involvement of students at the University of Minnesota.  Two PhD students contributed greatly to the project and served as co-authors on journal papers that arose from the project.  One undergraduate student worked on research related to the project. One of the PhD students and the undergraduate student are women, so the project also helped to increase the diversity of the STEM talent pool.
