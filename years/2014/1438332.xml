<AbstractNarration>SusChEM: Novel 1,2-Propanediol Biosynthesis from Renewable Feedstocks Through Enzyme Discovery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After many years of practice, the chemical industry faces sustainability challenges that arise from both the potentially dwindling feedstocks and intermediates that are derived from fossil fuels, and from the increasingly undesirable environmental costs associated with their production.  Biocatalytic syntheses, based on enzymatic conversion or microbial whole-cell synthesis, are increasingly explored as the alternate platform of chemical production. Key advantages of microbial synthesis over chemical syntheses include reaction selectivity, molecular diversity, and reduced environmental impact, and the utilization of renewable feedstocks, such as plant-based cellulosic material, instead of hydrocarbons. The successful implementation of microbial syntheses inherently addresses the sustainability challenges currently facing the chemical industry. Because natural pathways are often not suitable for large-scale chemical production, and do not lead to desired chemical products, efforts are needed into the discovery and the development of novel biosynthetic pathways for industrial chemicals.  Professors Wei Niu and Jiantao Guo at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln propose to achieve sustainable production of an industrial bulk chemical, 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO), by developing a new biosynthetic route.  1,2 PDO may be integrated into the production of other chemicals, such as n-propanol and propylene.  This study combines both the discovery and the engineering aspects of scientific research.  UN-L Students participating in this work will gain perspectives on the important aspects and synergistic effects of integrating basic science and engineering.  The multidisciplinary research activities will be used to support active recruitment of underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students to pursue studies and careers in STEM areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific goal of the proposed work is to establish the de novo biosynthesis of 1,2-propanediol, an industrial bulk chemical and a natural product, from renewable feedstocks through the reduction of a common fermentation product, lactic acid.  Application of the two known 1,2-PDO biosynthetic routes is limited either by the scarce availability of the starting material or the involvement of cytotoxic biosynthetic intermediate.  The PIs seek to overcome these limitations by establishing novel 1,2-PDO pathways using two parallel approaches.  The first one is a discovery-driven approach that focuses on identifying the genetic and catalytic elements that function in the poorly understood lactic acid reduction pathway in Lactobacillus buchneri, which produces 1,2-PDO under anoxic growth conditions.  The second one is a design and engineering-driven approach that focuses on the development of a novel artificial 1,2-PDO biosynthetic pathway, which entails the activation of lactic acid as lactoyl-CoA followed by two sequential reduction steps to form 1,2-PDO. This pathway would also enable the stereospecific biosynthesis of R- and S-1,2-PDO stereoisomers. Niu and Guo will apply protein engineering to improve the catalytic efficiency of the bottleneck enzyme, the CoA-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase.  To facilitate rational mutagenesis, efforts will be directed to obtain the crystal structure of the protein, of which the family is underrepresented in available protein structure database.  In addition, the proposed work will establish a novel growth-coupled selection scheme to allow rapid sampling of large number of enzyme mutants.  The selection scheme has the potential to be adapted for directed evolution of other enzymes that have similar cofactor requirement.</AbstractNarration>

This bio-based process can potentially be integrated into the production of chemicals derived from 1,2-PDO, and therefore to address the feedstock sustainability and environmental impact issues of the chemical industry at a grander scale.</p> <p>We devised an artificial 1,2-PDO biosynthetic pathway through the reduction of lactic acid (Figure 1).&nbsp; In addition to the elimination of highly cytotoxic intermediate of a natural pathway, the designed pathway enables stereospecific conversions of D- or L-lactic acid into <em>R- </em>or <em>S-</em>1,2-PDO, respectively.&nbsp; One major challenge in the implementation of this pathway lies in the slow kinetics of a key pathway enzyme, PduP.&nbsp; To facilitate the enzyme engineering efforts, we constructed a biosensor system, which consists of transcriptional factor (PocR) and promoter sequence of <em>pdu</em> operon from <em>Salmonella </em>(Figure 2A).&nbsp; The sensor system has an apparent <em>K<sub>m</sub></em> value of 0.080 mM towards 1,2-PDO (Figure 2B). &nbsp;It also responds to other vicinal diols, but with much lower affinity (Figure 2C).&nbsp; The biosensor was integrated in the high-throughput screening workflow in the directed evolution of PduP to identify mutants with improved catalytic activities.&nbsp; A second challenge in 1,2-PDO microbial production is the design of host strain that can provide sufficient reducing equivalents to achieve maximal titer and yield.&nbsp; We constructed an <em>E. coli</em> &Delta;8 strain, which has deregulated oxidative branch of the TCA cycle under the reduced oxygen condition.&nbsp; When the 1,2-PDO pathway is expressed in this host, <em>R</em>-1,2-PDO<em> </em>was produced at 17.3 g/L (42.2% molar yield) from glucose using a two-stage, fermenter-controlled condition (Figure 3A).&nbsp; Biosynthesis of <em>S-</em>1,2-PDO at 9.3 g/L (23.2% molar yield) was achieved using host &Delta;8 lldh (Figure 3B), which has the <em>E. coli </em>native <em>ldhA </em>gene replaced by a <em>lldh </em>gene from <em>Pediococcus acidilactici</em>.&nbsp; Analysis confirmed that the microbially produced 1,2-PDO was at high optical purity, 97.5% <em>ee </em>(<em>R</em>) and 99.3% <em>ee </em>(<em>S</em>) (Figure 4).&nbsp; We also demonstrated the biosynthesis of 1,2-PDO through the direct reduction of lactic acid using Carboxylic Acid Reductases (CARs) (Figure 5).&nbsp; To improve the kinetics of the overall pathway, we seek to apply the enzyme co-localization strategy to break the kinetic barrier. &nbsp;Our research on the detailed mechanism of enzyme encapsulation into carboxysomes reveals a previously unidentified structural motif in the large subunit of RuBisCO that is essential for the process. &nbsp;The motif is also capable of targeting other protein to the carboxysome shell, which can potentially encapsulate enzymes of the artificial 1,2-PDO biosynthetic pathway.<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p> <p>The education component of the project focused on the integration of research and education activities.&nbsp; The PI (Niu) developed a new undergraduate/graduate course, Molecular Bioengineering (CHME477/877), at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.&nbsp; The course focuses on protein engineering, synthetic biology and systems biology.&nbsp; Major research subjects of this project, including biocatalysis, enzyme evolution, and microbial production of bio-based chemicals are integrated in the course.&nbsp; During the project period, the PI (Niu) and co-PI (Guo) provided training and research opportunities to eight undergraduate students, five graduate students, and one postdoctoral researcher. &nbsp;In addition to conducting research, these students were also trained for effective communication of scientific concepts to the general public through editing entries in Wikipedia.&nbsp; The PI (Niu) and co-PI (Guo) actively recruited women and underrepresented students through this research project.&nbsp; The research experiences will have long and lasting impact for their future career choice in the STEM field.</p> <p>The PI (Niu) and co-PI (Guo) are committed to outreach activities.&nbsp; Together with two other University of Nebraska-Lincoln faculty members, they organized and mentored undergraduate iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) teams from the university for three consecutive years (2016-2018).&nbsp; The 2016 team is the first iGEM team from the State of Nebraska.&nbsp; The team of each year consisted of six undergraduate students with a good gender balance.&nbsp; The 2016 team was awarded with a silver medal and the 2017 team was awarded with a gold medal.&nbsp; Throughout the summer, teams participated in Museum Night at the Nebraska State Museum, where they educated museum attendees, mainly consisting of young kids and their parents, about synthetic biology and a range of scientific topics, such as genetically modified organisms and greenhouse gases.&nbsp; The students also served as ambassadors of synthetic biology through discussions with their peers and giving presentations to local biotechnology companies.&nbsp; The 2016 team won the team volunteer of the year award from the Nebraska State Museum.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/31/2018<br>      Modified by: Wei&nbsp;Niu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1438332/1438332_10323108_1541015241811_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1438332/1438332_10323108_1541015241811_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1438332/1438332_10323108_1541015241811_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1.
