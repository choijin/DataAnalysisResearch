<AbstractNarration>The award funds research on the relationship between monetary policy and the term structure of interest rates (how interest rates with the length/term of a loan).   Understanding this relationship is important for central bankers, who need to understand how their actions affect long-term interest rates and therefore the economy as a whole.  Investors also want to understand this relationship, because it is important for making the best possible investment decisions. Previous research has demonstrated that the credibility of a central bank is an important factor in this relationship.  If a central bank has no credibility, then its current decisions do not affect investors' expectations about the future and likely future interest rates.  Alternative, a bank might have "full commitment", where it chooses a monetary policy rule and does not make any changes in that rule over long time periods.  This project defines commitment possibilities between these two options, in which a central bank has the ability to commit to future plans but may sometimes revise these plans.  The research team will use data and a model of the US economy to identify past periods where the Federal Reserve made changes in previous commitments and will then explore how these episodes affected term structures.  The results of the project will give policymakers and investors new insight into the pros and cons of central bank commitments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project considers a general framework of optimal monetary policy where credibility is defined as the ability to commit to previously announced plans; this nests the commonly used cases in the literature of full commitment and no commitment.  The definition of credibility is based on the theoretical literature on time-inconsistency and estimated within a fully optimizing model.  The estimation framework uses recent Bayesian econometric techniques in the context of regime-switching models which allows the identification of historical episodes where Fed re-optimizations were more likely to have occurred.  The project will evaluate the quantitative effects of re-optimization episodes on the term premium.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project deals with a crucial component of the transmission of monetary policy actions to the overall economy, i.e. the effect of monetary policy on long term interest rates.  This is important because, even though the direct tool of monetary policy is the short term interest rate, what is typically more relevant for consumer and firm decisions is some longer term interest rate.      While there is a large economics literature that has studied the relationship between monetary policy and long term interest rates, this project focuses on the relatively unexplored role of central bank credibility.  The literature has dealt with the issue of central bank credibility by considering only the two extreme cases of full credibility or no credibility. Yet neither of these two dichotomous cases seems reasonable in practice.  We use a general framework to model optimal monetary policy where credibility is defined as the ability of the central bank to resist the temptation to renege on past promises, and can take on any value on a continuum spanning zero credibility to full credibility.  The response of bond interest rates to monetary policy decisions is then crucially dependent on the public?s perception of the level of central bank credibility.      In the first part of the project we study a simple theoretical model and consider the effects of different hypothetical levels of credibility from zero credibility to full credibility.  We find that depending on the level of central bank credibility, investors in the model can view long-term bonds either as increasing the risk of their portfolio or as providing a hedge.  We also show how a central bank policy decision to forgo past promises (termed a re-optimization) is transmitted from short rate decisions to medium and longer term interest rates.     In the second part of the project we conduct an empirical investigation of the Federal Reserve?s credibility using a structural model that is popular in the literature.  We find that the Federal Reserve is credible to some extent, but that credibility is not perfect.  An analysis of the historical effects in U.S. data reveals that re-optimization episodes have the biggest effect on medium term interest rates, so that 1 year bond rates respond more than 3 month or 10 year bond rates.      Overall our results provide a better understanding of the mechanisms through which central bank actions affect longer term interest rates. The results also suggest that there is scope for the Federal Reserve to meaningfully improve its credibility to help the financial markets predict and prepare for its policy decisions.  Finally, the empirical tools developed in this project can be readily applied to other central banks around the world.
