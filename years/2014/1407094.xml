<AbstractNarration>The number of potential applications for manufactured nanomaterials (NMs) is growing exponentially around the world, without concomitant research into the possible consequences of inadvertent or purposeful releases into the environment.  Fish and other aquatic organisms reside in bodies of water where NMs are likely to be disposed.  A growing body of evidence suggests that some NMs, depending on their composition, size or surface functionalization, can affect fish health.   The goal of this study is to evaluate if NMs can interfere with fish reproductive behavior.   This project is important because alterations in behavior can have devastating genetic and population effects. The research proposed here will fill a large gap in the understanding of the ecotoxicological implications of engineered NMs that may be released into the environment. Ultimately, studies like this one will influence NM development by clearly defining the characteristics that make NMs bio-active and that should be considered in manufacturing and future environmental regulatory policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this thesis research is that NMs introduced into fish orally through gavage can penetrate through the intestine into the blood stream and then partition into organs where they can further impact with cellular mechanisms including steriodogenesis.  Orally dosed quantum dots (QDs) cross the gut epithelium and accumulate in various tissues including the gonads, suggesting they may have profound effects on tissue function.  This project will specifically address a new hypothesis that NMs are able to interfere with reproductive behaviors of fathead minnows.  It is known that endogenous or exogenous steroid hormones control reproductive behavior of fish.    The specific hypotheses to be tested are (A)  that functionalized QDs will be internalized into testis and interfere with steroidogenesis and alter male reproductive behavior, and (B) that single walled carbon nanotubes will bind and sequester exogenously added ethinylestradiol and inhibit feminization of male behavior.  These hypotheses will be tested using in vivo studies to determine the interactions between NMs and environmental estrogen (EE) on gene expression and competitive reproductive behavior in fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas.  The expected outcomes are that (1) SWCNTs will reduce EE bioavailability and ultimately alter nest holding and defending behavior, (2) QDs will cause reproductive behavioral deficits in FHMs, and (3) that the effects produced by QDs will be exacerbated by EE co-exposure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nanomaterials (NMs) are very small materials that are used in a number of different products around the world and are released into the environment where they come into contact with aquatic organisms.  To date, not much is understood about the toxicity of NMs to the environment and the organisms within.    Graduate student, Candice Lavelle, had tested they hypothesis that NMs introduced into fish orally through gavage penetrate through the intestine into the blood stream and partition into organs where they impact cellular mechanisms. Her results showed that NMs penetrated the blood stream after ingestion and accumulated in the intestine, liver, gonads, and kidneys, among other organs in female and male fathead minnows.  However, changing the molecules on the surface of the NMs (functionalization) governed the extent of tissue penetration and the subcellular distribution.    An important finding is that these materials can enter the cells surrounding developing eggs called  follicle cells, which are critical to steroid hormone synthesis.  Our results suggest that the NMs appear to interfere with steroidogenesis with the potential of affecting fish reproductive behavior.  The doctoral research grant from NSF extended her research to test a new hypothesis that functionalized NMs were able to interfere with reproductive behavior in fathead minnows. To test this hypothesis she performed reproductive behavior tests of fathead minnows after oral gavage with functionalized single walled carbon nanotubes.  For this research she characterized the size, surface charge and dynamic radius of the NMs she used in the experiments and their ability to bind to ethinylestradiol (EE2), a potent environmental estrogen that is found as a component of birth control and  is known to alter the nesting behavior of male fish.  We noted that carbon NMs exposed to EE2 needed to be centrifuged with an ultracentrifuge to separate the bound and free EE2.  The unbound EE2 hat was collected from  centrifuged NMs (spun group) was used in behavior studies in addition to the mixture of EE2 and NMs that were not ultracentrifuged (not spun group).  The behavior test was to place control male fish (unexposed to estrogen or NMs) in competition with treated male fish (EE2 alone, NMs alone, or NMs+EE2 (spun or not spun)) in tanks with a reproductive female fish and determine which of the male fish was able to guard a nest and spawn with the female.  The nest-holder was recorded as the male (identified by fin clip) that spent more than half of the observation period in the nest in addition to performing nest tending and defending behaviors.    As predicted by her hypothesis, treatment with EE2 alone feminized male fish and made them less able to hold the nest. Male fish treated with NMs treated with EE2 but not spun were also feminized (one experiment) or not different from controls (second experiment). However, to our surprise male fish treated with the unbound fraction of EE2 from the ultracentrifuged carbon NMs bound to 0.21 ng/ul EE2 were more likely to be dominant, suggesting that this low level of EE2 elicited a compensatory feedback mechanism in the fish that resulted in behavioral dominance.  We also measured vitellogenin (the egg yolk protein) production in the treated fish. Vitellogenin is a gene that is only expressed in the presence of estrogen in male fish.  NMs that were not centrifuged elicited vitellogenin suggesting that this preparation was estrogenic to the fish, while those that were centrifuged did not which also supports the compensatory feedback mechanism suggested by the behavior experiment.  This work suggested that NMs could interfere with hormonal signals in fish and thus alter behavior that relies on the neuroendocrine system.
