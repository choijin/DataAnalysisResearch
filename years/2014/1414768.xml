<AbstractNarration>Commodity plastics, from grocery bags to touch screens, are ubiquitous in the American lifestyle and critical to our economy.  Among these, materials made from block copolymers have become increasingly widespread, including extensive use in 3D printing, numerous shock resistant applications, and as fillers in asphalt. Current commercial block copolymers are typically molecular chains with two or three chemically distinct segments, or "blocks." While incorporating multiple chemistries into the block copolymer yields very interesting and often desirable properties, expanding the number of blocks past three can often enhance those properties, making even more valuable materials known as multiblock copolymers (MBCs). Understanding the properties and molecular behavior of MBCs is currently limited by their difficult synthesis. A series of MBCs containing polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) using thiol-ene radical coupling that was recently synthesized will be characterized to advance our understanding of MBC behavior. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Mikehito Takenaka, a world-class morphologist, at Kyoto University in Japan to help guide MBC use in possible commercial applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MBCs to be used in this study are comprised of PS and PEO chained together using thiol-ene radical coupling. PS and PEO block copolymers undergo phase separation if their molecular weights are sufficiently high due to their poor chemical mismatch parameter.  Three MBCs will be studied: one that is expected to phase separate strongly, one weakly, and one not at all. The resulting morphologies will be analyzed by grazing incident small angle x-ray scattering and standard small angle x-ray scattering. Transmission electron microscopy and electron tomography will yield both 2D and 3D images of the materials. This data is expected to both broaden MBC knowledge and potential applications. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The focus of this NSF EAPSI award was the study of phase separation in polystyrene/polyethylene oxide (PS/PEO) multiblock copolymers made by the thiol-norbornene click reaction.  The PS/PEO system is of particular interest because of its use in numerous purification and energy applications.  Notably, PS/PEO has attracted significant attention as solid state electrolytes in lithium ion batteries, due to the ion conducting capabilities of PEO and the ability for rigid PS domains to resist lithium dendritic growth.  Multiblock copolymers, particularly those made via step growth addition, represent a unique but poorly understood class of materials with potentially useful properties for the aforementioned applications.  Through this award, PS/PEO multiblock copolymers were synthesized at the University of Massachusetts and characterized at the Department of Polymer Chemistry at Kyoto University.  A volume fraction series of PS/PEO multiblock copolymer samples were synthesized, varying the length of the PS and PEO block.  Sample molecular weight and number of blocks were characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermal properties by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and phase separation by small/wide angle X-ray scattering (S/WAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  At room temperature, samples with insufficiently long block lengths were dominated by crystallization driven phase separation.  Samples with more symmetric volume fractions and longer block lengths maintained phase separation above the PEO melting temperature.  Disordered microphase separation was observed for the longest block sample by TEM, with discrete domains visible, but no long range order present.  After the conclusion of the EAPSI program, these nine samples were further characterized at the University of Massachusetts, and the sum of those results and the results from the EAPSI are currently being compiled for publication.  The EAPSI has proven vital for this study, and has also fostered a new collaboration between the University of Massachusetts and Kyoto University.
