<AbstractNarration>The connectivity of brain circuits is central to how sensory information is processed, motor activity coordinated, memories stored and retrieved, and how behaviors emerge. While new physical connections can form and old ones be eliminated, much of brain processing depends on how synaptic inputs are integrated and how their strengths are dynamically adjusted. To understand neural connectivity one must develop the means to directly manipulate synaptic transmission by controlling the neurotransmitter-gated receptors of synapses. We propose to do this by engineering optical control into neurotransmitter-gated G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These light-controlled receptors can answer questions at every scale of analysis of the nervous system, from elucidating the contribution of a specific subtype of a neurotransmitter receptor to transmission and plasticity, to the events in a single dendritic spine, to understanding the role of pre- and postsynaptic receptors in neural computations, to understanding the synaptic basis of circuit operations and the role of those circuits in behavior and sensation. An additional and critical part of the project is tool dissemination and web-based tutorials, which will be a high priority for the researchers. Training will be provided to the broader scientific community during the annual Berkeley Advanced Imaging and Microscopy workshop. The proposal involves an international collaboration in research and training with Israel, which will expose students from the US and Israel to the expertise of the labs in the collaborating countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GPCRs form the largest class of membrane signaling proteins. They respond to a wide-array of stimuli. The roles of many GPCRs in neural circuits and behavior are not well-understood. Part of the problem is that the same GPCR may be found on presynaptic excitatory and inhibitory nerve terminals, postsynaptic dendritic spines and on associated glial processes. Another is that even though multiple GPCRs in a cell may couple to the same G-protein they often activate distinct targets due to molecular interactions that localize them to specific protein complexes. Thus, to determine the function of a GPCR one needs tools for that are subtype and cell-type specific, that are spatially precise, and that are rapid and reversible.  In this project, individual full-length GPCRs that can be activated or blocked by light will be developed. Specifically, light-gated versions of the group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) will be engineered and then used to study synaptic plasticity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project outcomes     The connectivity of brain circuits is central to how sensory information is processed, motor activity coordinated, memories stored and retrieved, and how behaviors emerge. While new physical connections can form and old ones be eliminated, much of brain processing depends on how synaptic inputs are integrated and how their strengths are dynamically adjusted. Progress in brain research has been revolutionized by optogenetic tools that use microbial opsins to excite or inhibit firing of specific neurons. But to understand connectivity, one must go farther and develop the means to directly manipulate synaptic transmission by controlling the neurotransmitter-gated receptors of synapses. We have developed a powerful strategy to engineer optical control into synaptic neurotransmitter-gated G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The goal of our NSF-EAGER effort was to expand the LimGluR toolkit and deploy these tools in the mouse for brain circuit analysis in vivo.  We began our effort by addressing several challenges for optical control of mGluRs in the brain:  a)      We have tuned our photoswitches to respond to 2-photon illumination with the aim of enabling deep optical control with unparalleled 3D confinement in order to make it possible to control signaling in structures as small as a single synapse.     b)      We have created a new photoswitch design in which bio-orthogonal attachment is achieved using SNAPtag technology. With this we created an entirely new and much more effective LimGluR toolkit. And we made it possible to multiplex optical control so that more than one signaling protein can be manipulated at a time.     c)      We developed a method for detecting the structural changes in GPCRs that occur when their function is turned on and discovered control principles that endow them with distinct properties of activation and that boost their activity.     These studies were described in 4 published papers (in Nature, Neuron, PNAS and ACS Chemical Science) and one paper under review (in PNAS).
