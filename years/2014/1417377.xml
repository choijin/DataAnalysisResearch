<AbstractNarration>Many people have argued that the diminishing summer Arctic sea ice extent will result in enhanced growth of small aquatic plants and, consequently, the small marine animals (zooplankton) that feed upon these plants.  These animals are the preferred prey of larger animals that are important sources of subsistence and commercial harvest for local Arctic residents.  This proposed project explores the idea that the nutritional value of the zooplankton may be altered as their numbers and total mass increase.  Thus, predicting the impact of an increase in zooplankton may not be as straightforward as previously assumed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is motivated by the hypothesis that the impact of future climate change on high-latitude planktivores, such as seabirds, fish, and bowhead whales, will come as much through changes in their prey quality (individual size and lipid content) as through changes in their prey biomass?with decreases in quality often accompanying and outweighing increases in biomass. To explore this hypothesis, the PIs will develop and apply a new kind of model that links climate forcing to impacts on planktivores via the life-history patterns of large zooplankton. A set of coordinated regional and large-scale model applications will examine specific, local versions of the central hypothesis as it applies to calanoid copepods and their predators, in the process refining the model, ensuring its cross-region portability, and also integrating a number of rich US and European zooplankton datasets for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will initiate and expand an array of collaborations among researchers in the US and Denmark. These collaborations include capacity-building and a postdoc exchange with the Centre for Ocean Life at the Technical University of Denmark, the leading center of trait-based marine research.  Furthermore, using leveraged support from the IGERT Program on Ocean Change at the University of Washington, the PI will visit the Greenland Climate Research Centre (Nuuk) to work with M. Simon and other colleagues on formulating a new, student-centered collaboration on indigenous seafood security and human dimensions of climate change. This is also an opportunity to share early model results with zooplankton, fisheries, and marine mammal researchers there, and develop new applied research directions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding and predicting the impacts of ongoing environmental changes on fish, seabirds, and marine mammals in high-latitude regions is extremely difficult because of the complexity of the linkages between environment and prey availability for these animals.  One fundamental problem is that oceanographic studies tend to emphasize bulk measures such as marine primary production or standing stock of plankton while studies of fish, seabirds, and mammals need information on their prey quality (size, energy content) and availability.  This project developed and tested a new mathematical model to overcome this mismatch.  The Coltrane (Copepod Life history Traits and Adaptation to New Environments) model is a mathematical framework for coupling multiple characteristics of zooplankton biology to models of physical oceanography (e.g., currents, water temperature).  The Coltrane model focuses on the large, lipid-rich crustaceans (copepods of the genus Calanus) that dominate zooplankton biomass in arctic seas and that serve as key prey for seabirds, marine mammals, and fish.  It focuses on 1) the life-history traits (growth rate, development rate (how fast does it progress through different life stages), adult size, starvation limits), 2) population dynamics (the balance between gains through reproduction and losses through predation); and 3) community composition (the combination of traits that permit the crustaceans to flourish under different environmental conditions).   The model was developed using information from 45 lab studies of copepod growth and development that showed there are two species-specific combinations of traits that control body size and to a large extent life history: 1) A relative development rate strategy (reaching maturity slowly or quickly, relative to other copepods at similar water temperatures) and 2) a relative growth rate strategy (growing slowly or quickly for its size relative to other species).  The model was tested on both global and local spatial scales.  For the global-scale experiment, the model correctly predicted life strategy 1) or 2) for large Calanus species with multiple generations per year in some regions and multiple years per generation in other regions, corresponding to observations. In an experiment emulating conditions in Disko Bay, West Greenland, the model predicted trait combinations for animals sizes that matched those of three coexisting Calanus species, from small animals (adult weight ~100 &mu;g carbon) with reproduction once per year timed to match each year's phytoplankton bloom through large ones (adult weight &gt;1000 &mu;g carbon) that reproduce months before the spring phytoplankton bloom and require multiple years to reach adulthood.  The Coltrane model is currently being applied to understand the impacts of large-scale sea-ice loss changes in the Arctic Ocean on the large crustaceans (and ultimately the seabirds, marine mammals, and fish that use the copepods as prey), the response of the food web to warm-cold year variation in the Pacific Ocean, and factors influencing zooplankton strategies in Antarctica.
