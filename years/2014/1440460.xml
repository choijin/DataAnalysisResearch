<AbstractNarration>The National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), in collaboration with the National Park Service and other organizations, will organize a climate adaptation science and education workshop that will focus on engaging diverse public audiences in learning about climate adaptation. The outcomes of the workshop will include: a strong regional network to continue and sustain the initiative; a strategic plan for Sandy Hook that will result in model for using parks as laboratories for climate adaptation education; and the identification of existing climate adaptation education projects that can inform the strategic plan and the model.  These outcomes will have broad relevance for the many environmental science and education projects funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop, centered on Gateway National Recreation Area and surrounding New York/New Jersey communities, will engage diverse stakeholders including community members, research scientists, park staff, and others. Participants will assess and further develop research findings that reveal the potential of place-based contexts, such as parks and recreation areas, as settings for learning about global adaptation issues such as sea level rise, impacts on fish habitat due to inundation and changes in water quality, impacts on recreational fishery, and coastal resilience.  Workshop findings will be disseminated broadly through the NPCA national network, national parks, and other organizations concerned with climate adaptation education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Communities and Sandy Hook Partnering to Build Resilience to Climate Change  Workshop Summary     In an effort to promote cross discipline collaboration, incorporate community perspective, and use the "power of place" through a hands-on approach to climate change, the project partners including the National Parks Conservation Association, the National Park Service, the Sandy Hook Foundation, Virginia Tech, Rutgers University and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) held a workshop in New Jersey at the Sandy Hook Unit of Gateway National Recreation Area in October 2014. The one-day workshop assembled nearly 70 participants including experts from various fields along with diverse community members to educate one another and share strategies for readying their park and towns for future changes. Land managers, elected officials, government leaders, scientists, and community members shared perspectives and proposed projects to improve the regionÆs resilience to a changing climate. By leveraging the unique qualities of the national park, the workshop and subsequent proposed adaptation projects helped stakeholders advance climate science learning within their community.   Goals for the Day:  Communicate what science reveals about how climate change is affecting the environment and communities in the Sandy Hook region with a diverse group of local community members and park staff. Discuss a possible vision for the future of the Sandy Hook Unit of Gateway National Recreation Area and the surrounding region.  Identify potential projects where people are excited to work together to better understand climate science, and use this collaboration to anticipate and adapt to potential impacts. Form working groups to advance climate adaptation project planning, funding, and implementation.   Area scientists and community experts presented on local climate science and participated in a panel discussion in the morning session. Presenters provided context and background information for the afternoon group session, focusing on relevant climate change science, including sea level rise, as well as perspectives on building resilience at Sandy Hook and surrounding communities. Despite their diverse professional backgrounds, similar concerns were expressed including sea level rise and the associated challenges such as loss of infrastructure, threats to human health, and effects on sanitation and water supplies. The consensus was that practices that have historically been used may no longer be applicable.   A professional facilitator guided the group through the day. In addition to the panel discussion, the afternoon session used the World Caf&eacute; method, a highly participatory, small group process, to maximize community participation, capture current best practices, and brainstorm co-beneficial climate adaptation project concepts.  Although the initial objective was to identify 1-2 implementable projects, the high level of stakeholder interest combined with the highly interactive workshop process resulted in seven possible projects:  Regional Resilience &amp; Municipal Coordination Plan Fort Hancock Model House Political Network for Advocacy and Fundraising Future Footprint Plan Education and Climate Literacy A: Living Laboratory and Community Center Education and Climate Literacy B: K-12 Education and Climate Literacy C:  All else   At the end of the workshop, participants sought to further their involvement by joining project implementation working groups and 12 were willing to serve in a leadership capacity. Additionally, participants could sign up to stay informed of projects, in which they didn't have the capacity or interest to have direct involvement. The approach and lessons learned from this workshop can help inform other community engagement efforts by the project partners and the communities they serve.   Annually, national parks receive more than 278 million visitors. Parks in urban areas, where approximately 80% of th...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
