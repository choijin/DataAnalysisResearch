<AbstractNarration>Surface tides supply about one terawatt of power to internal tides as they propagate up and over large topographic features. Most of the energy of these internal tides propagates away from the generation regions in the form of low-mode internal tides. The ultimate fate of this energy is unknown and has a large impact on the global distribution of ocean properties. Previous studies of low-mode internal tide propagation have observed regions where the internal tide was diffuse and exhibited complex interference patterns, making it difficult to close the energy budget. The Tasman Sea differs from previous sites because it is believed to contain one of the most energetic and focused internal-tide beams in the world. The beam is generated south of New Zealand, propagates 1,500 km across the Tasman Sea, and strikes the Tasman continental margin. This project called T-Beam will document the rate of decay of a focused internal tide beam, compare the measured flux convergence with novel in situ measurements of turbulent mixing, and investigate the dynamical processes responsible for the observed decay. The results from T-Beam should lead to significant improvement in parameterizations of internal-wave induced mixing in global climate models. A major goal of the analysis is to compare in situ internal tide fluxes with those inferred from satellite altimetry; the latter are known to be biased low in the presence of strong mesoscale currents but the extent of the bias is not well documented. T-Beam investigators have established collaborations with Australian scientists who will complement the T-Beam measurements with a suite of synergistic geological and biological analyses. During the field campaign, T-Beam investigators will prepare press releases and publish a daily blog. Undergraduate and graduate students in the United States and Australia will be offered the opportunity for at-sea experience, modeling and analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In T-Beam, the investigators will obtain high-resolution estimates of internal-tide energy flux and dissipation rates in the Tasman Sea. The study site is favorable because it has a single strong generation region, contains a long energetic and confined internal-tide "beam", and is sheltered from remotely generated internal tides. The proposed experiment will be highly coordinated with the NSF-funded Tasmanian Tidal Dissipation Experiment (T-TIDE), which will examine the dissipation of the internal tide as it shoals on the Tasmanian continental slope. T-Beam will enhance T-TIDE by providing synoptic measurements of incident internal-tide energy flux that will reduce uncertainties in estimates of the fraction of energy flux that is dissipated over the continental slope. T-TIDE will enhance T-Beam by providing additional observations (adaptive glider sampling and shipboard surveying) to help identify mechanisms and better constrain the open-ocean decay rates observed during T-Beam.  A decade ago, the Hawaiian Ocean Mixing Experiment (HOME) provided a comprehensive look at the internal tide generation process. Together, T-Beam and T-TIDE will complete that life cycle by providing the first comprehensive observations of an internal-tide beam as it propagates through the open ocean and dissipates on a continental slope. The Schmidt Ocean Institute is providing 28 days of ship time coincident with T-TIDE. This project will deploy a two-month mooring situated in the center of the observable internal-tide beam, conduct intensive ship-based surveys of density, velocity and turbulence to resolve the along- and across-beam spatial structure, and numerically model the formation, variability, and dissipation of internal-tide beams in the presence of arbitrary topography and mesoscale variability.</AbstractNarration>

The Tasman sea is a perfect laboratory for this kind of study&nbsp; because&nbsp; it contains one of the most energetic and focused internal-tide ``beams? in the world. The beam is generated south of New Zealand, propagates 1,500 km across the Tasman Sea, and strikes the Tasman continental margin. The observations used a combination of shipboard data from a 3 week cruise on the R/V <em>Falkor</em> and long-term moored oceanographic instrumentation. We successfully deployed and recovered a full depth ocean mooring during the life span of this experiment. The results from T-Beam were compared to satellite estimates of the magnitude and location of the internal tide and detailed what features were not captured by satellite observations. From the observations, we found that there was very little decay of the internal tide beam due to mixing&nbsp; during the internal tide's propagation across the Tasman Sea. The Tasman Sea is also a region of strong mesoscale activity which may act to modify the strength and location of the internal tide beam. T-Beam successfully quantified the effect of the mesoscale activity on the internal tide beam and presented a new parameterization that the community can use to map out the effect of the mesoscale on the internal tide. Before, during and after our field program, we conducted several public outreach programs related to T-Beam which included 1) numerous teleconference interviews and one-on-one correspondence also enhanced the middle school science curriculum at Los Alamos Middle School, 2) participation of four graduate students and two early-career non-PhD volunteers on the research cruise who gained technical knowledge and experience by participated in the cruise, 3) presentation of the project results to undergraduate physics majors at the University of Minnesota Duluth, Concordia College (Moorehead, MN) and Gustavus Adalphus College (St. Peter, MN), 4) contributed to an at-sea blog (https://scripps.ucsd.edu/projects/ttide/blog/) viewed by several thousand people over the course of the project, and 5) discussed physical oceanography and limnology with more than 200 elementary school students during the R/V Blue Heron's ``Science on Deck'' open house in Duluth, MN.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/03/2019<br>      Modified by: Amy&nbsp;F&nbsp;Waterhouse</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1434722/1434722_10315411_1570119869421_jpo-d-17-0116.1-f1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1434722/1434722_10315411_1570119869421_jpo-d-17-0116.1-f1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Map of the T-Beam study site"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1434722/1434722_10315411_1570119869421_jpo-d-17-0116.1-f1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Map of the T-Beam study site"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Internal tide beam in the Tasman Sea.
