<AbstractNarration>Over a three-year period, this International Research Experience for Students (IRES) program will engage  two U.S. undergraduate and two U.S. graduate students annually, for a total of twelve participants, at research sites in Greenland and Denmark to study Arctic microbiology and biogeochemistry under multiple climate change scenarios.  Following required training and research preparation at the University of Montana, students travel to Copenhagen for orientation and introduction to international mentors before they depart for three weeks of field work in Greenland.   Throughout, students are co-mentored by William Holben, the U.S. principal investigator (PI), and a team of experts associated with the Greenlandic Center for Permafrost Studies (CENPERM), a center that is administered by the University of Copenhagen and the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland.   Each student's research training will include experience with planning and implementing field strategies for permafrost, ice sheet, and hot spring and glacier sampling in a way that promotes student ownership of individual projects, while facilitating the integration of multiple data sets obtained throughout the duration of this IRES activity.  Results are expected to contribute to what is known about thawing permafrost and accelerated microbial decomposition of large amounts of organic matter stored in Arctic ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following each season of fieldwork and sample processing in Greenland, participants return to Copenhagen to prepare collected samples for metagenomic DNA and mRNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. These will be studied for patterns of microbial community change that reflect differing and changing environmental parameters.  Upon returning to Montana students will continue the computational and bioinformatic aspects of their studies.  Results should provide new insights into microbial community structure and activities on sheet ice and glaciers, as well as microbial biogeochemical cycling contributions to greenhouse gas emissions from permafrost soils. Over the course of this IRES program, the U.S. and CENPERM partners expect to deepen their collaboration through international teamwork, research training, and cultural interaction, as they mentor and engage a cadre of diverse students, including Native Americans, to become the next generation of climate change experts.  For broader impact, all participating U.S. students will benefit from early career experience with the kind of long-term relationship, professional network and research collaboration that is increasingly necessary to address complex global ecological issues.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of the IRES: Research Training in Climate Change Microbiology in Greenland and Denmark Program was to create an international learning organization via collaboration with a cadre of international Arctic researchers based in Greenland and Denmark. This was accomplished through intercultural and international training of U.S. students to instill both the experience and desire to address globally important ecological problems by working in collaborative and interdisciplinary international teams. We also sought to advance our research objectives as well as those of our Danish colleagues. The first goal was met through undergraduate and graduate student participation through the 3-year funding cycle. One graduate student (Samuel Pannoni) and two undergraduates (Kaitlyn Grenager and Caitlin Pattee) and PI Holben participated in summer 2016 international research activities. For 2017, two graduate students Teagan Hayes and Samuel Pannoni) and two undergraduates (Patricia Estrella and Christopher Peterson) were selected for participation. PhD student Samuel Pannoni was a repeat participant to ensure continuity of the research and because of his excellent skills and prior experience in Greenland. For 2018, two wildlife biology graduate students (Brandon Davis a 1<sup>st</sup>-generation student and Samuel Pannoni, repeat participant to ensure continuity) and two undergraduates (Charlotte Langner [Biochemistry] and Megan Franz [Chemistry]) were selected for participation. Through the duration of the program, the typical student experience was 2 - 4 weeks of intensive bench-training in the PI&rsquo;s lab at the University of Montana to be better prepared for the protocols to be used in Denmark, travel to Akureyrie, Iceland to meet up with other international researchers for the charter plane that took the larger group to Zackenberg, Greenland for field operations at Zackenberg Ecological Research Operations (ZERO). Field sampling in Greenland was next followed by travel to Denmark for 4 &ndash; 5 weeks of intensive laboratory research analyzing the field samples with Danish mentors and peers. On return to Montana, most students stayed on with the cohort for the remainder of the year to participate in follow-on data analysis. In terms of advancing our research objectives as well as those of our Danish colleagues, progress was made on several fronts. We&rsquo;ve expanded our comparative ungulate microbiome studies to include an isolated population of muskox in an isolated Geographic area (Greenland) that represents an excellent outgroup a number of studies being performed on ungulates in the Rocky Mountain Northwest of the U.S. We&rsquo;ve participated, along with a number of U.S. undergraduate and graduate students, in larger international research projects related to climate change in the Arctic, and we have become collaborators on a 4-year &nbsp;international research project called Project VEGA: Vegetation dynamics of the Arctic, which is funded by the Finnish Academy of Sciences and includes investigators from Finland, Norway, Denmark, and PI Holben in Montana, USA. While final research outcomes from this 3-year chronosequence IRES project are still being determined through extensive comparative microbiome analyses of muskox and soil, we anticipate that the findings will generate at least two peer-reviewed manuscripts, each of which will include the undergraduate and graduate students that participated in the project.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/03/2020<br>      Modified by: William&nbsp;E&nbsp;Holben</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460152/1460152_10372988_1578092111961_Samplinggroup2017--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460152/1460152_10372988_1578092111961_Samplinggroup2017--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sampling group in the field"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460152/1460152_10372988_1578092111961_Samplinggroup2017--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sampling group in the field"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Half of the group heading out for sampling in the morning.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sam Pannoni</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use -
