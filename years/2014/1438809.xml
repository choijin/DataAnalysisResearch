<AbstractNarration>The Information Sciences and Telecommunications (IST) programs at the School of Information Sciences (SIS) and the Health Information Management (HIM) program at the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences (SHRS) in the University of Pittsburgh are working collaboratively to develop an integrated curriculum on Security Assured Healthcare Informatics (SAHI).  The result is a novel curriculum that comprehensively integrates Health Informatics with Information Assurance (IA) and provide BS, MS and PhD level curriculum enhancements, and a development of integrated facility to foster educational and research activities in SAHI areas.The SAHI curriculum contributes to preparing high caliber professionals with comprehensive HIM and Information Assurance expertise that will help to address the critical and immediate need for a workforce trained to secure America's cyberspace.  The project produces professionals to fill research and employment needs in the Western Pennsylvania region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SAHI curriculum consists of multiple graduate level SAHI tracks with components focused on Healthcare IT (HIT) within the IST programs, and a track focused on Healthcare Security and Privacy (HS&amp;P) within the HIM program.  BS curriculum is being modified to provide HIT S&amp;P curriculum through course enhancements. A new SAHI track is being implemented by modifying the existing Networks and Security (N&amp;S) track. Finally, the existing BSIS track is being extended to create a SAHI 4+1 FastTrack program that allows a student to earn BS and MS degrees in 5 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is being rigorously evaluated using both formative and summative effectiveness evaluations through extensive reviews and feedback collection.  The Center for Instructional Development and Distance Education will create appropriate evaluation methods according to Kirkpatrick's four-level evaluation model.</AbstractNarration>

The team members from the two schools have collaborated towards developing new tracks and curricular contents within their respective departments. Below, we summarize the outcomes within each school.  Major outcomes within the SRHS include the following:  Creation of a Security and Privacy track in the HIM?s graduate program. A new program in Health Informatics (MSHI) has been developed that includes a graduate certificate in "Health Information Cybersecurity"  Both fully online and the on-campus versions of the MSHI program including the associated "Health Information Cybersecurity" certificate is expected to be fully available in Spring 2020. Several courses in HIM were modified/updated over the course of the project to establish the track/certificate in the MS HRS / MS HI program. In collaboration with the SCI, a professional certificate in "Cybersecurity in Healthcare" is being designe; it is expected  to be finalized in 2020.   Major outcomes within the SCI include the following:  Established a sub-track in Health Informatics  (HI) within the MS Information Science (MSIS) degree's specialization in Security Assured Health Informatics (SAIS) - SAIS was certified for 5 CNSS standards and is currently certified for NSA's standard required for CAE/CAE-R designations. In addition to the HI sub-track, we also created sub-tracks in "Big Data Analytics" and "Database and Web Systems" within the SAIS specialization.  Creation of an accelerated BS-X/MSIS program that allows a student pursuing BSIS or BSCS degree to finish both the BS and MSIS degrees within 5 years. This has been approved at the School level and is soon expected to be approved by the University, Established the Certificate of Advanced Studies (CAS) in Health Informatics sub-focus within SAIS CAS -- this requires 15 credits of coursework focused on security/healthcare focused courses within the SAIS-HI sub-track mentioned above. Course/modules/labs development: Developed new courses with healthcare S&amp;P content; significantly redesigned some courses; offered Doctoral Seminar courses focused on Healthcare S&amp;P, and incorporated healthcare S&amp;P content in MSIS and BSIS courses. Courses that were enhanced with healthcare content are listed in our project website (http://www.sis.pitt.edu/lersais/research/sahi/course.html)  A total of 14 labs have been created (please see: http://www.sis.pitt.edu/lersais/research/sahi/lab.html)  In the doctoral seminars and some advanced cybersecurity courses (including new ones), students were involved in research and development related Healthcare security and privacy projects.
