<AbstractNarration>Due to global changes in sea level, some of the most pivotal questions in human history necessitate the investigation of archaeological sites that are now under water.  These contexts have unique potentials for preserving ancient sites without disturbance from later human occupations. For example, it is extremely difficult to uncover a crucial time in US prehistory - when the nation was first inhabited by humans - because at the end of the last Ice Age when this presumably occurred sea levels were significantly lower and evidence of coastal habitation or migration routes are now under water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Alpena-Amberley Ridge beneath modern Lake Huron offers unique evidence into early adaptation, and sites preserved on this landform are providing an unprecedented view of prehistoric caribou hunting. Under the supervision and guidance of Dr. John O'Shea at the University of Michigan, doctoral student Ashley Lemke will conduct an innovative autonomous underwater vehicle survey of the lake bottom to discover new archaeological sites and map cultural features in detail. In addition, scuba divers will collect archaeological and environmental samples to understand the social and economic organization of hunters 9,000 years ago. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent research under Lake Huron has identified over 60 hunting features made of stone which are some of the oldest and best preserved in North America. These structures include stone lines and hunting blinds which bear similarity to those historically used in the arctic to hunt caribou. Thus far, these structures range from simple hunting blinds that could conceal a single hunter, to complex structures that would require several people or families cooperating in order to have a successful hunt. Ms. Lemke's research will further investigate known structures and conduct a survey to discover additional archaeological sites. Detailed mapping of hunting sites will provide an understanding of how prehistoric hunter-gatherers modified their environments and utilized strategic places to intercept migrating animals. This research will provide new data demonstrating that ancient peoples living in the Great Lakes region had complex economic strategies which relied on a sophisticated knowledge of the local environment and animal behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has wide ranging broader impacts. It will integrate interdisciplinary scholars and technicians with disparate archaeological, earth science, computer science, and marine technology backgrounds and promote international research collaboration between American and Canadian scholars. This integration of multinational researchers with a range of experience will test new methods for detailed underwater site mapping and documentation which will be broadly relevant to efforts at underwater research in other areas.  Beyond anthropology, this project will generate data relevant to a range of questions from Pleistocene geology to contemporary changes in water levels. Results and data will be presented in peer-reviewed publications and public outreach will include lectures given at local universities and museums.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>NSF support for this project allowed for the new discovery of 9000 year old archaeological sites underwater in the Great Lakes. At the end of the ice age, ancient peoples across the globe lived on areas of land that are now underwater after the melting of glaciers. These submerged sites offer unique preservation which allows archaeologists to reconstruct the lives of prehistoric people in great detail. Specifically this project documented the social and economic activities of caribou hunting peoples in the Great Lakes region. To investigate sites underwater, investigators John O&rsquo;Shea and Ashley Lemke from the University of Michigan utilized an autonomous underwater vehicle and a remote operated vehicle, two technologies that can travel and map underwater, to locate archaeological sites. Several potential sites were located using these methods and were then investigated by scuba divers to collect samples of rocks and sand. Once these samples were analyzed they provided data about the ancient environment, and we now know that the once dry land in the Great Lakes was a subarctic like area with spruce and tamarack trees 9,000 years ago. Scuba divers also recovered several small stone tool flakes from the underwater sites - confirming that prehistoric people lived there. The archaeological sites are in depths of 100-130 feet of water, and are primarily hunting features &ndash; such as hunting blinds used for deer hunting today &ndash; made out of stone. These stone hunting blinds were used to shield hunters from migrating caribou where they could hide until the animals were close by. This project not only located new archaeological sites but designed new methods for doing archaeology underwater. These methods will be applied to other underwater sites in the future. Beyond research, this project demonstrates that a portion of cultural heritage is preserved underwater and should be protected. While underwater archaeological sites are not well known they provide detailed pictures of the ancient past and engage the broader public.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/06/2016<br>      Modified by: Ashley&nbsp;K&nbsp;Lemke</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1441241/1441241_10312884_1467822425496_10257711_10104357931831493_8397157720591040379_o--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1441241/1441241_10312884_1467822425496_10257711_10104357931831493_8397157720591040379_o--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Underwater Archaeology"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1441241/1441241_10312884_1467822425496_10257711_10104357931831493_8397157720591040379_o--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Underwater Archaeology"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Two scuba divers investigate a 9,000 year old caribou hunting site 120 feet under Lake Huron, Great Lakes, USA</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ashley Lemke</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ashley&nbsp;K&nbsp;Lemke</div> <div class="imageTitle">Underwater Archaeology</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
