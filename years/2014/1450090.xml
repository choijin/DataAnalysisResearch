<AbstractNarration>Creating sustainable buildings that optimize energy efficiency, in part by relying on renewable energy sources, has several benefits to society. From an environmental standpoint, non-renewable energy sources often produce harmful emissions in the environment and most non-renewable energy sources are based on fossil fuels, which have a finite supply and are difficult to harvest and transport. Therefore, finding ways to develop sustainable buildings that use renewable energy sources has distinct environmental and societal value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Living Future Institute (ILFI) is encouraging programs that assist in the development of "greener" buildings that are also architecturally interesting. The Living Building Challenge (LBC) is a building certification program, administered by the ILFI, which measures sustainability. Williams College is pursuing the LBC as part of the Kellogg House renovation project. The Kellogg House was originally built in 1794, and upon completion of the renovation project, it will be the first historic building in the country to achieve LBC certification with a "net-zero" energy usage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports instrumenting the house with sensors and devices that accurately monitor and display energy consumption and generation crucial for measuring usage and guiding occupant behavior and that is designed to be sustainable and rely on only renewable energy sources. The main contribution of this project, therefore, will be the development of a scalable and robust sensing infrastructure that may serve as a model for future LBC participants. The energy usage data that is collected from the building will be anonymized and made publicly available. These data will facilitate future research in sustainability worldwide. Once completed, the Kellogg House will serve as a learning laboratory, teaching occupants to lead more sustainable lives even beyond the confines of the house.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main objective of the project was to design and build a system for measuring, archiving, and visualizing energy generation and consumption data in a smart building at Williams College.  The building is home to the new Environmental Center on campus, and was recently renovated and expanded in an attempt to satisfy the Living Building Challenge (LBC) as defined by the International Living Future Institute.  Part of this challenge mandates that the building generate at least as much energy as it consumes over the course of a year.  Our work focused specifically on the electricity usage of the building. To this end, we made the following contributions:  To start, we outfitted the building with sensors for monitoring electricity usage at the house, circuit, and the individual outlet level.  We installed eGauge  energy monitors on every circuit in the building, and experimented with several different meters at the outlet level, including a variety of WeMo and Insteon smart plugs.  Using these devices, we have collected energy usage data for over a year in the building.  Several different groups on campus, in addition to my students, including social science students, building facilities managers, and even a dishwasher repair technician, have already used this data to identify sources of unnecessary and, in many cases, excessive energy usage.   In addition, we have begun to analyze the data to identify sources of energy usage that do not align with the architects? models.  The building is currently consuming about 5% more energy than expected.  We hypothesize that lighting and climate control are the main sources of this overage.  Using a combination of energy usage and weather data from the past year, we are working to validate these claims.   Finally, one key component of our work is helping to develop an occupant feedback loop for people who use the building. People, in general, are reluctant to change their behavior in drastic ways, so encouraging and incentivizing occupants to conserve energy when possible poses a significant challenge.  For the past few years, my students and I have been developing ambient visualizations for the kitchen in the Environmental Center.  The goal of these visualizations is to provide instantaneous feedback to people using the kitchen, to ultimately help them make better decisions regarding their energy usage.  One visualization uses the size and number of hexagons to represent energy and power usage for kitchen appliances.  A second visualization uses circles of different sizes and color intensities to represent similar metrics.  Preliminary user studies have shown that occupants find these visualizations intuitive and helpful. This is ongoing work that we plan to publish in the upcoming months.
