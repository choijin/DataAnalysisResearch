<AbstractNarration>Plate tectonic processes occurring at the surface are ultimately governed by convection occurring within Earth's mantle. Understanding mantle convection processes requires a fuller understanding of both compositional and thermal variations in the mantle.  This project aims to address compositional variations in the mantle, through the study of mantle fragments, known as "xenoliths", erupted in lavas from the Canary Islands. These xenoliths preserve evidence that the mantle from which they originated experienced ancient melting events (&gt;&gt;1 Ga), but that the chemical evidence for these events have been partly obscured by later modification of the xenoliths during incorporation and eruption within the lavas.  Goals of the project are to develop methods to identify ancient and modern melting processes preserved in oceanic mantle beneath ocean islands, like the Canary Islands, and to use this new information to understand compositional variation in the Earth's upper mantle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A more refined understanding of when and how mantle heterogeneities are formed and, in some cases, destroyed has profound impact on our understanding of mantle melting processes, melt composition and physical behaviour of the mantle. Science questions will be addressed by measuring Nd-Hf-Os isotopes, highly siderophile elements and major- and trace-element abundances in a suite of xenoliths to understand the long-term evolution and HSE distribution in the mantle and to examine processes involved in generation and preservation of heterogeneous mantle. The new data will also be used to evaluate melt interactions and metasomatism in samples. Our methods will test hypotheses for the formation, evolution and destruction of depleted mantle domains in oceanic or continental environments. This will include comparison of modern melting processes in the islands with possible ancient melting processes preserved in the xenoliths, to assess models for the generation of refractory mantle in subduction-zone, plume or ridge settings, or as global-scale melting events, and to explore models for highly-depleted, refractory mantle domains as sources of distinct isotopic and elemental signatures recorded in some intraplate magmas.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In the proposed work, we examined fragments of Earth&rsquo;s mantle found in lavas from ocean islands, such as the Canary Islands and the Cook Islands, as well as other locations where fragments of Earth&rsquo;s mantle can be found. We examined the composition, mineralogy and texture in these samples to better understand the long-term evolution of Earth&rsquo;s mantle, and to examine the processes involved in generation and preservation of refractory mantle. During melting of the mantle, minerals and components that are melted render the mantle &lsquo;depleted&rsquo; and change both the chemical and physical character of it. For example, iron is preferentially melted out of mantle rocks compared to magnesium, making the mantle region that experienced melting more buoyant. In turn, this makes some regions of the mantle barren to further melting and also makes them resistant to further change, or refractory. Refractory mantle is well documented in continental regions. Remarkably, however, this type of mantle material is also found as xenoliths or &lsquo;foreign rocks&rsquo; erupted at some ocean island localities. In conjunction with other geochemical tracers, we used the rhenium-osmium isotope system, which allows determination of the time when portions of refractory mantle underwent melting and depletion.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In some cases, we find that this depletion and formation of refractory mantle occurred very early, as old as the Archean period, greater than three billion years ago. We also show that in addition to &nbsp;understanding when and how mantle heterogeneities were formed that, in some cases, evidence exists for the slow deterioration and destruction of this material. Our results have important implications for understanding of mantle melting processes, melt composition and physical behavior of the mantle. A total of over one hundred mantle xenoliths were studied to demonstrate the physical properties of mantle materials beneath oceanic islands. Our results suggest that the formation of refractory mantle is possibly similar to modern melting processes such as shallow melting at subduction zones, but may also be accounted for in hot, deep mantle plumes early in Earth history.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>By investigating xenoliths from ocean islands, we have also been able to show that it is possible to examine the composition of Earth&rsquo;s mantle. We utilized a suite of xenoliths from Piton de la Fournaise, La R&eacute;union (Indian Ocean), to examine the mantle source composition of the R&eacute;union hotspot. We wanted to know if the R&eacute;union hotspot was sourced from mantle like other hotspots, such as Hawaii, or if it was unusual in composition. This is important information, since the R&eacute;union hotspot is the present-day manifestation of volcanism that occurred in the Cretaceous-Tertiary Deccan Traps of India. What we discovered is that the isotopic composition of the source of R&eacute;union is quite homogeneous, but that the island has relative enrichments in ruthenium and palladium relative to what we think the composition of the Earth&rsquo;s mantle was before plate tectonics and crust formation. These relative enrichments are not seen in possible materials that formed the Earth, such as chondrites, either. The existence of these signatures demonstrates that the R&eacute;union hotspot samples a new type of mantle source. We suggest that the origin of this source may arise from mantle that experienced limited addition of impactor material after the Earth&rsquo;s core had formed (late accretion), or limited interaction between Earth&rsquo;s mantle and core. The unique isotope characteristics of R&eacute;union also suggest it&rsquo;s mantle source formed very early and has been isolated until quite recently.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Two PhD students and numerous Masters students were involved in this work, and they received training in field skills, laboratory skills and method development and writing.
