<AbstractNarration>Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Chemotherapy is a potent treatment method; however, the efficient delivery of anti-cancer drugs remains a major barrier to successful treatment. Improvements have been achieved using nano-scale self-assembling particles, which can encase the drug to lessen side effects and to target cancerous tissue. The functionality of the nanoparticles is dictated by the design of the individual molecules comprising the assembly. In this research, fluorine-containing molecules have been designed to efficiently deliver anti-cancer drugs and to simultaneously enable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which can visualize nanoparticle behavior. The proposed molecules will be synthesized and evaluated at the University of Tokyo in Japan in collaboration with Dr. Kazunori Kataoka, whose expertise and equipment will greatly facilitate and strengthen this research project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multifunctional polymers have been synthesized to address the challenge of targeted drug delivery towards improved chemotherapy. These polymers self-assemble into nanometer-sized micelles that can encapsulate anti-cancer agents, providing enhanced solubility and reduced systemic toxicity. This is achieved via a strategic polymer design including a symmetrical fluorinated segment to increase the stability of the assembly and to provide simultaneous 19F MRI capability. These dually functional particles can be applied to disease diagnosis and in vivo bioavailability analysis. In this research, targeting peptide ligands will be appended to the surface of the nanoparticles to facilitate penetration into cancer cells. Additionally, the behavior of the drug carriers in vitro (via cell toxicity and cell uptake assays) and in vivo (via intravital real-time confocal laser microscopy measurements) will be investigated. These experiments will elucidate key self-assembly interactions, which can then be leveraged to design more efficient and environmentally benign nanoparticles. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The number of people afflicted with cancer worldwide continues to rise. Chemotherapy remains a fundamental element of cancer treatment; however, efficient delivery of anti-cancer drugs remains a major barrier to successful therapy. Improvements have been achieved using nano-scale self-assembling particles, which can encase the potent drugs to lessen patient side effects and to better target cancerous tissue. The properties of the nanoparticles are dictated by the design of the individual molecules comprising the self-assemblies. The aim of this project was to manipulate the molecular design to enhance a key property of the drug-delivery nanoparticles: &nbsp;<em>in vivo</em> stability. Stabilization prevents the drug from prematurely leaking out of the nanocarrier, which could result in harming healthy tissue. Stabilization also enables the drug-carrier to circulate in the blood longer, allowing the drug to find, penetrate, and kill the cancer tissue. Previously the researchers designed and synthesized fluorine-containing molecules, which were able to form small nanoparticles with increased stability. In this project the researchers utilized the specialized equipment and expertise in the lab of Professor Kazunori Kataoka at the University of Tokyo in Japan. The aforementioned fluorinated nanoparticles were analyzed <em>in vivo</em> to confirm the stabilizing effect of the fluorinated design. The promising data gained in this project will be published shortly to disseminate the findings of this project. The results gained there are instrumental in demonstrating not only the validity of this design, but also the potential application to many other types of nanoparticle systems. Additionally, this international collaboration has fostered a new relationship between the U.S. and the Japanese labs to share expertise and new technology and methods. This cultural and intellectual exchange may allow for more rapid and impactful progress in this important area of research. &nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/02/2015<br>      Modified by: Sarah&nbsp;Decato</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
