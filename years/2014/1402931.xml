<AbstractNarration>The distribution of ozone, water vapor, carbon dioxide and aerosols in the lower atmosphere are strongly influenced by transport. Quantifying this transport is central to understanding and predicting air quality, climate change, and stratospheric ozone depletion. This collaborative project will use a combination of trace gas measurements and model simulations. The effort will also promote training and learning of graduate students a a postdoctoral fellow. Material from this research. Materials from the research will be included in a core course for the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Integration of Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) program on Water, Climate and Health, as well as teacher training courses at JHU and Columbia University. The results of the research will be widely disseminated at international science meetings, publishing in peer-reviewed journals, and posts of non-technical reports on websites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A particularly important quantity is the transit-time distribution (TTD) for transport from Northern Hemisphere populated regions, where there are large emissions of pollutants and their precursors. Maximum entropy inversions will used together with surface&lt;br/&gt;and aircraft trace gas measurements to constrain the TTDs. These data-constrained TTDs will be combined with chemical transport model simulations and meteorological analyses to examine seasonal and interannual variations, and connections with atmospheric dynamics. Chemistry climate model integrations will be used to explore how the transport changes with climate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project will provide the following: (1) data-constrained estimates of the TTDs since air was last in contact with Northern Hemisphere continental regions, including seasonal and interannual variations; (2) knowledge of the key dynamical controls on tropospheric transport timescales; and (3) an understanding of how tropospheric transport may change in response to climate. In combination these will allow a fundamental disentangling of the roles of chemistry and transport in shaping the composition of the troposphere, with important implications for understanding of air quality, climate change, and stratospheric ozone.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Under this award from the National Science Foundation we investigated several aspects of the interplay between atmospheric composition and chemistry (with emphasis on ozone, aerosols, and water vapor), the atmospheric circulation and transport (i.e. how atmospheric constituents are moved from/to different regions of the globe by the winds) and the climate system.  First, we used cholorofluorocarbons to study how air is transported from the Northern to the Southern Hemisphere.  Second, we focused on airmasses in the Arctic atmosphere, trying to establish what parts of the globe they originate from, preferentially; we also studied how the origin of Arctic airmasses will change with increasing levels of carbon dioxide in future climates.  Third we examined the surprising surface cooling observed over the continental United States in the 50's and 60's, and asked if it was due to man-made aerosols: using a climate model we concluded that aerosols were very unlikely to have been the principal cause of that unexpected cooling.  Fourth, we studied the climatic effects of stratospheric ozone, distinguishing the ozone changes due to the Montreal Protocol from the changes those due to increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.  Fifth, we studied the role of volcanic aerosols on the winter surface temperatures over the Northern continents: focusing on the large 1991 eruption of Mt Pinatubo, we showed that the impact of volcanic aerosols is quite small, and thus unlikely to explain the warm anomalies that were observed following that eruption.  Finally, we revisited the role of stratospheric water vapor as a climate feedback: examining a large number of climate models we showed that, when carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are doubled, the additional surface warming due to increased water vapor in the stratosphere is as large as the one coming from the melting of the polar sea ice, or the changes in the clouds, suggesting that stratospheric water vapor is an important -- though often neglected -- player in the climate system.
