<AbstractNarration>Cellular networks have become a part of the infrastructure that we rely on without pausing to think of the enormous complexity that underlies such networks. These networks serve an amazing diversity of mobile devices and operate in an amazing diversity of radio environments. Failures in such networks are not uncommon and we take their consequences in our stride as a fact of life, complaining about call drops and data disconnections. Similarly, we also encounter performance degradations, either in voice quality of calls or connection speeds. With the fast increasing amount of traffic on cellular networks and the cellular spectrum crunch, these conditions are expected to become more severe in the near to mid-term future. Further, in today's networks, there is no facility to provide services to a device by orchestrating an entire network of geographically dispersed mobile devices, such as, for providing a "video" of the path of an oncoming tornado.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the researchers put forward the view that rather than reactive management of failures or performance degradations, there is a need to build into cellular networks, proactive management of such events. The primary difficulty for this is that, to the end devices, the network is considered essentially as a black box. Conditions about the network, such as, congestion or overload of some elements of the cellular infrastructure, are not made visible to the applications on the mobile end devices. Likewise, much of the application eco-system within a device is not made visible to the network. Thus, it is not known to the network what is the latency requirement of some application or what demand it is going to place in the near future on the network. The proposed solution approach will turn this black box approach on its head and enable proactive fault and performance management and an entirely new class of applications through cooperation between the network and the devices, a Tango of sorts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project goals will be accomplished through two synergistic project thrusts. In the first, called "Fault Management and Orchestrated Services", the team will develop computational and statistical models for the real-time cellular data and analytics tools for the same, machine learning algorithms for predicting hard and soft failures, and mitigation actions for avoiding predicted failures. It will also develop orchestrated services between the cellular network and the end users to achieve system-wide goals under the broad umbrella of "participatory sensing". In the second thrust, called "Performance-driven Design", the team will develop an API that will allow the cellular devices and the cellular network to cooperate for achieving common desired system-level properties, such as, higher data bandwidth. It will provide advanced traffic management schemes through back-filling of delay-tolerant traffic and computation offloading from the mobile devices, leveraging a team member's recent efforts in the Cirrus Clouds Project.  The project will result in the development of a miniature LTE/UMTS testbed for open experimentation, open data access, and evaluation of the protocols mentioned above.</AbstractNarration>

This was a collaborative project with Purdue University. The project included significant collaboration with AT&amp;T research as well as collaboration with faculty at Stirling University, Scotland, CMU?s Qatar Campus, and Brown University.     Our accomplishments in this project included:  1-      The design, implementation and evaluation of the FemtoCloud system where a collection of mobile devices can collaborate to provide a meaningful edge compute resource.  2-     The development of techniques for Quality-of-Experience fair sharing of network resources for video streaming applications and the design of a collaborative framework enabling the network to enforce such sharing policy.  3-     Evaluation of the effect of last-hop bandwidth prediction quality on video adaptation techniques in order to inform the design of bandwidth prediction by enabling network participation in client adaptation.  4-     Architecting and implementing the prototype cDVD system, an in-network client-Driven Video Delivery service, where network/client collaboration is enabled through software-defined networking (SDN) component.  5-     Development of the TANGO system that provides a framework for collaboration between a cellular network and client that enables cellular network prediction of network conditions to be fed back to clients who then adapt video buffering strategy to improve performance.  6-      Development and validation of the MIMIC/eMIMIC schemes for inferring video quality of experience directly from network measurement, even when the network data is encrypted.  These techniques can form the basis of further problem diagnosis and mitigation by network operators.  7-      Design and deployment of a VideoNOC system that can be used by network operators to monitor the video experience of their attached clients.     The broader impacts of our research include:  1-      The support and training of three PhD students. Two have completed their work and are now with Google in Mountain View, CA.  2-      Facilitation of meaningful collaboration with researchers at AT&amp;T Research, Brown University, CMU ?Qatar Campus  and Stirling University, Scotland.  3-      The development of a novel concept of Quality of Experience sharing that has significant implications on the future of network resource allocation.  4-      Demonstrating the feasibility for network providers to understand and potentially manage their client quality of experience without the need for third-party participation.
