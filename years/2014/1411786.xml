<AbstractNarration>Hyperbolic conservation laws are a class of mathematical equations describing a wide variety of phenomena, including  gas dynamics, water waves, liquid crystals, and vehicle flow. Their study dates back to Euler (1755). However, several theoretical problems remain unresolved to this day. The presence of discontinuities in the solutions, in the form of shock waves, is a major source of difficulties in the  analysis of these equations. The present research  will seek advances in the understanding of solutions with large data, and error propagation in case when, as it happens in real-life situations, the initial conditions are not known with absolute precision. In addition, a major portion of the research will focus on conservation laws describing traffic flow on a network of roads.  New models for vehicle flow at road intersections will be developed, which are realistic and easily computable. In particular, these models will account for  the possible spill-back of queues along roads leading to a congested intersection. At a second stage, the PI will study traffic patterns arising as&lt;br/&gt;(i) global optima, where departures are scheduled by a central planner in order to minimize a global cost to all drivers, and  &lt;br/&gt;(ii) Nash equilibria,  where each driver selects a departure time and a route to destination, in order to minimize his/her own individual cost.&lt;br/&gt;In connection with recent technological advances in the collection of traffic data and the automatic driving of cars, developing efficient mathematical models will provide an important step toward the prediction and the optimal control of traffic flow. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first  part of  the research aims at  fundamental advances in the  theory of  conservation laws and nonlinear wave equations. In particular, building upon recent progress, the PI will study the global existence of solutions with large total variation and  the appearance of vacuum in finite time, for isentropic gas dynamics. The research will rely on a number of new approaches.&lt;br/&gt;(i) In the study of gas dynamics, a priori estimates or examples of blow-up will first be studied within certain classes of approximate solutions, which are easier to describe and that capture the essential features of true solutions. &lt;br/&gt;(ii) In the analysis of error estimates,  geodesic distances will be used, whenever  the standard Sobolev norms do not yield useful information.  &lt;br/&gt;In some interesting cases, the specific form of these metrics is motivated by  optimal transportation problems.   &lt;br/&gt;(iii) For the new models of traffic flow at a junction of roads, a solution will be constructed as the fixed point of a contractive transformation, defined by a novel version of the Lax formula.&lt;br/&gt;The PI serves as Director of a new Center for Interdisciplinary Mathematics at Penn State.  Its primary goal is to foster scientific interactions, widening the use and appreciation of modern mathematical techniques as effective research tools in a variety of disciplines.   Some of the topics of the present proposal, such as traffic flow models, are naturally interdisciplinary and will be included in the activities of the Center.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The theoretical part of this project was mainly focused on nonlinear wave equations. A distinguished feature of these equations is that solutions are not smooth, but develop singularities.  Indeed, the graph of these functions can have jumps, cusps, or kinks.   Much of the difficulty encountered in the analysis and in the numerical solution of these equations stems from this lack of regularity.  This project has provided a better understanding of these singularities. More specifically, it was found that, for various classes of wave equations, almost all solutions remain smooth outside at a finite number of curves in space-time,  Along these curves, the graph has a vertical tangent. A detailed classification of singular points was achieved, together with a description of  the local behavior of the solution near these points. The results apply in particular to the so-called "variational wave equation" arising from a model of liquid crystals.  A second part of the research dealt with applications of hyperbolic conservation lawsto the modeling of traffic flow on a networks of roads.        As we all have experienced, a most relevant feature of traffic flow are the traffic jams.These occur whenever too many people choose to drive on the same road at the same time. One can thus view a traffic pattern as the outcome of the decisions made by very many drivers, who choose their departure times and  routes to destination trying to minimize their own cost. Here the travel cost may include the time spent on the road and a penalty for late arrival.  Toward an understanding of these traffic patterns, the research project has achieved two main goals. First, a new model for traffic flow at road intersections has been introduced.This is ``well posed", in the sense that it predicts a unique solution, nicely depending on the observed initial data.  Moreover, it captures essential features of traffic flow, such as  the backward propagation of queues along roads leading to a crowded intersection.
