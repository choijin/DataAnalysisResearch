<AbstractNarration>Travel Support for International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP-2014)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project is to request National Science Foundation to provide $10K for travel support for graduate students to attend the 43rd Conference on Parallel Processing to be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota from September 9th to 12th. The 43rd ICPP conference, which is a premier conference in parallel and distributed systems. A committee for elect travel awardees will be setup. The first priority will give to students who are from under-represented minority and female. The second priority will be given to those who normally could not attend the conference. Besides technical paper presentations, the venue offers a wide range of technical activities including panels, industry presentations, posters, demos, and keynote talks. Attending such high-caliber technical venues is extremely valuable for future researchers. This award enables the supported attendees to be exposed to the state-of-the-art research in the field, to have the opportunity to interact with peer graduate students, researchers and experts from all over the world, to further gain knowledge that is likely to shape the future of the field (e.g., in terms of technology, standards, etc).&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This project is to support student travel and registration to attend International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP) 2014 that was held in Minneapolis, Minnesota from September 9th to 12th.  The goal is to encourage student participation by subsidizing the travel costs of individuals who would otherwise be unable to attend the conference.  A public open call for requests was sent out to a number of relevant professional mailing lists as well as included in the conference website (http://icpp.cs.umn.edu). Travel grant is available to students and postdoctoral researchers from only US schools only.    Any graduate student or a postdoctoral researcher from US schools may apply. Awards will be made based on   a) financial need to attend the conference and workshops, b) minority and under-represented students,  c) students from historical under-represented and minority institutions,  d) student authors presenting at the conference or workshops,       To apply, the student's advisor should send a one paragraph statement of financial need, student's progress toward graduation, student's CV, and research in areas related to ICPP.   A selection committee has selected 12 applicants to provide travel support of $750 each. This has enabled these 12 students to develop their future research directions as well as setting up their career goals through free exchange of technical ideas during the conference.
