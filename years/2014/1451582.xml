<AbstractNarration>Student Travel Support for 2014 Conference on Decision and Control&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is to support student travel to the 53rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), to be held in Los Angeles, CA, December 15-17, 2014. For over fifty years, the CDC has been the world?s leading annual forum for scientific and engineering researchers who share an interest in systems and control theory and the foundations of systems and control technology. As in previous years, the 53rd CDC will feature the presentation of contributed and invited papers, tutorial sessions, as well as plenary and semi-plenary sessions and workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The range of topics covered at the annual CDC is extremely broad, mirroring the varied applications of control and systems theory. The systems theoretic approaches have played a critical role in the development of many contemporary infrastructures and technology affecting everyday life. Systems and control theoretic tools are central in the design, operation, and security of cyber-physical systems, where they can inform engineers about ways to control large networks such as power systems, communications systems and traffic management. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will afford a unique opportunity for students to interact with members of the professional community in a stimulating setting, and to exchange ideas with a broad group of colleagues. The large number of workshops before the conference and the interactive format of many of the presentations will allow additional opportunity for training and learning. Outreach effort will be devoted to advertising the conference and the student travel award program to under-represented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was aimed at broadening participation of graduate students in one of most prestigious international conferences in control research.  The support from NSF, coupled with matching funds from the IEEE Control System Society has led to a significant increase in the number of student attendees.  In 2014, more than a third of people attending the conference were students.     This conference is a major venue for graduate students to become familiar with the latest research breakthroughs, experience the pre-conference workshops which are focused on emerging technical areas, and participate in professional development activities that are held during the conference.   Student participants were also able to benefit from an array of activities aimed at enhancing their education/research activities or career development.  These included (but not limited to): reduced rated pre-conference workshops, special tutorial sessions, and special sessions with industry and government funding agencies.   Over 2000 papers were submitted and over 1100 presentations (research talks, plenary talks, tutorials, etc.) were made.  Students studying in U.S. based institutions, who are also IEEE members, were eligible.  Giving  esearch talk(s) was a key element in the  selection process.   Two support programs (one from NSF and one funded by the IEEE-CSS)  made 59 travel grants to student from across the world (NSF funds were limited to students from US Institutions). A total of 27 student were supported by this (NSF) program.  The support included the cost of registration as well as 4 nights of lodging (at the conference hotel &ndash; at the negotiated reduced student rates).  One local student did not seek lodging support.                Last Modified: 11/05/2015       Submitted by: Faryar Jabbari]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
