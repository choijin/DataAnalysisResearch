<AbstractNarration>Cells are the building blocks of life, yet they are themselves a&lt;br/&gt;collection of proteins, small molecules, and solvent, none of which&lt;br/&gt;are, in and of themselves, alive. How living things can arise from the&lt;br/&gt;"behavior" of molecules, which are simply obeying the laws of physics,&lt;br/&gt;is the essential conundrum of modern biology. The rise of scientific&lt;br/&gt;supercomputing has offered the chance to study living systems at the&lt;br/&gt;levels of atoms, cells, and all levels in between.  With Blue Waters,&lt;br/&gt;it is now possible to take the most critical step from inanimate to&lt;br/&gt;animate matter by describing assembly and cooperation of thousands of&lt;br/&gt;macromolecules made of billions of atoms.  The ability to explore&lt;br/&gt;living systems via the "computational microscope" of molecular&lt;br/&gt;dynamics simulations has a profound impact not only on the progress of&lt;br/&gt;basic science, but also in the treatment of disease and the&lt;br/&gt;development of drugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use Blue Waters to study three types of biomolecular&lt;br/&gt;systems: the microtubules that make up the cell's cytoskeleton, the&lt;br/&gt;chemosensory array that acts as a "bacterial brain", and two highly&lt;br/&gt;relevant retroviruses: HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and RSV&lt;br/&gt;(Rous sarcoma virus).  The first project will model microtubules, in&lt;br/&gt;their native form, as well as the interactions between the&lt;br/&gt;microtubule, its regulatory partners, and anti-cancer agents.&lt;br/&gt;Simulations of the microtubule and its interactions with drugs can&lt;br/&gt;help drive the development of new microtubule-attacking cancer&lt;br/&gt;therapies.  The HIV part of the virus project builds on prior success&lt;br/&gt;in modeling the full HIV capsid to evaluate the effects of HIV drugs&lt;br/&gt;on capsid stability and to model the essential interactions between&lt;br/&gt;the capsid and host cell factors. Simulations of the HIV capsid&lt;br/&gt;provide the necessary detailed knowledge of the vital infection&lt;br/&gt;process to develop new HIV therapies.  The RSV part of the virus&lt;br/&gt;project has constructed the first model of an intermediate stage in&lt;br/&gt;virus capsid maturation, which will be used to describe the maturation&lt;br/&gt;process of retroviruses may open the doors to a new type of anti-viral&lt;br/&gt;drug which attacks that maturation process.  The chemosensory array&lt;br/&gt;project seeks to answer how input from many chemical sensors on the&lt;br/&gt;bacterial surface are transduced across hundreds of nanometers in the&lt;br/&gt;array, leading the cell to decide if it should continue swimming or&lt;br/&gt;change direction, to adapt to changing environments.  The chemosensory&lt;br/&gt;array is a universal structure in bacteria, but absent in eukaryotes,&lt;br/&gt;offering a new target for antibiotic drugs - a desperately needed&lt;br/&gt;advancement in combating bacterial resistance to current antibiotics.&lt;br/&gt;Each of the projects proposed presents an opportunity for petascale&lt;br/&gt;computing to contribute to mankind?s health and to answer one of&lt;br/&gt;mankind's oldest questions: "What is life?"</AbstractNarration>
