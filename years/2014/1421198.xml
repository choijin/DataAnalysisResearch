<AbstractNarration>During middle school, many young people disengage from and consequently do not achieve in school-based STEM subjects. This phenomenon is more pronounced among young people in low-income communities than elsewhere. Many summer, out-of-school STEM programs are designed to offer young people opportunities to engage in hands-on, inquiry-based learning that promote interest and engagement in STEM. Research on the effect of these types of programs is limited, however. This research project seeks to fill this gap by identifying and studying practices that promote interest and engagement in STEM-related topics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central goal of the summer STEM Interest and Engagement Study is to identify instructional practices associated with cultivating and sustaining young people's interest and engagement in out-of-school STEM summer learning programs for middle school youth. The project is based on a model of change developed from existing theory and empirical research on the cultivation of youths' interest and engagement in STEM. The project is a descriptive study that will apply multiple data collection and analytic methods, including the Experience Sampling Method (ESM), to determine instructional practices and the resulting interest, engagement, and perceptions of youth as they participate in STEM activities. In addition, survey data provided by program participants will allow the researchers to account for individual differences in preexisting interest and background factors, such as gender and ethnicity, and to measure changes in dispositions toward STEM. By better understanding these connections, practitioners can better understand how the design of their programs may influence the outcome of the participants' experience, including their education and career decisions.</AbstractNarration>

This was done by giving each of the 203 youth enrolled in the study a mobile phone. At up to four, random times during the STEM portion of programming, youth were signaled by a member of the research team to stop what they were doing, take out their phone, and complete a brief survey about what they were experiencing at that moment in time.</p> <p class="BodyTextPostHead">In addition, while ESM data were being collected, steps were being taken to videotape the programming being offered at the time the signal was issued. Overall, approximately 180 hours of video was collected across the nine programs in question.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The STEM Interest and Engagement (STEM IE) Study was a four-year project funded by the National Science Foundation under the auspices of its Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program that was designed to better understand what types of practices, supports, and opportunities afforded to early adolescent youth:  Are especially effective in helping youth experience in-the-moment engagement while participating in ISL activities, and Serve to support growth in STEM interest and aspirations.  The study was undertaken between 2014 and 2018 by a research team at American Institutes for Research, Michigan State University, and Northern Illinois University.   Where was the study conducted? The study was conducted in a total of nine, STEM-oriented, summer learning programs serving early adolescent youth from low-income communities supported by Boston After School and Beyond (BASB) and the Providence After School Alliance (PASA), two well-established afterschool intermediaries working in Boston, MA and Providence, RI respectively. Programs selected for inclusion in the study ranged from 4 to 6 weeks in duration, offering STEM-oriented programming daily for 3.5 to 4 hours, four days a week. Data were collected from study programs in the summer of 2015. What about this study made it unique? In order to answer the study?s research questions, steps were taken to collect youth in-the-moment experience data using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM). During the second, third, and fourth week of summer programming at each of the study programs, the research team selected two of the four programming days to collect youth experience data. This was done by giving each of the 203 youth enrolled in the study a mobile phone. At up to four, random times during the STEM portion of programming, youth were signaled by a member of the research team to stop what they were doing, take out their phone, and complete a brief survey about what they were experiencing at that moment in time. In addition, while ESM data were being collected, steps were being taken to videotape the programming being offered at the time the signal was issued. Overall, approximately 180 hours of video was collected across the nine programs in question. With the ESM and video data in hand, we were able to compare the type of learning environments being provided to youth and the practices and approaches being employed by activity leaders with the direct, in-the-moment experiences of participating youth, allowing for a very direct and real-time assessment of the relationship between practice and youth experience. What did we find? From a practice standpoint, episode quality as measured by the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS), statements made by activity leaders to demonstrate the relevance of STEM content, and providing youth with opportunities to experience a sense of agency while undertaking program activities were all found to be related to a set of in-the-moment experiences reported by youth conducive to supporting engagement. Some of these practices were also found to be especially supportive of getting youth who were not particularly motivated to attend STEM programming at the start of the summer session to have key experiences associated with engagement, experiences that otherwise didn?t occur when the use of these practices was absent. Both the CLASS-derived quality score and the more frequent use of relevance statements by activity leaders were found to be especially effective in this regard. Field-based settings were found to be effective in helping youth feel challenged, perceive what they were doing as relevant, and learn more about the STEM content being addressed. However, it also appears that these settings may be more effective when activity leaders afford youth a greater degree of autonomy in undertaking field-related tasks and using time set aside after the activity to reflect on session activities, discuss findings, and supplement what youth garnered from the activity with additional information. As anticipated, the more youth experienced in-the-moment engagement in programming during the span of the summer session, the more likely they were to report growth in terms of interest and future aspirations related to STEM. This finding seems to both reinforce the importance of focusing on practices that will engender youth experiencing in-the-moment engagement while participating in programming. STEM IE Toolkit A key component of the STEM IE study was to take what we learned about practices that seem to support youth having positive in-the-moment program experiences and constructing a free online toolkit that can be accessed by program practitioners to learn more about how to design and deliver STEM programming in a manner that incorporates these practices. The toolkit identifies practices that support youth engagement. It also contains video clips that demonstrate what a given practice looks like in live programs and professional development materials, including PowerPoint slides and facilitator guides.
