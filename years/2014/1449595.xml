<AbstractNarration>This award will support at least 26 students to participate at the 2014 SACNAS National Conference that will take place in Los Angeles (October 16-18, 2014). The students' participation at the conference will be facilitated by a "Geosciences Roadmap to the 2014 SACNAS Conference Programing" document.  This guide, available as PDF and app, will assist graduate and undergraduate students and professionals to better take advantage of the sessions that would benefit them the most. In addition, the PIs and collaborators will develop a "Geoscience Mentoring Handbook for the 2014 SACNAS National Conference". This mentoring guide will facilitate a consistent message from the mentors to the students, including constructive criticism and resources for students. Lastly, the PI will facilitate a conversation among faculty, geoscience societies, and industry on strategies for enhancing participation of under-represented students, in particular undergraduates, in Geosciences; a report from this conversation will be shared with the Geosciences community at large. The students selected to be funded through this award will come primarily from Tribal Colleges and Hispanic Serving institutions; they will be asked to contribute to and assess the guides that would be developed to support meeting participation.</AbstractNarration>
