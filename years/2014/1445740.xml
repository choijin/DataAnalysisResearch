<AbstractNarration>Expertise is needed to develop immobilized enzyme preparations that are cost-effective, enhance enzyme activity and allow multiple reaction cycles. Surprisingly, large enzyme producers are not organized to provide this capability. Their focus is to efficiently manufacture enzymes that meet demands in high volume markets. Similarly, few chemical manufacturers have the internal capability to develop efficient enzyme catalyzed manufacturing processes.  The commercial development of immobilized enzyme biocatalyst systems has the potential to provide transformational new technologies to the chemical industry that lower process energy input and avoid protection-deprotection steps. This team has developed deep insight and practical experience in creating superior performance immobilized enzymes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology will develop a deep understanding of how enzyme properties, including activity and stability, are influenced by the surface chemistry and physical parameters of immobilization resins. By identifying optimal combinations of enzymes and immobilization resins, important improvements in enzyme activity and stability will be achieved. The proposed new company will also develop insights into resin-enzyme combinations that improve immobilized enzyme biocatalysts for multiple cycle use. A key approach to gain knowledge in the development of high performance immobilized enzyme systems will be the implementation of a high throughput screening process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of the NSF ICorps project was to understand whether there is a potential market for our proposed immobilized enzyme technology thereby resulting in venturing into establishment of our own company. We began evaluating the following to test the feasibility of our goal  Understand our key value proposition that can be offered through our immobilized enzyme technology and if it could solve current Industrial pain points (Need). Knowing our primary customer and what market they belong to.  Find potential partners with enzyme manufacturers and resin suppliers and share with them the vision of opening up new markets for their existing products. Legal establishment of our company (LLC) provided we achieve a significant outcome from the NSF ICorps experience.   NSF I-Corps customer discovery process was vital to our success in identifying and consolidating our key value propositions that we intended to offer using Immobilized Enzyme technology. Our customer segment initially included pharmaceutical, food industry and commodity chemical. We were able to identify through talking to various customers in the respective industries that all of these various customers are in the verge of adoption of continuous manufacturing process rather than batch processing followed over the years. Therefore, there exists a real need to have catalyst, which could be easily recovered and reused over time to drive the process economics cost down. Immobilized enzymes are an effective way to drive down costs of bio-catalytic processes. Immobilized enzyme technology enables the development of cost effective products that were previously not commercially viable (too expensive).   The commercial development of immobilized enzyme biocatalyst systems has the potential to provide transformational new technologies to the chemical industry that lower process energy input and avoid protection-deprotection steps. Our new company "OptiZyme" will fill a critical technology gap that exists between resin manufacturer, enzyme producers and specialty chemical companies (Pharma, Food, Chemical).  By developing a new and safer catalyst for the industy, we believe we would eliminate high energy dependency, reduce solvent usage and streamline manufacturing process and thereby incorporating sustainable chemistry.  Due to our succesfull NSF I-Corps experience we have establish the following goals  Identified and Evaluated our key value proposition Screened potential customer segments and recognized key potential customers Calculated various revenue streams during various phases of our growth Signed Partnership agreement with resin producer Establishment of our company   We sincerely thank the National Science Foundation I-Corps initiative for teaching us the value of lean startup and understanding the fundamentals of entrepreneurship.
