<AbstractNarration>Stars within the Milky Way and other galaxies are formed as giant clouds of gas composed primarily of hydrogen and helium collapse under their own gravity, thus heating up the gas to the point where nuclear fusion is triggered and stars are formed.   The life cycles of these interstellar clouds drives the internal evolution of all galaxies.  The goal of this project is to study the earliest stages of the formation of these clouds by observing the spectra from certain atomic and molecular species, which serve as tracers of these otherwise cold, dark clouds.  The project will carry out these observations by using the NSF supported High Elevation Antarctic Terahertz (HEAT) telescope.  Outside of space, the Antarctic plateau on which the HEAT telescope is located is one of the few places on Earth that these observations can be made.  The project will use the HEAT telescope to map these giant clouds along the plane of our galaxy with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current theories of molecular cloud formation are guided and constrained by atomic (HI) and molecular (CO) observations of the cloud gas in the interstellar medium.  However, HI and CO surveys are less sensitive to the early stages of the molecular cloud formation.  Through measurements of CI and CII line emissivity with HEAT, the project will map the early stages of cloud formation as clouds of atomic hydrogen transition to Giant Molecular Clouds of H2.  The project also plans to observe the NII line to determine the ionizing luminosity of OB stars, which is a standard metric for star formation rate.  This data will be correlated with the rate of destruction of nearby GMCs as measured by the CII observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The HEAT telescope is a fully automated facility designed to run unattended for a year between servicing missions.  The proposal points out that there are actually two fully functional HEAT telescope/receiver facilities; one that is deployed in Antarctica while the other is being refurbished in Arizona for the following year.  This project will build upon previous efforts by the PI to train of a new generation of scientists and engineers by involving them not only in the science from the facility, but by providing a hands-on experience with the instrumentation as the off-duty HEAT telescope is refurbished.  The project intends to communicate its results to the general public in two ways.  First, the project will use the off-duty facility for public outreach demonstrations held at the University of Arizona.  Second, the project intends to present the HEAT project via a program produced for PBS?s NOVA television series.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF-funded program has developed the first robotic, automated,  astronomical observatory with cryogenic detectors at "Ridge A", the  summit of the Antarctic ice sheet, a site that provides as close to  space-like conditions as can be reliably produced on the ground.  The  exceptional conditions that we have measured at Ridge A are the product  of the extreme cold, high, dry, clear, and calm nature at the isolated  top of the Antarctic plateau.  The High Elevation Antarctic Terahertz  (HEAT) telescope takes full  advantage of these extraordinary conditions to perform astronomical  observations that are otherwise unachievable except on very expensive  space-based platforms.    Antarctica is as close as you can get to space-like observing conditions, but with your feet still on the ground -- and at a fraction of the cost.  Technologically, HEAT represents the very first facility of its kind.  It is a pathfinding facility that represents a new generation of Polar  instrumentation. As a robotic, automated facility, it operates for a  year at a time without direct human contact.  As such, it bears more  resemblance to a space satellite than a ground-based telescope, both  in design and in operation.  Our successful realization of this concept  permits the excellent conditions of remote sites to be harnessed  without the costs and hazards of manned operations, and is the result of  an international collaboration between this NSF-funded effort at the  University of Arizona and our colleagues at the University of New South  Wales in Sydney, Australia.    The HEAT telescope observes at terahertz (THz) frequencies, about  1000 times higher frequency than those used by mobile phones and 1000  times lower frequency, or redder, than one can see with one's eyes.  In  this frequency range, the most crucial spectral diagnostics of the  formation of galaxies, stars, planets, and life are found.  HEAT has  successfully operated for 2 years during this effort and has delivered  the largest terahertz-frequency spectroscopic survey of the Milky Way in  the light of atomic carbon at 810 GHz, or 0.81 THz.  It has also  observed high-mass star formation at frequencies as high as 1.5 THz and  it has determined that such observations, nearly impossible to perform  anywhere else, can be done reliably 80-90 days per year.  This site may  also be the only place on Earth where the 1.9 THz spectral signature of  ionized carbon, the brightest feature in our Milky Way Galaxy, can be  observed with regularity and the program continues towards this goal.    The data that HEAT delivers are freely provided to everyone, without a  proprietary period, on the web at soral.as.arizona.edu/heat/   HEAT has already allowed the isolation and determination of over 900 molecular clouds in the Galaxy in the light of carbon monoxide (CO)  and atomic carbon (C), two of the three main reservoirs of carbon in the  Galaxy.   It has discovered that weak, diffuse atomic carbon emission  permeates the Galaxy, and that up to 40% of the molecular gas in the  Galaxy has been missed by only looking at the millimeter-wave  transitions of CO, as has been done up to this point.  In some regions  of the Galaxy, this missing "dark gas" even dominates that previously  measured in the light of CO.   HEAT is identifying regions in the Galaxy  where dark molecular clouds may be forming, a process never before witnessed.  This is important because every star and every planet forms from a molecular cloud -- and HEAT is starting to witness how these clouds arose.  This is a  crucial step to the formation of stars, planets, and life.       Last Modified: 08/30/2018       Submitted by: Craig A Kulesa]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
