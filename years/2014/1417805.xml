<AbstractNarration>This proposal funds the research activities of Assistant Professor Jack Laiho at Syracuse University.  Laiho's research focuses on precision studies of the interactions of quarks via the strong and weak nuclear forces.  These forces are a part of the enormously successful Standard Model of particle physics.  In order to compare the predictions of the Standard Model with experimental observations large-scale supercomputer calculations are required to correctly account for the effects of the strong nuclear force using an approach called Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).  Theoretical predictions of the Standard Model are compared with experimental results obtained from particle accelerator experiments, thus testing our understanding of the laws of nature.  So far, good agreement has been found.  While it is satisfying that the current framework describes matter and its interactions so well, it is known from cosmology that there is physics not accounted for within the Standard Model.  The discovery of discrepancies between the Standard Model predictions and experiments done at particle colliders would be very exciting, as such results could lead to an understanding of the mysteries that are not explained in the current framework, including why there is as much matter in the universe as there is.  A broader impact of this research is that the Lattice QCD ensembles used by the PIs are made publicly available and are used by other researchers studying quark interactions throughout the world.  Additionally, knowledge of computational methods and problem solving skills needed to perform research in lattice field theory are useful assets for graduate students, whether they continue in academic research positions or get jobs in the private sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laiho's research focuses on calculations using Lattice QCD that are needed to maximize the impact of high-energy particle physics experiments.  This includes lattice calculations of heavy-light and light-light weak matrix elements, quantities where one needs to control the effects of non-perturbative QCD.  This work makes use of high performance computing facilities throughout the US, and is used for calculations of Standard Model predictions that are needed for comparisons with experimental observations as part of the search for new physics.  Laiho also has an interest in applying lattice methods to the study of quantum gravity to try to determine whether or not a quantum field theory of gravity is renormalizable when formulated nonperturbatively.   The Lattice QCD calculations funded by this grant are essential to make best use of the existing and planned experimental facilities including LHCb and Belle II.  They can help to uncover new physics beyond the Standard Model, and they provide insight into the workings of the strong nuclear force and quark interactions.  The research on gravity might lead to an understanding of how to handle another nontrivial theory using lattice methods in the non-perturbative regime.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF award funded the two threads of my research.  The first of these is the study of the subatomic particles known as quarks and gluons.  These particles interact via nuclear forces, and the equations that govern these interactions are known.  The laws of physics governing these interactions make up what is now known as the standard model, and it is one of the main purposes of this line of work to try to find failures in the standard model description of nature, i.e. to discover new laws of physics.  This can be done by comparing the precise predictions of the standard model with experimental results coming out of high energy particle colliders like the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland.  The calculations required to make such predictions require supercomputers and highly optimized code, along with detailed analyses of the numerical data that is generated.  This grant has funded the calculation of several different quantities that parameterize the decays of quarks, allowing us to constrain physics beyond the standard model.  The other thread of my research is an attempt to quantize gravity.  This approach makes use of the same numerical techniques that are used to solve the nuclear interactions of quarks.  This is a relatively high risk, high reward research program, since it focuses on an attempt to understand quantum gravity that is not particularly main stream.  It is a straightforward attempt to quantize general relativity as a quantum field theory, and as such is fairly minimilist.  One of the obstacles is that gravity is known to be nonrenormalizable, that is, there are infinities that appear in the theory when one attempts to calculate things, which is a sign that the theory loses predictive power, since actual physical gravitational processes do not have this divergent behavior.  My results using lattice methods suggest that this is not a problem for even the simplest implementation of general relativity as a quantum field theory, but rather a shortcoming of the usual approximations used to solve the theory.  If true, we might actually have a workable quantum theory of gravity from which predictions could be made.  We believe that this line of research deserves further investigation.
