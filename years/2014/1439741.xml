<AbstractNarration>This award supports student involvement in the 2014 IEEE Conference on Healthcare Innovations and Point-of-Care Technologies to be held in Seattle, WA, on October 8-10, 2014. This conference is focused on potential innovative technology solutions to challenges associated with care delivery. It includes panel discussions, scientific and clinical presentations, and breakout sessions. The conference will also offer students the opportunity to participate in an IDEO design innovation workshop in which students will work with clinicians and engineers to develop and conceptualize innovative ideas for healthcare applications. The goal of this project is to involve students in all facets of the conference, from meeting planning to presentations, the IDEO workshop and session leadership to post-conference evaluation.</AbstractNarration>

In order to maximize the quality of student participation, the scholarships included a unique once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn lifelong design development skills through an IDEO Design Innovation Workshop.    The workshop was for participants with healthcare technology innovation ideas that they would like to develop, or who would like to learn about the process of innovation, design and product development.  Participants worked in teams through a structured design process to develop innovative ideas into potential products for healthcare applications.  During the workshop, 8 project teams of students and other participants brainstormed their ideas before the conference and then continued to work throughout the conference to advance their innovation toward meeting an unmet clinical need/challenge under the mentoring of experienced professionals and entrepreneurs from IDEO, a renowned design and innovation consulting company.  Students applied for the workshop either as Idea Generators or Idea Developers.   Idea Generators: brought an innovative idea that they were currently incubating or a challenge that they wanted to solve to the workshop through the  "Idea Generator" pr...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
