<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on systems that allow one weak light pulse to control another weak light pulse. The motivation for these systems ranges from practical applications (such as low-power "switches" that route light pulses through optical communication networks), to fundamental issues in quantum physics. The experimental research is based on a promising new platform comprised of small-scale devices (waveguides) that steer tiny beams of light through atomic vapors. The knowledge created from this research will impact a number of different areas in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, and the project centers on training the next generation of scientists through extensive graduate and undergraduate student involvement in the research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific systems being pursued involve the use of sub-wavelength diameter tapered optical fibers surrounded by atomic vapors, and small hollow-core photonic bandgap fibers filled with atomic vapors.  In both cases, strong nonlinearities are enabled by waveguiding a tightly confined optical mode over a long distance through the atomic medium. The use of metastable xenon (an inert noble gas) as the atomic vapor overcomes major limitations imposed by the earlier use of rubidium (a reactive alkali atom). The enhanced nonlinearities in these xenon-based waveguide systems will allow the realization of new types of research on quantum entanglement and non-classical state generation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nonlinear optical (NLO) effects can enable situations in which one beam of light controls what happens to a second beam of light.  In traditional NLO systems, however, these effects are very weak and can only be observed using high-power laser beams. The realization of new types of NLO systems that operate with ultralow-power beams would enable practical applications ranging from all-optical switching and storage, to quantum information processing with light.  This project investigated a promising new ultralow-power NLO system based on the use of small-scale optical waveguides in atomic vapors.    The experimental platform involved the use of Optical Nanofibers (ONFs) that were fabricated by heating and stretching standard commercial optical fibers until their diameter was roughly 300 times thinner than a human hair.  These ultrathin ONFs have the ability to guide a beam of light along the fiber, with a substantial fraction of the guided light existing outside of the fiber itself.  Consequently, when an ONF is suspended in a gas of atoms, there can be very strong interactions between the guided light beam and atoms in close proximity to the ONF surface.  These strong light-atom interactions enable the realization of NLO effects with ultralow-power beams.  Using this ONF in atomic vapor platform we were able to experimentally observe a variety of NLO effects at power levels that were several orders of magnitude smaller than those used in conventional NLO systems.  In addition, we developed a new type of ONF-based resonator that has the potential to lower the required power levels by several more orders of magnitude. This device, which we call a Nanofiber-Segment Ring Resonator (NFSRR), represents a robust platform that has potential spin-off applications in optical sensing and measurement techniques.  Much of this work was done using rubidium atoms to form the atomic vapor.  Rubidium has a number of desirable properties, but also has a problematic tendency to stick (adsorb) to the glass ONF surface which limits the system's overall performance. Consequently, we investigated the use of xenon (an inert noble gas) as a suitable replacement for rubidium (a reactive alkali metal) in these experiments, and observed significant improvements in the overall ONF in atomic vapor platform.    This project led to the training of 5 physics graduate students at UMBC. The results of our work were disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and 2 doctoral theses.
