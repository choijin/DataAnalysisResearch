<AbstractNarration>Antibiotic resistant pathogens are a global human health threat, and there is growing attention on the potential role of the aquatic environment as a significant route by which antibiotic resistance may spread. Disinfection at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is designed to limit the pathogens that enter rivers and streams. However this may not significantly reduce genes which give bacteria the mechanisms by which they can defend against antibiotics, known as antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs). This project will study the effect of UV disinfection on the fate of ARGs in the effluent of the Xiamen, China WWTP, focusing on the location of ARGs with respect to whether ARGs are inside or outside of the cell. The location of ARGs impacts how the genes are acquired by pathogens, and how they persist in the environment. In collaboration with Professor Chang-Ping Yu at the Institute of Urban Environment the Chinese Academy of Sciences, this research seeks to advance technologies for minimizing the spread of antibiotic resistance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Samples will be taken before and after disinfection at the WWTP and then examined using a combination of methods to determine the shift in location of ARGs. The methods used will quantify two representative ARGs (tetM and sulI) by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Propidium monoazide (PMA) qPCR will be conducted to determine the intracellular portion of ARGs, and qPCR will determine total ARGs. This will give information on the role UV disinfection on whether these ARGs will be inside or outside the cell. This research will lead to a better understanding of antibiotic resistance and therefor may lead to better combatants to the spread of ARGs and increased public health. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this EAPSI project, we investigated what happens to antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) as they go through a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP).  ARGs are important to study because they give microbes including pathogens the capability to resist antibiotic treatments, and microbes have the ability to share these ARGs and even take ARGs up if they are free in the environment.   WWTPs are a source of ARGs to the environment due to flushed and excreted antibiotics and resistant microbes with in WWTP.  Therefore it is important to understand how WWTP processes like disinfection effect ARGs and therefore gain understanding of what may happen once released into the environment.   During this project, we studied the effect of disinfection at WWTPs on whether ARGs were mainly inside microbes, or outside microbes.  This greatly impacts how and if these ARGs will travel through water in the environment.  To do this we sampled two WWTPs in Xiamen, China.  We chose this location due to ChinaÆs high concentration of ARGs in sewage, and the nearby Chinese Academy of Science, Institute of Urban Environment in which the samples were analyzed in Dr. Chang-Ping YuÆs lab.  Samples were taken before and after disinfection, then quantified the total amount of two different ARGs (tetM and sulI), and the portion of these genes contained inside microbes.  This analysis revealed a decrease in the ARGs as a result of disinfection, however there was not a clear effect of disinfection on the proportion of ARGs within microbes.  As a result, a collaborative effort has continued with Dr. YuÆs research group to continue sampling these WWTPs and gain a better understand of ARG location as a result of disinfection.   The EAPSI experience has considerably impacted my training and professional development by teaching me new research methods, learning more about Chinese history and culture, and creating collaborations and friendships with Chinese researchers.  All of these will increase the quality of my research here in the US as collaboration with Chinese researchers will be crucial for solving complex environmental problems.  Presentations of this project have been given at research group meetings both in China and in the US, and a manuscript will be written detailing final results of the project.   This EAPSI project has already advanced the knowledge we have of ARGs in WWTPs, and with this healthy collaboration with Dr. Yu, we will continue to gain more knowledge on this topic.  This critical information will help combat the spread of antibiotic resistance and thus decrease the amount of resistant infections in the US and throughout the world.
