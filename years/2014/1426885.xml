<AbstractNarration>Research in decision-making has increasingly focused on the use of heuristics, or  short cuts, to describe judgment and decision-making, such as recent work on rationality and fast-and-frugal heuristics. The central purpose of research on fast-and-frugal heuristics is to characterize the various strategies that people employ across a variety of decision tasks, with the goal of understanding the interplay between task structure and strategy use. At the same time, other work in judgment and decision-making has begun exploring the interrelationship between basic-level cognitive processes such as attention and memory and higher-level processes involved in decision-making. For example, recent work illustrates that theoretical models based on long-term memory and working-memory are important for understanding judgment and decision making in a variety of real-world domains, such as medical diagnosis and intelligence analysis. The overarching goal of the present research is to integrate the fast-and-frugal heuristics approach with a judgment model based on basic memory theory. The researchers' goal is to address, both empirically and theoretically, how basic memory processes such as long-term memory and working memory both enable and constrain the use of fast-and-frugal heuristics. The resulting theoretical and empirical research will advance fundamental theory broadly in the area of judgment and decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on fast-and-frugal heuristics has been amongst the most influential and widely cited work within the area of judgment and decision-making over the past few decades. However, despite the proliferation of research on fast-and-frugal heuristics, aspects of the framework remain somewhat ill-defined. In particular, while the framework relies extensively on constructs from the area of memory, relatively little theoretical and empirical work has pursued this aspect of heuristic functioning. Yet, this is an important component of most real-world judgment and choice tasks, as the input to the decision process often relies upon the output of memory. The proposed work aims to address this gap in the literature by systematically investigating the role of memory in cue-based inference tasks where heuristics such as Take-the-best are assumed to operate. In addition to the project's contribution to the empirical literature, this work will break new ground on theoretical models of decision-making by merging fast-and-frugal heuristics with a memory-processes model of hypothesis generation and judgment. The proposed experiments will provide a detailed analysis of the underlying memory processes that both enable and constrain memory-based inference. The knowledge gained from this research has the potential to impact decision making in applied contexts such as risk communication and medicine, where heuristic rules are implemented as decision aids.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cue-based inferences require decision-makers to determine which option will be better on a criterion of interest based on observed attribute values (cues) of those options. For example, a car buyer might infer which of two cars is more reliable based on attributes such as transmission type, horsepower, and body style. A large body of literature has focused on what information people use and how that information is combined when making these types of decisions. Much of this research assumes that cue use is driven by objective cue validity, the proportion of times a cue correctly indicates which option is better on the criterion given that the cue discriminates between the options.  This research also typically compares under which circumstances people are likely to use compensatory strategies, high values on less useful cues can compensate for a low value on a highly useful cue, versus noncompensatory strategies, only the most useful cue is used. Recently, however, this framework has been criticized, both because the strategy selection process is poorly specified and because the increasing number of strategies in the toolbox makes it difficult to falsify.  Single-strategy frameworks can account for much the same data as the multi-strategy frameworks because they are able to mimic apparent strategy changes by adjusting thresholds or information weights.  Although there is evidence for both the multi-strategy and single-strategy frameworks, none of the current frameworks provide a fully compelling account of adaptive decision-making in cue-based inferences. Most frameworks rely on the concept of pre-computed cue hierarchies based on cue validity.  The general concept of a precomputed hierarchy is not psychologically plausible because of the amount of knowledge required to calculate cue validity and the number of calculations that need to be made.   The research conducted In this project demonstrates that a framework for cue-based inferences based on memory accessibility can account for apparently different strategies.  In other words, we argue that the decisions one makes depend on the information one can retrieve from memory as opposed to being the result of an explicit strategy per se.  The framework we developed as part of this project is capable of accounting for apparent changes in peoples decision strategy via memory accessibility, thus, avoiding the strategy selection problem that plagues many theories of decision making.  We published several studies investigating cue use in cue-based inferences that found that people are also influenced by non-statistical properties of the cues such as saliency and accessibility. These (memory) accessibility properties have been manipulated independently of cue validity through manipulations of cue frequency, serial position, and fluency.   Unlike some other frameworks, the use of cues in our theory and computational models are described in a psychologically plausible manner that is not based on a validity hierarchy but is instead based on well-established memory phenomena. Overall, the project demonstrated that an accessibility-based model can mimic apparently different strategies without explicitly specifying qualitatively different strategies. Specifically, both our empirical findings and simulation results demonstrate that classic manipulations that typically lead to both choice and process differences that are interpreted as strategy shifts can be accounted for by a model with no explicit strategies.
