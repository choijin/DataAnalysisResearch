<AbstractNarration>Corn is the world's leading grain crop. In the U.S. alone, more than 250 billion tons are harvested annually, generating twice as much revenue as any other crop. Corn is deeply rooted in our economy, being used in over 42,000 different applications, including the production of consumer goods, foods, pharmaceuticals, livestock feed, and fuel. The demand for corn continues to rise each year, fueling efforts to increase production. Unfortunately, 10-20 percent of the corn crop is lost every year due to breakage of the stalk before harvest, typically due to wind-induced stalk failure. These losses significantly reduce productivity of farms, negatively impact individual farmers, and decrease national production, thus affecting the cost of consumer goods, commodities trading, fuel, food, and the broader economy. Because so much corn is grown annually, even a relative small improvement in corn stalk strength could have a dramatically positive affect on total production and farm productivity. While biologists have worked for many years to address this problem, this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports a new approach: involving structural engineers working closely with industrial biologists. The combination of engineering with biology will support the development of stronger varieties of corn, and provide additional insights into crops, including the development of strategies and approaches for similarly strengthening other crops. The project will also expose undergraduate students to a meaningful and interdisciplinary research experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will address corn stalk failure using engineering failure analysis techniques.  First, in-field observations of natural failures will be performed to describe the nature of stalk failure, both qualitatively (physical description and appearance), and quantitatively (location and orientation).  Properly describing and quantifying the types and distributions of failure patterns will allow subsequent research to focus on regions of weakness hypothesized to reside near stalk nodes.  Laboratory tests will then be performed in order to collect additional geometric and strength data in a controlled environment using several types of corn stalks. Following these test, measurement of corn stalk tissues will be performed to assess stiffness, strength, and chemical composition.  Finally, these various aspects will be combined to perform statistical analyses, and to create engineering models of corn stalk behavior.  The overarching goal of this project is to identify aspects of the corn stalk which are associated with failure, seeking candidate features which could be modified to produce stronger stalks.  This study constitutes the first engineering failure analysis of corn stalks, and will provide a wealth of valuable information regarding the structural characteristics of this important crop, thus supporting and contributing to efforts to develop stronger varieties of corn.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This research project focused on the problem of maize stalk lodging. Each year, approximately 5% of the US maize crop is lost due to stalk failure - an annual economic loss of $3.8 billion. In this research, biomechanical engineering expertise was used to gain insights and new knowledge about maize stalk failure.</p> <p>Our first study was a forensic engineering analysis of maize stalk failure. A team of engineers carefully examined hundreds of collapsed stalks. We discovered three modes of failure: snapping, splitting, and creasing (or buckling). The failure of healthy stalks is dominated by the creasing failure pattern (see Figure 1).</p> <p>This knowledge was used to develop a new testing protocol for measuring the strength of maize stalks in the laboratory. This protocol produced the same failure pattern as naturally collapsed stalks. We also discovered that previous testing protocols induced premature failure of the stalk - introducing inaccuracies into those measurements.</p> <p>X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning was next used to obtain high-resolution, three-dimensional data of the maize stalk shape and material distribution. Over 1000 stalks were scanned. Customized computer code was used to automatically analyze this scan data, allowing the collection of hundreds of geometric measurements for each stalk (see Figure 2).</p> <p>After scanning, stalks were subjected to non-destructive flexural testing as well as a destructive bending test to determine the ultimate bending strength of each stalk. Statistical analyses of the structural and geometric data revealed many new insights. First, flexural stiffness was found to be closely related to stalk strength. Second, the maize cross-section was found to elliptical in shape. Third, engineering beam models were used and modified to predict the stresses within the maize stalk. We found that the section modulus (an engineering quantity used to describe the relationship between load and stress) was highly predictive of maize stalk strength.&nbsp;</p> <p>These insights were used to develop a field device for measuring maize stalk strength. This device was developed by undergraduate engineering students. The device was first deployed at 10 sites in 2016. An improved device was deployed at additional sites in 2017-18. The device is capable of performing approximately 200 stalk tests per hour and, over 34,000 field tests have been performed with this device (see Figure 3). The collected data was used to distinguishing differences between the strength of different varieties of maize. Plant breeders can now use this device to develop stronger crop varieties.</p> <p>Another goal of this project was to create computational models of maize stalks. These models based on the maize stalk geometries obtained from CT scans. However, such models require a knowledge of mechanical tissue properties of maize stalks. Consequently, we developed a number of different testing protocols to obtain the mechanical tissue properties of maize stalk tissues. These included longitudinal compression tests, transverse compression tests, and longitudinal tension tests (see Figure 4). These tests provided the first highly reliable assessments of maize stalk tissues. We found that the tough outer rind has material stiffness that is approximately equivalent to many common types of wood. The soft inner tissues have material properties that are more similar to styrofoam. The accuracy and precision of each test type was analyzed and compared in a series of scientific publications.</p> <p>Armed with geometric data from CT scans and tissue properties data, we created detailed computational models of maize stalks. These models were validated against the mechanical test data to ensure that the predictions from these models were accurate and reliable. These models were used to determine the influence of each model parameter on the overall strength of the corn stalk (see Figure 5). We found that geometric parameters have the highest influence on maize stalk strength. This suggests that the strength of maize stalks may be modified by breeding stalks with slightly different geometric features. This has particular relevance for the creation of hybrid first/second generation biofuel crops. These are crops that produce a high grain yield, but the stalks can also be used to generate biofuel. Such crops are not yet possible because stalks that are suitable for biofuel production have very weak tissue properties. Our research suggests that tissue weaknesses could be offset by subtle changes to stalk geometry.</p> <p>This research project has dramatically increased our knowledge of the factors influencing maize stalk strength. We now have reliable test protocols for assessing stalk geometry, strength, and material properties. In addition, a device has been developed for measuring stalk strength in the field. The data collected in this study is still being analyzed and studied. The knowledge and resources generated from this study will continue to improve our knowledge of maize stalk strength and failure ? hopefully leading to the development of structurally superior crops in the near future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/31/2018<br>      Modified by: Douglas&nbsp;Cook</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1400973/1400973_10332493_1541025164445_Test--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1400973/1400973_10332493_1541025164445_Test--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4: Mechanical Tests"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1400973/1400973_10332493_1541025164445_Test--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4: Mechanical Tests"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Top left: Tension test.
