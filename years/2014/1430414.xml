<AbstractNarration>The 2014 IEEE North American School for Information Theory (NASIT?14) will be held at the Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences in Toronto, Canada, from June 18th to June 21st, 2014. This Project provides support for the expenses of school participants from the United States, including graduate students and postdocs. These participants will benefit from attending the school, learning from senior colleagues, presenting their own research in poster sessions, and expanding their network contacts within the community, but who lack funds and would not be able to attend without travel support. The student selection criteria emphasize ethnic diversity, gender equality, and geographic diversity, to ensure broad participation in the workshop.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The 2014 IEEE North American School for Information Theory (NASIT Æ14) was held at the Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences in Toronto, Canada, from June 18th to June 21st, 2014.  This NSF project provided travel funds for student and postdoctoral participants from the United States.  A set of selection criteria were set up to ensure support was prioritized for participants that lack travel funds and would not be able to attend without the NSFÆs support.  An effort was also made to reach out to departments, such as math, where students work on information or coding theoretic topics, but often cannot attend IEEE conferences due to high registration costs. The IEEE North American School for Information Theory is an annual event of the IEEE Information Theory Society.  2014 was the seventh year the school was held.  The School provides a supportive environment where foundations for learning and long-term future scientific collaborations are established.  The School delivers interactive education for graduate students in the mathematical, engineering, and computer sciences.  It presents students the opportunity to meet with and learn from senior researchers from academia and industry who present long-format tutorials.  Student and postdoc participants present their own research results in poster sessions, giving them opportunities to expand their network with their community.  The IEEE Information Theory Society "Padovani Lecture" is delivered at the school.  The IEEE North American School for Information Theory is hosted by different institutions each year, with the intent of increasing the geographic diversity of the participants.  Attendance at the 2014 school included 95 registered students and postdocs, as well as 30 other registrants including 6 lecturers, 3 industrial panelists, 5 organizing committee members, and 13 professors from 7 other schools.  We encouraged attendance of faculty to increase opportunities for student/faculty interaction.       Last Modified: 07/25/2015       Submitted by: Aylin Yener]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
