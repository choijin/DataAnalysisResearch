<AbstractNarration>The Internet is an indispensable part of society today, but many of the details about how well it operates are poorly understood.  This project will support and enhance the Seattle community testbed, one of the tools supporting experimentation for measuring and understanding the Internet.   The Seattle testbed allows researchers the ability to safely run experiments on real user devices and networks and gives experimenters access to thousands of devices around the world.   End users must decide to 'opt-in' by installing the Seattle software on their tablet, smartphone, or other computing device to participate in Seattle.  Via enhancements to the Seattle platform, the project will improve the ability of researchers to understand smartphone and future network environments as they exist in the Internet today, so that they may improve the Internet and design better networks in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support the continued growth and development of the Seattle Testbed.   The programming APIs of the Seattle sandbox will be enhanced to add support for IPv6, reading device sensors, and multi-homing.   It will also improve support for NAT traversal, mobility, and similar code on the platform.   Several scalability and stability issues with the platform will be addressed, including automated build testing and similar practices.   The project will also more explicitly expose the community-driven development model at the project's core to make it easier for outside groups to participate in Seattle development and to also address the long-term sustainability of the Seattle code-base.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project extended the Seattle Testbed, a testbed used by thousands of students and researchers, to support wireless access points.   Prior to this work, the Seattle testbed ran in the background of tens of thousands of laptops, desktops, phones, and other devices around the world.  Seattle is commonly used for education, censorship detection / avoidance, and network measurement.  It provides unique capabilities because of the open model of use / participation and the utilization of devices owned by outside users.  SOAR (Seattle on Access Routers) extended Seattle Testbed to run on wireless router devices at the edge of home networks, thus founding a distributed cloud platform that permits researchers to securely run experiments while preserving the privacy of the router?s owner, and the safety and efficient operation of the device itself.  SOAR addressed many challenges that hinder research on home networks. Any research platform designed for such studies must provide a set of programming interfaces to support as wide an array of measurements as possible. In addition, deployment on a home wireless router has tighter resource limitations than a home computer, or even a cell phone. The SOAR platform addressed these concerns. It derives its  basic building blocks from the Seattle project, a proven large-scale, open-source testbed system. Seattle enables code from untrusted sources to run securely on resources donated by volunteer contributors from around the world. Its multiple applications in both the academic and educational communities have included supporting experimentation, measurements, and rapid code prototyping for research and teaching in distributed and networked systems, and mobile and wireless networks.  To adapt Seattle to work within the parameters designated above, our research team first harnessed another technology developed in our lab called Fence. This system ensured that code run over the network will access only a fixed percentage of the device's CPU, memory disk, and other resources. In addition, we used OpenWrt, a popular Linux platform for home routers, to allow users to build their own installers. Lastly, SOAR extended eight functionalities based on Repy, the core sandbox of Seattle, which allows researchers to implement a wide range of network measurements. This includes additional network measurement functionality with a focus on wireless / radio and IP layer measurements as well as support for the modern IPv6 network protocol, and HTTPS server extensions.  While the software artifacts produced by the project implement the functionality above, SOAR is also proven successful in teaching and the advancement of academic research. Over its runtime, 23 undergraduate and graduate students worked on Seattle and SOAR for theses and project assignments, helping them gather practical networking and programming experience based on modern software engineering practices and tools such as Git and Continuous Integration. Furthermore, students at multiple universities use our technology in classes, with six lively and enduring cooperations with other educational institutions at home and abroad. SOAR and derived technologies also resulted in 7 papers and posters published at international academic conferences and journals.  Summing up, the SOAR project has created a useful and practical software stack and environment for research on home networks, has been used in classes and as a practical teaching tool for software engineering, and has resulted in numerous contributions to scientific progress as evidenced by multiple publications.
