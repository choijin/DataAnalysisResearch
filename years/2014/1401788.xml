<AbstractNarration>Low-energy electrons play a critical role in a large number of fundamental and applied fields. They can induce specific chemical reactions which are relevant to dielectric aging, surface engineering, radiation damage, cancer therapy, and atmospheric physics. A particularly important process is dissociative electron attachment (DEA) involving electron capture by a molecule with the following break-up of a molecular bond. In spite of decades of experimental and theoretical studies of this process the understanding of it is far from complete. This is especially relevant to DEA processes involving molecular clusters, which are many molecules loosely bound by weak forces. The present project plans to theoretically study electron-molecule collision processes in gas phase and in cluster environments. The proposed activities will advance the theory of electron interaction with molecules and clusters, and molecules in a cluster environment. This research will create new knowledge in the areas connecting collision physics with chemical control, radiobiology and atmospheric science. The research will involve interdisciplinary efforts and collaborations with scientists from other fields. It will train students in broader areas including several subdisciplines. Examples demonstrating the role of low-energy electrons in different areas of chemistry, biology and environmental science will be incorporated in teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's major focus is on the development of the nonlocal complex potential theory of DEA for polyatomic molecules. This theory would allow a proper incorporation of long-range interaction effects into the DEA description for polyatomic molecules which has previously been absent. These effects might cause special type of resonances, vibrational Feshbach resonances, in DEA. They were previously described in the approximation of one reaction coordinate, and the project includes plans to generalize the theory to the case of several vibrational degrees of freedom. In addition, the effects of the cluster environment on the DEA processes will be investigated by the use of multiple-scattering theory. Almost no information on these effects,  experimental or theoretical, is presently available, although they are  important for the understanding of the mechanism of radiation damage to  biologically-relevant molecules.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit::  Dissociative electron attachment process is one of the major mechanisms of the bond breaking in molecules. It plays significant role in plasma processing, particularly nanofabrication, in electron-driven chemistry, particularly surface chemistry and atmospheric chemistry. It was recently discovered that low-energy electrons play important role in radiation damage and processes involved in ion-beam cancer therapy.  In the present project the theory of dissociative attachment processes was further developed and applied to bond breaking in several molecules, starting from simple diatomic halogen molecules and ending with complex molecules of biological interest. The influence of the water cluster environment on the dissociative attachment process has been also investigated, and several effects have been discovered, some of those enhancing the dissociative attachment rates, and some decreasing. These findings has improved our knowledge about electron interactions with molecules and clusters and mechanisms for molecular bond breaking.  In the course of the present work new method for description of positronium (a bound state of electron and positron) with atom and molecules have been also developed and applied to description of positronium scattering by rare gas atoms, molecular hydrogen, protons and antiprotons. This work is important for our understanding of the matter-antimatter interaction.  Broader impacts:  The findings have contributed to the field of the radiation biodamage and ion-beam cancer therapy. The results for electron attachment to thymine and uracil molecules show how low-energy electrons can produce the bond breaking in these molecules. The results on surface and cluster effects show how the bond breaking process in biomolecules is affected by surface and cluster environments. These findings are also important for atmospheric science and nanofabrication. In particular many plasma processes in nanotechnology are controlled by the dissociative attachment reaction..   The present project provided opportunities for training and mentoring of a graduate student. He was trained in research, computer simulations, and scientific writing. Several aspects of the present research have been incorporated in physics courses taught by the PI.                 Last Modified: 09/17/2019       Submitted by: Ilya I Fabrikant]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
