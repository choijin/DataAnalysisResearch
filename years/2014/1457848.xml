<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Research Coordination Network project is to develop an international network of researchers who use genetic methodologies to study the ecology and evolution of marine organisms in the Indo-Pacific to share data, ideas and methods. The tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans encompass the largest biogeographic region on the planet, the Indo-Pacific. It spans over half of the Earth's circumference and includes the exclusive economic zones of over 50 nations and territories. The Indo-Pacific is also home to our world's most diverse marine environments. The enormity and diversity of the Indo-Pacific poses tremendous logistical, political and financial obstacles to individual researchers and laboratories attempting to study the marine biology of the region. Genetic methods can provide invaluable information for our understanding of processes ranging from individual dispersal to the composition and assembly of entire marine communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will: (1) assemble a unique, open access database of population genetic data and associated metadata that is compatible with the developing genomic and biological diversity standards for data archiving, (2) facilitate open communication and collaboration among researchers from across the region through international workshops, virtual communication and a collaborative website, (3) promote training in the use of genetic methodologies in ecology and evolution for researchers from developing countries through these same venues, and (4) use the assembled database to address fundamental questions about the evolution of species and the reservoirs of genetic diversity in the Indo-Pacific. The network will provide a model for international collaborative networks and genetic databasing in biodiversity research that extends beyond the results of this Research Coordination Network effort.</AbstractNarration>

DIPnet has worked to leverage existing datasets to better understand the processes that shape Indo-Pacific biodiversity.  Toward these goals, the DIPnet consortium has published three papers (with another in the works) that leverage the huge volume of genetic data synthesized by this effort:  A. Understanding patterns of marine biodiversity across multiple levels of organization  Matias and Riginos (2018) used genetic data from nine species to test hypotheses about the species-level gradient of biodiversity in the Indo-Pacific. Liggins et al. (in prep) have found a correlation between species level biodiversity and genetic diversity.  B. Indo-Pacific Seascapes: Delineating conservation units with molecular data   Crandall, Toonen and Selkoe (2019) used simulations and coalescent metapopulation models for 41 marine species to show that larval dispersal is limited between Hawaiian islands even when traditional F-statistics are not significant.  C. Community Phylogeography: Shared ecological and evolutionary processes  Crandall et al. (2019) used genetic data from 56 coral reef species to test biogeographic hypotheses about barriers to gene flow in the Indo-Pacific.
