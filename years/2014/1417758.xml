<AbstractNarration>TITLE: Does the Arctic plant Eriophorum vaginatum take up organic N?&lt;br/&gt;Chapin et al. (1993) showed that Eriophorum vaginatum, the plant species that dominates arctic tussock tundra, not only can use organic N-sources, but actually grows better with amino acids as a sole N-source than with inorganic N salts. A challenge of this shifting view is that no one has actually quantified, for any plant species growing in the wild, and how much of E. vaginatum?s total N demand is met by organic N-sources! This project would quantify the forms of N it uses, as well as assessing organic nutrient dynamics in several other tundra communities. More broadly, this project would develop approaches for assessing organic nutrition more in other ecosystem types and so test the developing organic nutrition theory of N-limited plants. This project will support undergraduate education by integrating new material into classes at University California Santa Barbara, and by offering research experiences to a University California Santa Barbara undergraduate during year-1 and an Alaskan student to help with the field season in year-2. It will coordinate with the Toolik Long Term Ecosystem Research education program in creating a module on "What Plants Eat." The participants will work with the Santa Barbara Natural History Museum to develop a suite of activities that will engage the public to target three goals: 1. A better appreciation of the role of soil in our lives and ecosystems, 2. To understand the Arctic as a component of the Earth System, and 3. To better appreciate how science and scientists work and think.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenge to answering the question "Do plants really use organic N?" has been methodological. This project would use a combination of methods integrated through simulation modeling. The key novel method is microdialysis, in which a probe the size of a root is inserted into the soil, a carrier solution flows through it, and small molecules diffuse into it. Microdialysis will be coupled with intact root uptake kinetic studies, isotope partitioning, and analyzing diffusion and transport of amino acids, NH4+ and NO3- through soil to parameterize a root uptake model that will be used to synthesize and integrate the results. The first phase of the work will be done under controlled conditions in the greenhouse; then having refined the methods and assessed model parameters, the study will be moved into the field to assess seasonal patterns of N uptake and how it is affected by environmental manipulations.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Nitrogen is the element that most limits plant growth globally. For many years, the thinking had been that plants only used inorganic forms of N. Plants had to rely on soil microorganisms to decompose dead plant materials and so to regenerate inorganic N forms for plants to be able to take up N and grow. In the Arctic tundra, however, perhaps the most N limited ecosystem on Earth,, there didn?t appear to be adequate inorganic N released to support plant demands. Rather, it was discovered that tundra plants can take up simple organic forms of N?notably amino acids that might be released from proteins by the action of extracellular enzymes produced by soil microbes. This discovery led to a transformation in our view of how N cycles through ecosystems?shifting the emphasis from processes that release inorganic, mineral N to those that fragment N-containing polymers into pieces small enough for a plant to take up. This conceptual shift, however, had remained largely unproven?in environments where organic N uptake is likely important, N availability was so low that it wasn?t possible to quantify the rates of N turnover and supply to fully test the new hypotheses. This research used a new method (microdialysis) to assess the different N forms that are present in the soil solution and available for plant uptake. This approach uses small flow through dialysis membranes; they create a concentration gradient that allows soluble compounds to diffuse through the soil to the probe, where they can be collected and analyzed. In this way, microdialysis samples soil the same way a root does, and hence provides a quantitative method to monitor the chemicals that a root would be taking up?and hence to test the new theory. We found that whereas the inorganic N in the soil was high following snowmelt and dominated extractable pools of N in the soil, the actual flux of N was dominated by amino acids and showed little seasonal variation in comparison to inorganic N were only substantial during the early season shortly after snowmelt. These results also show how tundra plants are able to thrive in an environment so apparently N-limited: they don?t run out of N as the growing season continues! To our surprise the amino acid flux was dominated by positively charged amino acids (arginine, histidine, and lysine) dominated the flux of N. This project directly supported one PhD student and a postdoc, while indirectly supporting the training of 4 other PhD students who helped with field work and co-authored papers. Several of the trainees were first generation students and are developing their careers in academe. The project also created instructional videos on how to set up and install microdialysis probes.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/15/2021<br>      Modified by: Joshua&nbsp;P&nbsp;Schimel</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
