<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Ross Widenhoefer in the Department of Chemistry at Duke University for fundamental studies of  catalytic reactions based upon the element, gold, that enable the efficient transformation of simple organic molecules into more complex ones.  New catalytic methods that efficiently and selectively transform organic compounds into higher value products have the potential to transform various classes of chemical production.  Within this project, the mechanisms of specific reaction steps involved in gold-catalyzed reactions are being carefully investigated for their optimal application in chemical transformations. The proposed research activities are being integrated into the scientific education and training of the graduate and undergraduate student researchers, including students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. Graduate students are participating in educational activities offered through the Duke University Graduate School.  Graduate students and undergraduate students are also performing community outreach activities and developing demonstrations related to catalysis and coordination chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Widenhoefer is investigating the mechanisms of gold(I) pi-activation catalysis, including the hydrofunctionalization of carbon-carbon multiple bonds and the cycloaddition of enynes and related substrates. Despite a growing body of work in this area, limited experimental information is available regarding the mechanisms of the gold(I)-catalyzed hydrofunctionalization of carbon-carbon multiple bonds and, likewise, little direct experimental information is available regarding the structure and reactivity of cationic gold carbene complexes and cationic intermediates germane to gold-catalyzed enyne cycloaddition.  Research activities are being pursued to fill these gaps and to develop an experimentally-grounded understanding of the mechanisms of gold pi-activation catalysis.  The research is addressing four areas of inquiry: (1)  the mechanisms of gold-catalyzed intermolecular  hydrofunctionalization of carbon-carbon double bonds with strong and weak donor nucleophiles, (2) the extent of gold-carbon electron donation and d-to-pi backbonding in gold carbene complexes, (3) the structure and reactivity of cationic gold cyclopropyl carbene complexes lacking heteroatom stabilization, and (4) the mechanisms of silver-catalyzed  hydroarylation and skeletal rearrangement of bicyclo-[3.2.0]-heptenes formed in gold-catalyzed enyne cycloaddition.  Realization of the activities outlined in this proposal is expected to contribute in a meaningful way to the understanding of the mechanisms of gold(I)-catalyzed hydrofunctionalization and the structure and reactivity of gold carbene complexes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the most important developments in homogenous catalysis over the past 10 years has been the emergence of cationic gold(I) complexes as catalysts for the functionalization of C&ndash;C multiple bonds (pi-activation catalysis). As is often the case in homogeneous catalysis, an understanding of the mechanisms of gold pi-activation catalysis has lagged significantly behind the synthetic development of this chemistry, and available information is largely derived from computational analyses rather than experimental observation.  For this reason, our research activities during the tenure of this grant were directed toward (1) elucidating the mechanisms of gold-catalyzed intermolecular hydrofunctionalization of allenes with strong and weak donor nucleophiles, (2) evaluating the electronic structure and bonding of gold carbene complexes, (3) generating and interrogating cationic gold allenylidene complexes lacking heteroatom stabilization, and (4) elucidating the mechanisms of the skeletal rearrangement of strained alkenes generated in gold(I)-catalyzed enyne cycloaddition.              The intellectual merit of the research activities conducted during the tenure of this grant is four-fold.  Firstly, our efforts in the area of gold(I)-catalyzed hydrofunctionalization have contributed in a meaningful way to the broader understanding of the mechanisms of catalytic hydrofunctionalization, notably regarding the effects of nucleophile complexation on the kinetic behavior of catalysis.  Secondly, our work in the area of cationic gold carbene complexes  provides new insights into both the electronic structure and reactivity of the gold carbene complexes germane to a range of gold(I)-catalyzed transformations.  Thirdly, our results and conclusions provide mechanistic insight that will serve the ever growing global community of researchers working toward the development of new and more efficient gold(I) catalyzed transformations.  Fourthly, our investigations in these areas have uncovered a number of discrepancies between computational prediction and experimental observation, and for this reason, the insights drawn from our investigations will provide experimental benchmarks that will allow computational chemists to modify and improve their approaches.              The broader impacts of the activities conducted during the tenure of this grant stem from (1) the integration of scientific discovery with the training and education, (2) improving the graduate school educational experience, and (3) community outreach.  The PI has sought to provide meaningful research experiences for high school, undergraduate, and graduate student participants and to encourage both female students and students from traditionally underrepresented minority groups to participate in the PI?s research program and to pursue STEM-related careers.  With the objective of providing a more balanced graduate educational experience for students who are interested in pursuing careers in education at predominantly undergraduate institutions, these students have participated in a range of educational programs offered through the Duke Graduate School and the Department.  With respect to community outreach, the PI has implemented a high school outreach program in collaboration with Dr. Darrell Spells at the North Carolina School of Science and Math (NCSSM) and Dr. Ben Bobay of the Duke University NMR Center that provides hands-on experience and instruction in the use of high-field NMR spectroscopy.  To date, ~140 high school students from the NCSSM have participated in this program.          Last Modified: 12/04/2018       Submitted by: Ross A Widenhoefer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
