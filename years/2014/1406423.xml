<AbstractNarration>This project studies symplectic topology, which is a mathematical foundation of Hamiltonian dynamics. The research is also related to the mathematical foundation of string theory in theoretical physics. The project includes a systematic study of the "transversality problem" in those theories. We may regard this problem as a mathematical equivalent to the problem of infinity in quantum field theory in physics. The work is expected to answer essential questions in the mathematical foundation of theoretical physics. The project also studies several mathematical problems appearing in differential equations of classical mechanics.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PI and collaborators will study moduli spaces of holomorphic maps from bordered Riemann surfaces to a symplectic manifold with Lagrangian boundary conditions. This is a generalization of the theory of Floer homology which provides a mathematical formulation of topological open string theory. At the same time, the project will deepen the understanding of the virtual fundamental chains, which has important applications in the study of moduli spaces in differential geometry and topological field theories. Applications to Mirror symmetry and concrete problems in symplectic topology will also be investigated.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research is on symplectic geometry.  The main object is a global structure of symplectic manifolds.  Symplectic manifold is a space on which one can study Hamilton dynamics.  In symplectic geometry area of two dimensional object has an invariant meaning   in a similar way as in Riemannian manifold length of one dimensional object has an   invariant meaning.   Gromov in 1980's found studying 2 dimensional surface in symplectic manifold satisfying   certain equation (non-linear Cauchy-Riemann equation) gives a deep insight to a global symplectic manifold  and since then this becomes a basic tool in symplectic geometry.  The basic invariant is a `number' of sets of 2 dimensional surfaces satisfying non-linear Cauchy-Riemann equation.  More precisely we need to integrate various differential forms on sets of such 2 dimensional surfaces (moduli space   of pseudo-holomorphic curve).   Certain part of this research is related to provide foundation of such `integration'.  The main difficulty of such study lies in the fact that such moduli space is in general very singular.  Integration on a smooth manifold (non-singular space) is well established tool of differential geometry and topology.  Generalizing it to singular spaces is one outcome of this research.  We defined a notion of certain class of singular space, spaces with Kuranishi structure,   formulated the data, CF-perturbation, to define integration on such singular space,   and then develop general theory of integration on the space with Kuranishi structure equipped with CF-perturbation.  This is a version of the theory of `virtual fundamental chain'. Theory of virtual fundamental chain was started by   various people including PI in the year 1996.   As a part of this research we provide very detailed and precise version of the theory of virtual fundamental chain and   shows how we can apply it to the study of moduli space of pseudo-holomorphic curves.  Such a theory is necessary to the recent development of the theory where the invariant `counting the number of   such moduli space' are used in very much sophisticated way.  Another outcome of this research is to contribute such development using our theory of Kuranishi structure, CF-perturbation,   and virtual fundamental chain.  It includes the following:  1)  To study the case when the symplectic manifold has an extra group action.  2)  Generalizing the theory to the case when the symplectic manifold is non-compact.  3) We also established a procedure to associate a category to a symplectic manifold in a functorial way.  One important notion of a symplectic manifold is its submanifold called a Lagrangian submanifold.  A Floer studies the solution of non-linear Cauchy-Riemann equation with boundary condition given by   Lagrangian submanifolds and defined Lagrangian Floer homology.  PI discover (in 1993) that we can define a category where object is a Lagrangian submanifold and morphisms   are element of Lagrangian Floer homology. This category is called Fukaya category and plays important role in   symplectic geometry.   A. Weinstein proposed that there is a category whose object is a symplectic manifold and whose morphism is so   called Lagrangian correspondence.  C. Woodwords and K. Wehrheim proposed to define a functor from this Weinstein   category to the category of all (A infinity) category.  This is an enhancement of the process associating to a   symplectic manifold its Fukaya category. They proved it under rather restrictive conditions.  In this research PI completed this construction in complete generality in the case of compact symplectic manifold.  Those three works 1)2)3) are based on the foundation of the theory of pseudo holomorphic curves established by PI and   collaborators.   Using all these development 1)2)3) we expect certain application to gauge theory.  With Aliakbar Daemi PI proved a serious of project to combine and expand 1)2) and (together with 3) apply them   to certain problems on gauge theory.  We have written certain papers to formulate this general story and start working out the whole project.          Last Modified: 11/28/2019       Submitted by: Kenji Fukaya]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
