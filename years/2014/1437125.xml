<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT TITLE&lt;br/&gt;Conference: International Conference on Environmental Catalysis in Asheville, August 24-27, 2014&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This award provides the funds to subsidize the registration and travel costs for US student participation at the 8th International Conference on Environmental Catalysis (ICEC) with preference given to students making oral presentations. The conference will be held in Asheville, North Carolina, on August 24-27, 2014. The PI for the award is Prof. Carsten Sievers of the Georgia Institute for Technology. The principal objective of the conference is to create an environment for fruitful discussion and exchange of ideas among researchers from universities, national laboratories, and industry around the globe on catalytic reactions and processes with environmental implications. &lt;br/&gt;The field of catalysis plays a key role in the nation?s economy and standard of living. Fundamental research in catalysis produces materials (i.e., catalysts) that significantly improve the manufacturing process for many products. Many of these products find application in improving the quality of human life, reducing the adverse impact of human activities on the environment, and securing the nation's energy supply. Research in the field of catalysis also has major economic impact since a majority of the products used by a modern society require catalysts at some point in their manufacture. The scientific topics to be covered by this conference are the control of emissions of environmentally unacceptable compounds; the application of catalysts for the production of alternative, less polluting products; waste minimization; and the production of fuels and chemicals from renewable resources. These topics have significant societal impact because they directly affect the quality of life. Students who are educated by performing research in these areas will be uniquely qualified to be leaders in the technical areas required for a viable ?green economy?. This meeting will provide U.S. researchers, student and expert, exposure to developments at the cutting edge of catalysis research and a chance to publicize their research internationally to leaders in environmental catalysis. &lt;br/&gt;The 8th ICEC will cover all aspects of environmental catalysis, both heterogeneous and homogeneous. This meeting will provide U.S. researchers, student and expert, exposure to developments at the cutting edge of catalysis research and a chance to publicize their research internationally to leaders in environmental catalysis. Five topical sessions have been arranged: (1) sustainable and clean energy production, (2) emission control, (3) indoor air cleaning, (4) water treatment, (5) green chemistry. The ICEC was last held in the United States in 1998. International exposure is particularly important because environmental catalysis is heavily influenced by researchers from Europe and, increasingly, Asia. In addition, the conference will stimulate international collaborations and expose students and postdoctoral associates to new concepts, experimental techniques, and potential colleagues. The topics chosen for the 8th ICEC have significant societal impact because they directly affect the quality of life. Students who are educated by performing research in these areas will be uniquely positioned to be leaders in a new ?green economy?. The technological impact of support for this conference stems from the key role of catalysis in underpinning the nation?s economy and standard of living. The technical contributions to the 8th ICEC will be disseminated widely. The book of abstracts will be distributed to all participants in print and electronic version, and peer-reviewed articles will be published in a special edition of Catalysis Today.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Project Outcomes Report for "Conference: International Conference on Environmental Catalysis in Asheville, August 24-27, 2014" Award Number: 1437125      The International Conference on Environmental Catalysis (ICEC) was focused on one of the most important and thriving research areas within the field of heterogeneous catalysis. It was held at the Grove Park Inn in Asheville, NC on August 24-27, 2014.          Intellectual Merit:     The main goal of the ICEC was to create an environment for fruitful discussions and exchange of ideas on catalytic reactions and processes with environmental implications. This included topics like the control of emissions of environmentally unacceptable compounds, the application of catalysts for the production of alternative, less polluting products, waste minimization, and the production of fuels and chemicals from renewable resources. These research topics have enormous societal impact because they directly affect the quality of life. Students who are educated performing research in these areas will be uniquely positioned to be leader of a new "green economy". At the ICEC, students were able to engage in discussions with established researchers from universities, national laboratories and industry from all over the world. Thus, the conference provided a unique environment for learning and intellectual exchange.         Broader Impact:    The funds from the present conference grant were used to support the registration and lodging costs of 11 students from U.S. universities. As a scientific meeting, the ICEC had an implicit educational mission. The 8th ICEC was the first meeting of this series in North America since 1998. Therefore, this meeting provided American researchers with a unique opportunity to be exposed to the latest developments in the cutting edge area of environmental catalysis. In particular, student researchers benefited from the chance to present their research to global leaders in this subfield of catalysis. This is particularly important because environmental catalysis is dominated by researchers from Europe and, increasingly, Asia. There were a total of 408 attendees representing 44 countries, and there were 149 oral presentations, including 3 plenary lectures and 10 keynote presentations, and 209 poster presentations, including 60 that were discussed during an oral-poster session.
