<AbstractNarration>Magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy/imaging has become one of the most successful analytical techniques for a diverse array of applications in chemistry, physics, biology, materials, and medicine. In this project funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Yung-Ya Lin will establish new international collaboration between UCLA and National Taiwan University (NTU) to develop innovative approaches to significantly enhance the sensitivity and contrast in MR spectroscopy and imaging,  two major challenges in modern MR. This is particularly important for biomolecular MR where the atoms in the molecules of interest are only weakly magnetic, or when the molecules are present only at low concentrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From recent research funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Lin and his coworkers have discovered and investigated nonlinear/chaotic dynamics in solution MR. The well-known "butterfly effect" or "avalanching effect" exhibited by nonlinear/chaotic systems, i.e., extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, will be developed into powerful new approaches for sensitivity/contrast enhancement for MR spectroscopy and imaging. The proposed research utilizes cutting edge techniques from both the UCLA group and the NTU group to achieve significant MR sensitivity/contrast enhancement, thereby extending its impacts to biomedicine, biochemistry, and biophysics. Its intellectual merits are: (i) Utilizing emerging aspects of nonlinear/chaotic spin dynamics for the first time to alleviate the fundamental limitation in MR sensitivity/contrast; (ii) Engineering a general sensitivity/contrast enhancement mechanism based on indirect detection and spin amplification at high fields; and (iii) Controlling the nonlinear spin dynamics and optimizing the amplification gains by an electronic feedback control device. This collaboration will be highly complementary and beneficial to both teams and is only possible through this unique combination of team members and resources. Its broader impacts are (i) Making use of unique resources and complementary capabilities and demonstrating a high level of synergy through the formation of new international collaborations; (ii) Constructing a Nonlinear MR Simulator and web-based interactive course for research, mentorship, teaching, and outreach to enable cross-fertilization between research and education.</AbstractNarration>

This is particularly important in biomolecular NMR or MRI where insensitive and/or dilute spins are detected/imaged.     The NTU Chemistry group started with the "hardware" development: (i) Home-built an active-feedback electronic device, and (ii) Integrated this device into the 800MHz high-field NMR with imaging capacity, while the UCLA Chemistry group started with the "software" development: (i) Characterized the gains in signal-to-noise ratio for MR spectroscopy and contrast-to-noise ratio for MR imaging of the spin amplifier, and (ii) Formulated a theoretical description of the spin amplification process by quantum mechanics and classical mechanics.

In research, we have achieved the following two research milestones: (i) Demonstrated &gt; 10x NMR sensitivity enhancement in model proteins; (ii) Demonstrated &gt; 5x contrast enhancement in MR molecular imaging for early pancreatic cancer detection. The significance of the research results is two-fold: (i) Set forth a general sensitivity/contrast enhancement mechanism by intrinsic nonlinear spin dynamics at high fields.

This feature is important for flexibly generating and optimizing the input signal and for integrating the "active-feedback field" into the MR pulse sequences.     In education and outreach, we have constructed a computer package, termed "Nonlinear MR Simulator", to make available publicly existing and new MR computer simulation programs generated from the research activities that specifically target high-field, high-polarization, nonlinear MR. It provided a computation platform for research in high-field nonlinear MR, promoted group members? and students? understanding of high-field nonlinear spin dynamics through virtual experiments, and served as an educational tool for the MR community and general public in both USA and Taiwan.

Its broader impacts are: (i) Made use of unique resources (e.g., an 800MHz NMR at NTU that provided sufficient machine time and was hardware-modified and discovery of NMR spin chaos at UCLA) and complementary capabilities (e.g., home-built an 800MHz active feedback electronic device at NTU and simulated complicated nonlinear spin dynamics at UCLA) and demonstrated a high level of synergy through the formation of new international collaborations; (ii) Constructed "Nonlinear MR Simulator" &ndash; a high-field nonlinear MR simulator for research, mentorship, teaching, and outreach to enable cross-fertilization between research and education.
