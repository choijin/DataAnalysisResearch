<AbstractNarration>The proposed work involves developing an innovative human-technology interface (HTI) system, which allows users to operate and interact with electronic devices solely with expressions and thoughts. The proposed HTI system, with a mobile app as the user interface, will utilize self-learning algorithms along with low-cost commercially-off-the-shelf (COTS) brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has always been a need for a more natural and faster human-technology interaction (HTI) experience that goes beyond the traditional button and the latest touch-technology. Outcomes of the proposed research will revolutionize HTI and will provide an effective paradigm that can be applied to a broad range of areas such as mobile devices, home automation systems, audio video systems, video game consoles and auto electronics. Outcomes will be strongly leveraged to foster collaborative networks with multidisciplinary teams of investigators in academia and industry to establish a strong extramurally funded research program to explore other innovative HTI concepts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Approximately 50 million Americans are affected each year with neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), and progressive bulbar palsy (PBP). They face tremendous barriers that make electronic communication a challenge needing assistance.   An innovative low-cost human-technology interface (HTI) device, that enables persons suffering from neurodegenerative diseases to effortlessly access the internet and communicate via e-mail, text, chat, Skype, using facial expressions and head movements, was designed and tested. The project focused on persons with ALS (PALS); PALS face a tremendous communication challenge during the course of their illness.  The project team partnered with the ALS Society of Orange County chapter to facilitate prototype testing.  The testing revealed that the device is user friendly requiring minimal training to operate (less than 5 mins), cost-effective (approx. $150),  and has the potential to provide marked communication independence for PALS.  Outcomes of the proposed research has the potential to revolutionize the field of HTI and can provide an effective paradigm that can be applied to a broad range of areas such as mobile devices, home automation systems, audio video systems, video game consoles and auto electronics.  The project has generated broad educational and research opportunities at California State University, Fullerton through the graduate and undergraduate research program.  Outcomes are being disseminated to academic and industrial communities through international conferences, and on-campus events.
