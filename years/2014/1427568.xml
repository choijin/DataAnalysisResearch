<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Mohamed Abdalla from Tuskegee University and colleague Albert Russell will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students at this historically black college (HBCU).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will enhance research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) synthesis and characterization of biologically active compounds; (b) characterization of botanical extracts from local plants; (c) studies nanoparticle catalyzed cellulose deconstruction for the production of ethanol; (d) determination of protein structure; and (e) development of coatings from natural sources for the prevention of steel corrosion and fouling.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The proposal, MRI: Acquisition of a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer for the Improvement of Undergraduate and Graduate Research Capabilities was funded in 2014.  The proposal was interdisciplinary.  We have trained eight graduate students on the 400 MHz NMR over the two years period of the grant.  Of those students trained, two theses are completed, three more are in progress and three students have been accepted into Ph.D. programs.  We anticipate two publications from the theses that have been completed.  We have also trained undergraduate students enrolled in sophomore organic chemistry labs and required undergraduate research courses.  Graduate research students are now used to train other undergraduate students.  To this end, we have been successful in achieving several of our broader impacts.  The 400 MHz has enhanced our research capabilities and has opened doors to multiple partnerships with other universities.  We currently have used the instrument to collaborate with the University of Wisconsin, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Georgia State University and Iowa State University over the three-year period of the award.  We have hosted a Medicinal Plants Workshop every year through a collaboration with Georgia State University as a supplement to the Chemistry Curriculum that is part of the NSF sponsored Chemistry Collaborations, Workshops, and Community of Scholars (cCWCS) program. We also plan to host the third workshop in NMR metabolomics.We have also bolstered our instrumentation capabilities which ACS requires for Tuskegee to be sanctioned to grant ACS certified degrees.
