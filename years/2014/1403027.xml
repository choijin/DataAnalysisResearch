<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Mark Berg of the University of South Carolina is developing and applying new laser based methods for measuring very fast chemical reactions in complex materials such as polymers and ionic liquids.  Traditional methods use a laser pulse to perturb a chemical system once and then follow the reaction over a single time period.  The new methods developed in this project will use multiple perturbations separated by carefully chosen time intervals.  This approach should allow for the observation of specific types of molecules or reactions within a complex mixture, for example the collisions of light-excited molecules in photoactive materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will expand the range of processes and time scales where these methods can be applied and thereby allow their application to a wider range of problems.  Specific targets include: How does a homogeneous, small-molecule solvent become heterogeneous as the molecule polymerizes?  Do different molecule-sized sites occur in an ionic liquid, and do these sites alter the progress of reactions that use ionic liquids as the solvent?  What is the range of travel for an optical excitation in a conjugated polymer, and how do the resulting collisions quench captured energy?  Professor Berg is active in a university-wide initiative to increase applications to graduate school by underrepresented groups.  He is also participating in an NSF-funded IGERT program aimed at developing interdisciplinary training programs at the University of South Carolina.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Proper analysis of the random motion of individual molecules should give complete information on the dynamics of molecular processes.  In complex materials, standard analysis of these fluctuations often yields a distribution of rates, but little information on why more than one rate exists.  This project developed advanced statistical methods&mdash;multidimensional correlation functions&mdash;that provide information on whether transient heterogeneity in the material is the cause and on the rate of evolution of that heterogeneity.  These new methods are applicable to both computer simulations and single-molecule experiments and are useful for a broad range of materials that have complex kinetics: polymers, biomolecules, viscous liquids, nanoparticles and so on.  Three major advances were made to the general theory of multidimensional correlation functions: (1) A scheme for extracting kinetic parameters without assuming a shape for the decays was developed.  (2) Kinetic spectra were defined that visualize complex, multidimensional results.  (3) The first detailed theory of 3D correlation functions was developed, and they were shown to measure the dynamics of rate exchange in heterogeneous samples.  The practicality and usefulness of multidimensional methods was demonstrated in two systems that had been previously analyzed by conventional methods: single-molecule experiments on a polymer melt and computer simulations of an ionic liquid.  In the polymer, it was known that molecular rotation develops a broad range of rates near the temperature where the melt becomes a glassy solid.  Existing methods applied to single-molecule measurements failed to establish the cause of this distribution of rates.  Two-dimensional analysis of the same data clearly showed that it comes from heterogeneity in the local viscosity of the liquid and that the heterogeneity is long-lived.  In the ionic liquid, electric-field dynamics were known to spread over four orders-of-magnitude in time through a standard analysis of simulation data.  Two- and three-dimensional analysis of the same data showed that a short-lived heterogeneity in the environment is responsible.  However, in this case, the heterogeneity is due to different motions dominating the dynamics at different points in the liquid.  This project promoted the inclusions  of underrepresented groups through activities with the National GEM (Graduate Education for Minorities) Consortium.  The PI served as a reviewer for the GEM fellowship program.  In addition, personalized emails were sent to all fellowship applicants in chemistry, encouraging and reminding them to complete their applications to graduate school.  Interdisciplinary training was supported by bringing three undergraduate students with majors outside Chemistry into this project over a summer.  In one case, this summer project expanded into a year-long, internally funded research project headed by an undergraduate student.  The PI also served on the organizing committee for the Southeast Undergraduate Research Conference (SURC 2017), which gives undergraduates in both large and small colleges and universities a forum to present and discuss their research.
