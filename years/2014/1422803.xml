<AbstractNarration>Weidhaas&lt;br/&gt;1422803&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An accidental spill of a currently unknown quantity (estimated between 3,000 and 7,500 gallons) of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol from a coal preparation plant in Charleston, WV has compromised the drinking water supply for up to 300,000 water users in Charleston and nearby counties. This tragedy has caused the ban of use of potable water and has resulted in closure in several establishments including schools and business. President Obama issued a federal disaster declaration for the state on Friday, January 10, 2014 to provide federal aid for the state. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will:&lt;br/&gt;1. Assess the short- and long-term chemical fate of 4-methylcyclonehexane methanol in the drinking water and riverine systems through sampling efforts,&lt;br/&gt;2. Evaluate potential risks of the spill to public health and the environment, and&lt;br/&gt;3. Develop quick remediation measures and strategies for more resilient water treatment and&lt;br/&gt;distribution operations in future disasters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Environmental disasters resulting from accidents happen and will continue to happen.  In the case of the spill of the coal conditioning chemical it happened to affect about 15 % of the population of West Virginia.  This project will try to determine what might be done in the future to prevent such catastrophes and how can we build more resilience, in water treatment plants for the future.</AbstractNarration>
