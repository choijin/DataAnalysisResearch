<AbstractNarration>In safety-critical embedded systems, functionalities with different criticalities are often supported upon shared hardware platforms, to enable size, weight, and power (SWaP) reductions.  For example, in an automotive system, highly critical vehicle-control functions and less critical driver-alert functions might be hosted on the same hardware platform.  While such platform integration may be cost-effective, care must be taken to isolate failures of less-critical components so that more-critical components are not affected. This project is directed at developing techniques for ensuring such isolation, particularly on hardware platforms that utilize multicore processors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific goals in this project include devising new models for representing mixed-criticality systems, new metrics for quantifying the effectiveness of techniques for designing such systems (particularly from a SWaP perspective), and new methods for performing resource allocation and scheduling in integrated architectures that support mixed-criticality systems.  The overall objective is to use these new models, metrics, and methods, to obtain new tools, techniques, and methodologies for deriving mixed-criticality system designs that are both correct by construction and implementable in a resource-efficient manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators in this project collaborate extensively with partners in the avionics and automotive industries. Continued collaborations are expected to enable the results of this project to push research on mixed-criticality systems forward to address national industrial needs.  This project is also expected to produce new open-source software and tools, new course content, and public outreach through participation in UNC's demo program (which is aimed at K-12 students, college students, and school teachers) and lectures and seminars by the investigators at national and international forums.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The research objective of this project is to develop an integrated HVP (human vision perception) retaining OLED (organic light emitting diode) power management scheme with innovation at the hardware, system, and application levels. The project has obtained two main outcomes. First, a system called Scope is developed that can alter the rendering resolution and framerate on a smartphone to scale display rendering workload in response to real time changes in user-phone distance. A new method is demonstrated to measure the user-phone distance in real-time which is able to minimize front-facing camera sampling through the use of sensor fusion techniques. The Scope is able to reduce smartphone power consumption up to 58% while retaining visual quality in most cases. Second, an adaptive hybrid approach, MobiCore, is developed for power-efficient CPU management on Android devices. This approach can optimize the use of Dynamic and Frequency Voltage Scaling (DVFS) and the Dynamic Core Scaling (DCS) techniques with a sensitive control on CPU bandwidth. The measurements on the real systems prove that MobiCore can achieve substantial CPU power reduction compared to state-of-the-art architectures. Specifically, experiments show that enabling the simultaneous co-optimization of the number of CPU cores and their working frequencies together with a sensitive control on the allocated CPU bandwidth offers up to 11.7% CPU power reduction on Android devices. In summary, the Scope work achieves an excellent back-end computing optimization technology, which can be well applied in the OLED based wearable and mobile display system, and the MobiCore provides a comprehensive processor level low-power system analysis and optimization solution that can be universally applied to OLED based devices for high computing performance.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/15/2018<br>      Modified by: Zhi-Hong&nbsp;Mao</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1422057/1422057_10324741_1515997741925_Picture_PowerMeasurement--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1422057/1422057_10324741_1515997741925_Picture_PowerMeasurement--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Experimental mesurement"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1422057/1422057_10324741_1515997741925_Picture_PowerMeasurement--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Experimental mesurement"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Experimental power measurement for smartphones.
