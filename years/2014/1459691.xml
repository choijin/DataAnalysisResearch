<AbstractNarration>Part 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will study the use of pressure gauges for geodetic observations to monitor vertical deformation in the offshore regions of the Cascadia subduction zone. The work could contribute to our understanding of slow-slip seismic events and their potential for the generation of large tsunamis.  The project will use the Cascadia Initiative?s absolute pressure gauges (APG) data set to develop methods for removing oceanographic noise from the observations to determine what types and time scales can be detected using pressure gauges. Additionally, the project will search for possible vertical deformation that may have occurred during the Cascadia Initiative deployment. The APG records have the potential to detect slow slip events in the accretionary prism, which could change or enhance the understanding of the displacement behavior of these faults and of deformation in the overlying accretionary prism.  The results could be applicable to the future data acquired in Cascadia region and elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are provided to study the large Cascadia Initiative (CI) absolute pressure gauge (APG) data set that will allow the use of pressure gauges for geodetic observations to monitor deformation in the offshore regions of the Cascadia subduction zone. The utility of APG data for geodetic observations is limited by high noise levels from oceanographic signals and by the inherent drift in the sensors. The proposed research will use this large data set first to develop methods of removing oceanographic noise from these observations so as to determine what types and time scales of vertical deformation can be detected using pressure gauges. The second component of the research will be to search for possible vertical deformation that may have occurred during the CI deployment. The discovery of seismic slow slip events or similar events beneath the seafloor will likely change or enhance our understanding of the displacement behavior of these faults and of deformation in the overlying accretionary prism. This results will be applicable not only to the data acquired in Cascadia, but also  to observations from future ocean bottom seismometer deployments with that are equipped with APGs, which also includes a GeoPRISMS focus site, the Hikurangi (New Zealand) subduction margin.</AbstractNarration>

Four years of seafloor pressure data from 30 ocean bottom seismometers deployed at sites as part of the Cascadia Initiative (CI) ocean bottom seismometer experiment were analyzed. The instruments were deployed for roughly 10 month intervals at sites ranging from near the shore in water as shallow as 56m to off the shelf in 3300m or more. The focus of the CI project was the Cascadia subduction zone, a large megathrust fault that represents a very significant seismic and tsunami risk to the Pacific Northwest.&nbsp; A large earthquake exceeding magnitude 9, occurred in 1700 and produced a large tsunami. For the CI project, instrument deployments extended from near northern Washington state to the Mendocino escarpment at the south end of the Cascadia subduction zone offshore California. The questions addressed in this project were 1) how well can oceanographic signals (essentially &ldquo;noise&rdquo;) be removed and 2) can any significant tectonic events be seen in the data? The Cascadia subduction zone is thought to be essentially locked such that no motion is occurring anywhere in the zone, but the possibility remained that some motion was occurring near the trench, far offshore, outside the region that could be usefully monitored using instruments on land. The behavior of megathrust faults offshore is critical to understanding the tsunami risk. CI seafloor pressure data was used to design a deployment of OBSs with APGs offshore of Northern New Zealand. The results from that project demonstrated the value of offshore pressure measurements: in 2015 a &ldquo;slow slip&rdquo; earthquake was observed and measured near the trench offshore of Northern New Zealand. This slow slip event (that occurred over 2 weeks period and thus not seismically detected) had relieved much of the stress across the Hikurangi megathrust in patches near the trench, but that stress was not released in two patches that are associated with two earthquakes in 1947 that caused damaging tsunamis.&nbsp; CI initiative pressure data were used to develop the methods used to remove the large signals associated with the tides and mesoscale eddies in the NZ data and thus reveal the few cm changes in depth associated withe slow slip event. The four years of the CI data have now been analyzed to examine the scales of mesoscale eddies and test other methods of removing these signals. For the most part, the research confirmed the results from the NZ project, confirming the need for reference sites and also the limitations of these methods for removing this noise. The results clearly indicate that the next step to optimize the use of seafloor pressure gauges for geodetic observations (uplift) will be to better integrate in oceanographic observations.
