<AbstractNarration>The world population is projected to increase to over 9 billion people by 2050, necessitating a 70% increase in the food supply. Such a goal can only be accomplished by increasing the yields of the major crop plants, especially the cereals, whose grains meet substantial nutritional needs in the form of protein and starch for a significant portion of the world's population. Results from this research will provide new insights and innovative strategies to improve crop yields by manipulating the enzymes (proteins that facilitate chemical reactions) involved in the early steps of the production of the proteins and starch that are stored in rice grains. In addition, this project will provide state-of-the-art research training in molecular, cellular and genetic methods, especially large-scale studies of proteins (proteomics) and genes (genomics) for postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students, including students from a partnering minority-serving institution, California State University at Los Angeles. Products of this research will be integrated into a new website on molecular kinesis (how for example RNA and proteins move within plant cells to the sites where they function) an important topic that is poorly described in modern plant biology textbooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although considerable information has been generated over the years on how plant genes are controlled at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, very little is known about how RNAs are transported and localized to specific sub-compartments of the plant cell where they are translated, stored, processed or turned-over. This research will focus on the transport and localization of RNAs in developing rice endosperm with the aim of providing a comprehensive picture of the RNA binding proteins (RBPs) involved, how they are organized into multi-RBP complexes, and how RBPs that may be common factors of distinct RNA transport pathways may, nevertheless, provide the directions for targeting RNAs to particular individual pathways. This project will use genome-wide approaches to identify the role of specific RBPs in the transport and localization of RNAs to the cortical endoplasmic reticulum and their subsequent roles in translation, stability and/or RNA processing. Specific objectives will be to:  (1) categorize cytoplasmic-localized, cytoskeletal-associated RBPs into multi-protein complexes; (2) determine the composition of RNAs bound by these multi-protein complexes and identify the associated cis-sequences; and (3) determine the role of modular domains of specific RBPs that may be responsible for specifying a particular RNA transport pathway by the analysis of genetic mutations.  This information will provide an unprecedented view of the fate of RNAs and their location in the plant cell and will thereby fill a major gap in our understanding of steps in gene expression beyond transcription.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The transport of mRNAs to specific intracellular sites and their subsequent translation is an efficient process in concentrating proteins at their site of synthesis.  Despite the universal use of this mechanism in multicellular and single-cell organisms, there are few examples in plant cells with the most extensively studied being the localization of storage protein mRNAs in developing rice grains.  We had earlier demonstrated that the rice storage protein mRNAs and mRNAs, in general, are transported from the nucleus to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes that are distributed to the cortical (peripheral) region of the cell.  Three inter-related transport pathways are present; a prolamine RNA pathway to the protein body-ER, a glutelin RNA pathway to the cisternal-ER, and a default pathway to the cisternal ER.  The targeting of prolamine and glutelin mRNAs to these ER subdomains requires small segments of the mRNA sequences (zipcodes), which are recognized by specific RNA binding proteins (RBPs), which are organized as multi-protein complexes.   We had earlier identified the RBPs that recognize the prolamine zipcode sequences.  With this grant support, we identified the RBPs that interact with the glutelin zipcode sequences as well as additional RBPs needed for the basal processes of RNA transport and localization.  Collectively, over 35 RBPs were identified, many capable of interacting with each other to form a large RBP interactome network. Based on the existence of distinct multi-protein complexes sharing common RBPs, we hypothesize that different combinations of RBPs are arranged in higher-order multi-protein complexes that mediate post-transcriptional regulation.  Earlier genetic studies revealed that Rab5, a membrane trafficking GTPase protein, was essential for glutelin mRNA localization.  Research studies supported by this grant showed that Rab5 was part of the larger protein quartet, a multiprotein complex containing two glutelin zipcode binding RBPs and NSF in addition to Rab5.  The NSF protein is a hexameric ATPase, which disassembles the SNARE protein complex after fusion between the moving membrane vesicle and target membrane.  This quartet of proteins transports glutelin mRNAs to the cisternal-ER by co-opting membrane vesicular trafficking processes involving Rab5 and NSF.  The involvement of membrane vesicular trafficking in RNA localization is supported by the displacement of mRNAs to the extracellular space in rice lines defective for Rab5 or the Rab5 - guanine nucleotide exchange factor.  Interestingly, the mRNAs that are secreted are not a random collection but code for proteins that share similar function or intracellular location.   Hence, mRNAs that are related by the function of their proteins may be co-transported together to specific destinations in the cell.
