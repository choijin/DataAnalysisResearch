<AbstractNarration>This collaborative research project will study the effects of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) skills and training gained from high school through college on the career-long learning prospects of diverse groups of individuals and their adaptation to changing workplace experiences. Project investigators at the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and the University of Wisconsin-Madison will also contribute to the important research on STEM broadening participation issues, specifically the intersection of race, ethnicity, gender and disability with STEM education, STEM workforce development and STEM career success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will conduct interviews with individuals who originally participated in a U.S. Department of Education survey called the High School and Beyond (HS&amp;B) study.  The students were high school seniors when the data was initially collected in 1980.  Some of these students also provided additional survey data in 1982, 1984 and 1986.  Beginning with this longitudinal survey data, the researchers will study the STEM training that students acquired and the STEM competencies they developed in school.  Drawing on specific coursework, test scores, grades, degree attainment, and field of degree, the investigators will analyze how these competencies contribute to workforce success and flexibility in mid-life work for persons with diverse, intersecting attributes defined by race, ethnicity, gender and disability.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new data set will be made available to the public and to researchers through the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics. The project will use a large population sample, combining data from the sophomore and senior cohorts of the HS&amp;B study, in order to conduct theoretically grounded analytic modeling about the relationships between STEM training, workforce outcomes and diversity attributes.  The main theoretical focus of the work is examining the relative contributions of education as credentials (signaling theory) versus the relative contributions of what is learned in school and non-school settings (human capital theory).</AbstractNarration>

We found that certain aspects of the high school experience?especially the math and science courses that students took-- affect students throughout their life course and into midlife. Our midlife outcomes range from educational achievement (both postsecondary and later life training), physical and mental health, disability status, body weight, labor market outcomes (occupations, including STEM occupations, skills demanded in occupations, employment/unemployment), financial stability, and even civic engagement. We have modeled these outcomes later in life with a rich set of indicators of educational opportunity and coursetaking (particularly mathematics, science, and computer programming coursetaking), educational stratification, school effects, as well as non-cognitive skills.   Some of the more notable outcomes/findings include: - Individuals? math-related skills and locus of control at the end of high school predict their employment status at midlife. - College preparatory math courses serve as a safety net for women, protecting them from bad occupations later in life. - Adolescent men who expected occupations that declined in labor market share during early adulthood are at increased risk of suicide or substance abuse mortality by midlife. - Patterns of educational stratification at midlife are becoming more pronounced in some ways, as women pull further away from men in their educational attainments and parental education and high school academic achievement continue to shape educational trajectories. However, African Americans gain on whites during midlife through continued formal (largely academic) training and slightly greater conditional probabilities of graduate or professional degree attainment. - Low educational expectation during adolescence, mismatched expectations, are harmful to occupational attainment in midlife net of academic performance and degree attainment. - Women with STEM preparation have wages that are on par with men who do not have comparable preparation. Women without STEM preparation tend to be relegated to lower wage occupations and earn less in their jobs. STEM preparation cannot close the gender wage gap but is essential for women to secure an occupation with a good wage. - Adolescent men who expected occupations that declined in labor market share during early adulthood are at increased risk of death by suicide or substance abuse in adulthood. - Advanced courses in high school, especially in math, place adolescents on more politically engaged pathways into adulthood and positively predict midlife voting. - Adolescence is a critical period for individual empowerment, and experiences in schools contribute to whether individuals will exercise their right to vote across their lives.
