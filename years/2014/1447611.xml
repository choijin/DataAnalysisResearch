<AbstractNarration>Zircon (ZrSiO4) is arguably the single most powerful mineral for elucidating the evolution of the continental crust. The proposal will take advantage of the ability of zircon to record the temperature history of magma generated in the crust. We will specifically target granites produced in the period of earth history at approximately 1.05 billion years ago (the Grenville orogenic event).  Our prior research demonstrated that this is a unique episode for generation of large volumes of exceptionally hot (900-1100 oC) granitic magma.  The fingerprint of these hot granites includes high zirconium contents and conspicuously high modal abundance of zircon that does not contain xenocrysts of prior zircon (i.e., the zircon is not recycled from other crustal rocks and represents a primary chemical/mineralogic feature of the granites).  Preliminary chemical analysis of the zircon in the hot granites demonstrates that the zircon also has high titanium contents, which prove high zircon crystallization temperatures. Computer modeling of the crystallization history of the high zirconium granites also demonstrates that zircon begins crystallization at ~1000 oC. The important insight from these preliminary results regarding the evolution of the Earth?s crust is that there must be unique lithospheric conditions in order to generate such hot granites. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will target for study a much larger suite of granites from the Grenville Blue Ridge Province in eastern North America (Shenandoah massif, Virginia) where we have identified a terrane-wide occurrence of high zirconium granites. The purpose of the research is to more thoroughly elucidate the temperature history of the Grenville granite suite and examine in detail the chemical and textural relationship of zircon to the bulk rock chemistry and modal mineralogy, in order to more precisely ascertain the conditions at which the zircon crystallized. We will conduct whole rock geochemical analysis, crystallization modeling using the program rhyoliteMELTS, cathodolomuninescence imaging of individual zircon grains to explore for potential xenocrysts, and ion microprobe analysis of trace elements and isotopes in zircon. The research will be conducted by graduate and undergraduate students from the collaborating institutions, providing critical training for future geoscientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of our project was to determine what caused North American granitic magmas, that are approximately 1 billion years old, to have considerably higher concentrations of the element zirconium (Zr) compared to most average granite bodies.  One possibility that had been suggested was that the granites contained an unusually large amount of the mineral zircon, not from direct crystallization from the magma but ‘inherited’ from the source region of the magma.  We tested this hypothesis be determining the age of a statistically significant number of zircon crystals in several high zirconium granites using the uranium-lead radiometric geochronological clock.  Several hundred analyses were performed per sample using a rapid analysis method.  If a high proportion of the zircon crystals were inherited from the magma’s source they would be older than the native grains that had crystallized directly from the magma. Our results showed that only a small proportion of the zircon crystals were of the inherited type and thus this could not be the explanation for the extremely high Zr concentrations in the granites.  A second hypothesis we tested was the possibility that extreme amounts of sedimentary material were incorporated into the magmas, thus providing a zircon-rich source, which would lead to high Zr concentrations in the granites as zircon is the primary source of Zr.  If this hypothesis was valid then there would be a record of such sediment involvement based on the oxygen isotopic composition of the zircon (a reflection of the oxygen isotopic composition of the magma).  Magmas that incorporate significant amounts of sediment have unusually high ratios of 18O to 16O.  We tested this hypothesis using an in situ method of determining the ratio of 18O/16O in individual zircon crystals from several high Zr granites as well as a control group of low to moderate Zr granites.  The oxygen isotope ratios indicate that only a minimal amount of sedimentary material could have been involved in the genesis of the magma.  Our third major test was to see if unusually high magmatic temperatures could explain the high Zr abundance &ndash; hotter magmas allow for more Zr to dissolve into the magma. To estimate the temperatures of the magmas we measured the amount of the element titanium (Ti) in the zircon crystals. As it has been shown that the hotter the magma the higher amount of Ti will be incorporated in the zircon crystal structure.  Most zircon crystals have a Ti concentration of only a few parts per million (which translate to temperatures of roughly 700 &ndash; 750 degrees Celsius).  For our Zr rich granites we found that many of the zircon crystals contain four to five times as much Ti as most granites which translates to magmatic temperatures close to 1,000 degrees.  Thus we have demonstrated that these granites are not only some of the most Zr rich large granite bodies in the world but were also some of hottest granitic magmatic bodies in the world.  The research was also extremely beneficial to expand the scientific literacy of students as it formed part of the basis for the research projects of two Masters degree students and two PhD candidates.
