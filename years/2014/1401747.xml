<AbstractNarration>Many problems in number theory (for instance, understanding the number and geometry of integer solutions to polynomial equations) can be approached by studying dynamics of certain flows on symmetric spaces. On the other hand, classical tools from analytic number theory can be adapted and used to better understand the geometry and dynamics of these spaces. This project investigates a number of problems where spectral theory and tools from analytic number theory are used to study geometry and dynamics of certain group actions on hyperbolic manifolds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamics on hyperbolic manifolds come up in many areas of mathematics: In number theory they are central in the theory of automorphic forms; in low dimensional topology they are instrumental in the proof of the geometrization theorem; in dynamics the geodesic flow on hyperbolic manifolds is a classic example of hyperbolic (Anosov) dynamical systems; in mathematical physics the spectrum of hyperbolic manifolds can be viewed as an example of quantized chaotic systems. This project investigates a number of problems where spectral theory and tools from analytic number theory are used to study geometry and dynamics of certain group actions on hyperbolic manifolds, with and without arithmetic structure. Specifically, the research studies questions regarding the length spectrum of closed geodesics to understand how much of the geometry of a hyperbolic manifold can be obtained from information on the lengths of its closed geodesics; questions on the rate of escape to infinity of one parameter flows on hyperbolic spaces (originating from problems in Diophantine approximations); and questions on the strong spectral gap property on locally symmetric spaces, which is crucial to many applications to hyperbolic dynamics and number theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was composed of a number of problems involving spectral theory and dynamics on hyperbolic manifolds, with an emphasis on problems originating from number theory. Specifically, the P.I. studied questions regarding the relation between the length spectrum and other geometric invariants of hyperbolic manifolds; problems regarding the equidistribution of cuspidal geodesic on hyperbolic surfaces; shrinking target problems for flows on hyperbolic manifolds; and the Eucledian lattice point counting problem. Results from this project already found applications in research projects in various mathematical disciplines. We will now describe in more detail some of the main outcomes originating from this research project.  Length spectrum of hyperbolic manifolds: The length spectrum of a hyperbolic manifolds is the set of lengths of closed geodesics listed with multiplicities. The problem of counting the number of closed geodesics of a given length has a rich history and it is related to many questions in number theory, ergodic theory, geometry, and combinatorics. The question the P.I.  studied here is how much information on the length spectrum of a hyperbolic manifold is needed in order to determine it completely. The P.I. already had results on this question for compact hyperbolic manifolds, and one of the results of this project was obtaining similar results for non compact manifolds of finite volume, determining in particular, that in dimensions 2 and 3 even partial information on the length spectrum is enough to determine the volume.  Equidistribution of translates of cuspidal geodesics: Understanding the distribution of translates of closed subgroup orbits on a homogeneous spaces has many interesting applications. For example, it can be used to study integer solutions to various algebraic equations. When the orbits are compact (or of finite measure) there are classical results showing that their translates become equidistributed with an effective rate, but when the orbits have infinite-volume much less is known. One of the outcomes of this research is a solution for this problem for the special case when the space is a non-compact hyperbolic manifold. This result led to the resolution of the problem of counting integer points on affine quadrics with effective estimates for the remainder.  Shrinking target problems: Another significant result of this project concerns the shrinking target problem for flows on homogenous spaces. The general problem is to determine how fast we can make a sequence of targets shrink, so that a typical orbit will keep hitting the targets indefinitely. Such problems have various applications for the theory of metric Diophantine approximations. There are methods to study such problems in quite great generality for diagonalizable flows having exponential mixing, but these methods do not work for unipotent flows due to the slow mixing rate.

These generalizations produced new interesting results regarding Diophantine approximation of points by lattice orbits, as well as  new effective versions of the Oppenheim conjecture regarding the density of values of generic irrational indefinite quadratic forms.  Remainder in lattice point counting problem: A classical result going back to Gauss, states that the number of lattice points inside a large circle is given by the area of the circle up to a smaller error term bounded by a constant times the radius. A classical open problem, known as the Gauss circle problem, is to obtain the best possible bound for this error (where it is conjectured that one could bound the error by essentially the square root of the radius).
