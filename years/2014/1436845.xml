<AbstractNarration>This project identifies structural and infrastructure engineering (SIE) metrics and explores analytical and simulation methods that quantify these metrics. SIE metrics studied in this research include: reliability, robustness, redundancy, resilience, risk, sustainability, and life-cycle cost. Given that these metrics have different semantic perspectives their quantification has not been explored using computational and algorithmic thinking while this research does so. The research also studies the computational limits for each metric and takes advantage of the opportunities for exact and approximate formulations. Computable metrics inform the practice of designing, building, maintenance, and restoration of SIE systems. In addition, the research involves a diverse pool of students for which computational algorithms will be a mechanism for the design of SIE systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A taxonomy of metrics for SIE applications is explored, while demonstrating via mathematical proofs the membership of these metrics to a computational complexity hierarchy. Proofs are mainly achieved via reducible chains in polynomial time, special subroutines such as oracles, while combinatorial arguments reveal which metrics to pursue using diverse strategies, either exactly or approximately. For instance, the research explores recursive formulations for metrics at the bottom of the hierarchy, and additional proofs are pursued to determine why practical constraints, such as correlations in reliability, break the structure of the problem into exponential time algorithms. The project explores symmetries, periodicities, and other features that support probabilistic algorithms with tolerances and confidence levels that are acceptable for large SIE problem instances.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was motivated by the need to compute performance metrics for modern infrastructure systems in a way that such estimates offer guarantees on their accuracy.  A priori guarantees on infrastructure network performance are desirable for allocation of limited resources and system upkeep decisions.  We achieved this performance quantification goal in three ways: (1) by developing new algorithms that rely on Boolean satisfiability solvers for the principled approximation of network reliability, (2) by developing new algorithms based on tensor algebra to find exact bounds on network performance metrics, and (3) by developing new methods that map our network reliability problems onto quantum circuits for exploitation of quantum information and computing developments.  Our first outcome is the formulation of the network reliability problem as a constrained satisfaction problem, which enabled us to leverage decades of progress in Boolean satisfiability (SAT) research.  This new formulation, dubbed RelNet, uses SAT solvers as oracles, thus computing network performance metrics efficiently while offering error and confidence guarantees ahead of time.  This is consistent with a national vision on measurement science principles in engineering.  Our second outcome is the novel tensor network formulation for SAT problems and their counting instances.  Tensors are uniquely suited to handle multi-dimensional systems with multiple states, and are capable of synthesizing information efficiently via tensor network contractions.  We leverage here significant advances in linear algebra and discrete algorithms.  We demonstrate our developments by outperforming several off-the-shelf SAT counters, including those that have won competitions at satisfiability conferences.  Finally, our third outcome opens the door to quantifying the performance of engineered systems via quantum algorithms, which can either be simulated or implemented directly onto quantum hardware.  The enabling elements for this development are the SAT formulation of our network problems, along with their tensor network representations.  These two developments combined reveal the quantum circuits necessary for quantum computation of engineered network properties in practice.
