<AbstractNarration>Many autonomous systems today, such as personal or service robots, are designed primarily to perform tasks independently and in isolation. Integrating these robots with human partners can often result in poor performance, as the robot does not know how to interpret human interaction, and cannot merge information from this  interaction with a model that guarantees robot performance.  This research brings together key elements that are just now reaching a sufficient level of maturity for integration: firstly, natural language processing and probabilistic modeling to capture human input, and secondly probabilistic synthesis and verification of the combined human-robot systems to ensure correct performance. The outcome will be theory and software to enable correct, effective and natural interactions between robots and humans to be realized. This research will impact most future autonomous systems which require interactions with humans, including service, personal and planetary robots. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to develop models and algorithms for synthesizing and verifying an integrated human-plus-robot system based on natural language interaction. Algorithms are being developed for probabilistic modeling and inference of natural language, including the grounding of the constituents of the language into the physical world and the human's expectations. These models will enable the development of a distribution over specifications for control synthesis, which will in turn enable the development and verification of correct-by-construction controllers to a particular level of probability. The out years will consider interactive human-robot dialogue to resolve conflicts, and "open world" scenarios to enable on-line learning of new models over time. It is expected that this research will enable high reliability and performance in many autonomous systems because of the inherent interaction with humans.  Outcomes include open source data and software; community workshops; and undergraduate and graduate student education in the unique area of language, modeling and verification for robotics.</AbstractNarration>

Thus, the number of statements to match the belief is also inferred at run time.

Automatic inference of pre-conditions: The project developed an algorithm for learning obvious pre-conditions for synthesis, which are rules governing when a task can be synthesized (or not). For example, an object cannot be placed in a bin if the bin is covered, or if the object is too large for the bin. The approach uses topic modeling to group and define similar constraints/rules; these groups are inferred via data offline, prior to synthesis.  Synthesizing robot controllers from natural language: The project developed an algorithm for probabilistic grounding of natural language instructions into logical formulas and automatically synthesizing robot controllers from the grounded language.

Robot-specific templates are used to form a specification which can be synthesized into a grounded controller. The project also developed a natural language instruction grounding framework which uses formal synthesis to enable the robot to identify necessary environment assumptions for the task to be successful  Human feedback about robot understanding: The project developed an algorithm for automatically suggesting to untrained users additional assumptions about the environment relating to the robot?s task. These suggested instructions are required for correct robot execution and users are prompted to either accept or decline them. Different methods of prompting feedback using natural language (repeating the original sentence, creating a new sentence) were developed and evaluated the methods in user studies.  Data Collection: The project integrated natural language parsing and controller synthesis from logic formulas into a system (simulation and experiment) that was used for data collection of a corpus of natural language instructions, and validation experiments. Given natural language instructions and a world model, the end-to-end system synthesizes robot controllers that a physical robot (Rethink Robotics? Baxter) then executes.
