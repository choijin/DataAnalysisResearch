<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Suzanne A. Blum of the University of California, Irvine is developing microscopy techniques that reveal chemical reactions at ultimate sensitivity limits.  These techniques advance the boundaries of technology while concurrently answering long-standing questions in chemistry. These studies provide suggestions for improving the efficiencies of chemical reactions, resulting in reduced costs and waste generation and lower energy demands in the synthesis of advanced materials and pharmaceutical building blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on developing single-molecule and -particle microscopy techniques that reveal the locations of chemical reactions. Such location information will be used to understand the mechanisms of organic reactions including late-metal catalysis. Single-particle studies are performed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in order to test ideas about the spatial homogeneity and efficiencies of surface-supported molecular catalysts. Single-molecule studies are performed via fluorescence microscopy. These studies bring together the diverse expertise of a collaborative research team in organic synthesis, mechanistic investigation, reaction development, and single-molecule and particle microscopy experimental design and tool development. The broader impacts of the proposal include methods for improving catalyst efficiency and generation of fundamental mechanistic information for the development of synthetic methods. The expansion of a successful future faculty teacher training program at the University of California, Irvine, that the principle investigator initiated forms an additional broader impact in order to advance the NSF goals of advancing discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training and learning, and broadening participation of underrepresented groups. The expansion increases the number of graduate students receiving training in teaching, the diversity of chemistry courses in which the training occurs, the participation of faculty mentors as trainers in pedagogy, and the quantity of undergraduate students reached.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Chemistry and its modern techniques for constructing products has completely revolutionized the synthesis of materials, medicines, and agrochemicals. Yet, several desirable products cannot be produced efficiently because the chemical methods to make them do not exist.  A significant bottleneck to developing methods to produce these products is the lack of understanding of how reactions take place at the microscale.  The current experiments bridged this gap directly by developing a new sensitive fluorescence microcopy tool that enabled imaging microscale reactions as they occurred in real time in solvents, and thus produced knoweldge of how chemical change happens at the micrscale by direct observation.  The images produced by this microscopy technique enabled correlation of fundamental, individual reaction steps to microsale bulk properties of materials.   These experiments identified that lithium chloride, a readily available and cost-effective salt, promotes the direct insertion of organohalides to metallic zinc powder in the practical synthesis of organozinc reagents by solubilizing intermediates on the surface of zinc metal.  Further, the ability to image how the intermediates behave in the microscale, in the presence of different lithium salts, enabled prediction of the structure and possible reactivity of the ultimate solution organozinc reagent. The structures of the organozinc reagents underpin their reactivity.  Thus, these studies provided a robust mechanistic framework for and suggest the possibility of organozinc reagents with tunable electronic properties based on the nature of the salts in order to develop methods to make desirable products. This is an early example of microscopy-enabled characterization of elementary steps on the microscale being used to both understand and predict the macroscale structure of reagents, highlighting the role of the next generation of analytical tools in the development of synthetic chemistry.  In addition, the expansion of a successful future faculty teacher training program at UCI that the PI initiated formed an additional broader impact in order to advance the NSF goals of (1) advancing discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training and learning, and (2) broadening participation of underrepresented groups. This program improved chemistry course instruction for &gt;800 UCI undergraduate students.              Last Modified: 08/10/2020       Submitted by: Suzanne A Blum]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
