<AbstractNarration>This project aims to connect several areas of mathematics that relate to modern mathematical physics.  The theory of knots -- ordinary, tangled loops of string in three-dimensional space -- goes back to Lord Kelvin, who proposed that the periodic table was made from different knotted forms of the ether.  Since that time, knot theory became a well-established subject in mathematics, even as the physics of Kelvin's proposal came into disfavor.  The main challenge of knot theory in mathematics is to recognize when two knots are the same or different.  More recently, knots have reappeared in the mathematical physics relating to supersymmetric gauge theory and string theory. Through their reappearance in mathematical physics, knots have re-emerged in mathematics in sophisticated form. This project will elucidate the interplay among these fields within math and physics, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the subject. In addition, the principal investigator will train graduate students, support a research seminar, run a math circle, and perform other activities aimed at developing young mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Knots, Sheaves, and Mirrors" refers first to a connection between Legendrian knots and constructible sheaves, and second to a study of the moduli spaces involved under the identification. A Legendrian knot can arise as a boundary-at-infinity of a Lagrangian submanifold, so given the micro localization theorem (proved by the principal investigator and Nadler) relating sheaves and the Fukaya category, it is perhaps not surprising that Legendrians have a purely sheaf-theoretic description.  In fact, the exact relationship is somewhat subtle, but in the end one can equate augmentations of the Chekanov-Eliashberg differential graded algebra with constructible sheaves on the base plane containing the front diagram.  With this equivalence in hand, it is then natural, following the ideas of mirror symmetry, to study the moduli spaces of "rank-one" objects --- and these prove to be interesting spaces, related to Bott-Samelson resolutions, from which one can recover categorized HOMFLY invariants of the knot.  The project will also study the sheaf-theoretic description of Legendrian conormals of topological knots (along the lines of Aganagic-Ekholm-Ng-Vafa), wild Hitchin systems corresponding to algebraic singularities whose link is the knot.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    As the title "Knots, Sheaves and Mirrors" suggests, this project was about connecting different branches of mathematics.  One is knot theory, which describes how loops can be knotted in three-dimensional space.  The other is sheaf theory, which is an algebraic/combinatorial structure vastly generalizing the notion of a function.  The link between the theories comes from PI Zaslow's earlier work with David Nadler, in which they showed how sheaf theory describes one of the branches of mirror symmetry, itself a deep phenomenon discovered through theoretical physics and studied by Zaslow throughout his career.     During the period of the project, the PI completed several works establishing how knot theory can be treated with sheaves.  One of them --- "Legendrian Knots and Constructible Sheaves" --- was published in Inventiones Mathematicae, one of the very top journals.  Two other significant preprints were written and have been submitted for publication:  "Cluster Varieties from Legendrian Knots" (with Shende, Treumann and Williams) and "Augmentations are Sheaves" (with Ng, Rutherford, Shende and Sivek).  Another paper, "Cubic Planar Graphs and Legendrian Surface Theory" (with Treumann), generalized this work from knots (one-dimensional) to surfaces (two-dimensional), and has been accepted for publication by Advances in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics.       Work in progress with Williams and Treumann establishes a connection between mirror symmetry, sheaves and an integrable system first studied by Kenyon-Okounkov-Sheffield in their Annals paper.       While engaging in this research, PI Zaslow continued his efforts toward engaging with young scholars and the community at large.  He runs a math circle for middle schoolers.  He teaches in a Bridge program mainly for low-income and first-generation Northwestern students transitioning from high school to college.  He graduated three PhD students during the period of the grant, and he mentored two postdocs who now have tenure-track jobs.     Overall, the works in this project clarified and solidified a deep link between sheaf theory and symplectic topology even more broadly than knot theory.  The mathematical community is interested in these links, as evidenced for example by a major 2016 summer school in Jussieu (Paris):  "Symplectic Topology, Sheaves and Mirror Symmetry."  The PI has continued to explore and generalize the phenomena revealed by his investigations, and continues his efforts toward outreach and professional development.
