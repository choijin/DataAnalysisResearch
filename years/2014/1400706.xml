<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of this project were to investigate a range of questions concerning the long-time behavior of solutions to nonlinear dispersive PDE, with a particular focus on the problem of conditional scattering for large-data critical problems.  Other topics of research included proving scattering below sharp thresholds for dispersive equations in the presence of external potentials; long-time behavior for solutions to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (NLS) with nonzero boundary conditions at infinity; and scattering problems for dispersive PDE with randomized supercritical data.  These problems are all related to fundamental questions in the field of nonlinear dispersive PDE, which is a class of partial differential equations with connections to many physical models as well as to many other areas of mathematics (including harmonic analysis, mathematical physics, probability, and others).    This fellowship led to the resolution of many research problems and resulted in fourteen research papers, most of which have been published in peer-reviewed journals (with a few submitted papers still undergoing peer review at the time of this writing).  These results were also presented in departmental seminars and conferences during the time of the award.     The main results from this research can be described briefly as follows.     First, conditional scattering for large data was established for a range of models, including the mass-subcritical NLS and the energy-subcritical NLW.  These results relied on the further development of techniques related to the concentration-compactness approach to induction on energy.     Next, scattering results were established for NLS with nonzero boundary conditions, relying on the analysis of certain non-resonance phenomena present in the quadratic nonlinear terms (e.g. through the method of space-time nonresonance).  Related analysis also led to an almost global existence result for 1d cubic NLS with arbitrary (non-gauge-invariant) nonlinearities.  A modified scattering result was also obtained for the 1d cubic NLS with a repulsive delta potential.    Third, the problem of scattering below sharp ground state thresholds was addressed for the NLS and NLW in the setting of an inverse-square potential.  This required development of concentration-compactness and related techniques in the setting of broken symmetries.  The problem of scattering below the ground state for the radial NLS was also considered, and a new simpler proof was given in this setting.     Finally, scattering problems for NLS with randomized supercritical data were established in the setting of the mass-subcritical and energy-critical NLS.  These results in the theory of scattering for randomized data have contributed to further development in this interesting ongoing area of research.    Outside of the setting of mathematics research, the PI was able to get involved with undergraduate students through the supervision of reading courses.  In particular, the PI supervised reading courses on the mathematics of signal processing and machine learning.  The PI also prepared expository materials for undergraduate courses, as well as some expository papers related to research.
