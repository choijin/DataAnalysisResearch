<AbstractNarration>This research will make significant contributions to Integrated Circuits (ICs) design which are critical components in all computing, communications and sensing systems. The proposed research is multidisciplinary, spanning the fields of mixed-signal/ analog/Radio-Frequency (RF) design and simulation as well as computer science. It also contains a comprehensive plan for outreach activities and integration of research and education which are essential for enhancing the scientific and engineering workforce.The graduate students working on the project will receive cross-disciplinary training across diverse areas of electrical and computer engineering and computer science. In addition, the multi-disciplinary links to other system-level design disciplines will be explored and developed. The students will participate in summer internship programs with industry and work on real industry test cases. This will facilitate technology transfer to industry and will also challenge the PIs and students to address practical issues that impact commercialization of the technology developed in this research. The research will be disseminated through conference and journal papers, patents as well as demonstrations of working hardware prototypes. The PI and co-PI will make maximum efforts to involve undergraduate students at Georgia Tech and at Purdue in the research project. It will also be possible to involve undergraduate project students in this research through senior design projects. Thus, funding for this project will support the goals of recruiting more U.S. citizens, women and minorities to graduate programs at G.Tech and Purdue&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Mixed-signal/RF/mm-wave Circuits and systems of the future, manufactured with aggressive CMOS processing technologies will need to be tuned aggressively for performance throughout their life cycle using built-in self-tuning mechanisms. New algorithms and on-chip infrastructure need to be developed for tuning large numbers of parameters (e.g. bias currents, matching networks) of these devices efficiently to improve manufacturing yield and reduce field maintenance costs. Without such tuning mechanisms it will be difficult to introduce  new advanced electronic products into the marketplace at low cost. This research will develop new engineering principles for cross-domain (across different circuit modules including digital compensation) built-in tuning of high performance wireless communication systems using multi-dimensional optimization and supervised learning techniques. Intelligent built-in testing methods will be used to expose the process parameters corresponding to each device. This information along with process data from wafer maps and test response data from built-in sensors will be used to tune complex wireless systems for Multiple-Input-Multiple Output (MIMO) beamforming and polar radio. In addition, field tuning will also be applied to extending the useful life of devices in the field by redistributing electrical stresses from electrical degradation. The core concepts developed will be applicable to a host of mixed-signal/analog/high-speed devices such as Wired-Local-Area Network(WLAN) systems, sensor networks, automobile control systems,and others.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Intellectual Merit:</p> <p>Modern high-speed wireless communication systems are extremely susceptible to manufacturing process variations and defects due to the use of aggressive silicon manufacturing technologies. Consequently, manufacturing yield (given by the ratio of &ldquo;good&rdquo; integrated circuits (ICs) produced to the total number manufactured) is a very big issue with silicon manufacturers as discarded (bad) ICs have the effect of increasing the cost of products sold in the marketplace. Typically, RF devices have a range of performance specifications against which the quality of manufactured devices is evaluated. The objective of test stimulus generation is to find a stimulus such that accurate pass/fail decisions can be made for every manufactured device depending on process variability and manufacturing defect statistics. &nbsp;The generated test must implicitly guarantee that the device under test meets all its performance specifications. At the same time, the test must be considerably easier and faster to apply in relation to conventional test procedures&nbsp; that involve measurement of all the device performance specifications. To speed up test generation, we create booleanized (behavioral) models of the device under test that are as accurate as state of the art simulation tools such as HSpice &nbsp;(this is derived from work initially done at UC Berkeley in Prof. J. Roychowdhury&rsquo;s group: the work at Georgia Tech focused on model development for RF circuits and application of booleanized models to the problem of test stimulus generation) with the objective of speeding up circuit simulation). The booleanized models are created from a set of simulation experiments conducted on a circuit-level description of the device under test or by experiments conducted on the device under test hardware itself. The construction of such booleanized models incurs an up-front model construction cost but results in orders of magnitude speedup in simulation time. As a consequence, orders of magnitude speedup in test computation time becomes possible while allowing emulation of devices long after they have shipped to the customer. A key benefit of this approach is that for the first time, accurate test generation for complex mixed-signal/RF systems can be performed, allowing high quality testing of manufactured devices in production. The resulting test generation capability was subsequently leveraged to develop a novel adaptive testing methodology for mixed-signal/RF systems with the goal of minimizing test costs while maximizing failure coverage.</p> <p class="Abstract">Future 5G wireless systems will deploy massive MIMO systems with large numbers of transmit and receive antennas and novel RF transceiver architectures that admit RF beamforming. Such systems will need to be designed with built-in test and post-manufacture self-tuning capability for yield enhancement and in-field tuning. A key issue is the lack of observability into internal circuit nodes due to the convergence of multiple RF beamforming chains into a combined baseband signal and the need to decouple individual RF chain behaviors from combined baseband signals. A second problem is that of testing and tuning as many RF chains in parallel as possible across a diverse range of specifications and modes of operation (beam steering angles) using optimized test stimulus. The interdependence between phase shift and gain of phase-shifter/amplifier configurations complicates the latter. Also, in relation to SISO/MIMO omnidirectional systems, large numbers of tuning knobs are involved. To solve the above, novel algorithms for <em>parallel testing and tuning of massive MIMO beamforming systems </em>were developed.<em> </em>Machine learning assisted coarse tuning was first performed followed by a fine tuning procedure utilizing gradient descent. Tuning for EVM and signal-to-interference ratio was performed and results obtained were very encouraging showing over 50% improvement in manufacturing yield in some cases.</p> <p class="Abstract">In addition to the test stimulus generation and post-manufacture tuning techniques described above, algorithms for detecting and diagnosing design bugs were also investigated. This is because design bugs need to be detected, diagnosed and corrected before a device is sent for production. The algorithms developed were shown to be highly efficient for detecting and diagnosing common design bugs with correction being performed manually on the basis of the diagnostic data generated.</p> <p class="Abstract">Broader Impact:</p> <p>The two students working on this project developed infrastructure based on a tester load board donated by Texas Instruments for testing and tuning a set of ICs (over 500) containing RF LNAs and a mixer. &nbsp;This was used to generate realistic test data across a diverse set of ICs selected from different process corners. This infrastructure will be used for future projects going forward. In addition, the PI has already incorporated a module on mixed-signal/RF test into the testing class that he teaches at Georgia Tech (ECE 6140). Currently there are very few schools in the US that teach mixed-signal/mixed-technology design and test within the same framework in the same course. The principle of cross-domain adaptation will be incorporated into this course and the wireless MIMO/beamforming system developed through the proposed research will be used as an illustrative example.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/13/2017<br>      Modified by: Abhijit&nbsp;Chatterjee</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1407542/1407542_10300193_1497381046409_image4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1407542/1407542_10300193_1497381046409_image4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Testing and Tuning Problem"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1407542/1407542_10300193_1497381046409_image4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Testing and Tuning Problem"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The key problems  and challenges in testing and tuning massive-MIMO systems are described</div> <div class="imageCredit">S.
