<AbstractNarration>The investigators propose to characterize the multitude of approaches currently employed in the professional development of K-12 teachers of science, and to measure the effectiveness of such approaches in increasing teacher knowledge in the sciences. The project will study 150 professional development programs for teachers of science in grades K-12.   The sample will cover grade bands K-4, 5-8, and 9-12.  Subject matter will include life science (biology), physical science (physics, chemistry), earth and space science.  Such programs are funded through competitive federal grants for local implementation (by universities, museums, schools, and others), by state and local governments, by private institutions, and conducted by many federal agencies.  To date, there has not been a national inventory and study of the effectiveness of teacher professional development programs in science, using common outcome measures of teacher instructional practice.  If successful, the findings from this research will allow professional development providers and policymakers to design more effective teacher professional development programs and should provide a national landscape of teacher professional development in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In specific, the researchers will focus on assessing gains in teachers' subject matter knowledge and knowledge of student misconceptions, and will correlate these with professional development program design features.  Teachers of students from underrepresented groups will be oversampled to ensure special analyses for this group are possible.  Hierarchical linear modeling will be used in analyzing the results.  The project will result in a website, conference presentations, and scholarly and professional publications.</AbstractNarration>

Those who design and conduct PD programs have strong views on which aspects of PD are most effective. This project used a common instrument to measure how effective a multitude of professional development approaches are in increasing teacher subject matter knowledge (SMK) in the sciences and teacher knowledge of student misconceptions (KOSM), the most frequent focus of PD programs.     The team developed thirteen assessment instruments and administered these to educators in over 200 summer science PD programs nationally distributed across all 50 states and Puerto Rico.

The amount of time spent learning foundational concepts in the sciences was associated with gains in both SMK and KOSM (i.e., an increase in exposure or time spent predicted larger gains). The difference in gains between participants who reported "Always" spending time on learning these concepts and those who reported "Never" spending time was equivalent to the average gains teachers would make in ten years of teaching. Participants reporting that they attended the program because it "provided an opportunity to learn new or innovative methods of teaching science" or "looked fun, challenging, or personally rewarding" tended to have higher gains in both SMK and KOSM, equivalent to between five and eight years of teaching experience.

The thirteen assessments developed during the project have been made available to PD providers and educators through the MOSART website &ndash; PDMOST tab (https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/smgphp/mosart/). Any educator can use these high-quality assessment instruments at no cost for self-assessment, and PD providers can use these tools to gauge the level of knowledge incoming educators possess as well as the knowledge gains they experience over the program.
