<AbstractNarration>Shallow lakes and ponds may cover up to 40 percent of the land surface in Arctic lowland regions.  Many of these water bodies traditionally freeze solid during the winter, preserving sub-lake permafrost and keeping soil carbon stocks immobile at depth.  Slightly deeper lakes maintain some liquid water beneath floating ice, causing deep thaw zones in otherwise continuous permafrost.  Evidence suggests that thinner ice growth in response to warmer, snowier winters is pushing many bedfast ice lakes to floating ice regimes.  If such a regime shift becomes pervasive across lake-rich landscapes, resulting permafrost thaw and enhanced moisture and heat flux could generate positive feedbacks, further amplifying this regime change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines the extent and dynamics of bedfast and floating ice lakes in relation to hypothesized interactions and feedback with permafrost and climate.  A combination of remote sensing, field monitoring and geophysical measurements, experiments and physical models are used to isolate processes, quantify interactions and project changes.  Project findings will be relevant locally for native village subsistence and for water supply to the petroleum industry, and globally for scientists studying permafrost thaw and Arctic climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Lakes are dominant features of many arctic regions, covering greater than 20% of the land surface. Developed and set in permafrost, most thermokarst lakes are shallow, yet provide important habitat for fish and wildlife, places for subsistence hunting and fishing, sources of water for industry, and help regulate essential ecological and geological processes across the Arctic. &nbsp;These lakes are also ice covered for the majority (&gt;8-9 month) of the year and many freeze solid by winters end. But these regimes of ice cover duration and thickness are responding to climate change and variability. Our project focused on these changes in lake ice conditions and corresponding interactions and feedbacks with the broader arctic system. &nbsp;&nbsp;Through a combination of field studies and monitoring, remote sensing, and physical models we analyzed the dynamics of lake ice in the Arctic system at a range of scales focused in Arctic Alaska, but applicable to vast regions of Canada and Siberia. Key findings include:</p> <p>1 &ndash; Arctic lake ice has becoming thinner since the 1970&rsquo;s, when it often exceeded 2.2 meters. Recent observation from the Barrow Peninsula were just above 1 meter, likely the thinnest ice experienced in this area in the last century or much longer.</p> <p>2 &ndash; Thinner lake ice is causing fewer lakes to freeze solid according to remote sensing analysis, yet we see a great deal of year to year variability and among regions. Part of this is caused by differing snow characteristics, which impacts ice growth, and part is due to differing lake levels caused by summer rainfall.</p> <p>3 &ndash; Reductions in early winter sea ice extent is seen as a major driver of thinner ice and regime shift in lake ice (from bedfast to floating-ice conditions). More open water in the early winter is causing warmer atmospheric conditions and often heavier snowfall, which together reduce ice growth during this period. Yet year to year variation in sea ice extent is also seen as responsible for much variation in lake ice responses.</p> <p>4 &ndash; Thinner lake ice has a direct impact on bed temperature of shallow lakes and thawing of sublake permafrost. This process may be leading to enhanced greenhouse gas emissions (primarily methane) and also may be leading to permanent thaw subsidence and deepening of lakes. Though more research is needed to document these processes, each would be responsible for positive feedbacks of importance to the broader arctic system.</p> <p>5 &ndash; Lake water balance is sensitive to ice cover duration, making floating ice lakes less sensitive to drought compared to bedfast ice lakes. Thus, a shift from bedfast to floating ice regimes may help conserve lake water, at least in the short term, despite warmer summer temperature and enhanced evaporation.</p> <p>Taken together, these finding paint a dynamic picture for the future of lake-rich regions of the Arctic. Ice regimes shifts should provide increased overwinter fish habitat and more abundant winter water supply for industry that relies on lakes for ice road construction. At the same time, permafrost thaw below previously bedfast ice lakes may enhance greenhouse gas emissions from these lakes and also enhance lake shoreline erosion and catastrophic drainage events. Our results have revealed how many of these process operate and provide projections for future responses to climate change. Additionally, we have developed a solid combination of observational approaches (field synoptic surveys and remote sensing) that can guide tracking of future changes in freshwater systems in the new Arctic.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/18/2018<br>      Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;D&nbsp;Arp</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1417300/1417300_10308801_1530139162163_ALISS_cover_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1417300/1417300_10308801_1530139162163_ALISS_cover_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Landscape of Lake Ice"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1417300/1417300_10308801_1530139162163_ALISS_cover_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Landscape of Lake Ice"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Lakes are abundant landforms in the Arctic and covered with ice for 2/3 of the year.
