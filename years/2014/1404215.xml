<AbstractNarration>The expected detection of the first gravitational waves through the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) will create a paradigm shift in the way the Universe is viewed, as well as confirming an important prediction of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. The activities in this award will provide community college faculty and lower-division college students with the tools to view the Universe in an entirely new and different way and with insights into LIGO's daunting technological challenges, just in time to appreciate the expected first detections of gravitational waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will enable the creation of new science and technology content for the "LIGO College Faculty Resource Website." This content will be also be used in the online course "Teaching Einstein's Universe to College Students" which will be offered for academic or continuing education credits to community college faculty nationwide.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual merit:</strong> Five major products were developed to describe the technology and Nobel-prize winning scientific discoveries made using LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory). These products include two online courses developed for instructors of lower-division physics classes, an educator&rsquo;s guide for secondary school teachers, an educational poster that is being distributed by the Contemporary Physics Education Project, a non-profit organization, and a narrated, educational video that explain how LIGO operates, and that uses LIGO&rsquo;s actual CAD drawings to trace the path of the laser beam through the system. All materials are now in the public domain, and all are available free of charge, with the exception of the CPEP poster. The two online courses include significant amounts of original material, homework exercises and additional resources. The 2015 online course, LIGO: Waves and Gravity, included 3 units of original material (and 3 other units of pre-existing material): Learning More About Light, Geometry and Gravity for Weak Fields, and Astrophysical Sources of Gravitational Waves. The 2016 online course, LIGO: Detecting Gravitational Waves was created after the discovery of the first gravitational waves, and includes 5 units of original material: Introduction and Background, Direct Observations, LIGO: The Basic Idea, Sources of Noise and Signal Extraction. The animations and narration for the video were originated for this project, as were the Educator&rsquo;s guide narrative material and illustrations, and the illustrations and narrative material for the CPEP poster.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader impacts:</strong> The online courses were directly taken by a total of 35 instructors, and the materials are now in the public domain, where they are being used by many other instructors. The Educator&rsquo;s guide has been widely distributed through workshops and through both the LIGO and CPEP websites. The CPEP poster has been distributed at teacher&rsquo;s workshops and is available for purchase through Amazon. The narrated video is being used in talks given by LIGO scientific collaboration members and viewed by the general public. Artwork designed to explain the discovery of gravitational waves has been widely viewed by millions through the Astronomy Picture of the Day website. Additionally, PI Cominsky gave invited talks and/or workshops at 17 venues, including some that targeted rural, diverse students, as well as contributing a poster at a professional society conference.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/07/2018<br>      Modified by: Lynn&nbsp;Cominsky</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1404215/1404215_10316043_1530992245090_LigoCPEPoster16Xsml--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1404215/1404215_10316043_1530992245090_LigoCPEPoster16Xsml--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Gravitation: From Newton to Einstein"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1404215/1404215_10316043_1530992245090_LigoCPEPoster16Xsml--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Gravitation: From Newton to Einstein"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This colorful, graphically rich chart illustrates and summarizes theories of gravity as they evolved from Newton's Law of Gravitation to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Aurore Simonnet, Lynn Cominsky and Kevin McLin on behalf of CPEP</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Lynn&nbsp;Cominsky</div> <div class="imageTitle">Gravitation: From Newton to Einstein</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1404215/1404215_10316043_1530992939862_ligo-guide--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1404215/1404215_10316043_1530992939862_ligo-guide--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Cover of LIGO Educator's Guide"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1404215/1404215_10316043_1530992939862_ligo-guide--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Cover of LIGO Educator's Guide"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Direct Observation of Gravitational Waves is intended for students in grades 6 and higher.
