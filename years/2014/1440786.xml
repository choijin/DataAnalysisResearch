<AbstractNarration>This project broadly improves Carleton's cyberinfrastructure design and integration to ensure system performance and reliability, including rate and security of data transfer, in support of computational science. Project goals include (1) Upgrading campus Internet2 connection to the Northern Lights GigaPOP to a speed of 10Gbps; (2) Designing and building a prototype Science DMZ to provide immediate support for researchers constrained by the current limitations of the campus building and data infrastructures; (3) Blending the experience gained from the prototype Science DMZ with the ongoing work of the Carleton Science Planning Group to formulate the most effective plan for end-to-end research connectivity, with attention to proposed expansion and remodeling of campus science facilities; (4) Leveraging the knowledge and experience gained by the faculty and staff in this process into the ongoing collaboration efforts to facilitate shared research nationally and internationally. The project's design and implementation is based on best practices developed by successful NSF-funded projects, with particular focus on design of a Science DMZ to meet the needs of researchers at a research-oriented liberal arts college. The design and implementation of the project improves high bandwidth connections accessible to end-users in order to improve network performance and predictability for a wide range of applications. The project addresses specific cyberinfrastructure limitations that impede faculty research with external research partners. Project leaders will present findings regarding design challenges and innovations at national workshops, meetings, and conferences in order to advance small-institution understanding of SDN across wide-area and campus cyberinfrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

Another critical objective was to create more economy of scale by growing our collaboration with St. Olaf. We surpassed the original objectives by also finding fertile ground among the new faculty for sharing of infrastructure and leveraging their start-up and grant funding through creation of a cluster environment built upon the high capacity network made available by this grant. Three faculty researchers exemplify the range of current and future uses of this new infrastructure. Professor Deborah Gross leverages the increased network bandwidth, Professor Joshua Davis leverages the increased computational power, and Professor Rika Anderson leverages the close proximity of fast storage to fast computational resources.  Professor Gross has been an institutional leader in expanding the opportunities for undergraduate student research. In her lab, student researchers explore very large data sets of airborne particulates, which is complicated by having multiple dimensions across different time series. This infrastructure will allow her students to exchange that data in a database format with international collaborators, which they have been prevented from doing by network latency. The result will be to accelerate their research into the effect of aerosol particles on the environment and human health. Professor Davis performed large-scale numerical experiments to create models on how the crystalline structures of rocks deform, seeking to achieve exactly a 95% confidence interval on the model. His work may improve future studies of rock deformation and rock magnetism which support greater understanding of the factors at play in the transfer of energy among rocks at earthquake fault lines.  Professor Anderson uses bioinformatic approaches to investigate how marine microorganisms evolve in response to the extreme environment of deep-sea hydrothermal vents.
