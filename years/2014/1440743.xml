<AbstractNarration>Georgetown University is creating a Research Community Science DMZ network for scientific collaboration internally and with external researchers, leveraging GU's extant plan for Multi-Processing Label Switching deployment on campus. The IP networks at the off-campus GU Virginia Data Center (VDC) are securely extended via encrypted Layer-2/3 connection into cloud services, including access to Amazon Web Services, Internet2 Net+, and compute and storage resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These enhancements provide a friction-free, high-speed network to support Big Science and Big Data. Campus data use is expanding from terabytes to petabytes, extending into campus labs, commercial cloud services, and Mid-Atlantic Crossroads Regional Gigapop and Internet2 researchers through a layer 3 Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The GU Science DMZ and campus MPLS network architectures securely and deterministically separate research traffic from general Internet and administrative traffic. This flexible infrastructure enables faculty and others involved in STEM to work with colleagues on campus and at off-campus sites as though they were in the same lab, leveraging the speed of the 10 Gbps connection to Internet2. The Science DMZ includes the addition of a Data Transfer Node (DTN) host to support high-speed data transfers, Software Defined Networking (SDN) to extend services beyond GU?s borders and perfSONAR to maintain performance data on network throughput, availability, and latency. The Science DMZ, with the ability to access cloud compute and storage resources, leverages 10Gbps network enhancements on campus and to Internet2,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STEM research and education are expanding at GU. Strategic investments have been and are being made in faculty, programs and infrastructure. The GU network, including the Science DMZ, enables flexible access to on campus and cloud resources, enabling more compute and storage intensive research. As research programs expand, the quality of education and research available to STEM undergraduate and graduate students is enriched.</AbstractNarration>

Facilitating communication between institutions with functional Science DMZs is greatly improved, increasing the ability to collaborate in a data-intensive world.   We are creating a second science DMZ in AWS to support high-performance data transfers for researchers who need to move data in-to or out-of AWS to leverage high performance compute and storage resources.  The DTN (via Globus) and perfSONAR systems will be instantiated on EC2 servers and S3 storage to scale to the needs of researchers.   Benefits of the on-prem/hybrid cloud architecture include:   - Effective cost management of infrastructure support for new research exploration and validation   - Enabling faster response and resolution of performance issues with fewer staff resources by utilizing perfSONAR, while maintaining appropriate security policies   - Flexibility and scalability of almost unlimited compute and storage resource to meet rapidly increasing demand for data-intensive analytics and high performance computing   - Easier data access and sharing for cross-institution collaboration when raw data is stored in the public cloud, including implementing a federated Globus system on the Data Transfer Node to enable ease of file transfer    - Easier adaptation and integration of third-party services and software tools and quick deployment of applications   - Streamlined single point administration and management of IT resources residing in public and private infrastructure using best-of-breed management software  To ensure the highest performance transfer speed, the Science DMZ is designed to avoid transit of the firewall at the data center and other network locations on campus.  This improves researcher?s access to high-performance applications, computing nodes, and data storage both inside Georgetown?s Data Center at Equinix-Ashburn and in the cloud (e.g., AWS and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
