<AbstractNarration>Rocky intertidal habitats in the Gulf of Maine (GoM) provide a model system to examine the structure and dynamics of natural communities. Throughout the Gulf of Maine, the same species are often found in these habitats but community structure, dynamics and productivity differ markedly among 3 distinct regions (southern, central and northern GoM). Past influential work, conducted primarily in the southern and central GoM, focused on the local processes driving intertidal community structure but produced very different conceptual models of how these communities are structured. This project examines whether regional differences in rocky shore community processes are driven by differences in recruitment that are shaped by regional variation in temperature and food availability and nearshore coastal oceanography. This project will improve the understanding of how large-scale environmental forces interact with local processes to control the distribution of species and the structure and dynamics of these communities. Understanding the interaction between processes operating at different scales is fundamentally important to developing more reliable models that can be used to predict community dynamics. In addition, data resulting from this project will have important implications for regional dynamics in commercially important species and for ecosystem and fisheries management within the GoM. Students and postdoctoral researchers will be supported and trained as part of this interdisciplinary project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching hypothesis of this project is that regional differences in community-level processes are driven by very different patterns of population connectivity and recruitment in a few key species and that these differences are ultimately caused by regional variation in temperature and food availability and mediated by physical larval transport processes. Hence, the project will test the following hypotheses with manipulative field experiments, field sampling, connectivity estimates, and integrative modeling: 1) Locally-dispersing species dominate dynamics in regions with a net export of planktonic larvae (Northern GoM), while species with planktonic larvae dominate the dynamics in regions with high settlement and extensive connectivity among populations (Southern GoM). 2) Settlement density of species with planktonic larvae increases from northern to southern regions in accord with regional variation in food availability. 3) Population connectivity varies greatly among regions, with regions differing in the degree to which they are self-seeded or serve as larval sources vs. sinks; self-seeding leads to relatively localized population dynamics in the middle portion of the GoM. 4) Patterns of population connectivity are driven by physical transport processes and can be represented by coupling basic larval behavior models with circulation models. At 18 different sites in the GoM across ~ 600 km, surveys will evaluate variation in recruitment, food availability and secondary productivity and experiments will assess community processes in wave-exposed and sheltered habitats. The project will use hydrographic, current profile, and larval vertical distribution surveys to collect data for coupled larval/circulation models. Population connectivity will be both modeled and empirically evaluated (for one species) using elemental fingerprinting. A spatially explicit metacommunity model will integrate across all project components and test the relative importance of regional and local processes in controlling community organization and dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of this project was to test whether differences in larval transport among regions in the Gulf of Maine results in the formation of different intertidal communities.  The Downeast Institute's portion of this collaborative project focused on larval transport processes, while collaborators at other institutions focused more on the community dynamics.  We found that larval transport differed greatly along the coast.  While larvae along most of the coast are mainly transported to the southwest, the very northeastern most portion of the coast (the Grand Manan Channel) experiences a seasonal (summer) reversal in the direction of transport.  Barnacles and mussels exhibit latitudinal gradients in the release of gametes or larvae, with release beginning in the southwest and subsequently spreading to the northeast.  These latitudinal gradients interact with the seasonal flow reversal to send larvae in fundamentally different directions.  Larvae from the earlier spawning southwestern populations are transported to the southwest (as expected from previous work), but larvae from northeast populations are transported to the northeast (into Canadian waters).  As a consequence, a section of the northeastern coast (the Grand Manan Channel) receives very few larvae, and mussels and barnacles are very rare in this region.  The higher relative abundance of organisms with limited propagule dispersal (mainly algae) results in very different intertidal communities in this region.   As a by-product of our work on the transport of larval mussels, we monitored mussel beds for several years.  Contrary to popular beliefs, mussels are quite abundant in large beds that form on soft sediment well up the estuaries (near clam flats).  Although open coast rock-living mussels appear to have declined, we found that the mud populations were quite robust, though the recruitment of seed mussels varied quite a bit from year to year.  Although these mud populations are commercially harvested, the state of Maine has not traditionally assessed the stocks.  Our data provided some preliminary stock assessments during a time when the regulators and industry were debating whether to move toward more active management of the industry.
