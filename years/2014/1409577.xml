<AbstractNarration>Non-technical: &lt;br/&gt;This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Brown University is cofunded by the Instrument Development for Biological Research program in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (BIO). This award will study "Lab-on-a-chip" technology in improving healthcare by making biomedical tests smaller, cheaper, and faster. The ultimate limit would be tests on single molecules. This project aims to take an important step in that direction by developing powerful ways of controlling the shape and the motion of single DNA molecules. With this award, techniques will be developed that require nanofluidic device "channels with dimensions only tens to hundreds of nanometers across" because they can exploit physical concepts that only apply at that scale. For instance, a fluidic device with nanoscale topographic features inside it, like nanotrenches, harnesses the entropy of a DNA molecule to guide its motion or even contort it into predetermined shapes. Entropy is a measure of the multitude of microscopically different shapes a polymer can adopt. It is also possible to manipulate a DNA molecule electrostatically, using a nanofluidic version of the field effect upon which transistors are based. The experiments in this project will advance our fundamental understanding of nanofluidics and polymer physics. This project will also apply control over single DNA molecules to obtain overlapping restriction maps of a single molecule, which can increase the throughput of long-range sequence information that complements next-generation genomic sequencing data. This interdisciplinary project will prepare graduate and undergraduate students for careers in a rapidly growing area of the high-technology economy. Furthermore, the videos collected of single DNA molecules being controlled one by one will be used in the classroom at Brown University and in the nearby public elementary schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: &lt;br/&gt;This award is to develop new methods in controlling the configurations and the transport of single DNA molecules inside nanofluidic devices. The proposed methods rely on influencing the free energy landscape for a nanoconfined polyelectrolyte. This researcher will investigate how a series of trenches embedded within a nanoslit governs the configurational entropy of a polymer through the reduction of the number of configurations available in shallow regions as compared with deeper regions. The investigator will also explore how the charged inner surfaces of a device influence the enthalpy of a confined molecule through Coulomb forces, which can be locally tuned using electrodes. These new modalities of control should enable fundamental studies on single DNA molecules and new bio-analytical applications. Stochastic resonance and noise-assisted transport of DNA will be studied in a synthetic, bumpy free energy landscape. A similar device will be used to create overlapping restriction maps of the same DNA molecule by performing multiple restriction digests, sequentially, on the molecule as it is trapped and stretched in a long nanotrench. This project will advance "lab-on-a-chip" applications, provide excellent training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and will support outreach activities to local public schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project, entitled "Free Energy Landscaping for Single-Molecule Biophysics", developed a nanofluidic technology for manipulating single DNA molecules, and used that technology to investigate the fundamental behavior of DNA polymers when they are driven far out of equilibrium. This project has contributed to the training of multiple Ph.D. students, and the advances in technology and fundamental undersanding that were achieved can have a broad impact through use in biomedical devices.  Intellectual merit  Our understanding of nature rests heavily on the laws of thermodynamics, but we still do not know know how to generalize its most important laws and its most powerful concepts, like entropy, when a system is driven far away from equilibirum. This project investigated, with measurements and simulations, the motion of individual DNA molecules inside nanofluidic channels with arrays of nanoscale pits. A long DNA polymer is a statistical object because it is flexible, and the thermal agitation of the water molecules that surround it cause it to randomly adopt a multitude of different coiled configurations. As a DNA molecule perfoms Brownian motion within a nanofluidic channel, it gathers in regions where it can adopt the most configurations, which corresponds to its greatest state of entropy.  We created nanofluidic channels with nanoscale pits, because the extra space available inside those pits allows more DNA configurations, and hence traps DNA molecules. Furthermore, by pushing liquid through the nanofluidic channels containing DNA molecules, we could drive them as far away from equilibrium as we pleased, and then measure their motion by staining them with a fluorescent dye and tracking them using a fluorescence optical miscroscope.  Our measurements demonstrated that DNA molecules exhibit a phenomenon called "giant acceleration of diffusion" when they are driven over an array of nanopits.  This result is significant because giant acceleration of diffusion is one of the few nonequilibrium phenomena for which an exact, analytical theoretical prediction exists. We were able to compare our measurements with the theoretical predictions in a system that was driven far from equilibrium.   Nonequilibrium phenomena are an important frontier of physics because there is no clear way to generalize the concepts and principles of thermodynamics to systems that are driven out of equilibrium.  What does entropy even mean to a system not given enough time to sample the available microstates? By combining our experiments with molecular dynamics simulations through a collaboration, we could paint a detailed picture of how a DNA molecule's dynamics were related to the configurations it was sampling under an applied pressure.   This project also explored a different nonequilibrium phenomenon called stochastic resonance, whereby a DNA molecule's hopping between two adjacent nanopits becomes maximally synchronized to a weak, back-and-forth driving force with the addition of an optimal aount of added white noise.   This project also enabled the development of new techniques for analyzing the genetic content of single DNA molecules. Molecules that were trapped entropically in long trenches were subjected to multiple sequence-specific chemical interrogations, including restriction digests and fluorescent, in-situ hybridization probes.  Finally, this project enabled the experimental discovery of a new noise-driven transport phenomenon that we call "viscophoresis", because it manifests as the drift of a small, diffusing object in a gradient of fluid viscosity.

Broader Impacts  The nanofluidic technology we developed in this project, which we call "free energy landscaping", enables control over single DNA molecules.
