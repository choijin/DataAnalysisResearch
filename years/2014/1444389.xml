<AbstractNarration>This project will foster collaborations between physicists, mathematicians and neuroscientists to generate theoretical frameworks and statistical tools to interpret genomic, anatomical and physiological data on brain function. A community of researchers will be built through development of a seminar series for discussions of problems in which the theoretical approaches of physics, mathematics and statistics can be brought to be bear on specific research questions regarding neural systems. In addition, a set of pilot projects will be funded to foster collaborations between mathematicians, physicists and neuroscientists. Specific pilot projects will use the techniques of theoretical physics to address problems of understanding large scale functional anatomical connectivity, with the objective of identifying constraints on the distance and pattern of inter-areal connectivity in the human brain. Pilot projects will also develop a theoretical framework for understanding neural activity on different time scales during behavior, with the objective of understanding the unifying neural principles underlying human memory behavior over time scales from seconds to minutes to hours. Pilot projects will also develop mathematical and statistical techniques to identify molecular networks underlying specific features of neural function, with the objective of identifying specific network modules in the prefrontal cortex. These pilot projects will provide example interactions that can be expanded to further build a community of interaction of physicists, mathematicians and neuroscientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The maturation of scientific fields such as physics required the development of sophisticated theoretical frameworks to account for experimental phenomena at multiple different scales of analysis ranging from particle physics to condensed matter physics to astrophysics. The maturation of neuroscience as a field will require similarly sophisticated theoretical frameworks that effectively account for data at the different levels including the genomic, physiological and behavioral levels. Current theories of single neuron function have not yet been effectively extended to address physiological phenomena at the circuit and population level or the behavioral function of these network dynamics. The pilot projects in this grant will attempt to develop theoretical frameworks for addressing these multiple levels of analysis. The intellectual merit of the proposal will be the application of mathematical and statistical techniques to the interpretation of neuroscience data, including the development of theoretical models to account for existing data and to guide the design of future experiments. The field of neuroscience needs more extensive development of a theoretical framework for understanding the structure and function of neural systems at different levels, including genomic, physiological and behavioral. Successful interactions in the pilot projects could provide a model for further interaction of physicists, mathematicians, and neuroscientists throughout the field. More specifically, these pilot projects will provide a framework for development of new theories for analyzing the connectivity patterns of neural systems, the dynamics of brain function underlying behavior, and the molecular networks underlying these neural properties. The resources provided by this grant will serve to recruit additional mathematicians and physicists to address relevant questions concerning brain function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Mathematical Biology program in the Division of Mathematical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  The last several decades have seen an explosion of experimental data at multiple levels of investigation in neuroscience, but theoretical work has not kept pace in all the different scales of analysis. Successful research in computational neuroscience has developed models of the complex membrane potential dynamics of individual neurons. However, there has been less success in development of accepted theoretical approaches at different scales ranging from the genomic and molecular scale to the scale of whole brain function. Indeed, fundamental challenges are posed by the sheer volume of data now available across scales and the problem of gleaning understanding from that data into the nature of the complex interactions within and across scales of the biology of the brain.

These include pilot projects by Prof. Doug Rosene, Prof. Gene Stanley, Prof. Richard Myers, Prof. Eric Kolaczyk and Prof. Marc Howard.  The intellectual merit of these pilot projects is discussed first, followed by a brief summary of their broader impacts.  Project 1. In the project done by Joao Dos Santos and overseen by Prof. Gene Stanley and Prof. Doug Rosene, the grant has supported the development of a fully automated recognition algorithm of the ultrastructure of axons connecting brain cells within the cortex as shown in electron microscopy data. This allowed the identification of myelinated axon positions and shape as well as identifying the surrounding myelin sheath. The added recognition of the myelin sheath surrounding the myelinated axons allows them to measure quantities such as the thickness of the myelin sheaths.   Project 2. In the project done by Adam Labadorf with Prof. Eric Kolaczyk and Prof. Richard Myers, the grant supported results of differential expression analysis within each of the datasets about messenger RNA from human patients with either Huntington?s Disease (HD) or Parkinson?s Disease (PD). Published results from the grant address the differential expression analysis within each of the miRNA and mRNA sequencing datasets for both HD and PD. For HD, they found strong evidence of a massive immune response, a novel neuro-developmental gene signature in the mRNA dataset. For PD, differentially abundant mRNAs are enriched for mitochondrial function involved in cell metabolism, genes responsible for regulating protein folding and neuroinflammation.  Project 3. In the project done by Karthik Shankar and Inderdeep Singh with Prof. Marc Howard, they have developed a detailed model for function translation in neural circuits, an important cognitive operation. They have derived constraints for a model of translation in the Laplace domain and compared the properties of the resulting theoretical model to the theta phase precession of the action potential firing of hippocampal neurons relative to the theta rhythm oscillations in the local field potential.  Finally, they initiated development of a set of general operators, including translation and cross-correlation that could be used to build a library of cognitive operations.  Future work combining these operations in different sequences could enhance understanding of cognitive operations in the brain.   Broader impacts:  The seminar series and pilot projects have developed a community of students trained in both state-of-the art physics and neurobiology.  These students will be uniquely positioned to continue this effort for the decades to come.  In project 1, the development of techniques for identification of the axons that provide connections between brain cells and their surrounding myelin insulation has supported analysis of changes in myelination with aging and will support the tracing of the connectivity between cortical regions essential to theoretical understanding of brain function.  In project 2, the analysis of the messenger RNA in Parkinson?s disease and Huntingston?s disease provide important clues about the potential disease processes, including the potential role of the inflammation of neural circuits.  In project 3, the analysis of neural circuits for translation provides important links between sets of neurophysiological data and potential mechanisms for cognitive operations that could lead to future work elucidating the essential component mechanisms of cognitive function.
