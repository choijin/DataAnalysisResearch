<AbstractNarration>Tuskegee University, Auburn University and Alabama State University will collaborate to create the Tuskegee Alliance to Forge Pathways to Academic Careers (T-PAC).  This project was created in response to the NSF?s Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program solicitation (NSF 14-505) for the AGEP-Transformation (AGEP-T) track.  The AGEP-T track targets strategic alliances of institutions and organizations to develop, implement, and study innovative evidence-based models and standards for STEM graduate education, postdoctoral training, and academic STEM career preparation that eliminate or mitigate negative factors and promote positive practices for URMs.  The T-PAC project will develop, implement, study, and evaluate a model of STEM graduate education focusing on underrepresented minorities (URMs) who are U.S. citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed AGEP-T project will be unique and will have potential to contribute to foundational knowledge about how two Historically Black Universities that focus on baccalaureate degree production will collaborate with a research university to develop, implement and study a model of graduate education and comprehensive professional development for URM graduate students in STEM.  The project will also emphasize on-line instruction and professional development.   The lessons learned as this project progresses, and the ultimate results from the work, will provide information that will be beneficial to educators, administrators and policymakers, as well as the general public.</AbstractNarration>

The Alliance?s rationale to promote careers in the Professoriate is motivated by the drastic lack of diversity that exists in this sector.  The novelty of the T-PAC model lies in the establishment of both virtual and traditional (face 2 face) communities of historically underrepresented STEM doctoral students in their preparation process and engaging them in structured and intentional professional development activities that enhanced professional identity and fostered a sense of belonging in the STEM community.

Project findings suggest that through the combination of academic, social and professional support provided by T-PAC interventions, T-PAC doctoral students are better prepared, having gained skills-sets in many areas of teaching and research (e.g. pedagogy, literature searching, technical writing, proposal development) and in their ability to mitigate the personal challenges that are often experienced by graduate students and early career faculty (e.g. stress, study-work-life balance).
