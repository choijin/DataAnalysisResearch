<AbstractNarration>This grant will help ensure that the U.S. maintains an internationally competitive workforce related to the science and technology of short but intense pulses of light. The funding from this grant will be used to support the registration fees of students and postdocs so they can attend the 2014 Multiphoton Processes Gordon Research Conference (the 17th in a series of biennial conferences), which will be held June 15-20, 2014 at Bentley University in Waltham, MA.  This well-established international conference remains vibrant due to continuing advances in atomic, molecular, optical, and chemical (AMOC) science and related technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2014 meeting is structured around contributed posters and 8 sessions of invited talks that will focus on topics at the forefront of AMOC science including: High Harmonic Spectroscopy; Attosecond Electron Dynamics; ATI and Photoelectrons; Strong Field Processes and Sources; Photoionization delay; X-Ray Imaging; and Free-Electron Laser Experiment and Theory. The broad range of expertise and perspectives among attendees provides a unique and stimulating environment for the development of new ideas in these rapidly evolving areas.</AbstractNarration>
