<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2014 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Alison B. Miller is "Arithmetic Invariant Theory and Knot Invariants." The host institution for the fellowship is Harvard University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Benedict Gross.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ My NSF postdoctoral grant supported me as I explored the interplay between number theory and knot theory.  I deepened my understanding of both subjects, and made a key breakthrough that allowed me to succesfully use Bhargava's methods to count Sp_{2g}-orbits on quadratic forms, and thereby also count Seifert pairings and high-dimensional Seifert surfaces.  This breakthrough is also applicable to attack other, similar, questions of interest to me, regarding integer adjoint orbits for other groups.  Various aspects of my plan ended up being more ambitious than I realized, with the result that my paper on counting Sp_{2g}-orbits is still in preparation as of January 2020, but I expect to post it on the arXiv later this year.  (I have also since posted a preprint, based on material from my Ph.D. thesis but rewritten after the end of my NSF time, about using binary quadratic forms to obtain asymptotics for knots.)  I benefited from the academic environment of Harvard, and appreciated that the NSF postdoc gave me time to focus on research.  Unfortunately, Benedict Gross was not around Harvard as much as I'd hoped (he retired and relocated midway through my time there), but I was also able to have fruitful conversations with Barry Mazur as well as others in the Harvard math department.
