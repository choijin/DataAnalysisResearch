<AbstractNarration>Computer systems that combine traditional processors with powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the standard in all platforms ranging from cloud servers, to laptops and tablets, and even cell phones.  GPUs can yield performance or energy savings of up to 300x through their unique design.  However, developing applications to exploit these systems is a difficult challenge, requiring specialized hardware expertise and tedious performance optimizations that make them unusable by a large fraction of software developers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To overcome this challenge, this project will explore the commercialization opportunities for a source-to-source optimization system that transparently generates high performance software for heterogeneous computer systems.   This I-CORPS team has developed an automatic parallelization tool called Mistos that can help programmers write code for these high performance systems.  With Mistos, programmers need to only focus on functionality, rather than hardware details and performance tuning.  Mistos will enable users of all kinds of computing platforms, including mobile application developers, cloud services, and members of the scientific community, the ability to harness the computing power of heterogeneous GPU systems in a seamless and efficient manner.</AbstractNarration>

Using graphics cards for general-purpose computations can result in performance gains of up to 300 times over traditional processing methods. However, developing software to effectively utilize the massive computational power of graphics cards requires substantial programmer effort and knowledge, thereby hindering the adoption of these computing devices for non-graphics applications. The Michigan Source-to-Source compiler (Mistos) system developed new compiler technologies to alleviate these programming challenges by automatically generating high performance programs for graphics cards.  The goal of this project was to investigate the commercialization opportunities for the Mistos technology with the ultimate goal of determining a go, no-go decision on whether the creation of a business could be successful. To accomplish this goal, the team interviewed 125 potential customers from more than 30 technology and manufacturing companies to understand whether the Mistos technology would be useful and how it could be best provided.  Ultimately, the team concluded that the technology has strong commercial value.  However, the technology needs to expand beyond the graphics card to cloud computing in order to have maximum commercial impact.  The team is now moving forward with creating and launching a new business in the cloud computing area as a result of the I-Corps program.
