<AbstractNarration>This I/UCRC Fundamental Research Program project plans to research the adaptation of in-situ self-calibration methods developed for interferometric measurement of optical surfaces to measurement of freeform optical surfaces on precision coordinate measuring machines (CMMs). In optics manufacturing, a fundamental measurement is a map of surface errors, a hit map which is used to perform corrective polishing. This project will develop calculation methods that evaluate the uncertainty point-wise in that map and enable the estimation of the uncertainty in any parametric description of the error map. Methods developed in ultraprecision interferometric metrology will be applied to contact measurement of complex optical surfaces. The result will enable new optical surface shapes to be measured, and hence made, thus opening up new design space that researchers on CeFO faculty and elsewhere can explore productively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freeform optics represent a transformative opportunity, enabling compact, light,&lt;br/&gt;high resolution infra-red imaging systems that can have broad application from automotive to manufacturing process control, defense and disaster relief.  The fundamental metrology knowledge will be developed with member companies of the Center for Freeform Optics, ensuring rapid technology transfer and uptake of new methods.  The work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry members of the center and has the potential to extend the center's portfolio while potentially attracting new members. Research results will be integrated into the PI's undergraduate manufacturing class, where high tech optics inspire interest.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Freeform optics are a new class of optical surfaces that enable a revolution in optical systems design, allowing compact folded designs that can be many times smaller than conventional designs but with equal or higher performance.  Special ty machines can make these complex surfaces in short run production. Equally flexible, accurate, quality assurance methods are lacking.  High precision mechanical components are frequently measured on Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs) which make tactile measurements &ndash; point by point &ndash; of the surface.  The resulting measurement is the shape of the surface plus the positioning errors of the machine. This project has shown that the uncertainty of this measurement can be reduced by an in situ self-calibration of the positioning  errors of the CMM over the machine volume used in the measurement.  The traditional approach to correcting measuring machine errors is to calibrate the machine, typically annually, using external measurement methods to "calibrate" the entire machine working volume. One limitation of this approach is that the errors of the machine are assumed to be unchanging between calibrations.  Another limitation is that the time taken for the calibration is driven by the data density required and the size of the entire machine work volume.  If the machine errors are stable enough over the time taken to make a carefully chosen series of measurements of the part in multiple orientations within a subset of the CMM?s working volume, this information can be used to cancel out the machine errors from the measurement.  An approach using a combination of rotational positions and lateral shears ("shift-rotation method") was demonstrated numerically.  A freeform optic test part was fabricated using a magneto rheological finishing  tool at UNC Charlotte; slopes were deliberately limited to allow a full aperture measurement using convention interferometry. The part was measured using a micro-CMM (Zeiss F-25) and an area profilometer (Mahr LD 260 with auxiliary air bearing cross-slide and rotary table), using the shift rotation method. Agreement in the two methods for the dominant error in the surface was within 35 nm.  Comparison of the two tactile measurements (corrected using the shift rotation method) and the interferometric  measurement show good correlation in the reported shape of the optical surface. The rms (root mean square) of the surface heights reported by the interferometric measurement is significantly larger (~90 nm) than the two tactile measurements. This, however, is before correction for systematic errors in the optical measurement (on-going work).          Last Modified: 01/29/2018       Submitted by: Christopher Evans]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
