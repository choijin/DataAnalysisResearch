<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a three year standard award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site program at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis entitled, "Research Experiences for Teacher Advancement In Nanotechnology) for Green Energy and Technology (RETAIN)", under the direction of Dr. Maher E. Rizkalla.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Establishing an RET site at IUPUI will provide pedagogical training and assistance to STEM teachers within the school districts that comprise metro Indianapolis. Participation will enhance teacher development through graduate course credits and infuse STEM curricula with inquiry-based methodology in order to generate STEM interest among students.  More importantly, due to the multidisciplinary nature of nanotechnology, trained teachers will be equipped to integrate multiple STEM subjects into their curriculum providing students with subject-to-subject connectivity comparable to real-world collaborative expectations. This program complements IUPUI's undergraduate nanotechnology-track, funded through an NSF Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) award, by investing in Indiana's K-12 community to ultimately produce graduates with interest and college-ready skills for success in nanotechnology-related degree programs.  The proposed framework provides a portable model that can be implemented at other institutions and teaching modules that can be implemented on a national level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Integrated Nanosystems Development Institute (INDI) at IUPUI proposes to establish RETAIN an immersive research and training program in the multidisciplinary field of nanotechnology for a total of 30 (10 per year) Indiana high school teachers from high needs, metropolitan school districts, for six weeks during the summer.  RETAIN will offer participants: 1) knowledge of topics and careers in nanotechnology; 2) hands-on laboratory experiences in inquiry-based science; 3) participant-designed teaching modules developed to meet existing state and national science standards; 4) connection to a professional network of teachers and scientists as well as on-site RETAIN support during module implementation; and 5) professional development and college credit programming. Annually, five refined teaching modules will be disseminated on the Hoosier Association of Science Teachers, I-STEM Network, and TeachEngineering websites. The two major goals of RETAIN are: 1) Train 30 high school teachers (from high-needs metropolitan school districts) in inquiry and discovery-based science from hypothesis development and experimental design to data collection and dissemination of results, while introducing STEM concepts, applications, and careers options. 2) Integrate RETAIN content into high school classrooms by translating research experiences into 15 (five per year) inquiry-based, nanotechnology teaching modules designed to boost excitement and student interest in the STEM disciplines and careers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>At Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), the<em> Integrated Nanosystems Development Institute</em> (INDI) established an RET-site entitled Research Experiences for Teacher Advancement In Nanotechnology (RETAIN). This immersive research and professional development program had two primary goals: 1) Training high school teachers (from high-needs metropolitan school districts) in inquiry and discovery-based science, while introducing new STEM concepts, applications, and careers options; and 2) Integrating RETAIN content into high school classrooms by training teachers to translate their research experiences into nanotechnology classroom learning modules designed to excite students and increase interest in STEM disciplines and future career opportunities, particularly in communities with traditionally underrepresented students. In order to meet these goals, the structure of RETAIN consisted of two parts: real-world nanotechnology research (~80%) and pedagogical graduate coursework (~20%) designed to educate teachers on methods and strategies to successfully create and implement new nanotechnology content into their classroom.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>RETAIN has consisted of a 6-week summer program with academic-year post camp support. It offered participants: 1) knowledge of topics and careers in nanotechnology; 2) hands-on laboratory experiences in inquiry-based science; 3) training and graduate credit programming in creating classroom learning modules that meet state and national science standards; 4) on-site support during teachers? implementation of newly-developed learning modules; and 5) connection to a professional network of teachers, scientists, and industry professionals that could be used as resources. RETAIN engaged a total of 27 teachers (67%female and 33% minority) representing a diverse group composed new and pre-service teachers to those with over 20 yrs of experience. Moreover, the multidisciplinary focus area of nanotechnology has applications in nearly every sector, allowing it to impact teachers across STEM fields and providing teachers a means of creating subject-to-subject connectivity. As a result, participating teachers taught classes ranging from biology,&nbsp; chemistry,&nbsp; environmental&nbsp; science,&nbsp; physics, earth science,&nbsp; environmental earth&nbsp; and&nbsp; space science, biomedical science, algebra, geometry, computer coding, robotics, Project Lead the Way, and integrated chemistry and physics. Importantly, all but four taught at metropolitan high schools designated as ?high needs? with large populations of low-socioeconomic and traditionally underrepresented students. IUPUI?s urban placement has allowed RETAIN to established strong partnerships with six surrounding school districts, which have an average minority student population of 70%. These partnerships have not only strengthened campus relationships with surrounding high schools, but have also been used as valuable recruitment tools for other NSF-funded campus programming.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>During the summers, these participants undertook research projects that spanned nanotechnology for biological and energy applications, with examples that included: Smart Breath Nanosensors for Diabetes Monitoring to Graphene/Nanocarbon-based Li-ion Batteries. Here, participating teachers worked in dynamic labs alongside graduate students, undergraduate students (including NSF-REU participants) and high school students. At the close of summer, teachers presented their research findings at a campus wide summer symposium open to the general public. Further, two teachers earned authorship in scientific journal publications. Program evaluation data revealed that all teachers highly rated their research experiences, noted enhanced self-efficacy in collaboration and scientific inquiry skills, and voiced satisfaction on how they could use nanotechnology as an exciting platform capable of connecting different topics in their existing curriculum and creating new content they felt would strongly grab students? attention.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Together, research coupled with professional development programming significantly increased teachers? confidence in nano-related knowledge, their ability to integrate it into their curriculum, and their understanding of nano-related career opportunities and educational pathways (reported through surveys and interviews with an external evaluator). RETAIN teachers created and implemented new nanotechnology-focus learning modules into their classrooms, where on-site observation and survey data showed increases in both students? STEM attitudes and their understanding of careers and academic pathways. A total of 39 RETAIN teacher-developed classroom learning modules have been disseminated on Amazon Inspire (identified by participants as a leading resource) and several others have been submitted to Teach Engineering. Notably, teachers have continued implementing their modules over the years, with early participants indicating that they have consistently conducted their modules for the last 3-4 years. Moreover, continued follow-up revealed that some continued to create additional nanotechnology-focused modules outside of RETAIN. Each RETAIN teacher provides their module/s to an average of 200 students/yr (some individual teachers who have been conducting them for several years claim to have now reached 700-1200 students).&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>RETAIN has inspired teachers. Two participants later enrolled in Master?s programs at IUPUI. Many others have worked to have worked to mentor their peers, leading workshops on integrating nanotechnology into the classroom at regional teaching conferences. In the final evaluation report, the external evaluator concluded that <em>?Overwhelmingly, respondents agreed that RETAIN provided them with important information that would positively impact their students as well as potentially impact their students? career choices,?</em> and that ?<em>The RETAIN program is preparing science teachers in a meaningful way.?</em></p><br> <p>            Last
