<AbstractNarration>Stellar halos, the roughly spherical clould of stars orbiting a spiral galaxy, provide unique insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies, and they may hold the key to understanding dark matter.  From our position inside the Milky Way, we are unable to fully probe our own halo, because much of it is blocked from our view.  M31 (the "Andromeda Galaxy") is near enough that we can measure properties of individual stars in its halo.  This program will utilize existing data and obtain new observations of M31 in order to map the distribution star ages throughout its halo.  This will permit them to determine the relative importance of several different mechanisms that can add stars to a galaxy halo.  Ultimately, this will lead to a better understanding of the history of our own Milky Way galaxy.  This program will create opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate student research at two institutions. The University of Virginia group works with amateur astronomers on galaxy evolution research projects and outreach programs to K-12 students in rural Virginia. The University of California - Santa Cruz team teaches underrepresented high school students through the COSMOS, MAGIC, and the Science Internship Programs. Both of the PIs teach large undergraduate courses, actively mentor students, give regular public lectures and speak in K-12 classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will create the first age-distribution profile of the M31 stellar halo.  This work leverages an enormous investment of telescope time over the past 10 years (the SPLASH project) and aims to add two significant new parameters: metallicity and age distributions.  Three new observational methods will be applied, including a near infrared imaging survey across the M31 halo out to a distance of 180 kpc, optical time series of anomalous Cepheids in M31 satellite galaxies, and Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy of M31 field and dSph stars.  This work leverages an enormous investment of telescope time over the past 10 years (the SPLASH project) and aims to add two significant new parameters: metallicity and age distributions.</AbstractNarration>

This new phase of SPLASH had as a goal to discern better the age distribution of the M31 halo by looking for its youngest stars &ndash; those expected to have formed in the last major epoch of star formation in the M31 satellite galaxy system and associated halo substructure.  This epoch is thought to lie in the "intermediate" age range best probed by several species of stellar tracers &ndash; Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, Anomalous Cepheid (AC) stars and young globular clusters.  Observational programs were developed to explore these tracers in M31 and its satellite galaxies.  Because near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams provide a particularly potent means to identify AGB stars, a large database of deep, multicolor, wide-field near-infrared images of M31 were collected through a long term project on the Mayall 4-m telescope.   These data were supplemented with moderate-resolution optical spectra collected by the SPLASH collaboration using the Keck telescope.

A third type of AGB star, the M-type, was found in four M31 dwarf ellipticals, two M31 dwarf spheroidals, and four halo fields containing debris from the large halo substructure, the Great Southern Stream.  From the ratio of C to M type AGB stars metallicities have been determined for the associated stellar populations.     Time series photometric data were also obtained of the M31 satellites to search for the rare AC variables, but unfortunately none were identified, in part because the data obtained were ultimately not of sufficient quality for this task.  On the other hand, several ancillary benefits were derived from the combined SPLASH photometric and spectroscopic databases:  (1) From derived stellar radial velocities the line-of-sight velocity dispersion profile was derived for the smooth stellar halo of Andromeda over a huge range of projected radii (8-130 kpc), after accounting for foreground contamination of the Milky Way and substructure in the M31 halo using population "mixture models".  The smooth M31 halo was found to have a shallow velocity dispersion decline, in marked comparison to similar profiles estimated from tracers of the Milky Way halo.   (2) The enlarged SPLASH database, supplemented with high resolution infrared spectra from the APOGEE survey, enabled several new studies of a Milky Way structure, the Triangulum-Andromeda (TriAnd) overdensity, originally discovered in the foreground of M31 via SPLASH optical imaging.

This TriAnd work represents an exciting and unanticipated increase in understanding of our own Milky Way coming, in part, from the funded M31 project.  (3) Another outgrowth of this research was inspired by APOGEE observations of star cluster candidates in M31 and M33, a dwarf spiral galaxy satellite of M31, by team members.
