<AbstractNarration>This is funding to support travel for a diverse group of U.S. PhD students and distinguished faculty mentors to participate in a doctoral colloquium (workshop) on research on information science that will be co-located with the 2014 iConference to be held March 4-7 in Berlin, Germany, and jointly hosted by the Berlin School of Library and Information Science at Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin and the Royal School of Library and Information Science at the University of Copenhagen.  The iConferences, the annual meetings of the iSchool community (cf. http://ischools.org/ for more information) are a leading forum that brings together faculty, students, research staff, and industry practitoners with a common interest in supporting and augmenting human engagement with information and technology.  Open to broad participation, the iConferences have been successful in building a sense of community around the information field, bringing together people who otherwise might rarely interact with one another, and helping them share findings and exchange views relating to their interdisciplinary research.  More information about the 2014 iConference may be found online at http://ischools.org/theiconference/call-for-participation/. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2014 iConference Doctoral Colloquium, which will take place on March 7, 2014 (the final day of the iConference), will be a day long research-focused meeting of approximately 35 selected PhD candidates studying all aspects of information science (IS) together with 12 distinguished mentors (NSF funds will be used to support 16 student participants from U.S. institutions).  The primary objective of the Doctoral Colloquium is to help train the next generation of information science researchers.  To this end, it will provide the student participants with an environment in which they can share and discuss their goals, methods and results at an early stage of their research.  By participating in the doctoral colloquium, students will gain feedback on their work both from the mentors and from other students, which should allow them to enhance their research.  Students will also develop a better understanding of the different research communities engaged in the study of information science, and learn how to position their work within the IS community.  In addition, the colloquium will provide students with opportunities to make new professional connections beyond their own disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The iConference doctoral colloquia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of researchers in information science and related areas, allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.  Participation is encouraged from a broad range of relevant disciplines and approaches, thereby broadening attendees' perspectives on their topics of study and promoting advancement of the field.  No more than one student will be accepted from any given institution, and priority will be given to students who have not previously attended an iConference Doctoral Colloquium.  The organizers will proactively work to include women and minority representation among the student participants to the extent possible.  As a consequence of these steps, the student and faculty participants will constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, which will help broaden the students' horizons to the future benefit of the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Report on the 2014 iConference Doctoral Research Colloquium Sponsored by the National Science Foundation Prepared by Karen E. Fisher, The Information School, University of Washington Gloria Mark, Professor, Department of Informatics, University of California-Irvine Jens-Erik Mai, Professor, Information School, University of Copenhagen, Denmark  In March 2014, the iSchools Caucus held its ninth iConference in Berlin, Germany, host by the Berlin School of Library and Information Science at Humboldt-Universit&auml;t zu Berlin, with the program run by the Royal School of Library and Information Science, University of Copenhagen. The iConference brings together faculty, students, research staff, and industry researchers who share an interest in supporting and augmenting human engagements with information and technology. As at previous iConferences, a research colloquium of 24 promising doctoral students and 12 distinguished research faculty mentors was held in conjunction with the event.  PhD students were recruited to the iConference Doctoral Colloquim who represented the breadth of the growing iSchools membership and were at varied stages of their studies. Participation was encouraged by students and mentors from across the iSchools and provided continuity of research, intellectual work, and academic culture to the next generation of researchers and practitioners in the field.  The outcomes of the 2014 Doctoral Colloquium were:  Building a cohort of new      researchers who will have a network of junior and senior colleagues spread      out across the world in different settings. Illustrating the interrelationships      and diversity of the information field, and the various modes of inquiry      involved in research in the field. Helping new researchers      address the challenges and opportunities of interdisciplinarity, and what      it implies for undertaking research, collaborating, publishing, explaining      oneÆs work to diverse audiences, and situating oneself within      organizations/industry, government, and departments. Guiding the work of the new      researchers by having the experts in the research field &ndash; including      government and industry &ndash; give advice. Making it possible for      promising new entrants in the field to attend the Conference. Making the new entrantsÆ experience      at the Conference an enjoyable and rewarding one, from the outset engaging      them at a reception and continuing with other activities that culminate in      the Doctoral Colloquium, as well as encouraging them to return and submit      papers, panels, posters, etc. to future conferences. Helping inform faculty and      other mentors about the concerns of doctoral students by creating a      supportive environment for discussion. Exploring the complexities      of the job market. Currently it can be difficult to secure a position,      even though our graduates have been very successful. It is important that      new researchers learn how to market themselves and explain the skills and      approaches that they bring. Information Schools are not in the business of      simply creating Ph.D.Æs to be hired by other iSchools. Our graduates also gain      positions in other departments, in corporate research laboratories and in      professional information management positions. Understanding the      complexity and diversity of the hiring market and how to navigate it is a      critical skill. Helping students figure out      their places in the profession. The iConference is notable for its      collaborative and information-sharing nature. It is not just a place to      present, but is also a place to share ideas and start conversations that      can lead to grant proposals, joint teaching and research initiatives, and      other opportunities. The Doctoral Colloquium serves as a way to help      students to make a transition from a junior position to a peer who      participates in this collaborative activity.       ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
