<AbstractNarration>This study explores the effects of the Post-9/11 GI Bill and leverages several features of the benefit expansion to examine three questions of general interest in the areas of labor economics, public economics, and industrial organization. First, what is the effect of financial aid on older students? Second, does in-kind financial aid result in individuals choosing to enroll in more expensive (plausibly higher quality) institutions; and, if so, does this shift result in increased educational attainment? And, finally, what is the economic incidence of targeted federal financial aid (i.e., do colleges adjust institutional aid to offset the subsidy)? The study involves the creation of a unique panel of data on all recent active duty individuals from the Department of Defense linked with detailed post-secondary data from the state of Virginia and the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC). This will be the first dataset of its kind in terms of the detailed year by year information on military choices and post-military educational decisions and outcomes. The researchers will use difference-in-differences, triple difference, and regression discontinuity empirical approaches to answer these questions.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research aims to contribute to the academic literature on the effects of financial aid on individuals and institutions, the effect of in-kind versus conditional cash transfers for education, and the economic incidence of targeted subsidies to enrollment in higher education.  While the literature on the enrollment effects of financial aid on traditional students is quite developed, the effects on non-traditional students and the effects of financial aid and school match on attainment are open questions. This will be the first study of federal financial aid that uses both over time and across state variation in the degree of benefit expansion.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to specific interest in military veterans, the analyses will contribute to a better understanding of how to tailor existing and future financial aid programs to better achieve their goals.  &lt;br/&gt;Understanding the role that the Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits play in potentially helping hundreds of thousands of veterans, the vast majority of whom are first-generation students, go to and stay in college is critical in evaluating the mark this GI Bill will leave sixty years after the original GI Bill that contributed to a near doubling of college enrollment in less than a decade, and is credited as a driving force behind the creation of the modern middle class. Helping individuals to reenter civilian life successfully or invest in additional skills to advance their military careers has large national security implications. Despite the clear import of this topic there is essentially no information available. This project makes an important step in filling the gap.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Noted historian Sidney Burrell argued that the World War II GI Bill brought about "what may have been the most important educational and social transformation in American history."  It contributed to a near doubling of college enrollment in less than a decade, and it is widely credited as a driving force behind the creation of the modern middle class.  The Post-9/11 GI Bill of 2009, the largest expansion in veteran educational benefits since the original GI Bill, could cause another such educational and social transformation. The NSF SBE DDRIG funded my project to explore the effects of the Post-9/11 GI Bill as part of my dissertation research.  Understanding the role that the Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits play in potentially helping hundreds of thousands of veterans, the vast majority of whom are first-generation students, go to and stay in college is critical in evaluating the effect of the GI Bill.  Despite the clear import of this topic to Congress, the president, the military, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, there was essentially no information available prior to the start of this project.  As Senator Harkin noted in 2014, "it remains impossible for anyone other than the companies and colleges &hellip;to determine how veterans are performing" (Harkin 2014).   This project has provided a first look at the enrollment, persistence, and educational attainment of recent veterans and explore how the Post-9/11 GI Bill has affected those outcomes.  In order to do this, I created a unique panel of data from the Department of Defense on all recent active duty individuals.  I linked these data with detailed post-secondary data from the state of Virginia and the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC).  Through this linking, I created a unique dataset containing detailed year-by-year information on military choices and post-military educational decisions and outcomes.  The data have enabled me to provide: (1) a first look at the postsecondary trajectories of recent veterans across the country, (2) an evaluation of how the recent expansion in veteransÆ education benefits, the Post-9-11 GI Bill, has affected veteransÆ choices and degree attainment, and (3) an exploration of what factors magnify or attenuate effect of the benefit expansion on veteran student success.   Preliminary results suggest that veterans are doing better in college than many media reports have suggested.  The money provided by the Post-9/11 GI Bill has increased the likelihood that veterans will persist in college and graduate.  However, veterans appear to be substantially less responsive to additional resources than traditional students, perhaps as a result of the relatively high levels of financial available to them prior to the benefit expansion.  Although incentives embedded in the Post-9/11 GI Bill have resulted in veterans attending more expensive colleges, it is not clear that they are choosing higher quality colleges.  As I move forward, I will finalize the results of these analyses and I will also investigate whether the new GI Bill funds are crowding out other forms of financial aid.  Finally, I will promote my findings through new centers at the University of Virginia and Texas A&amp;M.  These centers, partnerships with West Point, will allow further analyses of these and related military issues to take place.
