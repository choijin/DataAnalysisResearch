<AbstractNarration>This project, creating a novel class of magnetically-controlled, mobile microrobots with two-dimensional vision-based micro-force sensing end-effectors, has the potential to advance both the state of the art in microrobots and the state-of-the-art in biological cell micromanipulation. By combining advanced mobile manipulation microrobots with a MEMS-based micro-force sensor, a novel, transformative tool for future advancements in mechanobiology and automated biomanipulation will result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The end-effectors of the proposed mobile microbots consist of micro-compliant mechanisms with custom-designed force-deflection characteristics whose deformations are observed with a camera attached to an optical microscope. The grippers will be fabricated along with a soft magnetic microrobot body and therefore controllable with external magnetic field gradients. These micro-force sensing mobile microrobots will have real-time micro-force-control manipulation capabilities specifically tailored for mechanobiology and automated biomanipulation tasks. A portable Ã¬Bio-Robotics test-bed, designed to fit comfortably around both inverted optical or confocal microscopes, is proposed to facilitate outreach and future collaborative research. Finally, a series of proof-of-concept application studies related to single cell and biomaterial adhesion and cell characterization will be conducted to showcase the efficacy of the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Advances in mechanobiology and automated biomanipulation enabled by this proposal will directly impact the healthcare of many. The research and educational/outreach efforts of this proposal will impact students from the high school to the graduate levels. Student teams will participate in an international mobile microrobotic competition, as well as the ASME Student Mechanism and Robot Design Competition, to stimulate students' interests in undergraduate research. Local elementary and high school students will be enriched through the Stevens' Center for Innovation in Engineering and Science Education and the Stevens Exploring Career Options in Engineering and Science program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:   In this project, a new class of wireless, micro-force sensing mobile microrobots (uFSMMs) was created.  The microrobot design consists of an integrated vision-based micro-force sensor end-effector on a magnetic mobile microrobot body and is controlled with gradient magnetic fields from a surrounding magnetic coil system. A vision system track the position of the robot and displacements of the micro-force sensor.  The stiffness of the complaint end-effector is calibrated so the tracked real-time displacements can be directly converted to real-time micro-force readings at the micro-Newton level.   The uFSMM is the first true micro-scale mobile robot with a functional end-effector with real-time, on-board sensing capabilities.  The developed manufacturing process can can tailor the stiffness values of the uFSMMs to sense forces in the range from 0 uN to 110 uN along with obtaining sub-uN force sensing resolutions along each axis in the plane.  The footprint of the uFSMMs are approximately 700 um x 1000 um.  The uFSMMs include different end-effectors designs for micromanipulation, distinct geometrical features on the outer edge of the frame of the robot along with the novel integration of colored structures in the uFSMM body as distinctive fiducials to facilitate real-time optical recognition algorithms.  This color-based tracking technique operates at 20 Hz; the average percentage error for the color-based tracking system is approximately 6% of the ground truth value. This corresponds to an average accuracy of less than +/- 1 uN.  On-line path planning around obstacles in the workspace has been implemented along with trajectory waypoint following for the uFSMMs.   The real-time force feedback information is used to guide the user to perform a host of teleoperated micromanipulation tasks in safe manner by displaying the real-time force feedback information on the screen and signaling the user when the manipulation force exceeds a pre-defined force threshold.  Experiments involving autonomous micromanipulation with real-time force control were also conducted with designed magnetic field generating testbed.  These experiments demonstrate that the real-time force information is incorporated in the control program.     Broader Impacts:  The great many applications for micro-scale robots and systems yields many potential broader impacts of this work.  Advances in mechanobiology, automated biomanipulation, life science automation, microsurgery, drug delivery, and diagnostic testing with microrobots can impact the healthcare of many.  The potential applications can result in significant impacts on mechanical control of cell and tissue development and cell-based regenerative therapies.  The experiments that have been demonstrated are of interest for those working in mechanobiology, where they study the relationship that applied forces at different times, locations, and magnitudes can have on cells as they develop. Additionally, the results can be applied to safely manipulate live cells.  Since the uFSMM is the first microrobot with an on-board sensor, it has laid the foundation for advanced research in multifunctional mobile microrobotics that can have a significant impact in the microrobotics community.  Outreach efforts associated with this project have included education and mentoring activities at the K-12, undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral levels. The PI has organized international robotics competitons to promote the STEM and microrobotics fields, as well as given guest talks, lab tours, and developed robotics modules for various K-12 groups of students.
