<AbstractNarration>Tidal marshes are productive ecosystems that provide key services to society such as storm surge buffering, and water-quality mitigation. The long-term stability of coastal wetlands is explained by interactions between sea level, plant growth, sediment supply, and wetland accretion, but coastal wetland stability is threatened by changes in environmental conditions. Sediment supply has been implicated as the ultimate control on potential vertical accretion rates in many tidal wetlands and, hence, their ability to keep pace with sea level. Human activities in watersheds have significantly altered the delivery of sediment from watersheds to the coast, and indeed there is evidence of past expansion of tidal wetlands in response to increased sediment supply. However, more recent land use change, reforestation, and dam construction have reduced sediment delivery from many watersheds to the coast. The goal of this project is to understand how past and current land use in watersheds that drain to the East Coast of the United States has altered sediment concentrations in rivers, to determine how changes in sediment supply influences sediment accumulation rates in coastal wetlands, and to project future wetland vulnerability along the East Coast under various scenarios of sea level rise and sediment supply. This information is critically needed, and will be of use to researchers, managers, and stakeholders. This collaborative project includes a strong commitment to integrate research and undergraduate education and increase diversity in the sciences. The lead institution on this project serves primarily undergraduate students, and undergraduate student summer interns and academic year thesis research students will be involved in all aspects of the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project takes the novel approach of documenting temporally-variable wetland accretion rates over the past century to evaluate changing watershed-derived sediment supply in nine estuaries along the East Coast of the United States. Land use change over the same time period will be examined in these watersheds to determine the major drivers of changing sediment supply. The investigators will test the following hypotheses: H1. Suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) have decreased in many (but not all) rivers draining to the East Coast in recent decades due to increased population densities, shifts away from agricultural land-use, and dam construction in watersheds, H2. Recent declines in fluvial SSC are reflected in lower wetland mineral accretion rates in many coastal estuarine wetlands. Geographic patterns of recent accretion rates reflect regional patterns of sediment decline, with the greatest reductions in mid-Atlantic wetlands, H3. Sediment deposition and marsh accretion will be greater in the plots with higher SSC availability and with plant trapping of SSCs. Further, due to complex ecogeomorphic feedbacks between marsh elevation, sediment deposition, and plant production, plant productivity will respond to SSC availability, and H4. Coastal wetland vulnerability to current sea level rise follows a regional pattern that reflects both the rate of relative sea level rise (highest in mid-Atlantic) and SSC (lowest in Northeast and Southeast). However, changing SSC and mineral accretion rates (greatest declines in mid-Atlantic) will alter future regional patterns of vulnerability to sea level rise.  The researchers will use innovative experiments to manipulate suspended sediment concentrations in water flooding a marsh over several years in a sediment-poor marsh system to directly evaluate rates of sediment deposition, plant growth, and marsh elevation, yielding empirical evidence for the role of sediment availability on ecogeomorphic feedback processes in marshes. These data will be used to validate, parameterize, and expand an existing model (the Marsh Equilibrium Model). The model will then be used to hindcast marsh accretion rates and to forecast marsh stability under various future scenarios of sediment availability and rates of relative sea level rise. The land use change and fluvial sediment supply analyses will be coupled with measurements of temporally-variable marsh accretion rates and modeling to provide a comprehensive examination of estuarine wetland vulnerability to sea level rise. This research will provide integrated assessment of estuarine marsh response to both sea level rise and sediment availability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The study was conducted in three Southeast estuaries: Cape Fear, NC, Edisto, SC, and Altamaha, GA to answer the following questions:  How have accretion rates in tidal wetlands changed in the past century?  What tidal wetlands are vulnerable to future sea-level rise based on in-situ and remotely sensed measurements of elevation, aboveground biomass, and soil accretion?      Field sampling was conducted in spring and summer of 2016 and 2017 to collect soil cores, measure elevation, and sample above and belowground biomass in three saline tidal marshes along the Southeast Atlantic Coast.   We used a combination of in-situ biomass measurements, and remote sensing techniques to estimate how tidal marsh biomass health and resiliency has changed over the last 32 years along our study sites. We created a time series analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and then correlated it to climate and environmental variables, as well as to changes in sediment supply across all three tidal marshes.   Our results indicate that accretion rates for cores collected in GA and SC saltmarshes are on the order of 3-4 mm yr-1, while accretion rates for cores collected in NC are on the order of 2-3.7 mm yr-1. The current rate of SLR along the Southeastern Atlantic coast is 3.2 +/- 0.3 mm yr-1 (GA and SC coast) and 2.4 +/- 0.35 mm yr-1 (Southeast NC coast) (NOAA.gov). The mean accretion rates for the three study sites indicate that marshes are keeping pace with current sea level rise. However, the RTK measurements of marsh elevation in the Cape Fear River NC suggest that it has lower elevation in tidal frame compared to SC and GA marshes. This, coupled with significant decline in the suspended sediment concentration between 1973 ? 1999, and low C sequestration, make the NC tidal marshes more susceptible to sea level rise than Georgia or South Carolina marshes.   This is supported by the remotely sensed time series analysis of tidal marshes? biomass, which reflects regional patterns of vulnerability to SLR, with greatest decline in the health of NC marshes.  The remote sensing analysis revealed that NC marshes experienced more changes in vegetation relative to GA and SC marshes over a period from 1988 to 2016.   The trend analysis showed statistically significant negative trends in biomass and in the retreat of marsh margins in NC marshes. Largest decline in biomass occurred between 1997 - 2002 and 2005 - 2015. The vegetation decline correlated with drought frequency and severity trends (Fig. 2).

We plan to submit three manuscripts that will explore coastal wetland resiliency change in response to sediment supply and sea level rise, including saltwater intrusion.  One manuscript (?Response of Tidal Wetlands to Rising Sea Level in Three Estuaries along the US Southeast Atlantic Coast?) will examine how accretion rates in coastal wetlands have responded to changes in sediment delivery and SLR over time in three coastal systems along the U.S. Southeast Coast.

The third manuscript (?Effects of chronic and acute simulated seawater intrusion on soil carbon balance and accretion in a tidal freshwater wetland?) will discuss how seawater intrusion affects the input, decomposition and accumulation of organic carbon in tidal freshwater marsh soils.  This study will add value to the work we are doing to understand how coastal wetland resiliency will change in response to anthropogenic disturbance, including salinization caused by accelerated SLR.              This research contributes to a better understanding of how land use and human disturbances will impact wetland accretion rates, and how it may influence future wetland vulnerability to sea level rise.

The combination of field and lab data collection and simulation modeling will be used to predict tidal marsh vulnerability to rising sea level based on a suite of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) global warming/SLR scenarios.   Understanding the response of marshes to changes in land use and human disturbances will inform coastal adaptive management in the face of climate change and SLR.
