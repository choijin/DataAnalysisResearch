<AbstractNarration>In elementary school one learns how to solve quadratic equations using the quadratic formula; it involves taking a certain square root.  One can also find solutions for degree three polynomials and degree four polynomials by taking radicals, but in general by the Abel-Ruffini theorem there is no formula for the roots of polynomial of degree five or higher in terms of radicals.  This theorem, first proven in the 1800's, is an indication of a profound difference between so-called solvable polynomials (those that can be solved by radicals) and nonsolvable polynomials (those that cannot be solved by radicals).  The latter are much harder to understand.  Existing techniques in the so-called Langlands program are often limited to the solvable setting.  Part of this proposal is dedicated to providing new techniques in the Langlands program that will work in nonsolvable settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though only proven in special (albeit important) cases the Langlands functoriality conjectures have become a cornerstone of modern mathematics.  The conjectures had their genesis in the area of automorphic forms, which lies at the intersection of number theory, representation theory, and harmonic analysis on Lie groups. The theory developed to understand and prove cases of the conjectures has become crucial to understanding these subjects, and has reached beyond them, leading to important applications in other areas such as topology, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.  This proposal aims to develop tools to resolve important cases of the conjectures and their analogues in other contexts.  The proposed research has two parts. First, it will investigate Langlands' so-called ``Beyond Endoscopy'' idea in settings designed to establish descent and base change of automorphic representations along nonsolvable Galois extensions. Second, it will develop relative analogues of the theory of twisted endoscopy.  This will lead to a better understanding of special cycles on Shimura varieties with a view towards establishing cases of the Tate and Beilinson-Bloch conjectures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: The Langlands functoriality conjecture is a grand unification principle in mathematics that predicts surprising ties between representation theory and arithmetic. The proof of this conjecture remains a holy grail in number theory.  The basic objects of study in the conjecture are automorphic representations, which behave a bit like fundamental particles in physics.  The functoriality conjecture predicts that when one has a map between the "dual" of two groups of symmetries then one can transfer automorphic representations from one to the other.  Over the course of the grant the PI    Obtained the first nonabelian trace formula, explicit geometric formula for the trace of a Hecke operator on the set of automorphic representations fixed by a nonsolvable group of symmetries (for example, the set of symmetries of 5 letters). Gave the best known asymptotic for the number of zeros of a quadratic form in an even number of variables.   Proved a summation formula for functions on the set of triples of vectors in three vector spaces on which three quadratic forms take the same value. Developed new versions of the Fourier transform in settings related to these summation formulae.   Broader Impacts:  The PI's work on nonabelian trace formulae inspired new results by Guralnick and Malle in finite group theory and results of Hahn in algebraic combinatorics. Given the ubiquity of the Fourier transform in science, it seems inevitable that new Fourier transforms of the type introduced by the PI will have broad applications. The PI used the work in the grant as the basis for research projects for two high school students, one female.  In addition the PI lectured at a workshop for rising high school senior women in math. The PI used the grant as the basis for undergraduate research which led to an undergraduate being invited to an international conference.   The PI presented the work widely nationally and internationally and organized several conferences to disseminate both the results obtained in the project and related work. The PI and H. Hahn are writing a book on automorphic representations for graduate students that is unique in its approach and will provide an important entry point into the PI's technically formidable, beautiful, and vital field of expertise.
