<AbstractNarration>The Catalina Sky Survey is a NASA-funded program to search for moving objects in our solar system.  The NSF-supported Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS) makes complimentary use of this same data stream to search among the fixed background stars for transient events, like supernovae and other forms of stellar explosions, and to monitor many types of variable sources.  It releases its results in real time so that they can be followed up immediately by professional and serious amateur astronomers. The CRTS is developing a new kind of scientific infrastructure: real-time mining of massive data streams coupled with dynamic follow-up strategies.  Students have opportunities to participate in hardware or software development, data mining itself, to obtain follow-up observations, and in the scientific analysis of the transient sources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date, CRTS has discovered over 6500 distinct transient events and over 13 million variable sources.  Through both formal and informal collaborations, as well as data sharing with the entire astronomical community, CRTS is enabling studies of variable stars, active galactic nuclei, the explosions that mark the endpoints in the life cycles of stars, stellar flares, cataclysmic variables and recurrent novae, planets around white dwarfs, new counterparts of gamma-ray sources, and many other interesting phenomena observable through "time domain astronomy".  This award provides funding for continuation of this highly-successful program as well as for several key enhancements.  This program, using existing telescopes and a large data stream, provides a testbed to develop data mining tools and procedures as a precursor to LSST and other missions under development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Exploration of the time domain &ndash; discovery and studies of objects and phenomena changing on time scales ranging from seconds to years &ndash; is now one of the most vibrant and rapidly developing fields of astronomy, touching on a broad and diverse spectrum of research areas, from the Solar system and discoveries of extrasolar planets to the distant quasars powered by the supermassive black holes, and from a better understanding of stars to a wide variety of powerful cosmic explosions such as Supernovae.  Detecting such changes is essential for understanding of some of the most interesting phenomena we observe. We now study the universe and its major constituents as a dynamical, changing system.  Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS) is an example of a new type of astronomical sky surveys that cover large areas of the sky repeatedly, looking for the objects that vary in time or transient sources that suddenly appear and then fade away.  It uses a data stream that is obtained in order to look for the potentially hazardous asteroids, and it uses the same data for a much broader range of astrophysical studies.  The data are analyzed in a real time, and any detected changes are published electronically right away, enabling the entire astronomical community to conduct the follow-up studies and make new discoveries.  This data re-use and an open data philosophy help the community extract the maximum scientific benefits from the data.  In all, this survey is monitoring some 500 million astronomical objects on time scales ranging from 10 minutes to over 14 years, with hundreds of billions of individual measurements.  This unprecedented data archive enabled many studies that were simply impossible to do with smaller data sets.  For example, one of the new discoveries was a population of supermassive black hole binaries that power some of the luminous quasars; their existence was theoretically predicted, but the only way to detect them was to look for the periodic changes in brightness among the hundreds of thousands of known quasars.  The survey also discovered about 17,000 transient events, that included about 5,000 Supernovas, some of them especially interesting scientifically, as well as many other interesting phenomena, from large stellar flares to accreting black holes.   Intellectual Merit:  CRTS helped open an exciting new arena of research, a systematic exploration of the time domain in astronomy, enabling numerous projects both by the survey team and by other investigators, many of which are on the cutting edge of the field, thus increasing our understanding of the universe.  CRTS was a scientific and technological precursor and testbed for the more modern and future synoptic sky surveys and experiments, leading to the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.  Broader Impact:  This project aided the entire astronomical community in making new discoveries and developing new scientific strategies.  It is an example of a new generation of scientific experiments involving real-time mining of massive data streams using machine learning tools, and dynamical follow-up strategies.  We also trained undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs, the future science and technology leaders, in the data science skills that are essential for the data-intensive research in the 21st century.   We also developed a broad variety of educational and public outreach materials, that increase the public appreciation of science and the wonders of the universe.
