<AbstractNarration>The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary international organization in the field of natural language processing, and its annual conference is the primary international conference in this research field. This project supports the travel, conference, and housing expenses of students selected to participate in the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Student Research Workshop, held in conjunction with the ACL conference on June 23-25, 2014 in Baltimore. The workshop consists of two tracks: full paper presentations and poster presentations. All selected work has only student authors. The full paper sessions are composed of paper presentations followed by a discussion panel led by respected researchers in the field. The workshop is organized and run by students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Student Research Workshop provides a valuable opportunity for the next generation of researchers to enter the computational linguistics community. It allows the best students in the field to receive critical feedback on their work from external experts and to forge contacts with other students and senior researchers. The organizers also pair each participant with a senior researcher to provide specific feedback on the students' research.  The students who select papers for the workshop  and plan the sessions also gain valuable opportunities for professional growth and interaction with the researchers on the organizing committee of the main conference. The workshop contributes to the maintenance and development of a skilled and diverse computational linguistics and natural language processing research community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The 2014 Association for Computational Linguistics Student Research Workshop (SRW) supports young researchers in becoming part of the computational linguistics community. The SRW provides a supportive environment where researchers can present their work (either as a thesis proposal or a research paper). The 2014 student research workshop showcased the early work of 15 students and was held at the 2014 international meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics in Baltimore.  Participants were selected through a competitive application process. In addition to presenting their work, participants of the SRW were also paired with an experienced mentor who could help give detailed feedback on their work and introduce them to the community. This provides an introduction to the process of submitting and presenting at competitive academic venues, which will help build the careers of these young researchers.    The SRW helps develop the research direction of young students, helping them form research directions that will shape the intellectual course of the field for years to come.    More broadly, the SRW serves as the first steps in a hopefully long careers of researchers starting in computational linguistics: providing a venue to present their work, matching them to experienced researchers, and supporting what is often their first encounter with the international research community.  This serves a benefit whether the researchers stay in academia or help create industrial applications of computational linguistics.
