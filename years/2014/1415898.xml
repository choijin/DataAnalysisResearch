<AbstractNarration>This project represents a collaboration between TERC and IntuVision to develop a video recording and analysis system called VideoReView (VRV) that allows grade four science teachers to record, tag, and analyze video in their classroom in real time.   The system will contain a number of features---such as a sophisticated system of tagging and the automatic detection of important video segments---designed to speed and assist the teacher in its use.  The investigators will then study and enhance the system in the context of professional learning communities of teachers.  The system is expected to enable teachers to examine their own teaching, and that of others, in a much more dynamic and specific way and to integrate video into their ongoing structures of professional learning.  To date, video analysis of teaching is out of the reach of ordinary teachers.  If successful, this research could change the way teachers engage in their own profession and their understanding of, for example, student thinking and argumentation in science---something emphasized in the Next Generation Science Standards---but previously more difficult to do without being able to replay and refine teaching episodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complete VRV System will be tested with 18 Grade four teachers and approximately 400 students from six schools in the Newton Public School System in a Boston suburb.  The emphasis of the study will be on the ability of teachers to use the system with little outside assistance, means of enhancing its features and usability, and its integration into professional learning communities.  A mixed methods research design will be used that includes surveys and interviews.  The study outcomes will be disseminated through publications and conference presentations.</AbstractNarration>

The project drew on prior research on use of classroom video for teacher noticing. The central premise of the project was that timely video feedback of their students? thinking coupled with supports for video analysis would increase teachers? attention to and interpretation of student thinking. These insights, in turn, would serve as the foundation to consider next steps for supporting student learning.</p> <p>The project developed a professional learning program supported by a classroom-friendly hardware and software tool to help teachers capture and study video of their classroom discussions. The software provided teachers with tools for analyzing students? ideas and reasoning. Specifically, there was an <em>Event Marker</em> to help teachers highlight notable segments of the video for deeper study. Further, an organizing frame called <em>Science Lens</em> provided teachers with a set of tags to annotate students? reasoning.</p> <p>Teachers participated in a four-part sequence of professional learning activities. First, they used a print-based tool to plan whole-class, meaning-making science discussions. Second, as they enacted the discussion, teachers used the hardware and software tool to capture the discussion with the camera focused on the students and not themselves. Third, they worked with a coach and used the software to study the resulting video and to prepare video cases to share with colleagues. Finally, teachers met in school-based Video Clubs to discuss their cases and to explore next steps in teaching.</p> <p>The project partnered with teacher co-developers across four schools in Massachusetts to design the video-supported professional learning program. Then, the program and associated research instruments were piloted and refined with teams of elementary grade science teachers in Massachusetts. The final research study was then conducted with five teams of elementary grade science teachers in Massachusetts and Vermont schools.</p> <p>The research findings show that teachers developed greater attention to students? ideas and reasoning over time. Teachers focused on specific student ideas and interpreted student thinking more frequently during video study with a coach. Similarly, during collegial study in Video Clubs, teachers focused increasingly on specific student ideas and considered pedagogical implications in light of student thinking more frequently. Teachers showed more meaningful engagement with students? ideas during classroom discussions. Shifts also occurred in students? participation during science discussions.
