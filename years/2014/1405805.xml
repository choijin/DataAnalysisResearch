<AbstractNarration>This project is a continuation of an effort to better understand the ground level photochemistry that causes the formation of ozone, a pollutant with adverse effects on human health. Measurements of ozone precursors will be made as part of an international study named The Campaigns of Air Pollution Research in Megacity - Beijing and the North China Plain.  This is a follow-on campaign to one that took place in August 2007 and will include scientists from France, Japan, Germany, Hong Kong, and the USA, as well as from China. Understanding ozone photochemistry over China is important to understanding global photochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both photochemical and transport modeling will be conducted to analyze the photochemistry and in-situ production of ozone at the site.  Several issues related to the local photochemistry will be further analyzed. These include the investigation of key pathways for heterogeneous production of nitrous acid and for the loss of hydroperoxyl radicals onto aerosol surfaces. Data from the in situ and satellite measurements will be analyzed using the 3-D Regional chEmical trAnsport Model (REAM). Model simulations of photochemical reactions will be conducted, constrained by the concentrations of long-lived species and observations of intermediate species such as peroxyacetyl nitrate, peroxynitric acid, and glyoxal. The research results of this effort will be used to update some of the photochemical mechanisms used in the model.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[China has undergone rapid economic transition in the past three decades. Similar types of rapid industrial growth occurred, are occurring, or will occur in other regions of the world. Observational and modeling evidence suggests that the characteristics of photochemistry over China differ significantly from what is represented in the current generation of 3-D chemical transport models. There is also evidence that suggests an increasing influence of trans-Pacific transport on ozone over the western United States, which is driven by emissions from China. We take an integrated measurement and modeling approach in order to address the challenges of understanding better photochemical processes and regional ozone formation in China. In situ observations are critically important to improve our understanding and model representation of radical and ozone photochemistry. In this project, we carried out multi-scale modeling analysis of situ measurements from the Campaigns of Air Pollution Research in Megacity - Beijing and North China Plain (CAREBEIJING-NCP) experiment and satellite observations. The major findings of this research are:  (1) Chorine chemistry appears to be quite active in daytime in China on a regional basis.  (2) Heterogeneous HONO production is a major radical source and increases regional oxidation capacity in polluted regions.  (3) Analysis of in situ observations suggests that heterogeneous HONO source is a dominant radical source in the fall for air masses affected by biomass burning.  (4) Radical chemistry in China exhibits different characteristics from the United States and showcases a need for better understanding of photochemistry in the boundary layer in order to understand the high pollution levels and formulate effective control measures.  (5) Improved inverse modeling methodology leads to consistent NOx emission estimates using OMI and GOME observations.  (6) The original inverse modeling methodology for satellite measurements of column NO2 cannot properly account for chemical nonlinearity and we suggest that the local derivative method improves upon the original formulation.  (7) The January extreme haze event in China is driven by regional climate change.  (8) The emission source profiles in China are complex and different from the U.S.  (9) Large amounts of pollutants are transported to the Tibetan Plateau, which will likely reduce snow and ice cover in this region and exacerbate warming of the climate.  (10) HCFC replacement compounds such HFOs can potentially lead to high concentrations of phytotoxic trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in the downwind regions.  (11) Regional climate change is a significant factor driving ozone increases in China and the effects of biogenic VOCs are becoming more important than in the past.  Three graduate students are trained in scientific research as part of the project. Two have graduated with Ph.D. degrees. The PI gave over 20 presentations or seminars on the research results from this project. The postdoc during the field experiment is now a scientist at NOAA ERSL. The PI hosted training programs of 5 visiting scientists, 6 Ph.D. visiting students, and 3 undergraduate students from China.
