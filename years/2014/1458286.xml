<AbstractNarration>It was once the widely held belief among practitioners of economic development that economic growth was frequently hindered by the existence of traditional cultural practices and attachments, which could prevent the emergence of more formal institutions. That position is no longer so widely held, as several decades of globalization have produced ample evidence of culturally blended patterns in instances of robust economic development, as informal economic structures have developed with local cultural notions of fairness, flexibility, risk and trust. As a result, informality is now celebrated as a model of flexible economic growth and practitioners are increasingly encouraged to adopt parameters reflecting the diversity of economic development strategies. Scientists remain challenged, however, as to how to identify and model the pathways through which informality and flexibility benefit economic growth. This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous, empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, will explore the ways in which informality, as a fundamental cultural pattern of this new flexible economy, influences existing economic structures and the propensities for economic growth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Samil Can, under the supervision of Thomas Hansen of Stanford University, will explore debt relations and dispute resolutions by tracing loan networks and practices of resolving debt disputes. The research will be conducted in Delhi, India, a commercial center in one of the world's most important and largest emerging economies. Based on preliminary research, the researcher holds that India has diverse moral and religious notions of exchange, credit, obligation and authority working to maintain informal and flexible economic structures. Based on this claim, the project whether and how these moral and religious notions socio-culturally undertake and diversify the roles fulfilled by the state, the banking system, and the regulations in an idealized formal economic model. The project investigates how Muslim traders, shopkeepers, warehouse suppliers, and retailers establish social networks to find debts and resolve debt disputes using formal and informal authorities (e.g. religious leaders, elders, court system, and police). Preliminary data suggests Muslims of Old Delhi heavily rely on religious and moral notions in their transactions, but also maintain access to other local and transnational economic networks. Therefore, this project seeks to provide generalizable insights on how flexible economic growth relies on various and ever-changing cultural notions. The project will utilize ethnographic methods (participant observation of carefully selected informants, in-depth interviews, oral histories) and spatial research methodologies (social network analysis, socio-spatial mapping) in order to document how these cultural economic transaction patterns among Muslims in Delhi relate to the larger informal economy of Delhi. The findings will significantly inform academic and intellectual debates over "flexible economic growth" by outlining its everyday practical implications and exploring the ways in which debt obligation is culturally framed. It will contribute significantly to a pressing global debate on the concept of "debt" among anthropologists, economists, political scientists, and a wide range of non-academic policy-makers. Amidst recent debates on the authority and legitimacy of creditors and debt-giving agents, the study on cultural frames of new local and global economic patterns shall also provide vital intellectual and practical insights on how current initiatives to restructure debt in financial markets should be formulated in relation to informality.</AbstractNarration>

In this context, "informal" and "informality" refers to situations of having limited or no access to formal lending regimes, banks, government subsidies, legal enforcement, litigation, etc. The larger goal of the project is to understand how these indigent traders maintained economic obligations and exchange regimes with limited or no access to "formal" economic structures or sanctioned forms of enforcement. In that sense, this research joins a larger thread of studies that ask how economic growth is generated through the "flexibilities" of informal economies that function under the auspices of cultural forms of authority and obligations.  Following the emergent literature on "affect" and "morality" in economic anthropology, I pursued a different track of research in comparison to other researches on informality. I asked whether indebtedness is a "moral affect" that influences how "the obligation to pay a debt back" is negotiated in everyday economic life by precarious populations engaging in informal economies. My findings suggest that "slowed-down" and "scaled-down" circulation patterns due to "cash scarcity" invite a variety of "moral audiences" to avoid "moral hazards" and enforce obligations (religious authorities, local "big men," kinship networks, loan sharks, police, etc.). This finding points at a relatively wider condition that could be observed across the Global South. In the case of indigent Muslim traders in Delhi, however, I specifically found out that, given enduring Hindu-Muslim sectarian tensions in India, Muslim Indian imaginations of indebtedness (and their relation to the moral audiences that provided informal authorities) rested on the powerful affective backgrounds of "blame," "shame" and "resentment."  How do these "affects" relate to actual economic exchange mechanisms in informal economy? By engaging with affects and materialities of everyday precarious lives, my larger perspective sought to understand how precarious populations "performed" morality in informal economy "subjectively," through a dynamic ethos of everyday economic morality, a make-shift patchwork of often incongruous moral paradigms that negotiated the multiplicity of competing moral audiences in economic networks. For instance, my research demonstrates how centuries old Sufi-Islamic moral notions (e.g. self-sufficiency; Stoically coming to terms with the world or the nefs [the wanting/needful ego]; accepting the selfishness of the worldly self, etc.) are re-hauled by many Muslim traders as a mechanism to justify "selfish" market behavior and self-entrepreneurialism.  However, I also found out that, despite the expectations of classical economy, these moral and spiritual negotiations of an "entrepreneurial subjectivity" in the form of a "selfishness" rested in the affective backgrounds of "blame," which diversified how Muslim traders acted towards different people and in different conditions. In other words, blame, and similarly shame, appeared as extremely strong affective backgrounds for moral conceptualizations of (i) which cultural "others" are to be blamed for the precarity, indigence and lack of prestige among Muslims, and similarly (ii) how "fair" traders are (and are not) obligated to treat "which" others in economic transactions. Various discourses and narratives of blame (e.g. "Who, or what is to be blamed for our indigence-segregation-insulation?") serve as powerful affective backgrounds that generated moral outlooks for how to (and not to) act as economic actors in secular markets and do business with (or within) capitalistic frames, despite being pious Muslims: "What is permissible, just, or fair when I, as a Muslim, and as a trader, act beyond/around/across Islamic norms?" Given the fairly limited and cash-scarce economic climate segregated Muslim Indians endure, "is it possible/permissible to ?coax? fellow Muslims in trade or in debt relations? How about non-Muslims?"  Nonetheless, the affective negotiations of "moral audiences" are not without limits. The "moral entrepreneurialism" of the subjects that negotiated moral audiences and their moralities in economic exchanges (i.e. shifting from one moral frame to another as situations required) are often limited by moralities and "skillfully moral" subjectivities of "credibility."
