<AbstractNarration>All Gram-negative bacteria possess two distinct membranes surrounding them. These membranes contain numerous membrane proteins. In the inner membrane, most proteins adopt a helical form termed alpha-helical fold, whereas in the outer membrane they almost all form sheet-like structures by side-by-side alignment of protein strands, which is termed beta-sheet fold. The outer membrane contains proteins with large, open pores, rendering it unable to contain chemical energy stored in small molecules such as ATP or in the form of an ion gradient. Therefore, an alternative source of energy is required for complex processes such as insertion of proteins to membrane or secretion of proteins through the membrane. It is the goal of this project to determine the feasibility of protein folding itself as the source of energy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to change a common paradigm in high school biology instruction, in which cells and the systems contained within are often seen as static and highly directed. Through molecular visualization of simulation data, the dynamic nature of proteins becomes readily apparent. Multiple modules on specific topics, such as the assembly of membranes and diffusion through membrane-bound channels, will be developed and implemented in high school classrooms in the North Georgia area. These modules emphasize the construction of explanatory models for the observed behavior, a key element of future science standards. Their implementation will be aided by the development of a simplified interface for the visualization program VMD. Assessment of the modules' impact will first be conducted in three classrooms before expanding to a wider audience through web distribution. Graduate and undergraduate students will be highly involved in the entire process, giving them training beyond just research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiple theoretical models have been proposed to explain how the folding of proteins to form beta-sheet can provide energy. In this proposal, computational investigations will be performed to determine, the energetic aspects of the formation of these structures through protein folding (1) in isolation, (2) in the insertion of outer-membrane-bound proteins and (3) in the secretion of auto transporter domains across the membrane. Quantitative determination of the energetic aspects of these processes will be used to evaluate and refine existing models. Investigations into two specific systems will be used to elucidate how outer-membrane proteins are inserted by BamA and how virulence protein domains are secreted by autotransporters, both being energized by their own folding. The specific objectives are to (1) characterize the free-energy landscape and stability of beta-sheet structures; (2) determine how BamA catalyzes the insertion and folding of outer-membrane proteins; (3) resolve the molecular sequence of events in autotransporter folding; and (4) integrate dynamics of biological systems into high school instruction. The primary method to be used is molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.  All simulation results will be closely coupled to experiments, both retrospectively and prospectively.</AbstractNarration>

Therefore, an alternative source of energy is required for complex processes such as membrane-protein insertion and protein secretion.  Additionally, practically all proteins at the outer membrane adopt folded structures dominated by beta sheets.  Through molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated folding of beta sheets (1) in isolation, (2) in the insertion of outer-membrane-bound proteins and (3) in the secretion of autotransporter domains across the membrane.  A few of the key results include the following: with regards to the first goal, we resolved the energetics of the folding process of the canonical beta-hairpin GB1; in an experimental-computational collaboration, we also determined how the chemistry of a single amino acid in a small peptide could control whether or not it folds into a beta hairpin.  For the second goal, we extensively characterized the dynamics of the protein BamA, an outer-membrane protein responsible for inserting other outer-membrane proteins; for example, we found that a small structural defect in one of its beta strands is critical to its ability to function efficiently.  For the third goal, we resolved how a specific autotransporter, CdiB, opens to permit access to its toxic substrate for subsequent export. A number of methodological advances in areas such as free-energy calculations, force-field parameterization, and others were made as well. A total of 25 peer-reviewed publications resulted from this award. We also developed multiple education modules that emphasize the role of dynamics in biological processes, which are distributed as web-based applets. For example, one module illustrates how photosynthesis relies on the stable organization of chlorophylls provided by a protein scaffold.  Two courses were also developed as part of this award, including a new Introductory Physics of Living Systems course sequence for students majoring in the biological sciences at Georgia Tech.  Finally, four students who participated in this work received their PhDs, in addition to four current PhD candidates who have participated.  Five undergraduate students also contributed to the work that was part of this award.          Last Modified: 07/30/2021       Submitted by: James C Gumbart]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
