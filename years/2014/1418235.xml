<AbstractNarration>Schools and teachers face unprecedented challenges in meeting the ambitious goals of integrating core interdisciplinary science ideas with science and engineering practices as described in new standards. The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), in collaboration with the University of Connecticut (UConn), and the Lawrence Hall of Science (the Hall), will develop a middle school ecology unit and related teacher professional development that will help high-need and urban middle school students, including English Language Learners, understand these ideas and related practices. Teachers will be supported through professional development that is directly linked to the curriculum and is designed to develop their science content knowledge as well as their knowledge of how to teach the curriculum.  The project builds on existing AMNH resources that include video and text passages supported with literacy strategies, online interactive data tools to plan and carry out investigations, and prior research on these resources used with teachers in professional development and with students in classrooms.  In addition to serving the schools, teachers and students who directly participate, the project's deliverables include the ecology unit, teacher professional development, assessment tools, and a model for designing such comprehensives science programs that relate to NGSS. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The curriculum unit will be modeled after the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) 5E model that will use the 5 Phases (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate) for students to work through with each of five themes: Ecological Communities, Food Webs, A River Ecosystem, Zebra Mussel Invasion, and Monitoring Human Impact. Teachers will participate in 12 days of professional development that will introduce the program's pedagogical approach (the 5E model) and how it reflects NGSS, with teachers having significant time to learn the science, try out the activities, learn how to facilitate the program, provide feedback on the program as part of the evaluation, and reflect on their practice.  The initial approach to the curriculum and teacher professional development will be designed in Year 1 and then iteratively revised and evaluated in Years 2-4 through formative evaluation that focuses on curriculum PD, and measures of student and teacher outcomes.  The evaluation will assess the contribution of teacher science and pedagogical knowledge to increases in student knowledge. The evaluation findings and assessment tools developed for the project will provide the foundation for a future efficacy study. The project is one of a relatively small number of projects funded through NSF's DRK-12 program that directly addresses the need for NGSS-related learning resources.  The project's learning resources, assessment tools, and model for designing NGSS-related and comprehensive science programs will be shared through professional publications, conference and workshop presentations, and liaison with organizations active in developing new resources bring NGSS into practice.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The American Museum of Natural History, the Lawrence Hall of Science, and the University of Connecticut collaborated to design, pilot, and field-test a 10-week middle school ecology unit, Disruptions in Ecosystems, and an associated professional development (PD) program that aligned with a bundle of middle school ecology Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) performance expectations and Common Core State Standards. The Moving Next Generation Science Standards into Practice project provides an NGSS-designed model unit that has been not only used in classrooms nationally and available online; but also by others for teacher PD about the Educators Evaluating the Quality of Instructional Products (EQuIP) process; as well as teacher and student assessments.  This project has deepened knowledge about how to design curricula that support the three-dimensional learning envisioned in the NGSS. The curriculum team developed approaches to scaffolding student learning experiences to promote growth in all three dimensions aligned to the targeted Performance Expectations. These experiences helped to prepare students to engage in sensemaking around concepts and issues in ecology. The second field test edition was submitted for an EQuIP review in 2017, receiving a rating as High Quality NSF Design If Improved, and final revisions have been submitted. The curriculum and design approach has been shared with a wide practitioner and researcher audience through professional meetings.  The project has also advanced knowledge of professional development design for teacher learning and of the influence of professional development on teachers and students. Throughout the project, the research team deepened their understanding of 1) the specialized knowledge needed by PD facilitators and 2) how to provide teachers with opportunities to engage in and reflect on NGSS-aligned teaching practices.

Finally, the project has contributed to our understanding of teacher and student assessment. This project yielded instructional materials and teaching resources aligned with NGSS, and instruments to help researchers and educators track the effects of PD on science teaching and learning. Although initially not part of the project design, the project team saw an opportunity to extend the work of assessment and was awarded supplemental funding to score full sets of assessments from the unit from &gt;900 students to gather reliability and validity data.  A product of this work is a full set of student exemplars which have been scored, annotated, and compiled into a teacher support document. Teachers found the exemplars and hands-on experience analyzing exemplars to be among the activities that they rated highest in terms of impact on their classroom practice. We anticipate that teachers using the curriculum in their middle school classroom will find the student examples helpful in anticipating the range of student performances one might expect, and productive ways in which to use student thinking on assessments to guide instruction. The large-scale scoring and analysis of hundreds of middle school student responses to these tasks offer insight into how students? developed competency with Disciplinary Core Ideas related to ecosystems, Crosscutting Concepts, and science and engineering practices, specifically, developing and using models, constructing explanations, and arguing from evidence.
