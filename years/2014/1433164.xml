<AbstractNarration>This postdoctoral research award is for an idealized numerical modeling study of self-critical behavior in tropical clouds.  Self-critical behavior in this context refers to the phenomena whereby clouds grow quickly into rainfall producers when their immediate surroundings reach a certain moisture level.  It is established on a large scale that this occurs in order to prevent the atmosphere from being overly moistened.  However, the research in this award is aimed at discovering what role self-criticality plays on an individual cloud level.  A successful outcome from this award would be increased understanding of cloud processes in order to improve weather and climate models.  The researcher also plans to teach and advise undergraduate students with the goal of influencing more of them to pursue science careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will be carried out using the Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Model (OLAM).  The researcher will address two topics related to the growth of individual clouds, cloud microphysics and gravity waves.  The first hypothesis of the work is that certain cloud microphysical processes become efficient around the critical moisture value.  To test this hypothesis, the researcher will turn off the depositional process in the model, the process whereby water vapor is transferred to ice crystals.  If the hypothesis is correct, the critical value should break down or shift.  The second hypothesis is that as the rain rate from the cloud increases the amplitude of the created gravity waves will also increase.  This would in turn create more clouds and rainfall and force the system back to a stable state.  This hypothesis will be tested by running the model with a short time step and following the waves and how they interact with nearby clouds.  This postdoctoral fellowship will be split between the University of Melbourne in Australia and University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.  This award was supported with funding from the Office of International and Integrative Activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[                Throughout the project, we examined why it rains where it does and how intense that rain is when it occurs.  Because the most intense rain on the planet occurs in intense bursts below tropical thunderstorms, we chose to focus on the mechanisms leading to heavy rainfall from those storms.  We know from previous research that greater atmospheric moisture leads to more intense rainfall from tropical thunderstorms, but the specific processes involved in the conversion of that moisture to surface rainfall have received less attention.  Particularly, why rainfall appears to switch on at a particular value of atmospheric column humidity is not understood at a process level.  This project addressed the column humidity value at which precipitation begins to fall.                 The research conducted in this project included examining cloud processes related to the creation and initiation of surface precipitation.  Processes like the effect of wind on the movement of water vapor, the convective intensity of clouds, and cloud microphysical conversion rates were examined as a function of column humidity.  Once these sensitivities were understood, a simple model was made to predict the behavior of rainfall.  The column humidity was broken down into components from two atmospheric layers.  When surface precipitation was examined as a function of these two layers, it could be easily attributed to various common tropical cloud types.  Cloud processes were examined again as a function of layer moisture.  Individual wind and microphysical processes were then identified as being important to some cloud types but not others.  The column humidity at which rainfall begins was shown to be the only value at which all cloud types might exist.  This uniquely defines the pickup value in precipitation.                 A cloud model, the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System, was used for this project.  A cloud tracking method, called RAMStracks, was developed for output from this model that follows the evolution of individual clouds throughout their model lifetime in 3 dimensions.  This tracking method will be useful for others who run cloud simulations and will be made freely available.  For this project, RAMStracks was used to understand the simultaneous evolution of rainfall and cloud processes through the lifetime of individual clouds.  For the first time, the variability of the evolution of a large ensemble of deep convective clouds was assessed.  It was shown that the dependence on column and layer moisture of individual clouds is very different among different clouds that might otherwise appear similar.  However, similar patterns between clouds emerged by which it was shown that column and layer moisture are critically important to the intensity and evolution of precipitation.                 The broader impacts from the project are two-fold.  First, the improvements to our understanding of the behavior of precipitation will lead to improved forecasting and now-casting of potentially heavy precipitation in seasonally tropical locations like Hawaii and other Pacific islands and coastal Florida.  The two-layer moisture structure that was shown to be important to clouds should be observable from satellites and from ground-based sensors which will allow forecasters in the future to make informed predictions based on the theories developed.
