<AbstractNarration>While this is the age of big data, there is still a question of whether more data translates to more knowledge. Particularly when generating data is expensive or time consuming, as it is often the case with clinical trials and biomolecular experiments, the problem of identifying information-rich data becomes crucial for creating models that can reliably predict the outcome of future experiments. Few results have been published on the amount of necessary data, and currently there are no methods for generating specific data sets which would unambiguously identify a predictive model. This research project addresses fundamental mathematical and computational questions in data selection.  The theoretical results will advance the fields of design of experiments and network inference through the determination of criteria for selecting data sets to uniquely identify models. The algorithms under development will serve as a guide for experimentalists in determining the data that are needed to identify the structure of a network of interest. Such knowledge has the potential to drastically reduce wasted resources that arise from too much data with too little information. Graduate students will participate at the appropriate level in each component of the project. Such an experience will provide possible topics for M.S. or Ph.D. dissertations and will very likely inspire career-long involvement of the participants in the STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a first step towards developing a complete theory, the PIs will focus on models described by finite-valued nonlinear polynomial functions. Finite-state multivariate polynomial functions have successfully been used to model complex networks from discretized data; however, few results have been published on the amount of data necessary for such models, with the majority applying to Boolean models only. The PIs will address the issue of the minimality and specificity of data to uniquely identify discrete polynomial models by developing the appropriate theory, implementing the theoretical results as algorithms, and applying the algorithms to important physical systems. The proposed work will also increase the utility of polynomial dynamical systems as models of complex networks by establishing the minimal amount of the data for unique model identification.</AbstractNarration>

For data which can be viewed as discrete, such as on/off, this project contributed to the characterization of data sets for which there is only one discrete model that fits the given data.   Intellectual Merit Significant intellectual contributions encompass both theoretical and computational components.  The theoretical results describe geometric properties of data that give rise to a unique model and algebraic properties of bases of such models.  The computational results include computer code and a collection of files containing information for small networks.  A summary follows.   We provided an algebraic criterion on models when they are unique, complete with a simple test of the criterion.   We showed that a data set and its complement have the same number of associated models. In particular given a data set that has a unique model which fits the data, the complement of the data set also has a unique model of fit.   We proved that data sets configured as staircases (lattice points clustered around the origin with no gaps) have unique models.  This provides a simple geometric criterion for data.   We introduced a so-called linear shift as a transformation of data that does not change the number of associated models, and developed a method to partition data into groups with the same model bases.  This partition allows for quick inspection of data and corresponding model types.   We identified an algebraic method to generate data sets with unique models, that is constructing a specific system of polynomials whose solutions can be interpreted as data that have a unique model of fit.    We generated data, the number of associated models, and bases for the models for networks up to 7 nodes with 2, 3, 5, 7 states, and for all possible data set size.  These computations are instrumental in testing conjectures.    We developed Python code to create all partitions of data for a given network.  Partitions for small networks will be stored in a repository along with the code and the above computational results, which will be publically available.     Broader Impact This work may serve as a guide for experimentalists in determining the data that are needed to identify the structure of a network of interest. Such knowledge has the potential to reduce wasted resources that arise from too much data with too little information.  Furthermore it has the potential to impact sectors outside of the sciences, such as healthcare: for example, the developed criteria may suggest which patient samples to collect so that diagnostic tests can uniquely identify the disease condition. The repository will be a valuable resource for computational scientists.  Given a data set, the repository can be probed for a match.  The matching set will be annotated with the number of possible models associated with the data set as well as a basis.  Each basis carries dependency information, which can be interpreted as the set of possible regulators for a given node in the network. Having such a repository will drastically reduce the time involved in identifying appropriate models as researchers will be able to browse the possible sets of regulators for a given node.

The student had the opportunity to speak at various national and regional meetings.  Furthermore she cultivated an interest in and ability to program by way of her work in this project. A consequence of this work is the potential impact in algebraic geometry.  A chief object of study in this project is ideals of points over a finite field.  Ideals of points have been studied over infinite fields, but have been largely overlooked over finite fields.  This work highlights open questions regarding ideals of points over finite fields.
