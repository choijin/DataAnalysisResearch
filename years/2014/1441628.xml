<AbstractNarration>Terrestrial vertebrates (Tetrapoda) include our own species and represent one of the great and diverse evolutionary radiations that intersect with humans' everyday lives. The four tetrapod classes - birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles - together comprise ca. 33,000 species, include life histories ranging from aquatic, subterranean, and arboreal to aerial, cover a variety of trophic strategies, and harbor some of the most stunning ecological adaptations. Tetrapods play a significant role in providing diverse ecological functions, and they are vital to biodiversity monitoring efforts. However, significant knowledge gaps remain in the evolutionary relationships, distributions of ecologically important traits, and distributions of species. The project will undertake concerted assembling efforts that will yield near species-level completeness of key evolutionary and ecological attributes thereby establishing a global model system for macroevolution, macroecology, comparative biology and global change research. The compiled trait and spatial data will provide a vital backbone for rigorous conservation monitoring and prioritization. The online analysis and visualization tools will extend successful, existing projects and will be built to be directly usable for other taxa and other Genealogy of Life (GoLife) projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Massive parallel sequencing methods will be used to collect new multi-locus genetic information for ca. 4,000 species currently lacking such data. These data will be used to derive a dated posterior tree set that includes all tetrapod species and captures remaining uncertainty. The posterior tree set will be used to calculate evolutionary distinctness and a variety of tree metrics. Together with key collaborators the researchers will compile morphological, ecological and life history trait data for dozens of variables and additionally benefit from phylogenetic imputation to predict missing values. A new tool incorporated into the existing Map of Life infrastructure will link existing species distributional datasets to global environmental data layers and provide broad-scale niche characteristics for all vertebrates together with estimates of uncertainty. Further integration will link these products to online phylogeny visualization tools to allow map- and tree-based discovery and download. Finally, the project will demonstrate the utility of the integrated layers through example biogeographic, conservation and comparative analyses that will highlight the advance in inference and in predictive conservation use arising from near-complete and unbiased global data. The research will also provide online visualizations and tutorials, a museum exhibit developed around the products, a workshop based on VertLife infrastructure, and undergraduate and graduate summer internships.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The VertLife Terrestrial project developed terrestrial vertebrates (Tetrapoda) as model group for near-complete species-level data regarding key evolutionary and ecological attributes. Tetrapods play a significant role in providing diverse ecological functions, and are extraordinarily well studied especially in areas such as comparative anatomy and have a stellar fossil record. However, significant knowledge gaps remain in the phylogenetic relationships among species and higher taxa, the taxonomic distributions of ecologically important traits, and geographical distributions of species.  Given the key value of phylogenetic data gathered at fine scale (species level or lower), VertLife focused on development of key new phylogenetic resources for key vertebrate clades where those data were lacking.  A significant part of this effort required extensive effort to rationalize existing taxonomic concepts and taxonomic usages. While vertebrate taxonomic resources are often available, they are scattered, incomplete and often out of date.  The work at University of Florida in part focused on this key effort to assemble consolidated information on currently valid taxa, their delimitation, as well as invalid names that are associated with the valid ones.  This critically underpinned key synthesis efforts.  The team at the University of Florida also assembled and showcased the use of key trait data, such as body size, and life history information, such as offspring number, that was collated as part of this effort.  Rather than fully relying on species-level trait data, a focal area was working from individual trait reporting to assembly of these traits over space and time.  New empirical work examined how individual trait measures such as body mass and length, number of offspring and even breeding phenology can be used in a phylogenetic comparative context to understand spatial and temporal drivers of body size change. We also showcase how those data can be visualized and provided a new phylogenetically informed mixed model framework that can scale from intra- to interspecific levels in order to understand change dynamics.  As part of this work, output information products were made available broadly and openly to the community of vertebrate biologists and paleontologists.  This work also hastened new tool development, especially in the R programming language.  This work provided professional training opportunities especially at the postdoctoral level, with key skills development in biodiversity data sciences toolkits.
