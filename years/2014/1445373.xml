<AbstractNarration>This awards provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the conference "West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar 2014" that will be held November 1-2, 2014, on the campus of the University of Denver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is the twenty-second installment of the West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar (WCOAS), a series that annually brings together a diverse group of mathematicians whose primary research interests are in various facets of the theory of operator algebras. A sampling of the topical foci of the 2014 event is given by the following: the Elliott program for the classification of  C*-algebras; applications of operator algebras to mathematical physics; noncommutative geometry; the Baum-Connes conjecture; free probability and its applications; subfactors and their invariants. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
