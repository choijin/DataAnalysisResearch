<AbstractNarration>The Third Workshop on Biostatistics and Bioinformatics will be held on the campus of Georgia State University, Atlanta on May 9-11, 2014. The objective of the conference is to reflect new developments in the frontiers of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics.  The conference will cover a broad range of current research topics, including high dimensional data analysis, survival analysis, longitudinal data analysis, and next generation and sequence data analysis.  The invited speakers will include leading experts and outstanding young researchers. The workshop will provide opportunities for exchange new ideas and research collaborations. Graduate students and postdocs will gain valuable research experience by attending the workshop and making poster presentations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the participation of approximately 16 people.  The conference organizers are making special efforts to provide travel support for a diverse group of researchers to attend the workshop.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We held a  Workshop on Biostatistics and Bioinformatics on the campus of the Georgia State University. The keynote speaker was Professor Xiao-Li Meng,  Dean of Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University. 15 other distinguished statisticians and outstanding young researchers  delivered invited talks.  Over  30 poster presentations were  given by graduate students and postdoc, and young  researchers. We made  special efforts to provide travel support  for a diverse group of researchers, and  the  NSF funding  was used to support  the partial travel  expenses for them   to attend the workshop.     The workshop provided  the opportunity for faculty and graduate students to meet the top researchers, identify important directions for future research, facilitate research collaborations. The workshop offered a platform to exchange ideas and learn about new progress in biostatistics and bioinformatics, contribute to the training of Ph. D. students. It reflected new developments in the frontiers of  Biostatistics and Bioinformatics including high dimensional data analysis, survival analysis, longitudinal data analysis, next generation sequence data analysis.   The workshop enables us to create collaborations among different universities in USA.  Several   papers  were  finished based on the collaboration  through the discussion during the workshop.  In summary,  our workshop is becoming nationally visible  by the increasing number of speakers from outside the Atlanta area.
