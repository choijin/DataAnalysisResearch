<AbstractNarration>The most populated cities in the world are located on deltaic coastal floodplains because of their rich fertile soils and plentiful natural resources. River deltas are disappearing at increasing rates due to human-caused changes to sediment supply and river flow, gradual sinking of land, and rising sea level, threatening the sustainability of human settlements on coastal river deltas. River management projects, including those designed to promote navigation and reduce flooding, have in some cases accelerated land loss and increased the threat of hurricane flooding. This project will explore the relationships among human river management, sediment supply, wetland building capacity, coastal flood risk, and human perception of flood risk. Testing the connections between river management, wetland loss, and flood risks will improve prediction of future coastal system states and produce guidelines for how to sustainably manage sediment supply and maintain human settlement in coastal areas. Other broader impact activities will include graduate and undergraduate education, application to public policy, and public and K-12 outreach. These are all unified through the general recognition in Louisiana (like many other deltaic coasts) that the science of deltaic restoration has strong and direct impacts on local welfare and economies. This project is supported as part of the National Science Foundation's Coastal Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability program - Coastal SEES.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore the co-evolution of deltaic landscapes and human system response by focusing on changes in coastal flood risks due to human manipulations of sediment delivery. Three experimental coastal basins in the central Mississippi River Deltaic Plain with distinct histories of sediment delivery by rivers and wetland loss responses will be investigated. An interdisciplinary team of researchers will combine field studies and modeling approaches to characterize:  1) feedbacks between human river management strategies that reduce sediment delivery and corresponding landscape degradation and 2) causal links between landscape degradation resulting from reduced sediment delivery, increased flood risks from hurricane storm surges, and human responses to perceived flood risks. The team will explore historical and future outcomes of river management strategies, including reorganization of human settlement in coastal areas using computer simulations incorporating how sediment supply builds land and human response to flood risks. Testing these system interactions in a modeling framework will produce foundational knowledge that can inform management decisions and promote sustainable human settlements on deltaic landscapes.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This NSF Coastal SEES project explored changes in flood risks due to human manipulations of sediment delivery and corresponding wetland loss in the MRDP as the Gulf of Mexico migrates inland toward coastal communities. Through coupled field studies of human and environmental variables, integrated by physical, ecological, and human community modeling, we tested how these changes in actual and perceived risks of increased floods from hurricanes contribute to significant increased risks to human settlement in coastal areas. Seasonal river flood stages along with tides and cold fronts control seasonal water levels that connect wetlands with sediments and nutrients transported from river channels to downstream estuaries. During periods of moderate to high river discharge, sediment bypasses the bay floor and enters the marshes directly when inundation occurs, a process enhanced by the passage of strong atmospheric fronts. This connectivity of materials between river channels and coastal deltaic floodplains controls vegetation type and density, which has a twofold effect: it favors trapping of sediment in wetlands (contributing to increase in elevation); whereas an increase in roughness of the landscape deflects water flow, contributing to how wetlands reduce flood risks during storm events. This NSF Coastal SEES project on the MRDP provided clearer understanding of how coastal deltaic floodplains and estuarine wetlands maintain elevation with connections to river channels, particularly during major events such as hurricanes, that keep these important landscapes from sinking with relative (subsidence and eustatic) sea level rise.</p> <p>We compared historical landscape dynamics for Atchafalaya Bay (sediment rich active coastal basin) to Terrebonne Bay (sediment poor inactive coastal basin) and applied these changes to innovative techniques in how to simulate how flooding risks respond to a stable vs disintegrating delta. In the Terrebonne Basin where sediment supply has been discontinued, the GOM has moved inland by nearly 17 km (10 miles) in comparison to no significant migration landward in the Atchafalaya Basin where sediment supply has continued since 1932. Innovative methods simulated coastal flooding historical coastal basins from 1930 to 2110 at nearly 40 year intervals indicating that past changes in the Louisiana coastal landscape and storm surge were a consequence of local land and river management decisions, while future changes are dominated by relative sea level rise. One particular finding from this innovative modeling technique was associated with how the migration of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) by 7.4 km inland towards the community of Lafitte between 1973 and 2010 has changed the costs of protection. For each person in Lafitte, flood defense costs increased approximately (2010 USD) $19,000 per person per kilometer inland migration of the GOM from 1973 to 2010. The methodology developed in this case study effectively connects wetland loss with increased flood defense costs and can be applied to communities with similar challenges.</p> <p>The social system modeling in this Coastal SEES project of MRDP also discovered innovative methods of estimating flood risks and social vulnerability using Bayesian network (BN) analysis and spatial dynamic modeling. Six variables were found to have direct impacts on population change and four variables were indirect variables. These probabilities could be used for scenario modeling to help inform policies to reduce vulnerability and enhance disaster resilience. A new spatial dynamic model was developed to examine the coupled natural?human responses in the MRDP as indicated by changes in population and associated developed land area. The goal was to identify key socioeconomic factors (utility) and environmental factors (hazard damages, elevation, and subsidence rate) that affected population changes, as well as to examine how population changes affected the local utility and the local environment reciprocally. The proposed model sheds light on the complex relationships between coastal hazards and human responses and provides useful insights to strategic development for coastal sustainability.</p> <p>These discoveries in coupling natural and social systems of MRDP aid in the design of future restoration strategies to maximize net land building in the MRDP, including the following: (a) enhancing river sediment delivery (both mud and sand), (b) increasing sediment retention in receiving basins and (c) minimizing erosion in bays and estuaries. Structures and devices that improve sediment retention, trap sediments, dissipate waves, and build living shorelines should be explored. Our research provides innovative models to simulate cost-to-benefit analyses of new ecosystem designs. Long-term planning should consider more landward diversions, strategic community relocation, and nonlinear response of the complex sedimentary system of the MRDP. Finally, as a small prograding coastal deltaic floodplain under early stages of delta development, active deltas are a continuously emerging ecosystem where the capacity for N removal of riverine NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> increases by 0.2 to 2% per year prior to export to coastal ocean. These results highlight the contribution of the coastal deltaic floodplain in an active coastal basin in processing elevated riverine NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> at continental margins with coastal ocean.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Robert&nbsp;R&nbsp;Twilley</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1427389/1427389_10339798_1580277792236_ModelingtheDynamicsofCommunityResilienceFig6--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1427389/1427389_10339798_1580277792236_ModelingtheDynamicsofCommunityResilienceFig6--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Networks Connected to Population Change"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1427389/1427389_10339798_1580277792236_ModelingtheDynamicsofCommunityResilienceFig6--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Networks Connected to Population Change"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The optimized Bayesian network with hazard threat (node in blue), per capita damage (node in orange), environmental (nodes in green), and socioeconomic variables (nodes in purple) interacting and influencing population change (node in yellow).</div> <div class="imageCredit">[1]K.
