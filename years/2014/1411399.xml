<AbstractNarration>The investigators in the collaborative proposal will make measurements of nearby dwarf galaxies and compare them with theoretical simulations to constrain the nature of Dark Matter in the universe.  Broader impacts of the work include training of graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher, and engagement of  under-represented groups toward careers in science.  Visualizations of dark matter simulations will be created for public outreach.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program aims to measure chemical and dynamical structure of stars within the Milky Way's dwarf spheroidal satellites and compare the measurements to simulations, in order to infer the spatial distribution of dark matter in the least luminous galaxies. They will compare observational results directly to the first suite of cosmological/ hydrodynamical simulations that resolve actual observables - stellar positions, velocities, metallicities, and ages.  The generation of mock observational catalogs from simulations will allow dark matter and galaxy formation models to be compared to data strictly in terms of observables.  The wider ranging impact of this project is to test the standard cold dark matter cosmological model.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There is evidence from many independent lines of inquiry that most of the matter in the Universe is in an unknown component, called dark matter. The largest structures in our Universe are consistent with this dark matter being "cold," meaning non-relativistic. The challenge now is to understand if cold dark matter with gas and stars is sufficient to understand our Universe. Or is something else needed? In this project we tested whether CDM + baryons (gas and stars) can explain a range of seemingly challenging observations.  We also investigated whether alternative dark matter models can match existing observations when baryonic physics is included. Specifically, we investigated two favorite models, warm and self-interacting dark matter, to test whether including baryonic physics with these models can better explain observational data, or can be ruled out, or more tightly constrained. Within these goals, the PI and collaborators published 5 peer-reviewed journal articles during the lifetime of the award.    (1) Both the Milky Way and Andromeda have a thin plane of satellite galaxies that orbit them, which seems to be difficult to explain in CDM. We find that satellites are more likely to be destroyed by interacting with the Milky Way?s disk when baryons are included.  No disk forms in dark matter-only simulations. The destruction of satellite galaxies leads to planes that are much more statistically significant compared to a random distribution. We can simulate planes of satellites that are as thin and extended as those in the Milky Way and Andromeda. However, we don't find these satellites are predominantly orbiting together, at odds with the observations.  (2) Observationally, there are not as many low mass galaxies with that rotate at a given velocity as are predicted within CDM. We measured velocities of simulated galaxies in as similar a way as possible to observations, and demonstrated that this apples-to-apples comparison yields "observed" velocities that are much lower than predicted in CDM. We conclude that there are no missing dwarf galaxies in CDM. The abundance of dwarfs predicted in CDM can be made to match the observations once observational biases are accounted for.   (3) We included gas and stars within a warm dark matter (WDM) model and showed that the formation of the first stars is delayed in WDM models.  The lack of star formation within the first billion years of the Universe is inconsistent with current observational data from stellar populations in dwarf galaxies.  (4) Simulations show that including energetic processes like supernovae can drive gas from galaxies (which is also seen in observations), and that this outflow of gas also changes the gravitational structure of galaxies, pushing some of the dark matter out of the centers of galaxies.  Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) could also push dark matter out of the central regions. We showed that, even if dark matter is self-interacting, supernova start this process first.  The result is that, at the present day, models with either CDM or SIDM that include supernovae look identical.  This means there are currently no observations that rule out self-interactions in dark matter, opening a whole range of new models that need to be explored.  (5) We explored whether the physics of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is affected in SIDM, and showed that there is a delay for SMBHs to sink to the center of their host galaxies in SIDM models, leading to the testable prediction that there should be an observed offset of SMBHs from their galaxy centers if dark matter is self-interacting.     Training: Through the entire three years of this award, the project has trained 3 undergraduates (1 woman, 1 underrepresented minority, 1 undergraduate honors thesis), 1 graduate student, and 2 postdocs (2 women).     Outreach: The PI participated in multiple public outreach talks each year.  We also developed large posters to distribute amongst colleagues that visualize the simulations and capture the imagination. We made movies of the simulations publicly available, and data from the simulations was made available upon request.  Curriculum: The PI developed curriculum that introduces students to the super- computing environment. This curriculum not only prepares majors for research, but introduces students to advanced computational architecture, data analysis, and modeling that trains them for future employment opportunities. The resulting materials (and improvements that are made as students provide feedback) will be made available publicly via webpage.
