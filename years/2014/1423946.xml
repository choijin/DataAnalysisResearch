<AbstractNarration>International Nongovernmental Organizations' (INGO) focus advocacy efforts on some issues and not others, and the extent of harm does not explain this variation.  INGOs mobilize around some issues of moral concern, but neglect others with similar objective characteristics. The project will test potential explanations of variation in attention to issues via a mixed methods research design that explores INGO advocacy effort in the two issue areas of global health and armed conflicts, both matters of great public import. INGOS' choice of problems and strategies is important to understand because INGOs have long been recognized as potent drivers of international normative change.  Through their practices they have made critical contributions to compliance with international legal standards, particularly significant given the difficulty in enforcing international norms. This project develops a theory of INGO advocacy choices that emphasizes the constraints and strategic considerations affecting their behavior. The project hypothesizes that institutional survival motives incentivize INGOs to respond to the preferences of their donor constituency, as well as to the expected likelihood of their demands? realization. In addition, the theory underlines the importance of micro level dynamics.   INGOs' agendas evolve in a path dependent way, where previous choices constrain and enable current agenda. Next, this project hypothesizes that issues gain organizational support because organizations are more likely to do what other organizations do.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To analyze the activism of INGOs, reasons for their issue choice, and path dependence, this project constructs the first quantitative database allowing for the statistical analysis of issue-specific INGO activism. The database will be useful for those who wish to understand how INGOs choose issues, an important question for many policymakers.</AbstractNarration>

We have seen significant activism efforts around tuberculosis, but not pneumonia; the Gujarat earthquake of 2005, but not the Kashmiri one; the Darfur conflict, but not the Eritrean-Ethiopian war. To address these puzzling patterns, this dissertation developed a theory of INGO activism as a good produced in a stylized moral economy characterized by the preferences of INGOs&rsquo; donor constituencies and the technologies available to INGOs. I examine two accounts of donors&rsquo; activism preferences: the first, which I call the cosmopolitan concern position, predicts that the causes most likely to be championed by international activists are those implicating the bodily harm or legal equality of vulnerable or innocent populations. I argue that this view, although well established, generates a series of anomalies, and therefore propose a modified account of the demand pressures facing INGOs. Drawing on recent work by moral psychologists, I propose we should expect donors to be partial to the wellbeing of those similar or familiar to themselves, and as such argue for the social proximity view of demand for activism as an important influence on INGOs&rsquo; issue selections. In addition, I expect INGOs&rsquo; issue choices to be influenced by demand-driven compassion fatigue, leading INGOs to prioritize novel crises and concerns over long-term problems. I characterize the moral economy&rsquo;s supply side in terms of the direct and indirect costs of activism, but argue that &mdash;because I expect INGO constituencies&rsquo; demand for activism to be comparatively inelastic and accountability toward the final beneficiaries of INGOs&rsquo; actions weak&mdash; equilibrium activism allocations are not likely to reflect a concern with such cost considerations. I test these arguments in three issue areas (global health, natural disasters, and armed conflicts) using a mixed-methods approach. My quantitative analyses rely on a new text corpus consisting of approximately 90,000 publications issued by 43 major INGOs, making possible, for the first time, the systematic tracing of INGOs&rsquo; issue prioritizations using quantitative text analyses tools. Using these methods, I find strong support for the social proximity view across all issue areas I investigate.</p> <p>The global health analyses showed that INGOs exert more activism effort on diseases that disproportionately affect wealthy US states, and a comparative case study on tuberculosis and pneumonia highlighted that the difference between the two diseases&rsquo; activism trajectories is best explained by a largely unexpected tuberculosis outbreak in the United States that shrank the psychological distance between the disease&rsquo;s path and key INGO constituencies. My analyses of INGOs&rsquo; responses to armed conflicts similarly suggested that the organizations systematically prioritize countries with large immigrant communities in the United States, and that this relationship strengthened in these groups&rsquo; income. Across all issue areas, I also find a robust relationship between the salience of issues in US media outlets, and the in-depth examination of this relationship in the issue area of natural disasters provides strong grounds for interpreting this relationship as causal.</p> <p>Together, these findings amount to an important qualification of the expectations formulated by the cosmopolitan concern hypothesis. In fact, the quantitative analyses consistently implied that we should expect changes in issues&rsquo; social proximity to trigger a larger INGO response than changes in issues&rsquo; objective gravity. In the global health analyses, I found some evidence to suggest that INGOs respond positively to diseases disproportionately affecting children (but not overall disease mortality), but noted that the estimated coefficients were smaller than each of the proximity variables considered in the same model. The number of fatalities and affected survivors showed an even weaker influence on INGO activism toward natural disasters. The strongest relationship between INGOs&rsquo; issue selections and the forces of cosmopolitan concern arose in the context of armed conflicts, where my results suggest that changes in battle deaths and the size of wealthy immigrant communities are expected to lead to similar adjustments in INGOs&rsquo; efforts. However, I also show that this result has to be qualified because the influence of battle fatalities is not constant across conflicts&rsquo; life cycle. In line with the compassion fatigue hypothesis, INGOs respond strongly to conflict severity only at conflicts&rsquo; outsets, and actually show either no, or dampened, responses to fatalities that occur after an average conflict duration of two years. I documented that, on average, INGO activism on armed conflicts peaks around 1.5 years after conflicts&rsquo; beginning, while noting that conflicts in countries with large US immigrant communities are able to sustain INGOs&rsquo; attention significantly longer.
