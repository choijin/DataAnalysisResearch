<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to engage stakeholders from the branches of science represented by the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate at the NSF -- astronomy, chemistry, materials research, mathematics and physics -- into an active dialogue aimed at making publicly available the results of scientific research sponsored by NSF. Scientists with a broad variety of expertise will come together for a series of workshops to discuss the possibilities of scientific and educational reuse of data (which data is useful and what should be preserved?), the cyberinfrastructure needs for making data publicly available (what data access methods are required, what sort of accompanying metadata will be needed for easy access, and what are the parameters of the necessary archival storage?) and the commonality aspects of public access (how much of the existing infrastructure can serve multiple disciplines?) The answers to these questions are expected to be discipline dependent, but promoting a dialogue between communities is necessary in order to identify best practices and cost-effective solutions to serve the community needs and to help pave the way to a world with broad public access to scientific data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Making research data broadly available opens the scientific enterprise to citizen scientists and other researchers and enhances the potential for discovery. Recognizing that the transition from the Digital Age to the Big Data Age provides also the technical means needed to make public the research data from a wide variety of scientific inquiries, the workshops supported by this project will work towards a framework by which public access can be accomplished. Economies of scale are expected by combining projects and infrastructure across various disciplines. As such, this effort will identify new opportunities for interdisciplinary research by emphasizing the dataset and metadata interoperability in the design of archival systems.</AbstractNarration>

This report is a direct result of consultation with the research communities funded by the Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) Directorate at the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Executive Summary  This report contains a broad discussion of open access to data and what this might imply for researchers funded by the NSF?s MPS directorate. The potential benefits of public access and sharing of data are recognized by many segments of the research community. However, during the deliberations encompassed by this project a broad consensus emerged that the MPS research culture, data management tools, and archives infrastructures are not ready at this time for a move to requiring public access to all MPS research data. One concrete step that the MPS community is willing to take at this time is represented by the following statement: Data and other digital artifacts upon which publications are based should be made publicly available in a digital, machine-readable format, and persistently linked to those relevant publications. This is the first in a series of steps outlined in this report as a roadmap toward achieving the potential future goal of making research data reusable. An implementation of this step would already represent significant progress toward that goal and would demonstrate a commitment to public access on the part of the MPS community. A second conclusion that can be drawn from the discussions of this project is that, unsurprisingly, different disciplines have a wide variety of current practices and expectations for appropriate levels of the sharing of data and other scientific results. A discipline-specific policy discussion will be required to determine an appropriate level of preservation and re-use.  A third conclusion is that the provision of public access to data entails costs in infrastructure and human effort, and that some types of data may be impractical to archive, annotate, and share. Cost-benefit analyses should be conducted in order to set the level of expectations for the researcher, his or her institution, and the funding agency. Finally, there was a consensus that creating incentives toward the sharing of data is the primary way to accomplish broad adoption of open access to data as the norm.  Activities related to the preservation of data and other research products for public access are not sufficiently recognized and encouraged within current reward structures, nor are there sufficient tools to make data preservation and sharing easy. Incentives can come in many forms, from changes in hiring and tenure practices to guidelines or requirements by publishers and funding agencies.  Combining many different forms of inducement will be necessary to move entire research communities towards widespread data sharing.  The four conclusions presented above represent the main concerns of the MPS community regarding issues of public access to research data at this time. Rather than conclude at this point, however, the workshop participants wished to present a forward-looking vision of what an open science future might look like, and suggest some strategies for attaining this vision.  The future envisioned here is one where re-use of research data is the norm, and the necessary tools and infrastructure are in place to maximize the scientific potential of research data by sharing it with others.
