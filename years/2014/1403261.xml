<AbstractNarration>This award supports ongoing research on the dynamics of binary systems in general relativity, and research on astronomy with gravitational wave observations.  This work will further our understanding of how black holes in binary systems interact with one another, and how the signals that will soon be measured with gravitational-wave detectors like LIGO are generated. As part of this work, gravitational wave signals are converted to sound ("sonification") to create powerful tools for illustrating the impact of gravitational waves for astronomy. Media content will be produced to illustrate how black holes' shapes are dynamically distorted by the tidal field of an orbiting body. This is done not only as part of the dynamical studies but also for communicating the science of gravitational-wave sources to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific projects pursued in this time frame are a mix of studies using black hole perturbation theory, and studies in support of astronomy with the LIGO gravitational wave detectors. Black hole perturbation theory will be studied in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Maryland and Germany to revise and extend the very successful "effective one body" (EOB) approach to compact binary dynamics. Work in this program so far has done much to clarify how interactions with a black hole's event horizon affect the evolution of compact binary. Future work will begin to probe orbits with substantial spin-orbit misalignment, laying the groundwork for using the EOB framework on a larger family of astrophysically relevant orbits. Black hole perturbation theory will also be used to understand as precisely as possible how a black hole is distorted by an orbiting body, and how momentary resonances between orbital frequencies can change the system's evolution. In the domain of gravitational wave astronomy, neutron star fluid instabilities will be studied to find out whether they can significantly affect the ability of LIGO and sister instruments to detect binary inspiral. Even if the claimed effect turns out to be incorrect, this will be a valuable exercise in assessing how robust are the techniques that will be used for binary inspiral. Another project will investigate how precisely the calibration of each LIGO instrument must be known in order to accurately pin down the sky position of coalescing binaries. Searching for counterparts to these events with telescopes has become an extremely hot topic in recent years; making sure that LIGO can accurately tell telescopes where to look is crucial for insuring that these searches are fruitful.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award continued support for our research group's study of strong-gravity systems in general relativity.  The major goal of our work has been to understand how strong-gravity binaries (especially those containing black holes) evolve in general relativity, and how their properties are imprinted upon the gravitational waves that these systems generate.  The funds from this award supported several research projects and one major outreach project.  The outreach project was a variant of "Celebrating Einstein," a multimedia science festival developed by Nicolas Yunes and colleagues at Montana State University.  We integrated their program into the 2015 Cambridge Science Festival.  Our variant had 6 major events: Einstein in the Classroom (which brought about 50 volunteers into middle-school classrooms in the greater Boston area to teach a pair of lessons inspired by Einstein's science); Speaking of Einstein (a panel of distinguished guests discussing Einstein and his science and its implications in society before an audience of interested community members); Story Collider (a science-themed podcast that we took over for one show, with a lineup of gravity-themed stories); Black (W)hole (a black-hole-themed art installation developed at Montana State that was shipped to Cambridge for our festival); Science by the Pint (a series of public lectures by senior researchers, including the PI, in local pubs, followed by one-on-one discussions for a few hours with interested patrons); and A Shout Across Time (a multimedia event involving dance, a Q&amp;A with a researcher, and an orchestral accompaniment to an original film about Einstein).  Our event reached well over 1500 local students and members of the public.  We reprised Science by the Pint in spring 2016, capitalizing on interest in gravitational waves following the LIGO announcements.  During the lifetime of this grant, we focused on 4 specific research projects:  1. Tidal deformations of black hole horizons.  In a series of three papers (two of which were a major part of the PhD thesis of former student Stephen O'Sullivan), we showed how to use black hole perturbation theory to compute in great detail how a black hole's geometry is distorted by the tide of an orbiting companion, and how to visualize this distortion.  The image included with this report is an example taken from an animation we made of the dynamic variation of a black hole's horizon due to an orbiting body.  We have now essentially completed all aspects of this problem that we planned to investigate.  A future student may look into connections between this work and numerical relativity.  2. The self force. A small body orbiting a black hole feels a correction to the black hole's gravity due to its own modification of this gravity.  This correction includes the effect of gravitational waves, as well as additional small but important effects.  During this award, we learned how to adapt our group's black hole perturbation theory codes to compute this force, and have begun investigating how well and how effectively it can be computed.  Understanding the self force has proven to be quite important for making the precise analytic models of binary evolution that are used in gravitational-wave data analysis, and will crucial for future space-based gravitational-wave detectors.  Some of this work will be continued under this award's successor.  3. The role of spin in binary evolution.  In general relativity, a body's spin changes the nature of its gravity, driving precessional effects as well as modulating the gravitational force it exerts and it feels.  As a major part of the PhD thesis of former student Uchupol Ruangsri, we developed techniques for modeling the impact of these effects in a computationally effective way.  Future work will tie these results into other ongoing analyses of binary evolution.  4. The last waves from binary black hole coalescence.  Working with MIT undergraduate Anuj Apte, we developed a set of mathematical tools to allow us to compute the last waves that are generated when two black holes collide.  Our goal is to understand how the late spectrum of waves from such collisions depends upon the geometry of the collision.  This work will be a major focus of investigation for our group in the first year of this award's successor.  Two graduate students completed their PhD studies under this award.  In addition, four undergraduate students were supported by these funds.       Last Modified: 10/09/2017       Submitted by: Scott A Hughes]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
