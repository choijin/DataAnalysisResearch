<AbstractNarration>Dr. Linda Roman at the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, USA, is supported by the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry, for an International Collaboration in Chemistry (ICC) award that comprises an international collaboration with Dr. Anny Slama-Schwok, Professor Joanne Xie and Dr. Eric Deprez, who will be supported by Agence Nationale de la Recherche in France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is funding Dr. Linda Roman from the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio and Dr. Jung Ja Kim from the Medical College of Wisconsin to develop probes for and undertake an investigation of the mechanism of nitric oxide synthases.  The nitric oxide synthases (NOS) generate nitric oxide (NO), which plays key roles in many physiological processes. The endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) generates NO in the cardiovascular system, where it is a potent vasodilator.  Similarly, the neuronal isoform (nNOS) is involved in neurotransmission and skeletal and cardiac muscle function, and the inducible NOS (iNOS) is expressed in response to an immune challenge.  The investigators will study the mechanism of function of these enzymes with the use of customized photoactivatable probes. The ability to modulate the activities of these enzymes will help elucidate their physiological roles and regulation, as well as give insight into their mechanisms.  This pursuit will allow undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows to acquire specialized training in protein expression, purification, characterization, and in the use of X-ray diffraction to determine the protein structure.  Specific compounds that bind to the NOSs will also be designed to help achieve these goals, exposing trainees to synthetic chemistry techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the use of novel photoactivatable NADPH analogues, called nanotriggers (NTs), targeted to the NADPH site of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms and cytochrome P450 reductase (POR), to elucidate the mechanism of electron transfer through these enzymes as well as stabilize them in a closed conformation, facilitating crystallization. This project will: (1) determine the X-ray structure of various NT-protein complexes; (2) elucidate time-resolved structure/function studies of the first catalytic steps by kinetics studies in solution and time-resolved X-ray crystallography; (3) design novel isoform-specific eNOS activators by in silico simulations; and (4) monitor eNOS trafficking in cells by biphotonic excitation, due to the intrinsic imaging properties and specificity of the NT probes. The photoactive tools to be developed and characterized can trigger a specific catalytic event upon irradiation with a laser pulse. The laser pulse occurs at zero time, allowing for synchronization of initiation of catalysis, which can be monitored in a time-resolved manner. This proposal will develop new tools for time-resolved studies of selected proteins that overcome the limitation of slow (greater than or equal to ms) diffusion of the probe by binding directly to the protein with the ability to trigger catalysis by ultrafast electron injection to the protein. This approach represents a new tool to synchronize an ensemble of enzymes in solution induced by a laser pulse and represents an alternative to single molecule studies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Dr. Roman:  We are developing compounds, called nanotriggers (NTs), to study several important proteins - the NOSs, which are involved in neurotransmission and hemodynamic control, and POR, which is involved in steroid and drug metabolism, along with other important functions in vit D and retinoic acid metabolism and bile formation.  Defects in all of these proteins have been linked to human diseases.  Since these proteins all use NADPH for their function, the NTs take advantage of the structural features that make NADPH bind to these proteins.  The development of these tools will allow us to study the enzymatic mechanisms, cellular localization, and perhaps modifications of these enzymes and, eventually, allow us to modulate their activites.  Through the course of this grant, we have purified large amounts of these proteins, expressed and purified truncated versions, and characterized the binding of fifteen different NTs, designed and synthesized by our collaborators in France, to our proteins.  Most of the NTs bound successfully and with reasonable affinity, demonstrating clear proof of principle for our approach.  Attempts to make NTs that bind more tightly to eNOS over nNOS were less successful, although this project is still ongoing with our collaborators in France.  Dr. Kim: We are studying the details of NADPH-binding to cytochrome P450 reductase (POR) and nitric oxide synthase isozymes. Our results will reveal the mode of NADPH binding to the proteins, both specific for each protein (POR and NOS isozymes) and common features to other similar proteins, including methionine synthase reductase and cancer related novel reductase 1.  Although current NT/NS compounds our collaborators have synthesized so far clearly bind to NOS proteins, we were not able to obtain a clear, very detailed  picture of how these compounds bind to NOS proteins.  However, we now have a much better idea what part(s) of these NT compounds are important for binding to NOS enzymes.  Using these new data, our collaborators in France continue their studies in developing new, Improved  NT compounds.
