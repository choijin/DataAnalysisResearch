<AbstractNarration>**Non-Technical Description**&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Condensed Matter Physics Program of the Division of Materials Research supports Yale University with a project to develop novel chemical doping methods for topological insulator nanostructures to alleviate current materials challenges facing the field. Topological insulators possess exotic conducting surface states that can be used as information carriers that do not generate wasted heat.  Thus topological insulators can replace current copper interconnects, resulting in great reduction of energy consumption for the society. This research will bring the realization of topological insulators as alternative interconnects one step closer to reality. Additionally, the methods can be successfully applied to two-dimensional, layered semiconductors to create dilute magnetic semiconductors for much broader impact for the society. Dilute magnetic semiconductors are widely studied for spintronics applications. The work contributes to the training of skilled technical workforce and contains elements for new course development on nanomaterials. In addition, the project promotes the participation of underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;**Technical Description**&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Condensed Matter Physics Program of the Division of Materials Research to Yale University supports a project to develop novel chemical methods to dope topological insulator nanomaterials with magnetic impurities, and to open a band gap in the topological surface states. Two chemical methods are investigated. The first method employs intercalation of magnetic atoms, ions, and molecules at the Van der Waals gap of layered topological insulators. The second method employs surface modification of topological insulator nanostructures with molecular spins. These methods exhibit significant advantages over conventional doping methods: 1) higher concentration of magnetic dopants, 2) no clustering of magnetic dopants, 3) spatial ordering of magnetic dopants into anti-ferromagnetism or ferromagnetism, and 4) broad applicability to other two-dimensional layered materials. Nanodevices will be fabricated to measure magnetotransport at low temperature to characterize the doping. The successful outcome of this research will lead to a materials platform in which fundamental condensed matter physics phenomena can be explored to advance knowledge in band gap in topological surface states, in topological magneto-electric effect, and quantum anomalous Hall effect. It is anticipated that the methodology developed in this project can be general. The research involves training undergraduate students to conduct research independently, developing new components for a nanotechnology course, and dissemination of knowledge through publications and conference presentations and outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The scientific goal of the project was to explore how intercalation, a chemical route to insert ions, atoms, and molecules into the host material at the gaps, can change the properties of the host material.  In particular, intercalation of magnetic dopants such as iron, cobalt, and chromium atoms was studied on a topological insulator, bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3), a two-dimensional layered semiconductor, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), and a two-dimensional layered semi-metal, tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) in order to change their magnetic properties.  A potential benefit of intercalation compared to traditional doping for changing magnetic properties of these materials is higher concentrations and uniform distribution of the magnetic dopants inside the host materials.  During the project, a direct chemical synthesis of large area WTe2 thin films and heterostructure MoS2/WS2 thin films was achieved to demonstrate scalability of the layered semi-metal and semiconductors.  In addition to studying effects of intercalation, how surface oxidation affects the electrical transport properties of these layered materials was studied carefully.  Using WTe2 as a model system, increasing contribution of the surface oxide layer to degrade the electrical transport properties was shown with decreasing thickness of the WTe2 sample.  The effects of surface oxidation on electron transport properties are important to study as electronic devices continue to be thinner, down to the single layer unit that are only a few atoms thick.     Broader Impacts  The project aimed to develop novel doping methods for topological insulator nanostructures and other two-dimensional materials to alleviate current materials challenges related to magnetic doping.  The developed intercalation-based magnetic doping can create dilute magnetic semiconductors that can be used for spintronic applications.  Demonstration of large-scale layered materials is promising for practical electronic applications.  The project also contributed to the training of skilled technical workforce.   Undergraduate students from under-represented groups were involved in the project, gaining research experience and learning material characterization techniques.  Graduate students and postdoctoral scholars attended conferences to present results of the project.  The principal investigator gave science talks to the general public to share some of the latest developments in the condensed matter physics field.
