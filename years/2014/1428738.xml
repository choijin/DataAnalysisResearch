<AbstractNarration>Air quality and composition studies, especially of volatile organic compounds, their oxidation products leading to secondary aerosol  particle formation, are based on a detailed knowledge of the molecular identity and concentration of many chemical compounds. Given the complexity of, and often vanishingly small concentrations of key chemical intermediates, techniques such as high resolution mass spectrometry are preferred. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interdisciplinary group at Georgia Tech jointly engaged in atmospheric chemistry, aerosols, clouds, climate, and air quality research will acquire a commercial instrument, a  Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols  High Resolution Time-of-Flight Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer (FIGAERO-HR-ToF-CIMS). This instrument will advance research in atmospheric trace gases/aerosols/clouds/air quality, expose undergraduate and graduate students to state-of-the-art mass spectrometric techniques, and serve as a locus to increase diversity in science and engineering at Georgia Tech.</AbstractNarration>
