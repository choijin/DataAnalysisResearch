<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Critical to efforts for optimizing organic optoelectronic devices, biological membranes, and drug delivery applications is an understanding of the thermodynamics that control nanometer-scale self-assembly in specially designed polymeric materials.  This is an integrated research program aimed at understanding the thermodynamics of self-assembly of block copolymers where molecular rigidity and semi-crystallinity affect the polymer nanostructure and charge transport properties.  An important component of this project involves several integrated educational activities.  Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in forefront areas of materials science, participate in local and national meetings, and interact closely with collaborators in the process of performing this research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rod-coil block copolymers play a central role in many recent efforts to optimize organic optoelectronic devices, but it is clear that structure must be controlled on multiple length scales ranging from the atomic spacing in a crystalline lattice to the 10 nm length scale of block copolymer self-assembly and the 100 nm to micron scale of the device.  Critical to these efforts is an understanding of how these interactions occurring over drastically different length scales work in combination.   The goals of this project involve the synthesis and self assembly of conjugated block copolymers, gaining a fundamental understanding of phase separation in these rod-coil block copolymers, and understanding the interplay of structural effects on charge mobility.  In the longer term, this fundamental understanding will be used to guide the design of semiflexible block copolymers and ultimately impact fields such as organic optoelectronics and biomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interplay between backbone shape, block copolymer self-assembly, crystallinity, and semiconducting properties is crucial both for a fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships as well as for the future design of optimized materials with controllable properties. Here, synthetic design and self-assembly of conjugated rod-coil block copolymers will be utilized to: (a) Develop a detailed understanding of the relationship between chain shape, crystallinity, and charge mobility in conjugated polymers (particularly polythiophene derivatives);  (b) Understand the rules associated with achieving confined crystallization in conjugated rod-coil block copolymers and the detailed morphology of crystals within these nanodomains, and  (c) Probe the roles of semi-flexible rods and the balance between liquid-crystalline and block-copolymer interactions on conjugated block copolymer self-assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

For some materials &ndash; particularly polymers that can conduct electricity &ndash; patterning over this length scale may result in significant improvements in polymer performance. Past work in our group has studied how differences in the shape of these functional polymer molecules from traditionally studied polymers affects the self-assembly. In particular, polymer molecules that are stiffer can align and as a result, they only assemble into sheet-like structures. <sup>1,2</sup> Further, conduction in many of the best performing electrically conductive polymers &ndash; in particular, the polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) &ndash; relies on crystallinity.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this crystallinity also interferes with the self-assembly that results in nanopatterning. Over the course of this NSF award, we have worked on understanding how the crystallinity can be balanced with the self-assembly of the block copolymer as a whole.</p> <p>In particular, we sought to establish systems in which both nanopatterning and crystallization were simultaneous present to achieve nanostructured, conducting materials.&nbsp;&nbsp; By using a similar semiconducting polymer, poly(3-(2&rsquo;-ethyl)hexylthiophene) (P3EHT) in a block copolymer, we showed that we can form organized nanostructures that crystallize and allow good electronic properties (Figure 1).<sup>3</sup> P3EHT also served as a good platform for understanding conjugated polymer crystallization.<sup>4-10</sup> As a function of temperature, P3EHT crystals become better ordered; also, the edges of the crystals consist of stiff chains, called a rigid amorphous fraction.<sup>4,5</sup> This discovery of a rigid amorphous fraction in electronically conducting polymers is significant because the chains bridging between polymer crystals are important for long-range conductivity. We have also studied how the molecular differences between P3HT and P3EHT lead to differences in how the chains pack into crystals that are important for their electronic transport properties.<sup>6</sup> To understand how the block copolymer nanostructures impact the polymer crystallization, we made nanopatterned block copolymers with P3EHT where the second block was either a glassy or a rubbery material (Figure 2).<sup>8</sup> We found that in order to form high quality crystals, the P3EHT&nbsp;chains need to both straighten out and become more closely packed; they accomplish this more successfully when the second material is rubbery at the temperature the polymer crystallizes (Figure 3).<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;When the block copolymer assembles into a curved structure, the curvature influences the orientation of the crystal which could have profound impacts on how charge moves (Figure 4).<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the course of this NSF award, we have presented rules regarding how the self-assembly of electronically active polymers in block copolymers and the crystallinity of those polymers are linked. This insight is expected to lead to new design rules for nanostructured semiconducting plastics with higher conductivities.&nbsp; This is likely to impact applications such as organic light emitting diodes, organic photovoltaics, and organic thermoelectrics.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the period of this grant, 3 graduate students have been trained, two of whom are now independent researchers.&nbsp; We have also conducted significant outreach activities at all levels of education. Graduate students in the Segalman lab are involved with outreach programs in which students host interactive demonstrations explaining nanoscience, shape memory materials, and bioinspired materials to elementary and middle school students. Graduate students have also mentored undergraduate (and community college transfer student) Christian Gomez through a project in which he designed custom experimental equipment for in-situ solvent vapor annealing studies in the group.
