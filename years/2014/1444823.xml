<AbstractNarration>Software vulnerabilities are a substantial problem that exists in part due to programmer errors. A common cause is that programmers have a cognitive gap between their understanding of what actions code will perform and the actual actions the code performs. This work takes a first step toward rigorously understanding how humans think about code to (eventually) help to dramatically reduce bugs by building more human understandable programming languages and programs. This project will perform a pilot study to determine how to understand such security bugs, tease out the key aspects of them, and integrate this understanding into expert tutoring systems to help programmers detect them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cognitive science techniques will be used to derive the core contributing issues in existing security vulnerabilities by slicing vulnerabilities into their component parts and evaluating the resulting bugs. This will create a generalized understanding of security issues which will enable easy reproduction and replication of similar source code, which is ideal input for an expert tutoring tool. The resulting expert tutoring tool will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of tutoring in helping programmers reduce reduce their susceptibility to similar bugs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Atoms of Confusion project was initiated to identify the potential root causes of developer misunderstandings about software code. The research team started with a hypothesis that developers often struggle to understand the code they maintain and implement because of patterns within the code itself. We labeled this sense of misunderstanding as "confusion," and further defined that term as what happens when a developer anticipates a different output when a piece of code is run than what a computer would actually deliver.    The importance of the project lies largely in the consequences it seeks to prevent. The type of confusion described above can be costly, both in economic and human terms, as misunderstandings can easily lead to compromisable flaws.  Over the last three years, the team has identified small, self-contained patterns within lines of code as a source of this confusion. Through the use of empirical, objective techniques, and data collected through carefully constructed user studies, we have identified 15 of these patterns that we have named "Atoms of Confusion." With our hypothesis that the source of the confusion was in the code itself confirmed, the second year has been devoted to the "whys, hows, and whats" behind what we have found. In additional studies, we've begun to measure a number of factors that can affect levels of confusion, including where the atoms are located within a piece of code and the potential influence of native languages on programmer perceptions. The last year of the project has been focused on whether the confusion state can be measured through human brainwaves. This enhanced knowledge of what makes atoms confusing can form the groundwork for methods that can help developers avoid their use, and remove them when discovered. The existing knowledge of these atoms inspires several directions, including better detection of the atoms, the greater impact of the atoms in software comprehension and software security.
