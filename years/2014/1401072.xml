<AbstractNarration>1401072&lt;br/&gt;Boppart&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference funding application is to support the registration fees and/or travel costs of conference participants including graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and among these,under-represented groups, so that they may attend the Gordon Conference on Lasers in Medicine and Biology, to be held July 13-18, 2014 at the Holderness School, Holderness, New Hampshire. &lt;br/&gt;In this Gordon Research Conference (GRC), there are 9 technical sessions covering topics that have been determined by the co-chairs, co-vice-chairs, and general community to be innovate, impactful, scientifically relevant, progressive, and expected to be critical for the future of the field and the future of medicine and biology. These sessions also provide a broad and comprehensive coverage of the biophotonics field, while giving focus to some rapidly emerging sub-fields. Sessions are balanced between being more fundamental in nature, with others more applied toward current and future biomedical needs. The oral presentations in all the sessions will be given by invited national and international experts, and all invited speakers have already confirmed their participation. The theme for the 2014 GRC is ?From Basic Science Discovery to Translational Applications?. This theme was chosen based on attendee feedback in prior years, identifying the need to emphasize basic principles and fundamental discoveries in optics, imaging science, biology, and medical science, as well as establish and demonstrate clear applications and pathways that showcase how these discoveries can be translated via technological and engineeringbased solutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Gordon Research Conference on LASERS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY was held at the Holderness School, Holderness, NH, July 13-18th, 2014.  The Conference was well-attended with 169 participants.  The attendees represented the spectrum of endeavor in this field coming from academia, industry, and government laboratories, both U.S. and foreign scientists, senior researchers, young investigators, and students.  Of the 169 attendees, 72 voluntarily responded to a general inquiry regarding ethnicity which appears on our registration forms.  Of the 72 respondents, 23% were Minorities - 6% Hispanic, 17% Asian, and 0% African American.  Approximately 25% of the participants at the 2014 meeting were women.  In designing the formal speaker program, emphasis was placed on current unpublished research and discussion of the future target areas in this field.  There was a conscious effort to stimulate lively discussion about the key issues in the field today.  Time for formal presentations was limited in the interest of group discussions.  In order that more scientists could communicate their most recent results, poster presentation time was scheduled.  A formal schedule and speaker program was developed in addition to a poster program.  In addition to these formal interactions, "free time" was scheduled to allow informal discussions.  Such discussions are fostering new collaborations and joint effort in the field.       Last Modified: 09/15/2014       Submitted by: Stephen A Boppart]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
