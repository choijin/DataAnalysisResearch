<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship supported the PI's work in algebraic number theory.  One of the deepest conjectures in this area is called the Langlands program.  It relates two seemingly unrelated areas in a profound way, and can be thought of as a duality statement.  The first area is the study of automorphic forms, which can be thought of as functions on simple regions (like the points contained in a circle in the complex plane) that have a very surprising amount of symmetry coming from arithmetic origins.  The second is the study of integer solutions to equations.  The common thread is that both of these areas give rise to L-functions, which are functions that encode arithmetic information for each prime number.  Starting from early works of Euler, Riemann, Dirichlet, and Dedekind, identifying the values of these L-functions at integers has proven to be a central topic in number theory.  The famous conjectures of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer, Deligne, Borel, Beilinson, and Bloch-Kato make increasingly general predictions regarding these values.  These predictions are formulated in terms of solutions to equations rather than automorphic forms.  After Beilinson made his conjecture in the early 80's, there was substantial progress in two cases to generalize the class number formula of Dirichlet and Dedekind to higher dimensions.  A core idea in Beilinson's work was to move the questions into the automorphic setting using ideas from the Langlands program.  However, further progress was stalled for some time.  The PI's postdoctoral work is part of a new resurgence of interest during the past six years in this and related questions.  Intellectual Merit  Early in the fellowship, the PI completed two projects with Aaron Pollack that gave ways of representing two very interesting L-functions as integrals: the spinor L-functions on symplectic similitude groups acting on four and six-dimensional symplectic spaces.  This yielded some immediate consequences for the Langlands program, including, using earlier work of Wee Teck Gan and Nadya Gurevich, a case of functoriality for the exceptional group G_2.  Moreover, the curious nature of the domain of integration meant that these integrals give rise to ``Beilinson-Flach elements'', meaning that they should allow one to access new cases of Beilinson's conjecture.  Beilinson-Flach elements were introduced by Bertolini, Darmon, and Rotger; their work kicked off the aforementioned resurgence in progress on special value conjectures.  More recently, there have been a number of works of Kings, Lei, Loeffler, Skinner, and Zerbes that aim to extend techniques of Kato in order to use each existing construction of such elements to prove new cases of the Iwasawa main conjecture.  During the postdoctoral fellowship, Aaron Pollack and the PI applied an old construction of Gelbart and Piatetski-Shapiro together with an entirely new one to prove two new cases of higher class number formulae: (1) for arithmetic quotients of the unit ball in two-dimensional complex space and (2) for arithmetic quotients of a four-dimensional space called the Hermitian upper half-plane.  Moreover, they were able to extend these results to apply to the compactified versions of these statements by applying the relative Fourier-Mukai transform, a deep technique from algebraic geometry.  Another new link in this work is to connect the non-vanishing of certain integrals to conjectures of Gan-Gross-Prasad in representation theory.  Broader Impact  The PI delivered many expository lectures at Columbia University aimed at graduate students in number theory and related fields during the tenure of the fellowship.  He also gave a talk aimed at introducing his research area to starting students, delivered an interactive primer on cryptography for underprivileged middle school students during Sonya Kovalevsky day, and informally advised many undergraduate and graduate students on topics such as career advice, teaching, work-life balance, and graduate school, postdoctoral, and fellowship applications.
