<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative recruitment and retention strategies and experiences in support of groups historically under-represented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  The Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity provides support for postbaccalaureate studies in STEM programs leading to the STEM doctoral degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Delaware State University, a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) and NSF Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) institution, is the host site for the 2014-2016 (Cohort XII) BD program for the Greater Philadelphia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation under the leadership of Drexel University.  The program supports a graduate student cohort of 12 underrepresented minority (URM) STEM Ph.D. students from LSAMP campuses across the nation.  The BD Activity provides extensive training in specific STEM disciplines as well as professional development and guidance that promote peer mentoring and leadership in the scientific community.  Students receive rigorous academic and research training experiences that support completion of the Ph.D. and the transition to a competitive career in academia and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the duration of the project and beyond, the BD program at DSU serves to increase the number and quality of students from underrepresented groups completing STEM Ph.D. degrees and entering the professoriate.  It enhances partnerships, research collaborations, and articulation strategies between an HBCU and several major majority-serving research institutions within the Greater Philadelphia alliance as well as national laboratories.  The project activities have the potential to develop a model approach which may be viable for use by Masters-level, minority-serving institutions to promote the movement of students from underrepresented groups through to STEM doctoral completion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term impact of the BD activity is reflected in America's STEM workforce,&lt;br/&gt;both in academia and in industrial research and development. By nurturing the future&lt;br/&gt;professoriate, as well as the scientific workforce, the value added is seen in the&lt;br/&gt;visibility of minorities in science and engineering, increasing representation and&lt;br/&gt;providing role models and motivation for the next generation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Drexel University, as a representative of the Greater Philadelphia Region Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (Philadelphia AMP), was awarded Bridge to the Doctorate funding for a two-year period for a Cohort XII program, to expand and  intensify the consortium?s on-going efforts to substantially increase the number of qualified African American, Hispanic and Native American (hereafter referred to as "minority") students entering graduate study in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), attaining doctoral degrees, and moving into the professoriate. The Philadelphia AMP represents a diverse alliance of nine institutions consisting of public and private, 2- and 4-year research and non-research, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and majority institutions.  Delaware State University (DSU) was selected to host the Bridge to the Doctorate Cohort XII activities due to the recent growth of DSU?s research capacity, external funding, and extensive collaborations with research-intensive institutions.  The latter activities, combined with the knowledge it has gained in hosting the BTD Cohort IV, VI and VII programs, as well as its four new Ph.D. programs (in Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, Applied Chemistry, Optics, and Neuroscience) which had begun producing Ph.D. graduates, demonstrated DSU?s emerging strength in STEM research and graduate education. This choice also supported the Alliance?s paradigm shift which involved the convening of HBCUs as the candidacy pool of Ph.D.-granting institutions, and the bolstering of the research capacity of its HBCU institution as part of its systemic change initiatives.  The goals of Philadelphia AMP's Bridge to the Doctorate (Cohort XII) program were to: (1) recruit twelve students into Master's or Ph.D. degree programs at Delaware State University (DSU); (2) retain these students through the completion of the Master's or Ph.D. program, providing the Master?s students with full qualifications for admission into a highly regarded Ph.D. program in their chosen STEM specialty with full financial support; (3) enable the Master?s students? admission and smooth transition into a Ph.D. program; and (4) monitor all student progress through Ph.D. completion and subsequent employment in industry and/or academia.  To date, the BTD Cohort XII project has retained twelve (12) program participants (100%). The average cumulative GPA of the retained BTD Cohort XII fellows as of Summer 2017 was 3.59; seven (7 or 58%) fellows achieved a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or above, and two (2) of the latter fellows also continued to maintain a 4.0. As of August, 2017, eleven (11 or 92%) of the twelve (12) fellows enrolled in the BTD Cohort XII project received their M.S. degree within two years. The one student who has not completed her MS degree is on track to finish in December 2017.  Hence, the BTD Cohort XII program was successful in substantially increasing the technical STEM competence of the BTD fellowship recipients as demonstrated by their increased performance, retention and progression. As of Fall 2017, five (5) fellows (or 45%) have already transitioned into Ph.D. programs at the following institutions: Delaware State University (1 fellow); University of Delaware (2 fellows); Virginia Tech (1 fellow); and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (1 fellow).  The BTD Cohort XII fellows also helped to advance knowledge in the STEM disciplines through: a) the promotion of their research activity as active members of DSU?s scientific community, b) the dissemination of their research findings at both national and international conferences and professional meetings, and c) industry employment.  In addition, the BTD Cohort XII program helped to expand the breadth and diversity of research / investigative perspectives within the graduate scientific enterprise at DSU. It also: a) enabled the DSU to recruit and retain more underrepresented minority STEM students in graduate study by substantially expanding their capabilities to develop and support STEM student talent, and to better identify potentially talented students, and b) enhanced DSU's capability to boost STEM graduate student productivity by providing a systematic, wider, and more targeted array of technical training, academic support and professional development programs.   Broader impacts also included: (1) advancing knowledge in the STEM disciplines through the promotion of research activity and the dissemination of information about best practices used to promote the retention of students from underrepresented groups; and (2) enhancing the infrastructure for research and education through the development of support networks and partnerships within the Philadelphia AMP and beyond.
