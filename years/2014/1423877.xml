<AbstractNarration>The project addresses several critical questions about the connection between decision-making practices and democracy: How does participatory budgeting, a process in which a government sets aside part of a public budget for the community to allocate, impact patterns of political behavior and civic engagement in the communities where it is implemented? Are investments in new opportunities for public involvement in budgeting worthwhile? This project tests assertions about the democratic impact of small-scale governance reforms like participatory budgeting. It advances a new mid-level institutional theory of participatory budgeting that describes how a new set of rules around budgeting may enable new patterns of communication and mobilization within a political community. Using both qualitative and quantitative methods in a comparative evaluation of four cases of participatory budgeting in cities in the US and UK, this research provides a unique set of empirical tests of causal claims about the democratic effects of giving people the chance to directly control local budget decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project investigates fundamental claims about the democratic impact of narrowly defined participatory governance institutions like participatory budgeting. It integrates disparate but related literatures explaining civic engagement, political institutions, and democratic quality, empirically testing assertions advanced by value-based theories of democracy. In developing an institutional theory of how participatory budgeting may transform the political behavior and preferences of people in a community, this project makes a substantive contribution to ongoing debates within political science about the relationship between institutions and what is generally referred to as political culture, the general pattern of beliefs and behaviors that establish default orientations toward political practices in a community.  As a new empirical contribution, it also provides one of the first comparative evaluations of participatory budgeting to draw systematic cross-country comparisons in developed democracies. The project takes a much-needed step toward a general understanding of what distinguishes participatory budgeting as a common set of institutions and how these institutions operate within a political community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This research has several broader impacts. First, it is of direct interest and application to policy makers, government officials, and community leaders. Follow-up to fieldwork has also included distributing specially targeted reports from the research back to participants and local organizers of participatory budgeting processes so they can reflect on and incorporate the observations of their process. Second, this project supports the education of undergraduate students by giving them the chance for extensive research experience. Third, during field research, the Co-PI has been able to provide technical assistance to process organizers to improve their own internal research and evaluation capacity. Finally, this research directly contributes to the economic well-being of the country.  More efficient and responsive budgeting processes, as supported by effective and targeted implementation of participatory budgeting will have a direct impact on the economic health of urban areas in the US, by making cities more economically competitive and establishing a better environment for business development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project makes a key contribution to the improvement and extension of the co-PI?s PhD dissertation examining the implementation and impact of participatory budgeting (PB) processes at the local level in the US and the UK. Most research projects in this field so far have focused on describing individual participatory processes and how they affect the individuals involved.  The NSF funds provided in this grant allowed for two distinct research projects that together make a unique and important contribution to our understanding of the impact of local participatory governance reforms on the wider communities that implement them, rather than just the few people who are directly involved.  The first major research activity funded by this grant was the design and implementation of a comparative survey of community organizations in 5 cities in the US and the UK.

These results have important implications for multiple audiences, from policy makers deciding whether to implement reforms and practitioners curious which groups are being effectively reached by PB processes to scholars seeking to better understand the interaction between changes to formal institutional rules and the established patterns of civic life in communities.  The second activity funded by this grant was the implementation of a new computational approach to describing changes in local political culture (the norms and expectations that members of a community hold about citizenship), in order to better evaluate to what extent participatory innovations can reshape the democratic culture of a place.  Defining and measuring changes in political culture is an ongoing challenge for social scientists, especially when comparing communities across time and place. This project implemented a new approach that allows partial measurement of changes in political culture, using political discussion in local newspapers. I created a dataset of over 20,000 local newspaper articles and letters to the editor about politics from 2004-2016 in two cities struggling with bankruptcy and local investment in California: Vallejo, which implemented an ongoing PB process in 2012, and Stockton, which did not implement a PB process upon exiting bankruptcy.  Working with undergraduate research assistants, we were able to classify a random subset of these articles as mobilizing or demobilizing political speech.  I then use these classified articles to implement a supervised machine learning method to estimate changing proportions of mobilizing and demobilizing political speech over time in the two cities.  This project makes two major contributions to scholarship:  On the one hand, it provides a focused empirical test of claims that participatory budgeting can impact the nebulous "quality of democracy" in a city.  On the other hand, it introduces and explains a method of text analysis that provides new opportunities for comparative and/or historical analyses of cultural change relevant to many other research questions or disciplines.  Full analysis of the results of each project is ongoing as of the end of the final grant reporting period, but preliminary results for the core research questions about the impact of participatory budgeting suggest a) that participatory budgeting may, under the right conditions, have an impact on the frequency of interaction between community groups and local government and b) that implementing PB in Vallejo was associated with a positive trend in the relative frequency of mobilizing political speech that cannot simply be attributed to the city?s exit from bankruptcy.
