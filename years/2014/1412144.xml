<AbstractNarration>The scientists will numerically simulate the origin of star populations in our Galaxy. The study will include a novel approach to modeling star clusters directly in galaxy formation simulations. They seek to unravel several unsolved puzzles in our understanding of Galactic formation and evolution: (i) What caused multiple generations of stars within massive globular clusters? (ii) What is the fraction of halo stars stripped off globular clusters? (iii) Was the bulge assembled by early mergers or by gradual transformation of the Galactic disk? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They will implement the cluster formation and evolution model in the cosmological adaptive-mesh-refinement code (called ART) and run several realizations of Milky Way-sized galaxies with different environment and merger history. ART is a powerful galaxy formation code and already includes non-equilibrium cooling and heating of cosmic gas, non-equilibrium formation and dissociation of molecular hydrogen, thermal, kinetic, and radiative feedback of young stars, transport of ionizing radiation, and other important processes. Inclusion of clustered star formation will add a realistic description of stellar populations, with a well-defined stellar initial mass function and more concentrated feedback on the interstellar medium (ISM). The simulations will produce a rich data model, and will be used to interpret various observations of Galactic clusters and dwarf satellites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They will integrate the simulations into a program of state-of-the-art scientific visualizations of galaxy formation over cosmic time. The visualizations will be designed for display at the University of Michigan Planetarium, and will be viewed by thousands of elementary, middle and high school students in the Detroit metropolitan area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    In the course of this project PI Oleg  Gnedin and graduate student Hui Li have developed a novel algorithm for  modeling star formation in cosmological galaxy formation simulations.  It simultaneously follows the formation of  new star clusters and their feedback on the parent molecular cloud, similar to how observational astronomers see it. We created a suite of simulations of galaxies like the Milky Way and investigated the evolution of their star clusters. The  analysis of these simulations constituted the core of Li's PhD thesis.  After graduation he moved on to a postdoctoral position at MIT, to work  on ultrahigh-resolution simulations of molecular clouds. In 2019, Hui  was awarded a prestigious Hubble Fellowship to combine the modeling of cluster  formation with large-scale galaxy formation.  PI Gnedin continued analysis of this simulation suite with two current graduate students, Gillen Brown and Xi Meng. Brown and Gnedin  investigated the chemical evolution of simulated galaxies and the  origin of anomalous abundances of heavy elements in massive globular  clusters. Xi and Gnedin investigated the predicted structure of  high-redshift galaxies and the properties of their stellar populations.  In parallel, PI Gnedin and undergraduate student Nick Choksi  developed an analytical model for star cluster formation and evolution  that complements the simulations - it uses the formation rate derived  from the simulations as input but allows a much faster computation for  multiple globular cluster systems. We used this analytical model to  investigate the age and metallicity distributions of observable globular  clusters at the present time, the origin of the mass-metallicity  relation of massive metal-poor clusters, and the build-up of the  globular cluster-halo mass relation. The model has also been extended to  study the formation and merger rate of stellar-mass black hole binaries  in clusters (potential sources for detection by LIGO), and the  formation of millisecond pulsars (potential explanation for the diffuse  gamma-ray emission detected by Fermi Space Telescope around the center  of our Galaxy and the Andromeda galaxy).
