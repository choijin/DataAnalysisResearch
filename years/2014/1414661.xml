<AbstractNarration>Currently there is a great deal of interest in microscale robotics for many applications, such as drug delivery. From literature, it is clear that the main reasons why microrobototics has not yet been developed for clinical use is the lack of sufficient energy and propulsion systems, as well as a lack of control systems needed for precise manipulation of these devices. Although material synthesis and processing have been rapidly advancing, no man-made material exhibits the diverse array of robustness and function inherent in many biological systems. A possible resource for such active materials exists within many microorganisms, namely bacterial flagella. One potential application of flagella is the use of these biomaterials as mechanical motors in robotic microswimmers. This research aims to fabricate and control bacterial-inspired robotic microswimmers. Dr.Jinseok Kim, at the Center of Bionics at Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) is currently investigating the use of such microrobots for minimally invasive surgery and targeted drug delivery. The researchers at KIST have expertise in studying microswimming behavior as well as capability to control microswimmers though various stimulations such as magnetotaxis.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flagella are an ideal system to use for a variety of microbiorobotic systems because they can convert rotational motion into translation motion. Also, as mechanical devices, flagella have extraordinary properties, allowing them to act as mechanical transducers. Furthermore, billions of flagella are readily available through inexpensive cell culturing techniques. Expertise and equipment, along with equipment to record, track, and analyze bacterial behavior is also present at KIST.  Using KIST's equipment for high resolution fluorescence imaging of micro size objects, flagellated artificial bacteria will be developed and investigated for their ability to swim at low Reyonds number. In addition, the ability of these robotic swimmers to navigate controllably in biologically realistic fluids will also be investigated. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In order to move effectively in the small scale environments in which they exist, many microorganisms evolved corkscrew like rotating flagella to overcome the viscous forces that dominate at the micro scale.  Taking inspiration from flagella, a handful of research groups, scattered throughout the world, are developing micro-sized robots that take advantage of the helical structure of the flagellum for propulsion.  However, the majority of these groups are developing flagella inspired robots using expensive top down methods, such as metal deposition based techniques.  As an alternative, using the detached flagellum of bacteria has the potential to be a better cost-effective solution compared with the current techniques being used to manufacture helical microswimmers.      As a 2014 EAPSI fellow, I investigated the fabrication and control of novel, wirelessly controlled, microscale robots.  The robots that I fabricated during this eight week program combined inorganic and non-living organic components together to create a swimming robot.  Specifically, working in Dr.Jinseok KimÆs lab at Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), I fabricated bacteria inspired microrobots that consisted of bacterial flagella attached to magnetic microbeads.  The process of fabrication started with first culturing bacteria, Salmonella Typhimurium, followed by isolation and purification of their flagella by mechanically shearing the flagella from the bacterial body.  Next, the purified flagella were broken down into their individual monomer units by thermally disrupting their intramolecular bonding.  After being washed, short, biotin functionalized flagella were mixed with the monomer solution, which resulted in flagella ten to twenty microns in length after three days of incubation.  These re-polymerized flagella were finally attached to magnetic avidin coated beads, approximately five microns in diameter, by gentle mixing.  Successful fabrication was confirmed through both electron and fluorescence microcopy.     After fabrication, the next phase in this project was to see if these artificial bacteria could swim.  Towards this objective a magnetic control system, developed in Dr.MinJun KimÆs lab at Drexel University, was shipped to KIST.  The system consisted of three pairs of orthogonally positioned magnetic coils that were installed in an inverted microscope.  A uniform rotational magnetic field was generated in the center of the coils using three power supplies connected to the coils and controlled through a custom made LabVIEW program.  There were some preliminary results obtained showing that the artificial bacteria were able to translate in the rotating field, although these results could not be completely confirmed as the gravitational force of the beads caused them to quickly sink.  Future experiments will correct this issue by using higher density working fluid, less dense beads, or by applying a constant vertical magnetic field to balance the gravitational force. With further research into developing swimming microrobots such as these, applications such as minimally invasive surgery and targeted drug delivery can be realized.     Aside from my research project, I was able to immerse myself in Korean culture during my stay.  While most of my time was spent at KIST, on the weekends I traveled around Seoul to experience Korean culture.  Although I used the weekends to travel in and around Seoul, during my stay in KIST I also experienced Korean culture by experiencing life as a researcher in Korea with Korean graduate students who had diverse backgrounds, ranging from microbiology to electrical engineering.  Working with these students gave me new perspectives on how to conduct research and how to approach certain technical issues that I may face in the future.  In addition, the networking and connections I made with the researchers at KIST have continued past my EAPSI experience, as we are continuing to work together on new project...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
